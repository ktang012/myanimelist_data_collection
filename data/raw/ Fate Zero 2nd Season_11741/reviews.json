            "content": "\"Power tends to corrupt, and absolute power corrupts absolutely\" - Lord John Dalberg-Acton, 1837.\r\nThere are many types of power - financial, military, political, religious, etc - and at one time or another each has been used to further the goals of individuals, organisations, and even nations. The odd thing though, is that even though it has been referenced for thousands of years in everything from legends and myths to folktales and history, magic has rarely been placed in the same category. The problem is that people don't really believe in magic any more, and the subject has been relegated to the realms of fiction andfantasy - even though it was often said that practitioners had the ability to wield primal forces, command spirits, and shake the foundations of heaven.\\n\\n\r\nEverything has a price though, and in order to achieve or seize power of any sort you have to be willing to give up certain ... things. So the question is, what would you sacrifice for the chance to be a god?\\n\\n\r\nThe continuation of Fate/Zero opens with two F-15 jets that have been dispatched by the Japanese Air Force with orders to investigate the situation on the Mion River. Archer/Gilgamesh watches with disdain from on high as Sabre, Rider and Lancer continue their temporary alliance, and the pitched battle with the giant creature summoned by Caster/Gille de Rais rages on.\\n\\n\r\nLittle do they know that a new player is about to enter the field ...\\n\\n\r\nOne of the most noticeable differences between the first and second halves of Fate/Zero is the shift from preparation and planning to all-out action - something that is rather eloquently symbolized by the battle on the Mion River. With much of the preamble over, the storyline is able to place the kid-gloves to one side and ramp-up the tension between the combatants. This is most often achieved by drawing on the conflicting ideologies of each of the characters - with some thoroughly unscrupulous tactics thrown in to drive home the fact that the participants are involved in a war. The plot remains as focused as ever, but there's a palpable change in the atmosphere of the series, and many episodes have a less forgiving, more brutal air about them.\\n\\n\r\nThis shift in \"attitude\" has been handled extremely well by series director Aoki Ei and his writers, and a great deal of attention has been paid to the impact the numerous action scenes have on the characters - something that's becoming a rarity in modern anime. It's an interesting and effective usage of screentime that is markedly different from the patient build-up of the first half of the story, but crafted with the same care and attention to detail that have become a hallmark of Type-Moon/Ufotable collaborations. This prevents the show devolving into a legendary free-for-all, and allows for some very interesting confrontations - several of which have their roots in the layers of subtext that were added during previous series.\\n\\n\r\nWith the focus on action instead of intrigue, one might have expected there to be some differences in the visuals. Thankfully there are almost no major alterations present throughout the series - aside from a few cosmetic differences in clothing and apparel. The high production standards have been maintained and character movements are as sharp and crisp as ever. There are a few relatively minor issues with the blending of CG and standard animation, but these are pretty easy to ignore. What does stand out are the rather dazzling visual effects, many of which are bigger and bolder due to the shift from preparation to action. The choreography and timing of these - together with the quality of the character animation - make for some truly stunning combat sequences.\\n\\n\r\nComposer Kajiura Yuki's all-female band Kalafina - the long-time muses of Type-Moon/Ufotable collaborations - open the second season with the operatic rock ballad \"To the Beginning\", while the main participants in the Holy Grail war are re-introduced in a well-choreographed montage that contains a few hints of things to come. On the other hand the closing sequence is a rather simple yet moving account - told through a series of still images - of the relationship between Emiya Kiritsugu and Irisviel von Einzbern - with Luna Haruna's pop ballad \"Sora wa Takaku Kaze wa Utau\" adding an uplifting and slightly bittersweet tone. Kalafina also return with the martially themed operatic ballad \"Manten\" as a special closing track for episodes 18 and 19.\\n\\n\r\nThe first season of Fate/Zero featured a very high standard of audio production, and it's nice to see that sound director Iwanami Yoshikazu hasn't allowed anyone to rest on their laurels. The background music is as diverse and atmospheric as ever, and while there are a few tracks that may sound a little off-kilter, this appears to be a purposeful move in order to heighten the mood of certain scenes. That said, there are two areas where this series is arguably superior to its predecessor - both of which have been pushed to the fore by the move to action.\\n\\n\r\nThe audio effects are as sharp and clear as ever, but the increase in combat means that the production standards need to be pushed even higher and more diversity needs to be added. In addition to this the quality of  the audio/visual choreography - which was already excellent in the previous series - often went unnoticed because of the focus on preparation and planning. Thankfully Iwanami is arguably one of the most experienced sound directors working in the industry, and his skills - developed over many years working on a variety of different anime - really make the difference. The superb effects and remarkable choreography really set the second series of Fate/Zero apart from other shows released this year, and mark it as a front-runner for any potential awards in this department.\\n\\n\r\nUnlike many other anime, the move to an action footing hasn't caused the script to devolve into random shouts, grunts and screams, and the writers have done well to retain the maturity and intelligence of the first season. There is a bit of a change in the delivery though, as with the goal in sight, some of the actors appear to have been encouraged to add more emotion to their roles. This works surprisingly well with characters who were cold or aloof in the first series - Sabre and Archer for example - and the differences in their feelings becomes more pronounced as the story progresses and the battles take their mental toll.\\n\\n\r\nOne of the biggest criticisms of Fate/Zero is that it has tried to weave a coherent narrative from too many character and plot threads without relying on a lead role. Now this may seem like an anathema to those who prefer their development to follow a distinct linear progression, but those tales often suffer from an age-old problem in storytelling - every good protagonist needs an equally good antagonist. It's an issue that has affected anime for many years as - contrary to popular belief - creating and developing a good opposite (the antagonist doesn't have to be a villain after all), to a hero/heroine is not an easy task.\\n\\n\r\nThankfully Fate/Zero takes its cues from shows like Baccano!, and the lack of a lead role is actually a boon to the series as it allows multiple perspectives to come to the fore. Each of the participants in the war for the Holy Grail is effectively the antagonist of one or more of the other combatants, and all of the players bounce around the plot like peas on a drum - colliding into each other and changing their directions, alliances and enemies in the blink of an eye. It's a rarely used and fascinating approach to character development that highlights in particular the ever-changing nature of the battlefield. One big plus is that while the first season was rather staid in its portrayal of the heroes, the second half of the story pulls very few punches - showing clearly the lengths to which several of the combatants will go in order to win, opening the scars of old wounds, and ensuring that the viewer knows exactly what everyone has put on the line for the ultimate prize.\\n\\n\r\nOver the years there have been many anime that have changed focus and tone from one season to the next, but rarely does it happen in the space of one series. The reason for this is because it's often extremely difficult to reconcile what may eventually turn out to be conflicting portrayals of the story and characters - and therein lies the greatest achievement of Type-Moon, Ufotable, and author Urobuchi Gen. The successful blending of two different perspectives has created a remarkable story that isn't afraid to show off its intelligence or maturity, and the second half of Fate/Zero successfully builds upon the carefully laid foundations of the first season - even with the increase in action and combat.\\n\\n\r\nPrequels are often tricky to deal with as they are very easy to get wrong, which is one of the reasons why this series is a little bit special. In addition to shedding new light on the events that occur in Fate/Stay Night, Fate/Zero is also a singular example of just how good seinen action tales can be, and a testament to the quality that can be achieved through long-term studio collaborations.",

            "content": "From the mind that gave us works such as Madoka and Saya no Uta comes a tale spun as a predecessor to the wildly popular series Fate/Stay Night. Of course, anyone who has read or watched Fate/Stay Night knows the outcome of the fourth Holy Grail War, but only half the fun of a journey is the destination. Gen Urobuchi and studio Ufotable guide us through a magnificent world saturated with dynamic characters, a beautiful score, jaw-dropping visuals and fluctuating idealistic views, which all congeal into a compelling narrative. Mistakes are made by Ufotable, but compared to the grandiose story and execution they only serveas minor annoyances. \\n\\n\r\nPlot\\n\\n\r\nThe Grail War has been done before, but never like this. The same rules apply. Seven masters, seven servants, all fighting in a fierce battle royal in order to determine the rightful owner of the Holy Grail. However in contrast to Fate/Stay Nights cast of children struggling to accept the responsibility so prematurely forced upon them we have a plethora of adult men ready to sacrifice anything to achieve their goals. By Juxtaposing the series and its prequel it becomes evident that Fate/Zero is a darker story focusing on the ideals of each characters along with the suffering these ideals bring forth. The plot is essentially a catalyst that lets the characters tragically develop as they spiral closer and closer into despair.\\n\r\nBut through its greatness Fate/Zero suffers from its link to Fate/Stay Night. As a prequel, its freedom was constrained by the eventual conclusion that loomed just beyond the horizon. But even as a predecessor limited to one conclusion Fate/Zero succeeded in producing a story that left you on the edge of your seat.\\n\\n\r\nArt\\n\\n\r\nIn addition to Fate/Zero Ufotable is also the studio responsible for the Kara no Kyoukai series; a powerhouse in the visual arts department. No corners were cut in producing Fate/Zero, either. Ferocious battles, twisted emotions, and familiar yet exotic settings are illustrated beautifully with the use of hair-raising choreography, movie quality animation and god tier CG. Now, CG is a turn off for most viewers, me usually included. However the CG in this series is so stunningly well done that I can't imagine it would be animated half as well any other way. In addition to CG, Ufotable has once again incorporated a beautiful contrast between neon colors as seen in Kara no Kyoukai. The warm orange glow of a streetlamp beating down on the lifeless world bathed in the hue of moonlight really gives the show a sharp look that is pleasing on the eyes. Fate/Zero also houses THE most amazing fight in anime I've seen to date, I won't spoil which fight it is, but those who have already seen the anime will know.\\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\\n\r\nA beautiful orchestrated soundtrack is the icing on the cake. The music accompanying the series is a kaleidoscope of melodies invoking emotional responses when needed; happiness, despair, tragedy, splendor, evil, conflict, etc. The opening and ending songs both intertwine with the story effectively as well. The opening has an emotional feel to it as compared with the upbeat actiony sequence present in season one. It adequately inspires a sense of foreboding  in the viewer. Now onto the ending. It serves to flesh out our protagonist Kerry by presenting us with how he and Iri came to be a couple and have their child. Teasing us with Kerry's past and how happy the two lovers were during the short time they spent together only serves to harden the impact of the finale.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters\\n\\n\r\nThese are what makes this show shine so brilliantly. There are no exceptions; every single character is quirkily unique, each one sheltering an array of conflicting emotions, and impossible ideals. Labeling any character as an antagonist, protagonist, side character, or otherwise would be insulting as almost every person is artistically created with personalities astonishingly fleshed out and consistent. Gilgamesh for example was once the ruler of pretty much everything on earth. By standing above everyone else figuratively and literally for his entire life, he has fostered an incredible superiority complex. Infinite weapons fill his treasury, and he only expends four on an enemy that is about to destroy the entire city before retreating saying that he \"Does not wish for the weapons to be returned because they touched that filthy creature\". That is beautiful characterization right there. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment.\\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed the shit out of this. There's nothing more to be said.\\n\\n\r\nOverall\\n\\n\r\nOne episode was filler, some others were rushed because of it, and a certain track wasn't included in the score, but this does not stop Fate/Zero from being one of the best anime in a long time. With a bravura of directing, animation, plot, character development, sound, choreography, and dialogue, Fate/Zero exceeded all my expectations and got better every single episode. Fanboyish as the review may seem, a wonderful story is a wonderful story, no matter which way you cut it.",

Speak of conquest and demonstrate it.\u201d - Rider \r\nThe Holy Grail\u2014an omnipotent wish granting device which grants the owner any one wish of their deepest desire. For generations, the Holy Grail Wars were held every 60 years to decide who would be worthy to yield an item of such immense power; seven Masters coupled with seven Servants duke it out in a battle royale to the death, but only one Master and Servant can be victorious.\r\n Fate/Zero is a thrilling, engaging, intellectual and mature anime withjaw-dropping visuals.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 9.51\\n\r\nFate/Zero is about the 4th Holy Grail War, which takes place 10 years before the events of the Fifth Holy Grail war, and is set in Fuyuki City. Seven magi are chosen by the Grail as Masters, and by the power of the Grail, they have the ability to summon Heroic Spirits brought forth as familiars to come and fight by their side, which are their Servants. Each Servant that\u2019s summoned is put into one of the following classes, which include: Saber, Lancer, Archer, Rider, Caster, Assassin and Berserker; each with their own skills and benefits.\\n\\n\r\nThe Story is masterfully done and kept me engaged throughout the entire series. You never know what\u2019s going to happen next or what plot twist is going to take place. Watching it is almost as reading a masterfully crafted literature epic; it's that good.\\n\\n\r\n This anime is heavily focused around dialogue, and for that reason there aren\u2019t many battles, but when a battle arrives it\u2019s just so amazing that it\u2019ll keep you at the edge of your seat. This isn\u2019t to say that the dialogue isn\u2019t entertaining though, as I personally enjoyed every last bit of it, even if it does sometimes drag on for awhile. The dialogue also tells a lot about some of the characters backstories. \\n\\n\r\nThroughout there are some comedic scenes here and there, most of which pertaining to Rider and Waver, though for the most part it mainly stays in a serious and dark atmosphere.\\n\\n\r\nArt/Animation: 9.94\\n\r\n The production quality for this anime is just amazing\u2014it really shows how great Type-Moon's productions are, and when they\u2019re mixed with ufotable, EXPECT GREATNESS! The art and animation in this anime are done SO well it\u2019s just breathtaking, to say the least. Every image is animated so well, there were very few animation errors, and everything was just so smooth. And the art was just beautiful! It was so good that in some scenes my jaw was literally dropped for 1-2 minutes. I also really liked the character designs; all of them were just awesome. The art and animation is just masterfully done, not much more I can say about it. Go check it out for yourself if you don\u2019t take my word for it. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 9.70\\n\r\nOne of my favorite aspects of this show has got to be how it portrayed the characters. I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s not entirely focusing on one main protagonist and rather showing all the characters and how their stories eventually unfold, or if it\u2019s the masterful way Gen Urubuchi conveyed how each character thought and why they took the actions that they took, but I loved it. Character development is also very good; you mainly notice it with Kiritsugu Emiya, as there are even 2 whole episodes about his back story in season 2. But my favorite character, like many others, is definitely Rider. Some of the feels you get when he gives his speeches. I also love his attitude and how he acts, one of my favorite characters of recent times.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9.57\\n\r\nThe soundtrack for both seasons was done by Yuki Kaijura, and if you\u2019ve ever heard any of her other awesome soundtracks (most notably SAO and Madoka Magica), you should have a pretty good idea that this one is just as great. Most of the pieces have heavy orchestra and are very powerful; this track also contains some very emotional pieces, like my personal favorite from it, Tragedy and Fate.\\n\\n\r\nI absolutely adored the first opening Oath Sign by LiSa, and I doubted the second one would be better than the first\u2026 But oh boy was I wrong about that (for my tastes). \u201cTo the Beginning\u201d By Kalafina (Yuki Kaijura\u2019s all-female band) quickly become my favorite OP of ALL time. Strong vocals accompanied by a strong orchestra make this piece a pleasure to the ears. I really liked the EDs. Sora wa Takaku Kaze wa Utau by Luna Haruna really set the mood for the end of each episode, and it also quickly became one of my favorite EDs.\\n\r\nI watched the dubbed version and it was just great--leagues above many other dubs I've heard. I don\u2019t think they could\u2019ve even picked a better voice actor for Kiritsugu Emiya than Matthew Mercer, and Freeman Crispin (also Alucard from Hellsing), as always, did an amazing job. His deep tone really suited Kirei Kotomine. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment/Overall: 9.68\\n\r\nWhat can I say? I absolutely love this anime. It will keep you thrilled, engaged, and satisfied by the ending. It has really high production quality, and a great soundtrack. My highest recommendation for you to watch this truly exceptional anime.\\n\\n\r\n One thing I also admire about it how mature it is\u2014it doesn\u2019t need fan service or overused/unoriginal comedy to be successful (not that that's always a bad thing, though). It is truly an original as well as unique anime, and  in my opinion, a must watch for fans of the Fate series.",

            "content": "The Holy Grail War: A war fought between seven selected masters and their servants to determine a sole victor, who will then bless one miracle upon the world. The Holy Grail War can either bring about an ideal wish that saves innocent lives or lead to chaotic destruction in the process. Or both. The Fate Zero series' plot circles around the Holy Grail War, its history and its future. The previous season focused on the characters' backgrounds, and in this season it is now all-out war. \r\nThe Holy Grail War also involves several sets of conflicts between various supernatural families. All the families for onewants glory for winning the actual war, but the one miracle wish that's blessed by the holy grail is what personally drives the contestants. Would you sacrifice the whole world for the rebirth of your dead, loved ones? Is it worth it? These dark themes are the bane of many of our protagonists and side characters as they approach their psychological breakdowns. \\n\\n\r\nThen there's Saber, and all other Honored Heroes.\\n\\n\r\nAll the characters in the fate zero series have multilateral background stories, but most things are left unexplained in the beginning of the series in order to create a mysterious atmosphere and aura around even the main protagonists. This leaves the audience thirsting for more every upcoming episode, so that they can learn the true intents of each character. And, why they desire the Grail so badly. These essential traits of Fate Zero characters are made to appeal to worldwide audiences, and are elevating at times \\n\\n\r\nOn another note, the season two of fate zero definitely involves more action than last season. Yet at times, this series still explores some dramas of all proportionals in depth, while being consistent in the flow of its overall plot. Thus, the tension the 2nd season creates a heavier, more intense atmosphere than what someone would usually be used to, partially due to the graphics involved in making this series.\u00a0\\n\\n\r\nSince I brought it up, I must talk about it. The graphics and music in fate zero needs to be pinpointed to an Oscar award soon or there's no hope for future anime franchises. The graphics in fate zero definitely exist as one of the best out there. The artistic aspects not only illuminate the detailed/general setting very well but seems to depict each character's personality as well. Ever since I've seen fate zero, there hasn't been any other series (with a few exceptions) that I have considered a 10/10\u00a0when judging its artistic qualities. The music in this series is also nicely executed in fluency with the sound acting and special effects. Most of which raises the level of fierceness in a specific action scene or just makes the actual animation showing on the screen more engaging.\\n\\n\r\nAlthough it would be cool to participate in the Holy Grail war and grant myself a wish, a possible dilemma could result in having to hand over my family, job, and all other responsibilities. So on second thought, I'd rather just be a spectator. And that's exactly what fate zero gives us the opportunity to do, and in the most appealing and qualified graphics possible. That's why, although it's not a perfect anime, the series proves itself to be considered well executed and deserving of all the attention it's getting. All in all, though it really saddens me that the Fate Zero series has finally concluded on a fixed, amiss note, it's very likely the deftly devious creator Urobuchi may provide us with a better and more ideal series sooner or later.",

            "content": "This review considers the anime adaptation of Fate Zero (F/Z) Season 2 entirely on its own merit.\r\nTL;DR version: The hotly-anticipated second half of F/Z is disappointing in the sense that it leaves the viewer with more questions than answers with a rushed ending.  It is especially frustrating when the first half took meticulous care in covering all the nooks and crannies of the Fate universe.  On the plus side, the visuals are excellent and the choreography of some of the action and battles is outstanding.\r\nWhich brings us to to the critical flaw, the *execution* of the story.  The carefully crafted build-up inthe first season starts falling apart, as the series switches its focus to action and bodycount.  This change of focus and direction just fails to engage the kind of viewer who wants to know the \"why\" it happened, on top of the \"what\".\\n\\n\r\n\"But they were simply constricted by the number of slots they had on TV.\"\\n\\n\r\nThose with bright minds will around it properly.  Producers need to know which aspects of the story to prioritize.  Steins;Gate for example picked and chose material carefully from the Visual Novel and the result was excellent.  The flow and pacing was consistent, despite the amount of material that was not included.  This was not the case for F/Z season 2 where the producers made two big errors in pacing.\\n\\n\r\nThe first error goes back to season 1.  I really enjoyed the loli-Rin episode and it was fitting, due to Rin being such an important character in the Fate universe.\\n\\n\r\n\"But they needed a cliffhanger for the start of season 2, which is why they used lol-Rin as a filler.\"\\n\\n\r\nEnding an arc at the final episode of a sub-season and having a clean-slate start for season 2 is also just fine, especially if it improves the overall product.\\n\\n\r\nThe second error is the producers' sadistic minds going for big, family kills on Mother and Father's Day respectively, thus affecting the pacing of the story.  This is especially so in the middle of the season where 2 episodes are devoted to a flashback.  The pacing of the flashback was extremely slow and given the amount of content that needed covering at the end it is questionable whether 2 whole episodes were needed.\\n\\n\r\nThese decisions therefore cost around one and a half episodes, a valuable amount of time which needed to be saved to wrap up the series.  Instead, we get an ending which happened, \"because it happened\".  In hindsight, the loli-Rin episode would make a perfect bonus episode in a Blu-Ray set.\\n\\n\r\nCombined with the pacing issues, the quality of dialogue takes a dive as depth and characterization is replaced by shallow, shounen-esque lines.  This is disastrous because F/Z started off as a \"badass\" anime with depth and sophistication.  During the latter part of season 2, the show becomes badass, for the sake of being badass.  This really affects the characters because instead of developing them and forging a connection with the viewer, they merely become tools of destruction.  The connections that were forged in season 1 gradually fade as our characters just drop like dead flies, in a large bodycount, with rushed death epilogues that gives the question \"Was that it, after everything?\"\\n\\n\r\nTo top it all off, what was mind-boggling was Sakura's last line in the series.  It shows a totally different character to the Sakura we knew prior, and what we know from F/Stay Night.  Instead of going for consistency, the producers had gone for the tragic route for the sake of it.\\n\\n\r\nThis discrepancy across the seasons confuses how F/Z wants to be identified.  A sophisticated series (Death Note's first arc) combined with some slick action in the first season, or simply a show to showcase \"baddass\" (Hellsing Ultimate, Black Lagoon).\\n\\n\r\nThe art and CGI were very good throughout, with the right amount of detailing on the characters.  I also failed to notice any deformities, inconsistencies and incorrect placing of facial features throughout the season.  The animation was also fluid, with rendered CGI being used the bulk of the battles to good effect.  Everything that meets the eye of the viewer was done extremely beautifully.  This was backed by good, convincing sounds effects of metal clanging against metal during battle.\\n\\n\r\nThe music is an odd one due to Kajiura Yuki abandoning her usual, dominant style for BGM and making it a passive one for F/Z.  There was no techno and dramatic opera.  Instead, a classical style was used which identified itself with the ancient times of the servants, and the use of ancient mythological magic.  The opposite would be the more \"techy\" weaponry used by present-day people in Mai-Hime, with Kajiura Yuki using her trademark style there.  Unfortunately, the passive style means the plot and depth of the story needs to be strong in order for the viewer to be engaged - which as discussed earlier was not to be.  This links directly to the overall enjoyment of the series, which took a dive as a result.  The final nail in the coffin for enjoyment was the awkwardly paced finale.  The placement of actual content felt \"off\", especially when we were abruptly fed with the idealized wishes of some of the characters.  The dialogue which was meant to provide closure was also unsatisfying, with \"explanations\" actually being descriptive, rather than being explanations.\\n\\n\r\nF/Z has been a series that has been extremely interesting from the outset.  The extremely high production values is an instant draw, with extremely well animated OP/EDs that set and fit the mood and content of the story perfectly.  People who loved the first season's depth and pacing will unfortunately be disappointed.  The \"less talk, more action\" crowd will surely love the excitement suspense from *most* of the battles that were extremely well choreographed.  Unfortunately, the flip-flopping of F/Z's genre identity mean both crowds will unlikely be completely satisfied.",

            "content": "For the love of Holy Grail, if you have never watched anything from Fate/Stay Night franchise under any circumstances DO NOT watch Fate/Zero first! I'll hold an even stronger statement - don't watch it at all. I've just made this grievous mistake, because I had listened to advice given on youtube by several self-proclaimed anime gurus. And now how pissed I am! Sheesh! Firstly, it ruined much of the experience of Fate/Stay Night. And secondly, I strongly believe Fate/Zero is crap.\r\nI am aware this warning and review will probably fall on deaf ears, because of the way unfavorable reviews are treated by MAL users. ButI'll be content if I am able to save at least one soul from the disaster this anime is. \\n\\n\r\nLet me elaborate on my background - when I started to watch this series I knew only that Fate/Zero is prequel, supposedly much superior to its successor. And that it was written by the same guy who wrote Madoka Magica. I knew nothing about characters, basic premises and how this story ends. So it will be easier for creators to impress me, immerse me in their fantastical world and make me care for what happens. Or so I thought. Oh boy, how I was wrong.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime has massive flaws in its narrative. And it is not even the main story itself - it's of course ridiculous but it would eventually do. However the pacing of it is atrocious. The anime disguises itself as interesting in its first 5 episodes, there is some introduction, then almost right off the bat we hop into a duel between characters. And then... then almost nothing happens for the next 8 episodes. The entire first season should be actually called Fate/Zero Action or, equally accurately, Fate/All Talk. Ok, maybe I'm somewhat unfair, there were some skirmishes, though utterly insignificant. Then around second half something indeed started to happen - but it was still interrupted by All Talk episodes (I still get shivers remembering an episode containing conversation between certain priest and Gilgamesh). And, don't you have wrong impression - I'm not some action junkie. I was annoyed simply because discussion and character development episodes were just criminally uninteresting. It's beyond describable how one doesn't care for virtually any of the characters in this story. Given how much time the anime spends on exposing their back-stories and motivations it is fail of epic proportions. It is partially because this whole exposition is handled very poorly. After the whole show I still don't understand e. g. what is the actual cause of intense rivalry between main protagonist and main antagonist. Additionally narrative is prone to raise some significantly-looking issue (or character) and then to drop it for long or even forever. And there is this most important issue, which even one character in the story (Gilgamesh I suppose) noticed - how abysmally dull are most of these characters' motivations. It makes you automatically yawn at the mere sight of them. There are some events which simulate plot twists, but there are all so boring and the reasons for them so contrived they are not something to speak of. In other words - it's impossible for a viewer to care if character X treacherously kills character Y, when you couldn't care less neither for X nor for Y. \\n\\n\r\nOk, so maybe at least fight scenes redeem the show? No! Most of them are astonishingly anti-climactic, including two of the three final ones. BTW not only fights are anti-climactic. So is the ending, concluded thanks to idiotic Diabolus ex Machina. \\n\\n\r\nAnd after having watched this I saw juvenile shounen-like Fate/Stay Night anime series from 2006. It's almost beyond my belief that MAL users (as of early 2015) rate Fate/Zero so well and F/SN so badly. Yes, 2006 anime is cliched. Its stereotypical high-school protagonist whines too much. There is a generic romance plot. Hell, the whole coming-of-mage plot is ultra generic. And yes, it's more light-hearted. But still I liked it more, even though I was spoiled by prequel. The creators of F/Zero failed to notice that it's not enough to be \"darker and edgier\" to have a good plot and interesting characters. The art part of the anime is only thing in which creators didn't fail. But it annoys me that more, when I watch skillfully sound-tracked, brilliantly animated boring fights between inexplicably boring characters.\\n\\n\r\n[warning: bad puns ahead] I strongly advice all of you to stay in the dark night when it comes to Fate/Zero. Although the story deserves clear zero points, animation, sound and the fact that Saber is always fully-clothed wind up the total score to 4/10 (or 3/10 for first season alone). \\n\\n\r\nAlternatively: It's possible that my above rant is the result of watching this show prematurely. The writers of the series from my perspective put emphasis on such weird places of their story that it makes plausible that I'm seriously missing something. Conclusion, once again, DO NOT WATCH IT BEFORE FATE/STAY NIGHT.",

            "content": "Fate Zero 2nd Season review:\r\nTime for a trivia! Are you someone who enjoys watching violence mixed in with action, fantasy, and thriller themes? Are you someone who loves listening to a powerful soundtrack with stunning visuals that will keep you at your seat? Ever wanted to watch a prequel based off a popular series and carving for more? Well luckily, you've probably hit a jack pot because ufotable once again pulls off a spectacular masterpiece out of their hats and present the latest Fate/Zero part 2 that is sure to give viewers a satisfaction like they've never ever experienced before.\r\nIn today's anime world, prequels arenot too rare. Most of them serves as an introduction and perhaps a trailer of the the true series will unraval for our die hard viewers. Fate Zero Second Season presents the continuation of the battle involving the Holy Grail, the ultimate reward for eternal glory. As more lives are sacrificed, secrets are unraveled. The actors and their directors play their parts in this Holy Grail war and it's only king for him or herself. There is no allies, no true allegiances, no God, no Angels. There is one thing and that is V for Victory. But really, what is victory? Glory? The true throne of king? Or is it perhaps something that unattainable even for a God?\\n\\n\r\nFirst and foremost, this series has gained international attention and is considered to be one of the most popular series. Anyone who has ever set their eyes and played a VN game before would and should know the products of Type-Moon, with FSN being one of its most successful products. I mean, just look at the ratings and the discussion threads. There is daily topics being posted, various discussions regarding the franchise of both seasons, and users comparing who their favorite/strongest servants are from the series.\\n\\n\r\nBut is this series really worth the hype? Is this series really being worthy to on the Top #10 of MAL along with some other known titles? The fact that one of them is also an anime is based off a VN in the top 10 also makes us wonder. Well...let's put our heads together and  see if the series does live up to the hype.\\n\\n\r\n[ ----- Story ----- ]\\n\r\nAs the second half of this highly popular series, the story picks up from part 1 that began in October of Fate/Zero. The producers and director already assumed that you've watched part 1 and have some decent knowledge of the F/Z franchise. If you're scratching your head right now and wondering why there's an overgrown Cthulhu Mythos being in the begnning of the series, then STOP. Watch part 1 first and come back because you're missing out all! And I'm certain Archer is not amused. \\n\\n\r\nThere is already tension between Saber and Lancer, one you can cut through with an Excalibur. But from where it leaves off, the monster Caster unleashes hell and tries to take the servants deep down with it. It does seem a bit lackluster in that the first part of the series had none of the character die off but death has gotten impatient. In this part 2 of the prequel, death has come back from holiday and is here to claim some of its prize. And by prize, I do mean lives, the lives of the servants and their beloved masters. \\n\\n\r\nIndeed, the bodies starts to pile up like pouring rice but there's also more than that. For our main protagonist, an calculating, cold, and indifferent man, we take a trip down memory lane and see some of the dark past that made him the man that he has become. While most series take brief flashbacks and illustrates them shorthand, this prequel depicts a more detailed style involving Kiritsugu \"Magus Killer, Kerry\" Emiya. His dark past is revealed in details that leaves the viewers at the edge of their seats and with his interactions with his \u201cmother\u201d figure (ironically also on Mother's Day) and childhood friend. It is dark, it is brutal, and it is your face. The past that Kiritsugu had to go through and made him the man that he is today is understandable after watching this prequel. Hell, if I had to go through all that, I'd never be the same person again. The man's got guts and he's live up to the name as the Kiritsugu \"Magus Killer, Kerry\" Emiya.\\n\\n\r\nAnd of course, Saber once again plays her role as the King of Arturia from the Fate/Stay Night franchadise in this sequel. As a proud king, she respects the values of others and is determined to help those in need. For instance, when she realizes that her dear friend and partner Irisviel von Einzbern has been kidnapped by another proud king, she stops nothing but to save her even if it's at the cost of the Holy Grail war or perhaps her own life. That my friends, is true valor and style of a proud king.\\n\\n\r\nWhile at times the dialogue are as heavy as part 1 of the prequel, the usage of the words defines the intelligence and insight that gives the viewers a reason to continuously watch the show. A clear example is the speeches between Rider and Waver and Archer's often egotistic yet artistically way of getting his words out. \\n\\n\r\nAs for the Holy Grail War, the rules are still there. There is only one winner and it's winner takes all. Fate/Zero although has similar ties with Fate/Stay Night has some major differences in that it becomes a much more matures style. Even the masters themselves becomes calculating and insightful in their moves. Their servants play their roles accordingly and some have even developed their own solitude of being the one and true king. \\n\\n\r\nAs Elizabeth I once said:\\n\\n\r\n\u201cTo be a king and wear a crown is a thing more glorious to them that see it than it is pleasant to them that bear it.\u201d\\n\\n\r\n[ ----- Characters ------ ]\\n\r\nSeven servants, seven masters, and more than seven wonders to watch this part 2 of the prequel. The characters of the series is definitely another reason to continuously enjoy more of Type-Moon's works.\\n\\n\r\nHonestly, there are so many great character interactions between the servants and the masters. It can be digusting and horrid like the relationship of psychopathic killer Ryunosuke and Caster. It can be the estranged relationship between Lancer and his master, Kayneth El-Melloi Archibald. It can be the indifferent relationship between our star protagonist Kiritsugu and Saber. It can also be the powerful bond between Alexander the Great (Rider) and his master, Waver. \\n\\n\r\nThere is of course also our cynical man who is discovering his purpose in life, the manipulating, calculating, and stoic man Kirei Kotomine. It is entertaining and strange to watch Archer/Gilgamesh observe his various actions and moments throughout the story. Of course, his later obsession with Saber enters another tone that can be defined as peculiar at its finest. \\n\\n\r\nRegardless though, every one of the character is independent and unique to themselves in personalities, goals, ambitions, and style. Even the characters in Kiritsugu's flashback are quite interesting to take insight into. His interactions with them and the bond, whether it's a childhood crush on his friend, or a more motherly/son relationship with his mentor, brings out his character in its most defined form. \\n\\n\r\nWhile not all the characters are perfect (Kariya for instance), they clearly play their various roles well and does what they do best: kicking ass and delivering F/Z style entertaininment.\\n\\n\r\n[ ------ Art/Animation ------]\\n\r\nEver been to an art museum before? Ever seen a professional artist's work and made you go \u201cthat is just...beautiful\u201d? Well, Fate/Zero part 2 like its prequel will give you the impression of a life time. (at least in terms of anime visuals)\\n\\n\r\nIn technical terms of production, Fate/Zero Season II is what defines the ultimate form of what Type-Moon's production visuals has came to be. This series just looks bloody amazing and that's not an overstatement. No, it is more than that. The visuals are stunningly beautiful and ufotable deserves the prize of the Holy Grail for producing such powerful animation. Not surprisingly, ufotable already has achieved its praise after producing the Garden of Sinners franchise. The dark edges of the series and the spectacular battle scenes between Beserker/Saber are just a few examples. While it does occasionally employ the usage of CGI, it makes it up into the style of the battle sequences between the servants/masters that almost makes us forget this flaw. But more than that, art defines this series that shows once again that ufotable is able to produce series that lives up to the fan's expectations. And of course, I'm not disappoint.\\n\\n\r\n[ ------ Soundtrack/Music ------]\\n\r\nSoundtrack plays a powerful role in any series and in this part 2 of the prequel, it is there once again to bring out the style of Fate/Zero.\\n\\n\r\nThe OP song is changed this time but retains its well coordinated choreography and orchestra. The theme \"to the beginning\" by Kalafina is a strong piece of work that brings out the strength and power of the servants and the brutality of the Holy Grail War. And once again, the sequences are shown with appearances of the servants and their respective masters. Additionally, it also shows sequences of a child Kiritugu in the beginning to his manhood that shows how much he has changed from what he once was, to what he has become, the proud master of Saber.\\n\\n\r\nYuki Kaijura is once again involved with producing the soundtrack and themes of the series. And once again, she delivers and executes what the fans expected: a glorious soundtrack worthy of a Holy Grail prize. The soundtrack of Fate/Zero part 2 is just as stunningly impressive as part 1. If in fact for anything reason at all to watch this series beyond the characters, beyond the storyline, or beyond the epic speeches of Rider or the stunning visuals is the soundtrack. With the ultra talented Yuki Kajiura in charge, expect the unexpected as your ears will be pleased like never, ever before.\\n\\n\r\n[ ------ Enjoyment ------- ]\\n\r\nStory, music, animation, characters. What else more is there to say? Well, for another reason to continuously watch the F/Z franchise is the spectacular battle sequences. \\n\\n\r\nWhile the first season lacked some of the expected battle scenes, season 2 of Fate/Zero brings out battle and bloodshed like never before. Even in the very beginning, the aerial dogfight between Archer and Berserker makes a strong impression while Caster takes the ground belong and battles against the remaining servants. More impressively is the final duel between the two proud kings Archer and Rider in the later episodes. With egos that a single king of the seat can be sat on, these two characters battles it out in one of the most artistically and defined ways in the series that truly shows why they are worthy of their masters. \\n\\n\r\nWell, Fate/Zero Season 2 is not perfect. In fact, there is in my opinion no series that can be perfect. It does seem that some of the sequences are a bit forced and a a few key scenes cut that left the viewers go \u201cwhy wasn't that there?\u201d Additionally, the dialogue continues to stay a bit intact and lengthy at times particularly with Archer's egoistic speeches and Kirei's indifferent style of talking. Despite these minor flaws though, this part 2/season 2 of the series captured my attention as much as season 1. The intelligence of the story, the well executed dialogues, the captivating characters, the stunning visuals, the beautiful soundtrack, the quality of the work, and the enjoyable of the battle sequences are just seven reasons to watch this series. \\n\\n\r\nSeven servants, seven masters, and seven reasons to watch this part 2. What else can you want more?\\n\\n\r\nWell, I guess maybe some of the more detailed explanations for the die hard fans when the BD version debuts. Still though, this series has been crafted and engineered beyond its minor flaws. It is in my book one of the best series there was, one of the best there is, and one of the best there ever will be.\\n\\n",

            "content": "This review analyzes the entirety of Fate/Zero, not secluded to one seasoned release. Firstly, Fate/Zero is a prequel to the stories of \"Fate/stay night\". \"Fate/stay night\" originated as a visual novel and later was released as an anime in 2006. That anime, while it does succeed in some ways to its own right, is something that should be taken as its own entity as it can be considered a failure of being an accurate adaptation of the source material. The visual novel itself comprised of three stories that all are tied to this one. Two of those are currently being brought up in anime-form bythe same studio that's behind this, but do not see that order as how things should be viewed. The story of Fate/Zero was made after that of \"Fate/stay night\" in a novel. Because of that, even just touching Fate/Zero before trying \"Fate/stay night\" will result in spoiling some of the reveals of those stories. However, do not assume that you must enjoy \"Fate/stay night\" to also enjoy Fate/Zero. Fate/Zero can work on its own, and some people who didn't like the sequel may even enjoy it still. Fate/Zero has been held in high regards, and it will certainly be hard for anyone to not understand even a bit of why that is. Before continuing into my analyzation though, there should also be an unusual warning in terms of the gore present. The gore Fate/Zero carries is something that would either get it heavily censored or banned from premiering on public television in the Western world. I don't want to spoil, but if you are even slightly wary of fictional gore, Fate/Zero should be something to be heavily reconsidered.\\n\\n\r\nI haven't seen many anime that have been released recently and, upon first experiencing Fate/Zero in its visual glory, I was surprised even beyond the praise I've heard. I've seen a fair amount of \"Kara no Kyoukai\" by the studio Ufotable, and seeing what that accomplished on its own honestly didn't meet my expectations of all of the great things I've heard of the studio. When I moved from that to this, however, things became very clear. It was shocking at the level of budget and detail that this series went into, almost something that could make it on Western television. The first moments didn't even contain action yet still convinced me greatly. The subtlety along with the impactful color-scheme and the massive background detail created a perfect picture along with the never-ceasing and phenomenal animation. While it isn't fair to compare this to the \"Fate/stay night\" of 2006 due to its different age and vastly different budget, another aspect that blew me away was the CGI and how it was handled. The CGI of \"FSN2006\" has become a joke to most when comparing it to what we receive in Fate/Zero. That definitely isn't a fair comparison though as the CGI in Fate/Zero is clearly the best I've seen in anime - not only in the believable detail and fluid movements, but in the ability to treat it properly aside the hand-drawn art. The hand-drawn animation itself also doesn't impress too much less when taking into account its almost unnecessary attention to detail at many times along with the spectacular proportion-work and quality control. There is no filler frames that are drawn half-heatedly, and everything feels properly treated visually.\\n\\n\r\nThat visual treatment does not end with the technicality of the visuals, however, but is also greatly accompanied by a moderately risky director. Fate/Zero does not introduce itself as many other anime would, taking on a mature and subtle style that is very similar to what could be seen in the best of Western television. It could be reasoned that the anime expects many of the viewers to have already been introduced to the universe, but either way what has been brought here is something that tells only what is necessary and handles everything else boldly. The director does good work at his own job in making moments impactful and intriguing, but is even also aided by a great script-writer. The entire atmosphere feels mature and has a sensation of giving the viewer respect in being able to work out more basic understandings on their own. Fate/Zero expects the viewer to be able to listen closely to all conversations as there is no baseless and filler conversation, but developing moments to either the characters or the situation's complication. In that way Fate/Zero feels very unique to most anime and also feels greatly refreshing.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound also lacks nothing in budget and carries powerful depth throughout. The atmosphere is treated flawlessly with cinema levels of sound work in most moments, to the sound effects of basically everything. The music is also well done and it works for the setting while also giving a very cinematic feeling to the whole series. That doesn't make the music perfect though, the surprising reason being it was done by Yuki Kaijura. Many people adore her work, and I do as-well, but as an obvious result of her being used too often in recent times, her originality has already begun to deflate. I was actually surprised after seeing the phenomenal visual quality that the people in-charge chose her for handling the soundtrack. It feels like a safe way out since not many would really dislike her work, but from it being so common in other popular works, it has become somewhat stale to me. I even let out a sigh when I heard one of the tracks playing as a near duplicate of a track that was in \"Sword Art Online\" (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0qkgJsPKJP4#t=11), but take note that this came out before \"Sword Art Online\". Also, the music doesn't exactly fit in the most effective way at times, it sometimes failing to properly build anticipation at some crucial moments for it. However, there are surely moments where it does work and there are some genuinely great tracks. It also does work better when newer instruments are used than Kaijura usually uses. There is also a spectacular singer for the trademark electronic vocals she uses, and one of the songs in particular which I haven't found the name has some impressive singing on her part. The soundtrack is great and many people will likely love it, but when experiencing a number of her works, the connections and lack of proper uniqueness are too hard not to notice. It should also be noted that the openings and endings aren't too unique or memorable. They carry the somewhat typical strong female voice that sings in a style fit for an anime opening length, and that voice kind-of serves as the leading instrument. Out of them all, I found the last opening to be the most fitting and the last ending to also be somewhat enjoyable. The English dub is much less troubling, though, as the voices are something around a Bebop level of fantastic. Brief comparisons even leads me to believe that the English dub has surpassed the Japanese in this case. There are two slight flukes with it however (and try to realize how good this must be to nitpick so much) as the sound-quality of the English recording broke the silence in some moments where it really shouldn't have, along with there being several moments of passionate yelling that weren't handled in quite the way it usually would sound in anime. I also didn't experience the subbing work at all, but the script-work of the dubbing team did a flawless job with only one small fluke as-well in one moment that is so tiny that most will likely not even notice (I checked the official subs and they also carried that mistake).\\n\\n\r\nThe dialogue was smart and impressed me when I wasn't expecting too much from a fantasy show. All Fate/Zero had to do to keep people entertained was follow through with its premise, as a battle royal is something that many people seem to be craving, but it instead chooses to go a little beyond that in both character interaction and where it leads. The character interaction is, without a doubt, the most entertaining aspect of the series. I found myself to be engaged with just about every character's personality, and it all felt understood and reasoned with. Most of these characters are also flawed in one way or another, and the show effectively portrays much of that flawed nature with an air of intellect. While some of the realizations could be not too surprising if one were to think about it on their own for a while, or if they've already thunk it up, it was just something unexpected and unnecessary to have been done. It shows that the story isn't afraid of getting psychological, and I would say Fate/Zero is one of the best psychological stories I've seen in anime. Not everything is dramatic though, and those interactions also don't fail to be continually interesting. The series does give a lot of its time to developing the characters as-well, and handles a fairly large cast impressively for a 24-episode anime, but it isn't all perfect.\\n\\n\r\nFor starters, the premise for the Fate universe was always an interesting take on the battle royal concept. It adds an extra layer of depth to the idea by making the combatants have to work with another individual to gain their success in the battle. It also allows mechanics for interactions between those two partnered combatants to end up in many different ways following a secure guideline. Respectfully, that guideline is not challenged with the story Fate/Zero has to it, and everything works well enough through what is explained. The setting and story allows for a light merging of genres and time-periods as well that create some amount of discovery and mystery to understanding some of it for every combatant. The character and their designs are, again, wonderful. They each carry unique motives and ideals that are uncovered, questioned, and bring about a blurring of who is right and wrong. All of this works splendidly, but not to the extent of its potential. At the end of the game, a mistake that the director took was treating this series clearly as the prequel it is. Sure Fate/Zero is a prequel to \"Fate/stay night\" and it was even made afterwards, but when the entirety of Fate/Zero also makes some explanations for itself to make itself also work on its own, to end in such a way disregards the present story at hand in turn of the coming one. One shouldn't exactly fear for a cliffhanger as the ending of Fate/Zero is clear, but how it is handled doesn't treat it with the proper respect it needed to feel effective. That mistake also shows in the pacing near the end in the last couple of episodes. Things begin to move at too fast of a pace, skimming past necessary character development and interactions to make everything from before feel properly concluded. In that regard, Fate/Zero doesn't succeed in being as impactful or effective as it could've. With such smart writing prior, it felt more as a shame to see it all left behind for a quick turn of events. Even so, those prior events are still moments that exist in this anime and that shouldn't go unnoticed.\\n\\n\r\nFate/Zero carries enough for mostly anyone to enjoy at least one fundament of it. The visuals are top-notch, surpassing the looks of numerous anime movies, and the sound as a whole doesn't stand too far behind. Both options of voiced languages are great, and no-one stands for a loss. Those who respect subtlety and some witty comments will also likely find Fate/Zero enjoyable, while some others who see Fate/Zero in a more strange light because of that might not enjoy the slow moments it has. There are moments where development is brought in stories that don't directly progress the main story, and some may also not find that way of handling things enjoyable. However, when taking consideration of the length, I felt that it was an effective way of handling the characters and it also stayed very relevant during and after they were completed. Before finishing this series I was convinced to dive into the visual novel, and I did. I read for some time and, while I never did get too far into the story, how this storytelling is handled in comparison to \"Fate/stay night\" will lead me to no doubts that there will be people who side with either one. I, personally, side with Fate/Zero when considering the canon story-lines as it felt more natural and unique in its style. Fate/Zero also feels more vibrant and alive with less things one would commonly find in a visual novel. Make one thing known though, I haven't read the Fate/Zero novel. For all I know, the novel could tell the story in what I consider an inferior way when considering the anime. If that was the case, some Ufotable treatment may very well fix the moderate difference between Fate/Zero's style and \"Fate/stay night's\". Many of these characters are memorable, and I have no doubts that I will appreciate a lot of this story even in the future. Although, I could see the soundtrack falling from memory as it failed to make itself truly unique and special. In that way, \"FSN2006\" did win in making the musical style more different and effective in connecting with the series it holds. If I listened to a track from Fate/Zero blindfolded, I couldn't tell you honestly if it was from \"Madoka Magica\", \"Sword Art Online\", or any other soundtrack Yuki Kaijura has done (\".hack//Sign\" being another). Watch Fate/Zero, but understand the potential spoilers for beginning in the Fate franchise with it. Most would recommend starting with the visual novel, and I would recommend getting a feel for the universe somehow before getting into Zero. Watching \"Fate/stay night\" 2006 might be an effective way of quickly doing that without spoiling too much, but they're definitely two different creatures. There is some exposition here though, and remember that delving into \"Fate/stay night\" will also in-turn spoil the ending of Fate/Zero (but it is intended to be that way, not that it has to).",

            "content": "THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS.\r\nFate/Zero answers the problem with prequels.  How do you make something compelling when the audience already knows how it will all end?  Embrace the darkness and finality. \r\nA word of warning, the rest of my review will assume that the reader has already watched Fate/stay night and the first season of Fate/Zero.  If you have not, then the best thing you can do is stop now and return after you have seen those chapters in the Fate series.  \r\nFans of Fate/stay night already know that things will end badly for the main characters, after all this is necessaryin order for the setup of what the audience has already seen.  But unlike the most infamous of dark prequels, Star Wars 1-3, Fate/Zero has the guts to take that challenge and turn it into an opportunity. \\n\\n\r\nThe protagonist of Fate/Zero, Kiritsugu Emiya, is presented as a cypher in the first and most of the second seasons.  He is shown as absolutely ruthless, a fitting characteristic for the ultimate victor of this round of the Grail war.  At the same time, Kiritsugu is oddly compelling since he is the badass of the series -- taking down opponents with guile and strategy rather than the nobleness of his character unlike his successor in Fate/stay night.  \\n\\n\r\nLike another cypher in the famous TV series Breaking Bad, Gustavo Fring, the writers eventually take the viewer into the backstory of Kiritsugu with a monster payoff.  In an effort to avoid giving out spoilers, lets just say that after you watch the two finest episodes in the franchise, you will not look at the main character in the same light. \\n\\n\r\nSimilarly, the primary antagonist in the series, Kirei Kotomine, is also fleshed out nicely.  Although his motivations are more unclear then Kiritsugu, the viewer is rewarded with actions that flesh out his \"big bad\" credentials nicely.  \\n\\n\r\nCombined with fan favorite Servants Saber and newcomer Alexander the Great, an excellent supporting cast, and none of the boring filler-subplots that plagued Fate/stay night to its detriment, Fate/Zero provides an excellent story for the anime fan craving more than the typical shounen of broody adolescents grappling with inner doubt and awesome powers.  Destined to become a classic piece of anime storytelling Fate/Zero provides the viewer with excellent animation, sound, story, and characters.  10 out of 10, for those that like their anime dark and action packed!",

            "content": "Tyrannical power and glory are two things that define a sovereign ruler with an iron fist. Many mythologies have been interpreted to fit these notions into their stories to create a different understanding of them. A series that has been long regarded with acclaim by many die-hard enthusiasts is the Fate series. Starting as a visual novel series, it eventually shifted its form to animation with Fate Stay Night to mediocre reception from fans. It was then that a man named Gen Urobuchi decided to make a prequel light novel series called Fate Zero, and thus a legendary phenomenon was born in animation form fouryears later.\\n\\n\r\nThough this is the 2nd season of Fate Zero that I\u2019m basing this off of after finishing it, it would be more tempting to critique it as a whole. Because it is merely a continuation of the series and nothing else. Do not feel disingenuous if you feel like you want to read the visual novels before going into it, or suffer through the horrible Fate Stay Night adaptation. Fate Zero is, by and large, its breed and it wouldn\u2019t necessarily warrant a lesser experience had one not experienced any of them. Going through the entire series to the inevitable conclusion, Fate Zero manages to pull off a strong emphasis on technical beauty and wonder; while it falls short on some levels.\\n\\n\r\nI remember when I first got introduced to the Fate series and couldn\u2019t make heads or tails on what it was about from looking at the plot summaries. Once you dive into it and it starts to explain in great detail about the ongoing war over the holy grail, it does make it more coherent, even if you haven\u2019t followed the visual novel to death. Fate Zero does a great job of explaining it from the first episode alone, which has a running time of an hour. Following the footsteps of several of our protagonists and their goal of achieving the holy grail, they are all given pretty substantial screen-time for us to empathize with their competitive drive against one another.\\n\\n\r\nNow this screen-time I mention comes from the pacing this show has with not only how we can identify with the characters, but also to showcase their unique fighting abilities. I\u2019ll give a lot of credit to the animation studio, ufotable, and bringing out their big guns into the production of Fate Zero. It also helps that they worked on a massive budget that they were able to work around, which is a rarity in this day and age. Their attention to detail in the color schemes, especially in the darker moments, is very astounding to look at. It\u2019s one of those instances where it is mandatory to watch this is the full high definition to get involved with the creative detail of the art and animation.\\n\\n\r\nWith animation comes to action scenes, which Fate Zero is not afraid to show, with true greatness. What is quite refreshing to see in an action scene is for characters to plan out their attack moves instead of just swinging their weapon until the enemy dies. Even so, it doesn\u2019t needlessly pad out the fighting scenes with constant dialogue in-between, at least most of the time. Visually exciting and epic in its ultimate nature, these will not disappoint your average action show fan.\\n\\n\r\nEpic storytelling has its roots in having a large cast of characters in it. The characters in Fate Zero are, unfortunately, hit or miss depending on the progression we get from the development they have. This includes the relationship we have with the human characters and the servants that protect them. The best example is the relationship between Rider and Waver based on the level of chemistry these two have whenever they are bickering between one another. However, the rest didn\u2019t speak to me as having great chemistry, only because their only purpose is to advance the plot and nothing else. With Rider and Waver, it felt like I was rooting for these people more to win the war because they bolster so many lighthearted moments that make them appealing to watch.\\n\\n\r\nSaber gets a lot of praise as being a strong character, and I do understand that from the perspective that she knows how to protect herself and her master. Other than that, she doesn\u2019t carry the show all on her own because of her bland personality, and all she does is tries to get her honor back, which feels so superficial. This is the case for most of the characters, except for Kiritsugu Emiya, in Fate Zero. Style with no substance is what I would generalize my point as for them. It could very well be the problem with adaptations that don\u2019t expand enough for people like me who hadn\u2019t read the visual novel, but that is hardly an excuse if you think about it.\\n\\n\r\nThe worst instance I can give for this is the characters Caster and Ryunosuke. Both of them are pure psychopathic murderers that take pleasure in killing children just for the fun of it and nothing else. That should not entail that I take these characters as bad only on the premise that it's completely unnerving or unsettling. What troubles me is that that\u2019s all that we get out of Caster and Ryunosuke. We don\u2019t know what makes Ryunosuke turn into the person that he is, and most of the blame can be put on him since Caster is already based on a real-life serial killer. They are there to emit shock value into the mix to make the show somehow more \u201cadult\u201d when it doesn\u2019t matter in the slightest, not that this was the first for Gen Urobuchi.\\n\\n\r\nNevertheless, the character development kicks into high gear when we explore Kiritsugu Emiya\u2019s troubled past. The only negative aspect to this is that the two episodes that chronicle his past felt unnecessary in the main broadcast and would\u2019ve fit better in a separate OVA. What makes it less of criticism is that it is done very well in delving into the psyche of Emiya and shows how different he has changed throughout his life. So in retrospective, my reactions to Fate Zero\u2019s attempt in constructing a narrative and character story are mixed, but they are far from terrible.\\n\\n\r\nPeople wanted to see the epic conclusion to Fate Zero, and they sure got it in good proficiency. Even though I felt the ending was a little anti-climatic to some degree, with some sequences feeling a bit rushed, they give at least some closure to the character arcs. Has this officially made me into a Fate series fan? No, not even close. But there are a lot of things to appreciate about Fate Zero and its attention for spectacle over substance. Sometimes that can work, and Fate Zero rests on that throne as one of the more enjoyable experiences. Now does this mean that Type-Moon will not stop milking their franchise and driving it into the ground in the future? You bet your ass they will.\\n\\n\r\nGrade: B\\n",

Fate/Zero has simple plot hiding behind rhetoric and long-winded speeches from rooftops just to look cool. The dialogue was uninspired at best and often times so dull that I felt that I could walk away to make a cup of coffee and come back knowing I missed absolutely nothing that contributed to the story.\r\nThe biggest problem is that none of the characters other than Waver and Rider were ever really developed, leavingno emotional impact on their deaths. In fact, when it came to a lot of the seemingly important events, I just didn't care. Pointless monologues and exposition, bad pacing (nothing happened in S1, while characters were dropping like flies in the second season), irrelevant story arcs, topped with shallow characters; Fate Zero puts a good effort at feigning depth and puts forth some interesting ideas, but is ultimately a train wreck of poor narrative with a plot that lacks any real complexity or substance.",

            "content": "\"Those who desire to rise as high as our human condition allows, must renounce intellectual pride, the omnipotence of clear thinking, belief in the absolute power of logic.\" -Alexis Carrel\r\nOverview: \r\nFate/Zero takes place on the stage of Fuyuki, a city based on modern day Kobe. Here, seven masters chosen by the Holy Grail- an omnipotent wish granting device- gather to do battle. The seven human masters, each from disparate backgrounds, experiences, and creeds assemble, and are granted a \"servant\", or the spirit of a fallen hero from ages past given physical form. With these servants, the masters wage a proxy war in the formof a battle royale: the last master/servant duo standing is the winner, as declared by the Holy Church. The pair is then granted a wish: that which they desire most. \\n\\n\\n\r\nAnimation and Art: 10\\n\\n\r\nHere's where Fate/Zero and ufotable really earned their keep. It\u2019s plain to see that this show had an enormous budget: a good percentage of it was spent in the animation department, and spent well. The 3D animation is an absolute gold standard for how modern day AAA anime titles can and SHOULD look. It\u2019s absolutely incredible to behold when the 3D CGI meshes with the hand drawn animation onscreen well, and importantly: doesn\u2019t look incredibly fake. For me, having 3D CGI onscreen can break the immersion, because it\u2019s typically a very jarring difference between the background and hand drawn, but not so in this case. \\n\r\nI thoroughly enjoyed seeing the vehicles and grotesque monsters that were given life through 3D animation here. I've had a sour taste for 3D for a long time, even in shows with high production values like Ghost in the Shell SAC, by the esteemed Production IG. A few standout moments include Saber's motorcycle, the F-14 jet commandeered by Berserker, and the fire and water effects that looked as realistic as I've ever seen in animation.\\n\r\nVibrant, dynamic lighting and shadow play along with particle effects rendered by the 3D beautifully. Swirling lights, darks, and brilliant displays of energy color the typically dark palettes of the show. Much of it takes place at night, and it really allows the lighting and brightness of the clashes to be cast against the darkness and shadows, further encapsulating the duality that the show embodies.\\n\\n\r\nSound and Voice Acting: 8\\n\\n\r\nFate/Zero has a rather sizable cast, with seven masters, servants and various supporting characters, but Aniplex didn't skimp on talent at all.\\n\r\nHeading up the group are Matthew Mercer as Kiritsugu Emiya and Crispin Freeman as Kirei Kotomine. Bridget Hoffman gives a great performance as Irisviel, and Liam O'Brien appears, nearly reprising his Vincent Law role as Kariya Matou. The ubiquitous Michelle Ruff and Johnny Yong Bosch also appear in supporting roles.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack by Yuki Kajiura (SAO, usw.) is comprised of many emotional orchestral themes, high tension string sections, and appropriately energetic or heartfelt compositions that mesh well with the action along with the more subdued moments. \\n\\n\\n\r\nStory: 9\\n\\n\r\nThis production takes a rather unusual route in the means of its storytelling. Rather than having a limited perspective of a single main character, or that of a typical protagonist/antagonist setup, Fate/Zero chooses an ensemble route that is at the same time very intricate, but not difficult to follow. Each master and each servant have their own motives and means at their disposal with which to defeat the others and capture the Grail. At no point in the series is it truly clear who's been dealt the best hand in terms of the abilities and willingness of the servant in conjunction with the cunning and ambition of the master. Again, this duality forms the spine of Fate: an individualistic war waged with individual goals, but having to unite as a team with another for a singular purpose. \\n\r\nThe Grail's choosing of the combatants is indiscriminate: there are kids with no business being involved in a war; in which the possibility they may lose their life is very real. There are others chosen who've spent their entire lives preparing for the Holy Grail War, ones who care nothing about the Holy Grail or even being involved with the war, ones who fight for the salvation of loved ones, and still others who fight for purely selfish motives- seeking the power of the omnipotent wish granter as a means of personal gain, or mutually assured destruction. \\n\r\nThis varied group of entrants further serves the dualistic ideal of Fate/Zero, a collection of persons from dissimilar motive and thought unified, yet vying against each other on this quest for the Grail. The prideful, the greedy, the lustful, the wrathful, the gluttonous for power, the envious, and the slothful are equally applicable to this story: 7 masters, 7 servants, each is clearly represented by (at least one of) the Seven Deadly Sins in line with their character traits and history.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 9\\n\\n\r\nEach character has their own morals (or lack thereof) which typically sit juxtaposed to their partner, who serve as a foil in many cases. Again, the duality dynamic that is signature to this series is put to excellent use here in reflecting the strict moral code adherence of the Saber, Arthuria against the postmodernist, win-at-all-costs mentality of her master, Kiritsugu. \\n\\n\r\nArthuria is defined early on as a strong willed woman, whose sole character traits consist of the aforementioned strict adherence to a code of honor, of loyalty, defined by her as chivalry, which is in line with her time period and legends. She has an extreme worldview, believing that even the battlefield should be a place where honor comes first. \\n\\n\r\nPart of what makes Arthuria unique is her unwillingness to change, no matter what she's faced with. It's both a noble, and ultimately futile goal. I make point of the speech Kiritsugu gives her in episode 16: \\n\\n\r\n---\"to Saber: No. Honor glory, there's no point in talking to a killer who extols such things. A knight cannot save the world. Knights call certain methods of killing 'good' and 'evil', acting as if there were some sacred nobility to the battlefield. Such illusions created by heroes throughout history have led countless young men to their deaths, all for the sake of this glory and honor they extol. \"\\n\r\nSaber: \"Even the taking of a life in battle as a human being must have ideals, otherwise every war would bring the fires of hell to this world.\"\\n\r\n\"There you have it, Iri(sviel), our heroic spirit considers a battlefield to be worse than hell... what a joke. A battlefield IS hell itself. There is no hope to be found on it, there is nothing but unspeakable despair. Just a soulless cry we call victory: paid for by the pain of the defeated, but humanity has never recognized this truth. This is because in every era, a dazzling hero has blinded the people with their legends, and kept them from seeing the evil of bloodshed they bring. True human nature has not advanced a step beyond the stone age!\"---\\n\\n\r\nArthuria cannot accept that the truth of battle is relative... what did it matter if someone was killed by unfair/unjust/unrighteous means VS in \"honorable\" battle? It's both her strength and her greatest hypocrisy, this eternal attachment to the values of Knight's Honor she embodies. \\n\\n\\n\r\nThe second relationship worth exploring here is that of Kirei Kotomine and well... himself. Kirei, as a clergyman and inquisitor (church assassin) despite the appearance of a fulfilled life, is an extreme nihilist. His duality is that he has no reason to seek the Grail, yet he wishes that the Grail would reveal to him the meaning of his own life. Brutal, bitter, and cunning, Kirei is a formidable adversary for anyone, but takes a particular interest in Kiritsugu Emiya. This interest being the first passion of his empty, desolate life. \\n\r\nThe man who fights for everything, yet can have nothing, and the man who fight for nothing, yet seeks everything: the crux of Fate/Zero.\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9\\n\\n\r\nWhat drew me into Fate/Zero wasn't the enormous expo dump at the beginning of the series. (Seriously, a 45 minute long dialogue about the intricacies of the Grail War and the underlying corruption, betrayal, and cutthroatness of the families who continually struggle to possess the Grail is a bit gratuitous)\\n\r\nNo, what drew me into this show was the tone. I harp about tonal inconsistency a lot, but this time the shoe is on the other foot. Type-Moon's story here is very well fleshed out, and maintains a dark, mature tone throughout. It's never tarnished by silly, untimely comedic moments or thoroughly unnecessary fanservice. Fate/Zero takes themes such as loss, despair, and tragedy and pairs them with idealism, of hope and honor, and justice creating an amalgam of duality that is really impactful. \\n\\n\r\nAnother bit I thoroughly enjoyed was the inclusion of historical figures as the Grail heroes. I was familiar with about half of them before, by my eyes were opened to some other historical and legendary figures, which I took to reading about immediately after learning their identities. \\n\r\nGilgamesh, King Arthur, Alexander the Great, and the Berserker were known to me upon their appearance, and their character roles fell deftly in line with how they're portrayed in legend and in actual history. \\n\\n\r\nThe Assassin was modeled after Hassan-i Sabbah, a 3rd Crusade Age Muslim missionary who founded a league of assassins (popularized by a video game series a few people might have heard of). \\n\r\nThe Caster, Gilles de Rais (or Bluebeard), was a mid-Dark Age companion to Joan of Arc, and also a notorious serial killer, particularly of children. He is also noted to have been interested in the occult, particularly summoning. \\n\r\nFinally, Diarmuid Ua Duibhne, a legendary hero of 2nd-4th century Irish origin. He was said to have used two spears, one red, and a yellow one which inflicted wounds that did not heal (likely poison).\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9\\n\\n\r\nOverall a very well done show. I was impressed by the lack of pulled punches: this show is very brutal at times, and doesn't shy away from some heavy themes and visuals a lesser show would have avoided or cut. Fate/Zero isn't for the faint of heart, there are some reviling moments, emotionally rending tragedy, and spots of tear inducing exuberance. Fate/Zero wasn't afraid to take some risks, and they paid off excellently. \\n\r\nI've thoroughly enjoyed the matureness of this show: it could have easily been an overblown shonen action show, but subtlety prevailed, and took a more nuanced route. A philosopher and a warrior, a scholar and an athlete- Fate/Zero is doing it all.\\n\\n\\n\r\ntl;dr\\n\\n\r\n+ Excellent, diverse cast, all interesting in their own right\\n\r\n+ The absolute best 3D animation there's ever been\\n\r\n+ Fantastic, nuanced plot and dialogue to match\\n\\n\r\n+/- Ensemble storytelling can be off putting to some\\n\r\n+/- Slow, exposition filled first half\\n\\n\r\n- Some characters are irritating, perhaps written to be so\\n\\n\\n\r\nRecommend?\\n\r\nYes, absolutely. Great dialogue, better characters, and excellent execution and follow through with a very mature, action based plot.\\n\\n\r\n\"But the tale of humanity will never come to a close, for the struggle of survival is a war without end, and war \u2013 war never changes.\"",

The story often highlights how the goals of the Masters often conflict with the values of the Servants, even the arrogant Gilgamesh. In Fate Stay Night the Servants have a close relationship with their Master's whereas in Fate Zero there is almost contempt.\r\nThe best episode so far hasSaber, Rider and Gilgamesh discussing and disagreeing about what good kingship means.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation goes to the next level with for some shots you wonder if they have slipped in real film.\\n\\n\r\nThe only downside is that the opening and closing songs and titles sequences are not as good as season one.\\n\\n\r\nYou know what is going to happen in the end but who cares.",

            "content": "Fate/Zero Review:\r\nThis is a review for both seasons 1 and 2\r\nAfter seeing the high praise given to this anime from Gigguk and Arkada on Youtube, I decided to give Fate/Zero a go. After watching it, I now completely understand why this show has such positive reception as it was an enthralling ride with hardly any real \"negative\" points to it.\r\nStory 9/10:\r\nFate/Zero takes place 10 years before the events of Fate/StayNight in the middle of what is known as one of the \"Holy Grail Wars.\" I had not seen F/SN before watching this anime, but thanks to the info dump of a first episode I wasquickly put up to speed. The \"Holy Grail Wars\" are battles fought in secret a few times each century. The war is between 7 historical or mythological legends that are brought into present time by their \"masters\" (AKA random people chosen by the grail). The goal is for one of the pairs to ultimately defeat all of the other servants and/or their masters and be the last one remaining. Once this happens, the Holy Grail should appear and grant the victor any wish they desire. Unlike F/SN, Fate/Zero has a VERY serious undertone. As a comparison, I like to akin these two series to the Batman franchise where Fate/Zero is more like the Dark Knight saga, while Fate/StayNight is more like the old tv series with Adam West. Both are good in their own ways, but one is clearly more serious than the other. One of the things that makes Fate/Zero special is that it doesn't rush to pick out a specific main character or good guy, and instead follows the stories of all 7 pairs with an unbiased view point. This let's the viewer really learn about what all the characters are like and their objectives in the war. The different viewpoints really eliminates a lot of the space for plot holes or lack of reasoning, and every event in the story seems to have a purpose. It really is rare to see a show with a concept as ambitious as this, that actually pulls through with barely any plotholes or errors in its writing. Although the ending was somewhat of a cliffhanger, it is also brilliantly done and gave me countless goosebumps as the results of everything that happened were revealed. The story in Fate/Zero was one to remember. Epic is truly the only way to describe it, and its execution was truly in a class of its own.\\n\\n\r\nArt 10/10:\\n\r\nHands down the best art I have seen in an anime series. Watching the show, it really feels like they had a very high budget for the animations. Movements are extremely fluid, and thus the fight scenes are spectacular. Facial expressions, character design, settings, lighting, everything was superb and I really haven't seen an anime nail the animation aspect quite this well. I really don't have anything else to say besides that the art was spectacular.\\n\\n\r\nSound 8/10 (edit: 9):\\n\r\nMuch like everything else in this show, the music was similar to that of a blockbuster movie. Heavy orchestra in the background accompanied by opera singing when battle scenes get intense. The quality of the music was brilliant. However, the show did lack \"memorable\" or \"catchy\" songs that you would like to see in an anime. But like I said, the show in general felt more like a long blockbuster movie than an average anime so the music fit the show perfectly. I found both of the OPs very well suited for the show and quite catchy compared to the background music, although the EDs were less spectacular. As far as voice acting is concerned, I found the Japanese voice actors all portrayed their characters brilliantly, particularly in Rider's case. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter 9/10:\\n\r\nThe fact that the show doesn't focus on a single character really strengthens all of the characters in the show. Due to the changing view points, you really get to see what each character is like, what their motives are, and just their personality in general. The first season really introduces you to the characters and the setting, while the second develops these characters and shifts the story into full swing. None of these characters are your stereotypical archetypes, and some of them really shine. All of the servants are extremely interesting, and Rider is one of the most charismatic characters I've seen in a while. For a good portion of the show, you really don't know who the good guys are and who the bad guys are. You may find yourself rooting for one character only to realize he is evil, or hating one only to realize he is very noble. Towards the end, it becomes pretty evident who the main character is due to an emotional and brilliant two episode arc on his past. My only qualm about the characters is that, because of the divided focus, I wasn't able to fully emotionally invest in any of them. And even though I did definitely feel for the characters and their struggles, I wasn't really completely devastated when bad things happened to them like I would be in an anime like Clannad, Steins;Gate, or Code Geass, where they really focused on one character's development. However, I feel that it would have been pretty much impossible to have the vast depth in the cast if they focused on one character, and the show probably would have been much worse. In short, this show has one of the most, if not THE most, fully fleshed out set of characters that I have ever seen, and just barely misses the 10 mark due to it not quite letting me attach to the characters as much as I wanted to.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 8/10:\\n\r\nFate/Zero was thrilling to watch. The first season was kind of slow as it was really just setting the stage for the madness in the second season, but was fun none the less. Like I said, watching Fate/Zero is similar to watching a movie like the Dark Knight. Everything felt real and all the decisions that characters made felt important, and this sense of seriousness and realism made the show truly a joy to watch. One of my complaints is once again, that I could not emotionally connect with any of the events as much as I have in other shows. It's weird because I know this show is almost flawless, but something about it just wasn't up to par with those on my top 3 anime from an enjoyment standpoint. I really can't put my finger on why I didn't enjoy this show more, but I did enjoy it more than the vast majority of the other shows I have seen so it still gets an 8.\\n\\n\r\nRecommendation:\\n\r\nI can't imagine someone hating this show due to it's unbelievable execution, but it is currently ridiculously expensive to buy so I can only recommend you stream it (available on Crunchyroll). \\n\r\nStream it! +.1\\n\\n\r\nOverall 9.1/10:\\n\r\nFate/Zero is probably the most technically sound anime I have ever seen. There are no huge errors to complain about with it due to the high production value in its art and sound, and nearly flawless writing in its story. If you found Fate/StayNight to be unimpressive, but are curious about this show, do not hesitate to watch Fate/Zero because it is truly on another level from most other anime. Fate/Zero is a grade A anime that is a must watch for all.\\n\\n\r\nThe Verdict:\\n\r\nAn anime that absolutely deserves its praise and an epic tale at its finest.\\n\\n\r\nPros:\\n\r\n+ Cinema quality art and sound\\n\r\n+ Remarkably deep cast of characters\\n\r\n+ Story is an epic to remember\\n\r\n+ Brilliant writing left little room for plot holes or inconsistencies\\n\\n\r\nCons (These cons are more \"reasons why this isn't quite a 9\" than cons, because it really didn't have distinct \"negative\" aspects or \"mistakes\"):\\n\r\n- Lacked a top tier emotional impact\\n\r\n- For ME it missed that \"oomph\" factor that would push it into my favorites\\n\\n\r\nIf you liked Fate/Zero, watch...\\n\r\nDurarara!\\n\r\nSimilar storytelling where they don't really zone into a main character til more towards the end, allowing all the characters to grow equally and the story to be viewed from all angles.\\n\r\nFate/Stay Night (by Ufotable):\\n\r\nWait until the ufotable version of Fate/Stay Night comes out because the original Fate/Stay Night, while pretty good, felt A LOT different than Fate/Zero and really wasn't on the same level.\\n\\n\r\n9.1/10 - Brilliant\\n",

            "content": "If I had to be fair to the greatness of this serie, I had to drop the rate of all the animes I've rated until now by 2 points or more.\r\nFirst, this is not an action show, though it have tons of beatifully done action sequences. This is the story of a man who believed in his ideals and fought for them, but no just him. This is the story of 7 Servants (counting the 1st season) and their troubled, weird, incredible masters, in a way that you can't really choose a villain or a good guy, but you choose the way of thinking thatbetter suits your own.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is amazing, well done, beautiful. If I have to choose a word to describe it it would be...Type-Moon-ish. Lots of drama, psychological issues and depressive as well as funny moments. The story is well paced and gets you sitting in the edge of the chair, waiting for the next episode.\\n\r\nThe art, probably the best part of the show. Imagine a show that, when the quality drops, it comes from \"godly awesome\" to \"oh my god, this film is sooo good\". Not too much to say for people like us, that like to watch animes, but a word for the directors: WATCH THIS to learn how to make a good animation!\\n\r\nThe sound is mine personal opinion. It's amazing, and has Kalafina! I love this group and almost anything they do, so I'm kind of biased to talk about sound.\\n\r\nThe character of the show is well done, so much to like and dislike (based on your mind alone, I've choose my villain and hero, what about you?), they made a protagonist along the 2nd half of the show, but there still some people that think that this one or that one are better, just the individual opinion, that's what make this show so good.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment? Silly question my friend, by the rates I think you can tell if I liked it. This show is in the top 3 of 11 out of 10 people. This is probably the best show I've ever seen in my life.\\n\r\nSorry for the long post, but I had to make this review and try to show all my passion fot it. I hope I did. \\n",

            "content": "Hello everybody Shawn aka TheKazeTrigger here and welcome to my first MVM Entertainment anime review project.\r\nFor the first anime I will be reviewing is Fate/Zero.\r\nNow I have mixed opinions of the Fate franchise because while my thoughts on Unlimited Blade Works by Ufotable are mixed and I personally hate the Deen adaptions of Fate Stay Night. I thought my love with the Fate franchise will die out because of this.\r\nDid my love for Fate Zero die out or it's still going strong as ever?\r\nWell let's find out.\r\nStory.\r\nThe story of Fate Zero revolves on something call the Holy Grail War.\r\nA Holy Grail war is a warbetween seven servants as well as seven masters (Magic Users) who through the power of the grail summon heroic spirits who are the people of legend, history fame, or myth. They all battle which each other to claim ownership of the grail which is said to be able to grant the owner any wish.\\n\r\nThe story of Fate/Zero is really good in my opinion because unlike it's squeal Fate Stay Night which was inconsistent Fate Zero stay consistent from start to finish containing some of the best story direction I have ever seen.\\n\r\nFate Zero is the story of the 4th Holy Grail War 10 years pearl to the events of the 5th Holy Grail War in Fate Stay Night what really separates this war for that is the player themselves.\\n\r\nUnlike in Fate Stay Night where the war focus on entirely on the main protagonist here it's much bigger more diverse, and more mature and\\n\r\nThis is war done right!\\n\r\nAliens and betrayals, well planned and thought out strategies and deposition, well directed fight sequences, really relatable characters movable tons, world building that is fully fleshed out.\\n\r\nNot to mention I really adore the use of heavy dialogue and exposition as seen in episode 1 and for that reason episode 1 of Fate Zero is one of my favourite first anime episodes in anime and it's in my top 30 favourite anime episodes.\\n\r\nIn short Fate Zero has it all!\\n\r\nThe story is original, externally well written, unpredictable, hardly and black and whites and it will keep you edge to your seat when watching,\\n\r\nThe ending of Fate/Zero is great and it really fits with the theme of Fate/Zero.\\n\r\nI won't spoil the ending here because this ending is a experience that you should watch for your own viewing.\\n\r\nFate/Zero also does an amazing job exploring its themes such as prides, responsibilities of being a king, sacrifices, tragicly, survival and future.\\n\r\nI honestly cannot  find any flaws with the story because the execution of the story is just wonderful.\\n\r\n10/10\\n\r\nCharacters.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters of Fate/Zero are very mature and well written compare to the cast of Fate Stay Night where they immature as hell and they usually fall into generic character tropes.\\n\r\nThe thing that makes the character cast so special is that doesn't really have a main character least for a while.\\n\r\nAll of the masters and servants are explored in depth and we get to see the war through each of their perspectives. Completely different to its squeal series Fate Stay Night.\\n\r\nNot to mention the character interactions with each other because unlike in Fate Stay Night where the character interactions are stiff, forced and sometimes have no substance at all Fate Zero character interactions are believable, relatable and have a great impact of the outcome of the 4th Holy Grail War.\\n\r\nMy favourite characters in Fate/Zero is Rider and Waver because not only they are great entrainment character but they are well written from start to finish. Not to mention Rider and Waver are some of the best duo I have ever seen in anime.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nThis is all thanks to Gen Urobuchi. If you guys don't know about him Gen Urobuchi is the series composition of Madoka Magica, Psycho Pass, Gargantia on the Verdurous Planet and Fate/Zero.\\n\r\nGen Urobuchi has a habit of writing ideologies rather than characters and fate zero is the prime example of that. Most of the character aren't really fleshed out or well developed  They serve  more as physical embodiment of the individual ideals rather than actual people. The focus is on the character interactions and not necessarily the characters themselves. All of the characters in Fate/Zero are really complex characters making for a nice change from the typically Black and White approach as well generic that squeal series Fate Stay Night suffers from.\\n\r\nAlso by the time you figure out who's good or evil chances are they already been killed in the battlefield. \\n\r\nBesides that this character cast is nothing but amazing.\\n\r\n9.5/10\\n\\n\r\nArt/Animation.\\n\\n\r\nVisually Fate/Zero is one of the best looking anime I have ever seen. Ufotable absolutely really did a wonderful job here as the animation is some of the best animation I have ever seen for a TV series.\\n\r\nThe action sequences are unbelievably beautiful  and the choreography is just perfect.\\n\r\nAlso unpopular option I think the art/animation here is better than Fate Stay Night UBW (TV) while the fights in UBW (TV) are greatly animated most of slice of life bits were kinda too bright and sometimes the character designs are not properly drawn and feel like plastic at times if you look very closely on the character during those scenes.\\n\r\nThe character deigns in Fate/Zero well thought out, very well drawn, animated and consistent from start to finish.\\n\r\nI personally have no complaints with the art and animation.\\n\r\n11/10 I definitely broke the scale for this one.\\n\\n\r\nSound.\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is just epic.\\n\r\nThis is Yuki Kajiura at her best because she utilises those badass choir vocals endlessly to give nearly every track that feel of epicness.\\n\r\nFate/Zero has 2 opening and ending themes and they are all just epic and very catchy in they own way.\\n\\n\r\nNow for dub or sub.\\n\r\nTo be honest go for what you want because both the Japanese and English voice actors really did a great job with they performance making each role more satisfying  to the audience.\\n\r\nI would say go for both sub and dub for this one.\\n\r\n10/10\\n\\n\r\nFinal Thoughts.\\n\\n\r\nFate/Zero is one of the best animes I have ever seen from 2010s era of anime and its one of the most entering rides I have ever been on.\\n\r\nThe story was addicting and seeing the characters ideologies clash with each other was absolute thrill. The animation is absolutely beautiful and the soundtrack is fitting epic from start to finish.\\n\r\nAlso both sub and dub are flawless in my eyes.\\n\r\nIt accomplishes something a few prequels have and far surpassing its sequel Fate Stay Night. At time point I mention why is Fate/Zero is better than Fate Stay Night and that because it is. Fate Zero manages to fix everything that I hated about Fate Stay Night and in my opinion Fate/Zero makes any anime adaptation of Fate Stay Night look like a joke by comparison.\\n\r\nFate/Zero is one of the best animes I have ever seen and its now in my top 15 favourites anime of all time.\\n\r\nFate Zero is a modern classic that should not be missed by anyone.\\n\r\nI give Fate/Zero Both Seasons a 10/10 ( Masterpiece of war)\\n\\n\r\nFate/Zero is available from MVM Entertainment in the UK and they currently licensed both seasons on DVD and Blu Ray.\\n\\n\r\nIf you can Fate/Zero is a must buy on Blu Ray for the better viewing experience.\\n\r\nThe DVD version of Fate/Zero is surprisingly good compare to the blurry looking Fate/Stay Night UBW (TV) on DVD which was a ugly experience in my opinion  \\n\\n\\n\r\nAnime recommendations.\\n\r\nFullmetal alchemist Brotherhood\\n\r\nCode Geass\\n\r\nKara no Kyoukai\\n\r\nHellsing Ultimate.\\n\r\nGinga Eiyuu Densetsu (Legend of the Galactic Heroes)\\n\r\nAnyway this was Shawn aka TheKazeTrigger and I will see you guys next time.\\n\\n\r\nNext anime review for my MVM Entertainment anime review project will be The Familiar of Zero S1 or Bakemonogatari.",

            "content": "***This review is comprehensive of both seasons of Fate/Zero.***\r\nIf your one and only wish could be granted, how far would you tread down the path colored in blood and embroidered with thorns?\r\nWelcome to Fate/Zero, an epic that explores the efforts of seven masters and their servants (heroic spirits such as King Arthur) to obtain the Holy Grail, a device said to be capable of granting any one wish.\r\nSorely disappointed by its sequel, Fate/Stay Night, I, like many others before me, was initially reluctant to watch the show. Turned off by the ridiculously pure ideals of Emiya Shirou and defiled by the constant repetition of thephrase, \"People die when they are killed\", Fate/Zero's appeal to me was minimal.\\n\\n\r\nOh, how wrong was I.\\n\\n\r\nFate/Zero is a delightfully dark deviation from its sequel and excels in almost every single category. Before I delve into the meat of this review, allow me to comment on the more technical aspects of the series.\\n\\n\r\nArtistically speaking, Fate/Zero is incredibly accomplished. The animation quality is outstanding, and falters not even for a second. Ufotable executes everything from simple character movements to brilliantly drawn action sequences in excruciating detail, using dark color palettes that encapsulate the mysterious and somber ambience of the show.\\n\\n\r\nAs expected of Yuki Kajiura, the mastermind behind several other breathtaking soundtracks, the music is top-notch. Incorporating choir and orchestra into many of her works, Yuki Kajiura creates tracks that fit each scene more or less faultlessly. Each track adds to the complexity of every mystery, complements the sorrow of every tragedy, and intensifies the scale of every battle.\\n\\n\r\nAll openings and endings add a little something special to the series, providing insight on some aspects of the show that, for the sake of spoilers, you must discover yourself.\\n\\n\r\nBetween its two seasons, Fate/Zero pulls a stunt that is both admirable from both a production and (in the long term) an entertainment standpoint. Fate/Zero discontinued its story for a rather short period of three months although there was no reason to do so in regards to the plot; that is to say, there was no point in delaying the continuation of such a fluid story. Although it may have vexed some viewers, this method of production ensured that the overall quality of Fate/Zero would be consistent \u2014 a wise decision, that, in the long run, provided even greater entertainment for the audience.\\n\\n\r\nThe most desirable decision would have been to release all episodes at a later point in time, but I would rather have Ufotable do this than rush production and suffer a drop in quality.\\n\\n\r\nNow, to discuss the story, characters, and my personal enjoyment...and if you thought there was a lot to read so far, then you've got another thing coming.\\n\\n\r\nThe story of Fate/Zero is carefully constructed so that there are no missing or remaining pieces of the puzzle upon completion. The concept of battling for an omnipotent wish granting device is not completely novel, but Fate/Zero's execution of the idea is, dare I say it, the best I've ever seen.\\n\\n\r\nAs the story is told from a variety of perspectives, it is not as easy to discern who the winner will be by the end of it all, unlike most survival game anime that may as well have just told us the victor in the first ten minutes of the first episode. As certain characters begin to get more development, the predetermined victor becomes more and more evident, but this is just a regrettably unavoidable aspect of such works. Regardless, the plot does well to attribute sufficient screen time to each tag team of master and servant to uphold the feeling of uncertainty in its audience.\\n\\n\r\nThe plot is also made unpredictable due to its dark nature. With such a dreary atmosphere (bolstered by the aforementioned animation style and music), we as viewers are never quite sure of how things will turn out. Things may seem to be heading in a somewhat predictable direction when suddenly, the plot throws a wrench in its works to turn the tables around.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, unlike in some series (such as Mirai Nikki), this technique not employed excessively, allowing the story to be told coherently and without much disruption.\\n\\n\r\nLikewise, the characters are also equally as amazing as the plot. It is rare to see an anime with such a large cast give each and every one of its numerous characters enough development to evoke strong emotion in the case that something should occur.\\n\\n\r\nWhy do viewers feel triumphant at the defeat of a villain? Why do they feel sad at the death of a hero?\\n\\n\r\nThe answer is empathy.\\n\\n\r\nIt is specifically because of proper character development that viewers form a collective and (nearly) unanimous feeling toward a specific character. It's the difference between being told a random person has died and being told that the closest person to you has passed away in a tragic accident. Without a comprehensive understanding of character motivations and their circumstances, it is impossible to FEEL anything for them; in other words emotional connections between characters and viewers are of vital importance.\\n\\n\r\nFate/Zero accomplishes this feat beautifully. There is enough development on each character that the viewers can understand each and every one of them (although some less than others). Everything the characters say or do has a purpose and reinforces the former \"emotional connections\" to the extent that every event holds at least some significance or meaning.\\n\\n\r\nTo very quickly summarize these thoughts, Fate/Zero has characters that make you actually CARE about what happens to them, whether that be in a positive or negative light.\\n\\n\r\nThe complexity and relatively unpredictable nature of the plot and the high amount of development that occurs in every single character is what makes Fate/Zero one of the masterpieces of anime, but it is for these exact same reasons that the series suffers. Simply put, these traits are double-edged swords.\\n\\n\r\nGoing back to the puzzle analogy, although there are no missing/leftover pieces, there are too many to begin with in the first place.\\n\\n\r\nHaving watched Fate/Stay Night prior to this, I had a full understanding of the concepts of the Holy Grail War. Since the protagonist, Emiya Shirou, was just as new to the Holy Grail War as the viewers were, the show eased its viewers into it. However, it is easy to see how newer members of the Fate franchise may have not had the time to wrap their minds around the basics of the plot before the exposition explodes into action.\\n\\n\r\nMoreover, the characters, and the heroic spirits in particular, are difficult to understand from time to time. Again, due to my interest in ancient folklore, I had a rather deep understanding of most servants and their incentives. It is exactly because the show tries too hard to give every character decent developments that it feels as if some characters were not done enough justice. Knowing the fates/stories of each and every one of the heroic spirits gave ten times more weight to every swing of their weapon and every word on their lips.\\n\\n\r\nNevertheless, not everyone may feel the same way \u2014 I still would have greatly enjoyed Fate/Zero even if I were not so informed on the pasts of the heroic spirits or on the Fate universe in general. These are merely things that, ideally, should have been done, but realistically, couldn't be done. It's completely unreasonable of me to expect that an anime accomplish so much in such a short period of time, and the truth is that Fate/Zero did an incredibly admirable job fleshing out such an enormous amount of substance in a mere 25 episodes.\\n\\n\r\nAlthough I enjoy a great variety of anime (from the pure and peaceful nature of Usagi Drop to the mindless action in Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann), I enjoy nothing more than dark, twisted, and thought-provoking series such as this.\\n\\n\r\nFate/Zero focuses largely on the idea of clashing ideologies, whether that be between two masters, two servants, or even a master and a servant. Do the ends justify the means? Is there defeat to be found victory, or must victory be absolute? Themes like these frequently appear in the world of Fate/Zero, each difficult to give a certain answer to.\\n\\n\r\nIn particular, the anime delves into the topic of the importance of chivalry and the definition of what it means be a king. How must one lead his or her nation? Is there honor and morals involved in killing others? Why is it that the code of chivalry must be tacitly upheld? Again, these are themes that may appear too foreign to some viewers and may even go unrecognized, but I spent a great deal of time contemplating my own responses to these questions, enjoying every minute and second of doing so.\\n\\n\r\nCONCLUSION:\\n\\n\r\nFate/Zero is a masterpiece \u2014 yes, a masterpiece. The animation and sound are arguably among the best in any anime, and the story and characters are complex yet adequately developed. Although the series could have benefitted even more by fleshing out more of its material and conveying its universe to potentially new viewers, it does all that it can in 25 episodes.\\n\\n\r\nThe reason I also endorse Fate/Zero as a \"masterpiece\", a word I don't like to throw around lightly, is that the show is just so incredibly well rounded. In almost every anime that I have watched so far (which isn't too many), there has always been at least one category in which the anime lacks. Be it story, character, art, sound, or my personal enjoyment, I could find little to no faults with any of these five categories. In fact, the anime is so balanced in everything that it accomplishes that it was only fair that I attribute the same amount of significance to every category in my final rating.\\n\\n\r\nSo, without further ado...\\n\\n\r\nSTORY (20%) \u2014 9.2/10\\n\r\nCHARACTERS (20%)  \u2014 9.2/10\\n\r\nANIMATION (20%) \u2014 9.8/10\\n\r\nSOUND (20%) \u2014 9.7/10\\n\r\nENJOYMENT (20%) \u2014 9.8/10\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL (100%) \u2014 9.5/10\\n\\n\r\nNow...\\n\\n\r\nBy the power of my Command Seal, I command thee, avid reader, to explore the magnificent universe of Fate/Zero!",

            "content": "This is mostly a review of the entirety of Fate/Zero rather than the second season in particular. I have not watched or read the Fate/Stay Night material before watching this. \r\nStory: 9\r\nWriting a prequel to an already well-established series has proven in many cases to be difficult to do (i.e. Star Wars) but Fate/Zero passes with flying colors. Even if you have seen Fate/Stay Night prior to watching this, it still provides many twists and turns that leave you guessing all the way up until the final episode, all the while seamlessly setting up the story for Fate/Stay Night. The dialogue is genuine and theways the characters interact with each other always make for great moments. The first few episodes are a bit of an information dump, but really help to explain the world you are immersing yourself in. Philosophically, it chronicles the eternal struggle of morality in the face of war that never becomes too preachy, but leaves you wondering what is right and wrong.  \\n\\n\r\nArt: 9\\n\r\nStaying consistent to the TYPE-MOON art style, it looks very nice in an updated setting. Although there is a rather consistent use of CGI, it does not take away from the action all too much. It does, however, enhance large scale attacks very nicely. The character designs, again, are the highlight as they are able to craft characters of unique traits and avoid making them appear hokey.     \\n\\n\r\nSound: 10\\n\r\nIn regards to the dub, I watched the English dub which I thought was executed very well. The voices matched the attitudes and statures of the characters and never once felt miscast.  Rider\u2019s voice in particular couldn\u2019t have been a better fit. Even the characters with somewhat deadpan personalities like Kiritsugu and Kirei are well acted and the subtleties of their emotions really shine through. The soundtrack is fantastic. Yuki Kajiura creates a very immersive and powerful score that has you on the edge of your seat during every battle. Also, the opening theme of the second season is one of the best anime openings I\u2019ve ever heard.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 10\\n\r\nThe character development in this anime is astounding and is easily the best part of the show. Rather than primarily focus on one main character, besides the two episodes of Kiritsugu backstory, the show really helps to flesh out each character\u2019s personality and their ambitions towards why they lust after the Holy Grail. Even if you don\u2019t particularly like certain characters, you still understand the reasons behind their actions and are interested to see how they act because of it.   \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10\\n\r\nI can\u2019t talk enough about how much I enjoyed this anime. I was captivated as soon as I finished the first episode. It was difficult for me not to pound out the whole show in a few days, which I have a bad knack of doing. Every character, good or bad, left an impression on me and were memorable no matter how large their role was. I will definitely be re-watching it to enjoy it again.   \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 10\\n\r\nA great anime that has awesome characters, a compelling story, and an intriguing philosophical battle to go alongside the well-choreographed fights. Definitely in my Top 10 Anime list. Great for both the casual and avid Anime fan. You can also enjoy it whether you've seen Fate/Stay Night or not. \\n",

            "content": "I am the bone of my prequels.\r\nEdge is my body, and dialogue is my blood.\r\nI have created over a thousand plotholes.\r\nKnown to elitists.\r\nBut not to you filthy casuals.\r\nHave withstood feels to create painful backstories.\r\nYet, those viewers only care about the fancy visuals.\r\nSo as I pray... UNLIMITED UROBUTCHER WORKS.\r\nFate/Zero 2nd! What a blast! Definitely a huge step up from its first season, Fate/Zero 2nd somewhat ditched the extremely slow motion pacing, and I mean somewhat because, it's the Fate franchise! The pacing will always be slow! Except in the last two episodes of course...\r\nThis season features much more action than the first season, as well asmuch more gripping and engaging drama! While it still holds the Fate franchise charm of taking forever to explain the simplest of situations, it does so much more interestingly than the first season, which totally makes up for it. There is still a lot of dialogue, but instead of info dumps and other boring conversations from before, this time you get people threatening to kill each other, people cursing each other, people explaining things that are actually interesting, and so much more! \\n\\n\r\nOf course, I can't really write a Fate franchise review without mentioning the PRETTY VISUALS! Due to their unlimited budget works, Ufotable has been named a god studio in terms of animation, and Fate/Zero has received the godlike animation style that this studio is now so famous for. In other words, no show can beat the Fate franchise in action scenes! And since Fate/Zero 2nd focuses more of its time on the action scenes, the breathtaking animation is highlighted even more! \\n\\n\r\nAnother thing that the Fate franchise is famous for is an amazing use of sound, and Fate/Zero is no exception. Not only is the OST either really beautiful or hype generating, the sound effects of the battles, the voice acting, all of it is on such a high level. Fate/Zero's budget isn't just limited to the art and animation.\\n\\n\r\nAnd of course, the characters. This is a huge reason why many believe Fate/Zero is so much better than Fate/Stay Night UBW. The characters going for the grail are all incredibly adept adults, with dark backstories and mature methods of obtaining their goals. Everyone's favorite character Saber kicked major amounts of ass, and her motorcycle skills are pretty sexy. TsundeRin's hairstyle is actually cool in Fate/Zero. Looks like Fate/Zero's budget also includes making badass characters.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Fate/Zero is one thrilling watch. So what if its an adaptation of a light novel, which is an adaptation of a porn game? It's an edgy survival game with tons of badass and gorey action, some borderline occult horror moments, and even some humor (since Rider is a character). \\n\\n\r\nTL;DR: \"Just because it's by Urobutcher, doesn't mean it's bad!\" - Shirou Emiya.",

            "content": "\"Power tends to corrupt, and absolute power corrupts absolutely\" - Lord John Dalberg-Acton, 1837.\r\nThere are many types of power - financial, military, political, religious, etc - and at one time or another each has been used to further the goals of individuals, organisations, and even nations. The odd thing though, is that even though it has been referenced for thousands of years in everything from legends and myths to folktales and history, magic has rarely been placed in the same category. The problem is that people don't really believe in magic any more, and the subject has been relegated to the realms of fiction andfantasy - even though it was often said that practitioners had the ability to wield primal forces, command spirits, and shake the foundations of heaven.\\n\\n\r\nEverything has a price though, and in order to achieve or seize power of any sort you have to be willing to give up certain ... things. So the question is, what would you sacrifice for the chance to be a god?\\n\\n\r\nThe continuation of Fate/Zero opens with two F-15 jets that have been dispatched by the Japanese Air Force with orders to investigate the situation on the Mion River. Archer/Gilgamesh watches with disdain from on high as Sabre, Rider and Lancer continue their temporary alliance, and the pitched battle with the giant creature summoned by Caster/Gille de Rais rages on.\\n\\n\r\nLittle do they know that a new player is about to enter the field ...\\n\\n\r\nOne of the most noticeable differences between the first and second halves of Fate/Zero is the shift from preparation and planning to all-out action - something that is rather eloquently symbolized by the battle on the Mion River. With much of the preamble over, the storyline is able to place the kid-gloves to one side and ramp-up the tension between the combatants. This is most often achieved by drawing on the conflicting ideologies of each of the characters - with some thoroughly unscrupulous tactics thrown in to drive home the fact that the participants are involved in a war. The plot remains as focused as ever, but there's a palpable change in the atmosphere of the series, and many episodes have a less forgiving, more brutal air about them.\\n\\n\r\nThis shift in \"attitude\" has been handled extremely well by series director Aoki Ei and his writers, and a great deal of attention has been paid to the impact the numerous action scenes have on the characters - something that's becoming a rarity in modern anime. It's an interesting and effective usage of screentime that is markedly different from the patient build-up of the first half of the story, but crafted with the same care and attention to detail that have become a hallmark of Type-Moon/Ufotable collaborations. This prevents the show devolving into a legendary free-for-all, and allows for some very interesting confrontations - several of which have their roots in the layers of subtext that were added during previous series.\\n\\n\r\nWith the focus on action instead of intrigue, one might have expected there to be some differences in the visuals. Thankfully there are almost no major alterations present throughout the series - aside from a few cosmetic differences in clothing and apparel. The high production standards have been maintained and character movements are as sharp and crisp as ever. There are a few relatively minor issues with the blending of CG and standard animation, but these are pretty easy to ignore. What does stand out are the rather dazzling visual effects, many of which are bigger and bolder due to the shift from preparation to action. The choreography and timing of these - together with the quality of the character animation - make for some truly stunning combat sequences.\\n\\n\r\nComposer Kajiura Yuki's all-female band Kalafina - the long-time muses of Type-Moon/Ufotable collaborations - open the second season with the operatic rock ballad \"To the Beginning\", while the main participants in the Holy Grail war are re-introduced in a well-choreographed montage that contains a few hints of things to come. On the other hand the closing sequence is a rather simple yet moving account - told through a series of still images - of the relationship between Emiya Kiritsugu and Irisviel von Einzbern - with Luna Haruna's pop ballad \"Sora wa Takaku Kaze wa Utau\" adding an uplifting and slightly bittersweet tone. Kalafina also return with the martially themed operatic ballad \"Manten\" as a special closing track for episodes 18 and 19.\\n\\n\r\nThe first season of Fate/Zero featured a very high standard of audio production, and it's nice to see that sound director Iwanami Yoshikazu hasn't allowed anyone to rest on their laurels. The background music is as diverse and atmospheric as ever, and while there are a few tracks that may sound a little off-kilter, this appears to be a purposeful move in order to heighten the mood of certain scenes. That said, there are two areas where this series is arguably superior to its predecessor - both of which have been pushed to the fore by the move to action.\\n\\n\r\nThe audio effects are as sharp and clear as ever, but the increase in combat means that the production standards need to be pushed even higher and more diversity needs to be added. In addition to this the quality of  the audio/visual choreography - which was already excellent in the previous series - often went unnoticed because of the focus on preparation and planning. Thankfully Iwanami is arguably one of the most experienced sound directors working in the industry, and his skills - developed over many years working on a variety of different anime - really make the difference. The superb effects and remarkable choreography really set the second series of Fate/Zero apart from other shows released this year, and mark it as a front-runner for any potential awards in this department.\\n\\n\r\nUnlike many other anime, the move to an action footing hasn't caused the script to devolve into random shouts, grunts and screams, and the writers have done well to retain the maturity and intelligence of the first season. There is a bit of a change in the delivery though, as with the goal in sight, some of the actors appear to have been encouraged to add more emotion to their roles. This works surprisingly well with characters who were cold or aloof in the first series - Sabre and Archer for example - and the differences in their feelings becomes more pronounced as the story progresses and the battles take their mental toll.\\n\\n\r\nOne of the biggest criticisms of Fate/Zero is that it has tried to weave a coherent narrative from too many character and plot threads without relying on a lead role. Now this may seem like an anathema to those who prefer their development to follow a distinct linear progression, but those tales often suffer from an age-old problem in storytelling - every good protagonist needs an equally good antagonist. It's an issue that has affected anime for many years as - contrary to popular belief - creating and developing a good opposite (the antagonist doesn't have to be a villain after all), to a hero/heroine is not an easy task.\\n\\n\r\nThankfully Fate/Zero takes its cues from shows like Baccano!, and the lack of a lead role is actually a boon to the series as it allows multiple perspectives to come to the fore. Each of the participants in the war for the Holy Grail is effectively the antagonist of one or more of the other combatants, and all of the players bounce around the plot like peas on a drum - colliding into each other and changing their directions, alliances and enemies in the blink of an eye. It's a rarely used and fascinating approach to character development that highlights in particular the ever-changing nature of the battlefield. One big plus is that while the first season was rather staid in its portrayal of the heroes, the second half of the story pulls very few punches - showing clearly the lengths to which several of the combatants will go in order to win, opening the scars of old wounds, and ensuring that the viewer knows exactly what everyone has put on the line for the ultimate prize.\\n\\n\r\nOver the years there have been many anime that have changed focus and tone from one season to the next, but rarely does it happen in the space of one series. The reason for this is because it's often extremely difficult to reconcile what may eventually turn out to be conflicting portrayals of the story and characters - and therein lies the greatest achievement of Type-Moon, Ufotable, and author Urobuchi Gen. The successful blending of two different perspectives has created a remarkable story that isn't afraid to show off its intelligence or maturity, and the second half of Fate/Zero successfully builds upon the carefully laid foundations of the first season - even with the increase in action and combat.\\n\\n\r\nPrequels are often tricky to deal with as they are very easy to get wrong, which is one of the reasons why this series is a little bit special. In addition to shedding new light on the events that occur in Fate/Stay Night, Fate/Zero is also a singular example of just how good seinen action tales can be, and a testament to the quality that can be achieved through long-term studio collaborations.",

            "content": "From the mind that gave us works such as Madoka and Saya no Uta comes a tale spun as a predecessor to the wildly popular series Fate/Stay Night. Of course, anyone who has read or watched Fate/Stay Night knows the outcome of the fourth Holy Grail War, but only half the fun of a journey is the destination. Gen Urobuchi and studio Ufotable guide us through a magnificent world saturated with dynamic characters, a beautiful score, jaw-dropping visuals and fluctuating idealistic views, which all congeal into a compelling narrative. Mistakes are made by Ufotable, but compared to the grandiose story and execution they only serveas minor annoyances. \\n\\n\r\nPlot\\n\\n\r\nThe Grail War has been done before, but never like this. The same rules apply. Seven masters, seven servants, all fighting in a fierce battle royal in order to determine the rightful owner of the Holy Grail. However in contrast to Fate/Stay Nights cast of children struggling to accept the responsibility so prematurely forced upon them we have a plethora of adult men ready to sacrifice anything to achieve their goals. By Juxtaposing the series and its prequel it becomes evident that Fate/Zero is a darker story focusing on the ideals of each characters along with the suffering these ideals bring forth. The plot is essentially a catalyst that lets the characters tragically develop as they spiral closer and closer into despair.\\n\r\nBut through its greatness Fate/Zero suffers from its link to Fate/Stay Night. As a prequel, its freedom was constrained by the eventual conclusion that loomed just beyond the horizon. But even as a predecessor limited to one conclusion Fate/Zero succeeded in producing a story that left you on the edge of your seat.\\n\\n\r\nArt\\n\\n\r\nIn addition to Fate/Zero Ufotable is also the studio responsible for the Kara no Kyoukai series; a powerhouse in the visual arts department. No corners were cut in producing Fate/Zero, either. Ferocious battles, twisted emotions, and familiar yet exotic settings are illustrated beautifully with the use of hair-raising choreography, movie quality animation and god tier CG. Now, CG is a turn off for most viewers, me usually included. However the CG in this series is so stunningly well done that I can't imagine it would be animated half as well any other way. In addition to CG, Ufotable has once again incorporated a beautiful contrast between neon colors as seen in Kara no Kyoukai. The warm orange glow of a streetlamp beating down on the lifeless world bathed in the hue of moonlight really gives the show a sharp look that is pleasing on the eyes. Fate/Zero also houses THE most amazing fight in anime I've seen to date, I won't spoil which fight it is, but those who have already seen the anime will know.\\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\\n\r\nA beautiful orchestrated soundtrack is the icing on the cake. The music accompanying the series is a kaleidoscope of melodies invoking emotional responses when needed; happiness, despair, tragedy, splendor, evil, conflict, etc. The opening and ending songs both intertwine with the story effectively as well. The opening has an emotional feel to it as compared with the upbeat actiony sequence present in season one. It adequately inspires a sense of foreboding  in the viewer. Now onto the ending. It serves to flesh out our protagonist Kerry by presenting us with how he and Iri came to be a couple and have their child. Teasing us with Kerry's past and how happy the two lovers were during the short time they spent together only serves to harden the impact of the finale.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters\\n\\n\r\nThese are what makes this show shine so brilliantly. There are no exceptions; every single character is quirkily unique, each one sheltering an array of conflicting emotions, and impossible ideals. Labeling any character as an antagonist, protagonist, side character, or otherwise would be insulting as almost every person is artistically created with personalities astonishingly fleshed out and consistent. Gilgamesh for example was once the ruler of pretty much everything on earth. By standing above everyone else figuratively and literally for his entire life, he has fostered an incredible superiority complex. Infinite weapons fill his treasury, and he only expends four on an enemy that is about to destroy the entire city before retreating saying that he \"Does not wish for the weapons to be returned because they touched that filthy creature\". That is beautiful characterization right there. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment.\\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed the shit out of this. There's nothing more to be said.\\n\\n\r\nOverall\\n\\n\r\nOne episode was filler, some others were rushed because of it, and a certain track wasn't included in the score, but this does not stop Fate/Zero from being one of the best anime in a long time. With a bravura of directing, animation, plot, character development, sound, choreography, and dialogue, Fate/Zero exceeded all my expectations and got better every single episode. Fanboyish as the review may seem, a wonderful story is a wonderful story, no matter which way you cut it.",

Speak of conquest and demonstrate it.\u201d - Rider \r\nThe Holy Grail\u2014an omnipotent wish granting device which grants the owner any one wish of their deepest desire. For generations, the Holy Grail Wars were held every 60 years to decide who would be worthy to yield an item of such immense power; seven Masters coupled with seven Servants duke it out in a battle royale to the death, but only one Master and Servant can be victorious.\r\n Fate/Zero is a thrilling, engaging, intellectual and mature anime withjaw-dropping visuals.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 9.51\\n\r\nFate/Zero is about the 4th Holy Grail War, which takes place 10 years before the events of the Fifth Holy Grail war, and is set in Fuyuki City. Seven magi are chosen by the Grail as Masters, and by the power of the Grail, they have the ability to summon Heroic Spirits brought forth as familiars to come and fight by their side, which are their Servants. Each Servant that\u2019s summoned is put into one of the following classes, which include: Saber, Lancer, Archer, Rider, Caster, Assassin and Berserker; each with their own skills and benefits.\\n\\n\r\nThe Story is masterfully done and kept me engaged throughout the entire series. You never know what\u2019s going to happen next or what plot twist is going to take place. Watching it is almost as reading a masterfully crafted literature epic; it's that good.\\n\\n\r\n This anime is heavily focused around dialogue, and for that reason there aren\u2019t many battles, but when a battle arrives it\u2019s just so amazing that it\u2019ll keep you at the edge of your seat. This isn\u2019t to say that the dialogue isn\u2019t entertaining though, as I personally enjoyed every last bit of it, even if it does sometimes drag on for awhile. The dialogue also tells a lot about some of the characters backstories. \\n\\n\r\nThroughout there are some comedic scenes here and there, most of which pertaining to Rider and Waver, though for the most part it mainly stays in a serious and dark atmosphere.\\n\\n\r\nArt/Animation: 9.94\\n\r\n The production quality for this anime is just amazing\u2014it really shows how great Type-Moon's productions are, and when they\u2019re mixed with ufotable, EXPECT GREATNESS! The art and animation in this anime are done SO well it\u2019s just breathtaking, to say the least. Every image is animated so well, there were very few animation errors, and everything was just so smooth. And the art was just beautiful! It was so good that in some scenes my jaw was literally dropped for 1-2 minutes. I also really liked the character designs; all of them were just awesome. The art and animation is just masterfully done, not much more I can say about it. Go check it out for yourself if you don\u2019t take my word for it. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 9.70\\n\r\nOne of my favorite aspects of this show has got to be how it portrayed the characters. I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s not entirely focusing on one main protagonist and rather showing all the characters and how their stories eventually unfold, or if it\u2019s the masterful way Gen Urubuchi conveyed how each character thought and why they took the actions that they took, but I loved it. Character development is also very good; you mainly notice it with Kiritsugu Emiya, as there are even 2 whole episodes about his back story in season 2. But my favorite character, like many others, is definitely Rider. Some of the feels you get when he gives his speeches. I also love his attitude and how he acts, one of my favorite characters of recent times.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9.57\\n\r\nThe soundtrack for both seasons was done by Yuki Kaijura, and if you\u2019ve ever heard any of her other awesome soundtracks (most notably SAO and Madoka Magica), you should have a pretty good idea that this one is just as great. Most of the pieces have heavy orchestra and are very powerful; this track also contains some very emotional pieces, like my personal favorite from it, Tragedy and Fate.\\n\\n\r\nI absolutely adored the first opening Oath Sign by LiSa, and I doubted the second one would be better than the first\u2026 But oh boy was I wrong about that (for my tastes). \u201cTo the Beginning\u201d By Kalafina (Yuki Kaijura\u2019s all-female band) quickly become my favorite OP of ALL time. Strong vocals accompanied by a strong orchestra make this piece a pleasure to the ears. I really liked the EDs. Sora wa Takaku Kaze wa Utau by Luna Haruna really set the mood for the end of each episode, and it also quickly became one of my favorite EDs.\\n\r\nI watched the dubbed version and it was just great--leagues above many other dubs I've heard. I don\u2019t think they could\u2019ve even picked a better voice actor for Kiritsugu Emiya than Matthew Mercer, and Freeman Crispin (also Alucard from Hellsing), as always, did an amazing job. His deep tone really suited Kirei Kotomine. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment/Overall: 9.68\\n\r\nWhat can I say? I absolutely love this anime. It will keep you thrilled, engaged, and satisfied by the ending. It has really high production quality, and a great soundtrack. My highest recommendation for you to watch this truly exceptional anime.\\n\\n\r\n One thing I also admire about it how mature it is\u2014it doesn\u2019t need fan service or overused/unoriginal comedy to be successful (not that that's always a bad thing, though). It is truly an original as well as unique anime, and  in my opinion, a must watch for fans of the Fate series.",

            "content": "The Holy Grail War: A war fought between seven selected masters and their servants to determine a sole victor, who will then bless one miracle upon the world. The Holy Grail War can either bring about an ideal wish that saves innocent lives or lead to chaotic destruction in the process. Or both. The Fate Zero series' plot circles around the Holy Grail War, its history and its future. The previous season focused on the characters' backgrounds, and in this season it is now all-out war. \r\nThe Holy Grail War also involves several sets of conflicts between various supernatural families. All the families for onewants glory for winning the actual war, but the one miracle wish that's blessed by the holy grail is what personally drives the contestants. Would you sacrifice the whole world for the rebirth of your dead, loved ones? Is it worth it? These dark themes are the bane of many of our protagonists and side characters as they approach their psychological breakdowns. \\n\\n\r\nThen there's Saber, and all other Honored Heroes.\\n\\n\r\nAll the characters in the fate zero series have multilateral background stories, but most things are left unexplained in the beginning of the series in order to create a mysterious atmosphere and aura around even the main protagonists. This leaves the audience thirsting for more every upcoming episode, so that they can learn the true intents of each character. And, why they desire the Grail so badly. These essential traits of Fate Zero characters are made to appeal to worldwide audiences, and are elevating at times \\n\\n\r\nOn another note, the season two of fate zero definitely involves more action than last season. Yet at times, this series still explores some dramas of all proportionals in depth, while being consistent in the flow of its overall plot. Thus, the tension the 2nd season creates a heavier, more intense atmosphere than what someone would usually be used to, partially due to the graphics involved in making this series.\u00a0\\n\\n\r\nSince I brought it up, I must talk about it. The graphics and music in fate zero needs to be pinpointed to an Oscar award soon or there's no hope for future anime franchises. The graphics in fate zero definitely exist as one of the best out there. The artistic aspects not only illuminate the detailed/general setting very well but seems to depict each character's personality as well. Ever since I've seen fate zero, there hasn't been any other series (with a few exceptions) that I have considered a 10/10\u00a0when judging its artistic qualities. The music in this series is also nicely executed in fluency with the sound acting and special effects. Most of which raises the level of fierceness in a specific action scene or just makes the actual animation showing on the screen more engaging.\\n\\n\r\nAlthough it would be cool to participate in the Holy Grail war and grant myself a wish, a possible dilemma could result in having to hand over my family, job, and all other responsibilities. So on second thought, I'd rather just be a spectator. And that's exactly what fate zero gives us the opportunity to do, and in the most appealing and qualified graphics possible. That's why, although it's not a perfect anime, the series proves itself to be considered well executed and deserving of all the attention it's getting. All in all, though it really saddens me that the Fate Zero series has finally concluded on a fixed, amiss note, it's very likely the deftly devious creator Urobuchi may provide us with a better and more ideal series sooner or later.",

            "content": "This review considers the anime adaptation of Fate Zero (F/Z) Season 2 entirely on its own merit.\r\nTL;DR version: The hotly-anticipated second half of F/Z is disappointing in the sense that it leaves the viewer with more questions than answers with a rushed ending.  It is especially frustrating when the first half took meticulous care in covering all the nooks and crannies of the Fate universe.  On the plus side, the visuals are excellent and the choreography of some of the action and battles is outstanding.\r\nWhich brings us to to the critical flaw, the *execution* of the story.  The carefully crafted build-up inthe first season starts falling apart, as the series switches its focus to action and bodycount.  This change of focus and direction just fails to engage the kind of viewer who wants to know the \"why\" it happened, on top of the \"what\".\\n\\n\r\n\"But they were simply constricted by the number of slots they had on TV.\"\\n\\n\r\nThose with bright minds will around it properly.  Producers need to know which aspects of the story to prioritize.  Steins;Gate for example picked and chose material carefully from the Visual Novel and the result was excellent.  The flow and pacing was consistent, despite the amount of material that was not included.  This was not the case for F/Z season 2 where the producers made two big errors in pacing.\\n\\n\r\nThe first error goes back to season 1.  I really enjoyed the loli-Rin episode and it was fitting, due to Rin being such an important character in the Fate universe.\\n\\n\r\n\"But they needed a cliffhanger for the start of season 2, which is why they used lol-Rin as a filler.\"\\n\\n\r\nEnding an arc at the final episode of a sub-season and having a clean-slate start for season 2 is also just fine, especially if it improves the overall product.\\n\\n\r\nThe second error is the producers' sadistic minds going for big, family kills on Mother and Father's Day respectively, thus affecting the pacing of the story.  This is especially so in the middle of the season where 2 episodes are devoted to a flashback.  The pacing of the flashback was extremely slow and given the amount of content that needed covering at the end it is questionable whether 2 whole episodes were needed.\\n\\n\r\nThese decisions therefore cost around one and a half episodes, a valuable amount of time which needed to be saved to wrap up the series.  Instead, we get an ending which happened, \"because it happened\".  In hindsight, the loli-Rin episode would make a perfect bonus episode in a Blu-Ray set.\\n\\n\r\nCombined with the pacing issues, the quality of dialogue takes a dive as depth and characterization is replaced by shallow, shounen-esque lines.  This is disastrous because F/Z started off as a \"badass\" anime with depth and sophistication.  During the latter part of season 2, the show becomes badass, for the sake of being badass.  This really affects the characters because instead of developing them and forging a connection with the viewer, they merely become tools of destruction.  The connections that were forged in season 1 gradually fade as our characters just drop like dead flies, in a large bodycount, with rushed death epilogues that gives the question \"Was that it, after everything?\"\\n\\n\r\nTo top it all off, what was mind-boggling was Sakura's last line in the series.  It shows a totally different character to the Sakura we knew prior, and what we know from F/Stay Night.  Instead of going for consistency, the producers had gone for the tragic route for the sake of it.\\n\\n\r\nThis discrepancy across the seasons confuses how F/Z wants to be identified.  A sophisticated series (Death Note's first arc) combined with some slick action in the first season, or simply a show to showcase \"baddass\" (Hellsing Ultimate, Black Lagoon).\\n\\n\r\nThe art and CGI were very good throughout, with the right amount of detailing on the characters.  I also failed to notice any deformities, inconsistencies and incorrect placing of facial features throughout the season.  The animation was also fluid, with rendered CGI being used the bulk of the battles to good effect.  Everything that meets the eye of the viewer was done extremely beautifully.  This was backed by good, convincing sounds effects of metal clanging against metal during battle.\\n\\n\r\nThe music is an odd one due to Kajiura Yuki abandoning her usual, dominant style for BGM and making it a passive one for F/Z.  There was no techno and dramatic opera.  Instead, a classical style was used which identified itself with the ancient times of the servants, and the use of ancient mythological magic.  The opposite would be the more \"techy\" weaponry used by present-day people in Mai-Hime, with Kajiura Yuki using her trademark style there.  Unfortunately, the passive style means the plot and depth of the story needs to be strong in order for the viewer to be engaged - which as discussed earlier was not to be.  This links directly to the overall enjoyment of the series, which took a dive as a result.  The final nail in the coffin for enjoyment was the awkwardly paced finale.  The placement of actual content felt \"off\", especially when we were abruptly fed with the idealized wishes of some of the characters.  The dialogue which was meant to provide closure was also unsatisfying, with \"explanations\" actually being descriptive, rather than being explanations.\\n\\n\r\nF/Z has been a series that has been extremely interesting from the outset.  The extremely high production values is an instant draw, with extremely well animated OP/EDs that set and fit the mood and content of the story perfectly.  People who loved the first season's depth and pacing will unfortunately be disappointed.  The \"less talk, more action\" crowd will surely love the excitement suspense from *most* of the battles that were extremely well choreographed.  Unfortunately, the flip-flopping of F/Z's genre identity mean both crowds will unlikely be completely satisfied.",

            "content": "For the love of Holy Grail, if you have never watched anything from Fate/Stay Night franchise under any circumstances DO NOT watch Fate/Zero first! I'll hold an even stronger statement - don't watch it at all. I've just made this grievous mistake, because I had listened to advice given on youtube by several self-proclaimed anime gurus. And now how pissed I am! Sheesh! Firstly, it ruined much of the experience of Fate/Stay Night. And secondly, I strongly believe Fate/Zero is crap.\r\nI am aware this warning and review will probably fall on deaf ears, because of the way unfavorable reviews are treated by MAL users. ButI'll be content if I am able to save at least one soul from the disaster this anime is. \\n\\n\r\nLet me elaborate on my background - when I started to watch this series I knew only that Fate/Zero is prequel, supposedly much superior to its successor. And that it was written by the same guy who wrote Madoka Magica. I knew nothing about characters, basic premises and how this story ends. So it will be easier for creators to impress me, immerse me in their fantastical world and make me care for what happens. Or so I thought. Oh boy, how I was wrong.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime has massive flaws in its narrative. And it is not even the main story itself - it's of course ridiculous but it would eventually do. However the pacing of it is atrocious. The anime disguises itself as interesting in its first 5 episodes, there is some introduction, then almost right off the bat we hop into a duel between characters. And then... then almost nothing happens for the next 8 episodes. The entire first season should be actually called Fate/Zero Action or, equally accurately, Fate/All Talk. Ok, maybe I'm somewhat unfair, there were some skirmishes, though utterly insignificant. Then around second half something indeed started to happen - but it was still interrupted by All Talk episodes (I still get shivers remembering an episode containing conversation between certain priest and Gilgamesh). And, don't you have wrong impression - I'm not some action junkie. I was annoyed simply because discussion and character development episodes were just criminally uninteresting. It's beyond describable how one doesn't care for virtually any of the characters in this story. Given how much time the anime spends on exposing their back-stories and motivations it is fail of epic proportions. It is partially because this whole exposition is handled very poorly. After the whole show I still don't understand e. g. what is the actual cause of intense rivalry between main protagonist and main antagonist. Additionally narrative is prone to raise some significantly-looking issue (or character) and then to drop it for long or even forever. And there is this most important issue, which even one character in the story (Gilgamesh I suppose) noticed - how abysmally dull are most of these characters' motivations. It makes you automatically yawn at the mere sight of them. There are some events which simulate plot twists, but there are all so boring and the reasons for them so contrived they are not something to speak of. In other words - it's impossible for a viewer to care if character X treacherously kills character Y, when you couldn't care less neither for X nor for Y. \\n\\n\r\nOk, so maybe at least fight scenes redeem the show? No! Most of them are astonishingly anti-climactic, including two of the three final ones. BTW not only fights are anti-climactic. So is the ending, concluded thanks to idiotic Diabolus ex Machina. \\n\\n\r\nAnd after having watched this I saw juvenile shounen-like Fate/Stay Night anime series from 2006. It's almost beyond my belief that MAL users (as of early 2015) rate Fate/Zero so well and F/SN so badly. Yes, 2006 anime is cliched. Its stereotypical high-school protagonist whines too much. There is a generic romance plot. Hell, the whole coming-of-mage plot is ultra generic. And yes, it's more light-hearted. But still I liked it more, even though I was spoiled by prequel. The creators of F/Zero failed to notice that it's not enough to be \"darker and edgier\" to have a good plot and interesting characters. The art part of the anime is only thing in which creators didn't fail. But it annoys me that more, when I watch skillfully sound-tracked, brilliantly animated boring fights between inexplicably boring characters.\\n\\n\r\n[warning: bad puns ahead] I strongly advice all of you to stay in the dark night when it comes to Fate/Zero. Although the story deserves clear zero points, animation, sound and the fact that Saber is always fully-clothed wind up the total score to 4/10 (or 3/10 for first season alone). \\n\\n\r\nAlternatively: It's possible that my above rant is the result of watching this show prematurely. The writers of the series from my perspective put emphasis on such weird places of their story that it makes plausible that I'm seriously missing something. Conclusion, once again, DO NOT WATCH IT BEFORE FATE/STAY NIGHT.",

            "content": "Fate Zero 2nd Season review:\r\nTime for a trivia! Are you someone who enjoys watching violence mixed in with action, fantasy, and thriller themes? Are you someone who loves listening to a powerful soundtrack with stunning visuals that will keep you at your seat? Ever wanted to watch a prequel based off a popular series and carving for more? Well luckily, you've probably hit a jack pot because ufotable once again pulls off a spectacular masterpiece out of their hats and present the latest Fate/Zero part 2 that is sure to give viewers a satisfaction like they've never ever experienced before.\r\nIn today's anime world, prequels arenot too rare. Most of them serves as an introduction and perhaps a trailer of the the true series will unraval for our die hard viewers. Fate Zero Second Season presents the continuation of the battle involving the Holy Grail, the ultimate reward for eternal glory. As more lives are sacrificed, secrets are unraveled. The actors and their directors play their parts in this Holy Grail war and it's only king for him or herself. There is no allies, no true allegiances, no God, no Angels. There is one thing and that is V for Victory. But really, what is victory? Glory? The true throne of king? Or is it perhaps something that unattainable even for a God?\\n\\n\r\nFirst and foremost, this series has gained international attention and is considered to be one of the most popular series. Anyone who has ever set their eyes and played a VN game before would and should know the products of Type-Moon, with FSN being one of its most successful products. I mean, just look at the ratings and the discussion threads. There is daily topics being posted, various discussions regarding the franchise of both seasons, and users comparing who their favorite/strongest servants are from the series.\\n\\n\r\nBut is this series really worth the hype? Is this series really being worthy to on the Top #10 of MAL along with some other known titles? The fact that one of them is also an anime is based off a VN in the top 10 also makes us wonder. Well...let's put our heads together and  see if the series does live up to the hype.\\n\\n\r\n[ ----- Story ----- ]\\n\r\nAs the second half of this highly popular series, the story picks up from part 1 that began in October of Fate/Zero. The producers and director already assumed that you've watched part 1 and have some decent knowledge of the F/Z franchise. If you're scratching your head right now and wondering why there's an overgrown Cthulhu Mythos being in the begnning of the series, then STOP. Watch part 1 first and come back because you're missing out all! And I'm certain Archer is not amused. \\n\\n\r\nThere is already tension between Saber and Lancer, one you can cut through with an Excalibur. But from where it leaves off, the monster Caster unleashes hell and tries to take the servants deep down with it. It does seem a bit lackluster in that the first part of the series had none of the character die off but death has gotten impatient. In this part 2 of the prequel, death has come back from holiday and is here to claim some of its prize. And by prize, I do mean lives, the lives of the servants and their beloved masters. \\n\\n\r\nIndeed, the bodies starts to pile up like pouring rice but there's also more than that. For our main protagonist, an calculating, cold, and indifferent man, we take a trip down memory lane and see some of the dark past that made him the man that he has become. While most series take brief flashbacks and illustrates them shorthand, this prequel depicts a more detailed style involving Kiritsugu \"Magus Killer, Kerry\" Emiya. His dark past is revealed in details that leaves the viewers at the edge of their seats and with his interactions with his \u201cmother\u201d figure (ironically also on Mother's Day) and childhood friend. It is dark, it is brutal, and it is your face. The past that Kiritsugu had to go through and made him the man that he is today is understandable after watching this prequel. Hell, if I had to go through all that, I'd never be the same person again. The man's got guts and he's live up to the name as the Kiritsugu \"Magus Killer, Kerry\" Emiya.\\n\\n\r\nAnd of course, Saber once again plays her role as the King of Arturia from the Fate/Stay Night franchadise in this sequel. As a proud king, she respects the values of others and is determined to help those in need. For instance, when she realizes that her dear friend and partner Irisviel von Einzbern has been kidnapped by another proud king, she stops nothing but to save her even if it's at the cost of the Holy Grail war or perhaps her own life. That my friends, is true valor and style of a proud king.\\n\\n\r\nWhile at times the dialogue are as heavy as part 1 of the prequel, the usage of the words defines the intelligence and insight that gives the viewers a reason to continuously watch the show. A clear example is the speeches between Rider and Waver and Archer's often egotistic yet artistically way of getting his words out. \\n\\n\r\nAs for the Holy Grail War, the rules are still there. There is only one winner and it's winner takes all. Fate/Zero although has similar ties with Fate/Stay Night has some major differences in that it becomes a much more matures style. Even the masters themselves becomes calculating and insightful in their moves. Their servants play their roles accordingly and some have even developed their own solitude of being the one and true king. \\n\\n\r\nAs Elizabeth I once said:\\n\\n\r\n\u201cTo be a king and wear a crown is a thing more glorious to them that see it than it is pleasant to them that bear it.\u201d\\n\\n\r\n[ ----- Characters ------ ]\\n\r\nSeven servants, seven masters, and more than seven wonders to watch this part 2 of the prequel. The characters of the series is definitely another reason to continuously enjoy more of Type-Moon's works.\\n\\n\r\nHonestly, there are so many great character interactions between the servants and the masters. It can be digusting and horrid like the relationship of psychopathic killer Ryunosuke and Caster. It can be the estranged relationship between Lancer and his master, Kayneth El-Melloi Archibald. It can be the indifferent relationship between our star protagonist Kiritsugu and Saber. It can also be the powerful bond between Alexander the Great (Rider) and his master, Waver. \\n\\n\r\nThere is of course also our cynical man who is discovering his purpose in life, the manipulating, calculating, and stoic man Kirei Kotomine. It is entertaining and strange to watch Archer/Gilgamesh observe his various actions and moments throughout the story. Of course, his later obsession with Saber enters another tone that can be defined as peculiar at its finest. \\n\\n\r\nRegardless though, every one of the character is independent and unique to themselves in personalities, goals, ambitions, and style. Even the characters in Kiritsugu's flashback are quite interesting to take insight into. His interactions with them and the bond, whether it's a childhood crush on his friend, or a more motherly/son relationship with his mentor, brings out his character in its most defined form. \\n\\n\r\nWhile not all the characters are perfect (Kariya for instance), they clearly play their various roles well and does what they do best: kicking ass and delivering F/Z style entertaininment.\\n\\n\r\n[ ------ Art/Animation ------]\\n\r\nEver been to an art museum before? Ever seen a professional artist's work and made you go \u201cthat is just...beautiful\u201d? Well, Fate/Zero part 2 like its prequel will give you the impression of a life time. (at least in terms of anime visuals)\\n\\n\r\nIn technical terms of production, Fate/Zero Season II is what defines the ultimate form of what Type-Moon's production visuals has came to be. This series just looks bloody amazing and that's not an overstatement. No, it is more than that. The visuals are stunningly beautiful and ufotable deserves the prize of the Holy Grail for producing such powerful animation. Not surprisingly, ufotable already has achieved its praise after producing the Garden of Sinners franchise. The dark edges of the series and the spectacular battle scenes between Beserker/Saber are just a few examples. While it does occasionally employ the usage of CGI, it makes it up into the style of the battle sequences between the servants/masters that almost makes us forget this flaw. But more than that, art defines this series that shows once again that ufotable is able to produce series that lives up to the fan's expectations. And of course, I'm not disappoint.\\n\\n\r\n[ ------ Soundtrack/Music ------]\\n\r\nSoundtrack plays a powerful role in any series and in this part 2 of the prequel, it is there once again to bring out the style of Fate/Zero.\\n\\n\r\nThe OP song is changed this time but retains its well coordinated choreography and orchestra. The theme \"to the beginning\" by Kalafina is a strong piece of work that brings out the strength and power of the servants and the brutality of the Holy Grail War. And once again, the sequences are shown with appearances of the servants and their respective masters. Additionally, it also shows sequences of a child Kiritugu in the beginning to his manhood that shows how much he has changed from what he once was, to what he has become, the proud master of Saber.\\n\\n\r\nYuki Kaijura is once again involved with producing the soundtrack and themes of the series. And once again, she delivers and executes what the fans expected: a glorious soundtrack worthy of a Holy Grail prize. The soundtrack of Fate/Zero part 2 is just as stunningly impressive as part 1. If in fact for anything reason at all to watch this series beyond the characters, beyond the storyline, or beyond the epic speeches of Rider or the stunning visuals is the soundtrack. With the ultra talented Yuki Kajiura in charge, expect the unexpected as your ears will be pleased like never, ever before.\\n\\n\r\n[ ------ Enjoyment ------- ]\\n\r\nStory, music, animation, characters. What else more is there to say? Well, for another reason to continuously watch the F/Z franchise is the spectacular battle sequences. \\n\\n\r\nWhile the first season lacked some of the expected battle scenes, season 2 of Fate/Zero brings out battle and bloodshed like never before. Even in the very beginning, the aerial dogfight between Archer and Berserker makes a strong impression while Caster takes the ground belong and battles against the remaining servants. More impressively is the final duel between the two proud kings Archer and Rider in the later episodes. With egos that a single king of the seat can be sat on, these two characters battles it out in one of the most artistically and defined ways in the series that truly shows why they are worthy of their masters. \\n\\n\r\nWell, Fate/Zero Season 2 is not perfect. In fact, there is in my opinion no series that can be perfect. It does seem that some of the sequences are a bit forced and a a few key scenes cut that left the viewers go \u201cwhy wasn't that there?\u201d Additionally, the dialogue continues to stay a bit intact and lengthy at times particularly with Archer's egoistic speeches and Kirei's indifferent style of talking. Despite these minor flaws though, this part 2/season 2 of the series captured my attention as much as season 1. The intelligence of the story, the well executed dialogues, the captivating characters, the stunning visuals, the beautiful soundtrack, the quality of the work, and the enjoyable of the battle sequences are just seven reasons to watch this series. \\n\\n\r\nSeven servants, seven masters, and seven reasons to watch this part 2. What else can you want more?\\n\\n\r\nWell, I guess maybe some of the more detailed explanations for the die hard fans when the BD version debuts. Still though, this series has been crafted and engineered beyond its minor flaws. It is in my book one of the best series there was, one of the best there is, and one of the best there ever will be.\\n\\n",

            "content": "This review analyzes the entirety of Fate/Zero, not secluded to one seasoned release. Firstly, Fate/Zero is a prequel to the stories of \"Fate/stay night\". \"Fate/stay night\" originated as a visual novel and later was released as an anime in 2006. That anime, while it does succeed in some ways to its own right, is something that should be taken as its own entity as it can be considered a failure of being an accurate adaptation of the source material. The visual novel itself comprised of three stories that all are tied to this one. Two of those are currently being brought up in anime-form bythe same studio that's behind this, but do not see that order as how things should be viewed. The story of Fate/Zero was made after that of \"Fate/stay night\" in a novel. Because of that, even just touching Fate/Zero before trying \"Fate/stay night\" will result in spoiling some of the reveals of those stories. However, do not assume that you must enjoy \"Fate/stay night\" to also enjoy Fate/Zero. Fate/Zero can work on its own, and some people who didn't like the sequel may even enjoy it still. Fate/Zero has been held in high regards, and it will certainly be hard for anyone to not understand even a bit of why that is. Before continuing into my analyzation though, there should also be an unusual warning in terms of the gore present. The gore Fate/Zero carries is something that would either get it heavily censored or banned from premiering on public television in the Western world. I don't want to spoil, but if you are even slightly wary of fictional gore, Fate/Zero should be something to be heavily reconsidered.\\n\\n\r\nI haven't seen many anime that have been released recently and, upon first experiencing Fate/Zero in its visual glory, I was surprised even beyond the praise I've heard. I've seen a fair amount of \"Kara no Kyoukai\" by the studio Ufotable, and seeing what that accomplished on its own honestly didn't meet my expectations of all of the great things I've heard of the studio. When I moved from that to this, however, things became very clear. It was shocking at the level of budget and detail that this series went into, almost something that could make it on Western television. The first moments didn't even contain action yet still convinced me greatly. The subtlety along with the impactful color-scheme and the massive background detail created a perfect picture along with the never-ceasing and phenomenal animation. While it isn't fair to compare this to the \"Fate/stay night\" of 2006 due to its different age and vastly different budget, another aspect that blew me away was the CGI and how it was handled. The CGI of \"FSN2006\" has become a joke to most when comparing it to what we receive in Fate/Zero. That definitely isn't a fair comparison though as the CGI in Fate/Zero is clearly the best I've seen in anime - not only in the believable detail and fluid movements, but in the ability to treat it properly aside the hand-drawn art. The hand-drawn animation itself also doesn't impress too much less when taking into account its almost unnecessary attention to detail at many times along with the spectacular proportion-work and quality control. There is no filler frames that are drawn half-heatedly, and everything feels properly treated visually.\\n\\n\r\nThat visual treatment does not end with the technicality of the visuals, however, but is also greatly accompanied by a moderately risky director. Fate/Zero does not introduce itself as many other anime would, taking on a mature and subtle style that is very similar to what could be seen in the best of Western television. It could be reasoned that the anime expects many of the viewers to have already been introduced to the universe, but either way what has been brought here is something that tells only what is necessary and handles everything else boldly. The director does good work at his own job in making moments impactful and intriguing, but is even also aided by a great script-writer. The entire atmosphere feels mature and has a sensation of giving the viewer respect in being able to work out more basic understandings on their own. Fate/Zero expects the viewer to be able to listen closely to all conversations as there is no baseless and filler conversation, but developing moments to either the characters or the situation's complication. In that way Fate/Zero feels very unique to most anime and also feels greatly refreshing.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound also lacks nothing in budget and carries powerful depth throughout. The atmosphere is treated flawlessly with cinema levels of sound work in most moments, to the sound effects of basically everything. The music is also well done and it works for the setting while also giving a very cinematic feeling to the whole series. That doesn't make the music perfect though, the surprising reason being it was done by Yuki Kaijura. Many people adore her work, and I do as-well, but as an obvious result of her being used too often in recent times, her originality has already begun to deflate. I was actually surprised after seeing the phenomenal visual quality that the people in-charge chose her for handling the soundtrack. It feels like a safe way out since not many would really dislike her work, but from it being so common in other popular works, it has become somewhat stale to me. I even let out a sigh when I heard one of the tracks playing as a near duplicate of a track that was in \"Sword Art Online\" (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0qkgJsPKJP4#t=11), but take note that this came out before \"Sword Art Online\". Also, the music doesn't exactly fit in the most effective way at times, it sometimes failing to properly build anticipation at some crucial moments for it. However, there are surely moments where it does work and there are some genuinely great tracks. It also does work better when newer instruments are used than Kaijura usually uses. There is also a spectacular singer for the trademark electronic vocals she uses, and one of the songs in particular which I haven't found the name has some impressive singing on her part. The soundtrack is great and many people will likely love it, but when experiencing a number of her works, the connections and lack of proper uniqueness are too hard not to notice. It should also be noted that the openings and endings aren't too unique or memorable. They carry the somewhat typical strong female voice that sings in a style fit for an anime opening length, and that voice kind-of serves as the leading instrument. Out of them all, I found the last opening to be the most fitting and the last ending to also be somewhat enjoyable. The English dub is much less troubling, though, as the voices are something around a Bebop level of fantastic. Brief comparisons even leads me to believe that the English dub has surpassed the Japanese in this case. There are two slight flukes with it however (and try to realize how good this must be to nitpick so much) as the sound-quality of the English recording broke the silence in some moments where it really shouldn't have, along with there being several moments of passionate yelling that weren't handled in quite the way it usually would sound in anime. I also didn't experience the subbing work at all, but the script-work of the dubbing team did a flawless job with only one small fluke as-well in one moment that is so tiny that most will likely not even notice (I checked the official subs and they also carried that mistake).\\n\\n\r\nThe dialogue was smart and impressed me when I wasn't expecting too much from a fantasy show. All Fate/Zero had to do to keep people entertained was follow through with its premise, as a battle royal is something that many people seem to be craving, but it instead chooses to go a little beyond that in both character interaction and where it leads. The character interaction is, without a doubt, the most entertaining aspect of the series. I found myself to be engaged with just about every character's personality, and it all felt understood and reasoned with. Most of these characters are also flawed in one way or another, and the show effectively portrays much of that flawed nature with an air of intellect. While some of the realizations could be not too surprising if one were to think about it on their own for a while, or if they've already thunk it up, it was just something unexpected and unnecessary to have been done. It shows that the story isn't afraid of getting psychological, and I would say Fate/Zero is one of the best psychological stories I've seen in anime. Not everything is dramatic though, and those interactions also don't fail to be continually interesting. The series does give a lot of its time to developing the characters as-well, and handles a fairly large cast impressively for a 24-episode anime, but it isn't all perfect.\\n\\n\r\nFor starters, the premise for the Fate universe was always an interesting take on the battle royal concept. It adds an extra layer of depth to the idea by making the combatants have to work with another individual to gain their success in the battle. It also allows mechanics for interactions between those two partnered combatants to end up in many different ways following a secure guideline. Respectfully, that guideline is not challenged with the story Fate/Zero has to it, and everything works well enough through what is explained. The setting and story allows for a light merging of genres and time-periods as well that create some amount of discovery and mystery to understanding some of it for every combatant. The character and their designs are, again, wonderful. They each carry unique motives and ideals that are uncovered, questioned, and bring about a blurring of who is right and wrong. All of this works splendidly, but not to the extent of its potential. At the end of the game, a mistake that the director took was treating this series clearly as the prequel it is. Sure Fate/Zero is a prequel to \"Fate/stay night\" and it was even made afterwards, but when the entirety of Fate/Zero also makes some explanations for itself to make itself also work on its own, to end in such a way disregards the present story at hand in turn of the coming one. One shouldn't exactly fear for a cliffhanger as the ending of Fate/Zero is clear, but how it is handled doesn't treat it with the proper respect it needed to feel effective. That mistake also shows in the pacing near the end in the last couple of episodes. Things begin to move at too fast of a pace, skimming past necessary character development and interactions to make everything from before feel properly concluded. In that regard, Fate/Zero doesn't succeed in being as impactful or effective as it could've. With such smart writing prior, it felt more as a shame to see it all left behind for a quick turn of events. Even so, those prior events are still moments that exist in this anime and that shouldn't go unnoticed.\\n\\n\r\nFate/Zero carries enough for mostly anyone to enjoy at least one fundament of it. The visuals are top-notch, surpassing the looks of numerous anime movies, and the sound as a whole doesn't stand too far behind. Both options of voiced languages are great, and no-one stands for a loss. Those who respect subtlety and some witty comments will also likely find Fate/Zero enjoyable, while some others who see Fate/Zero in a more strange light because of that might not enjoy the slow moments it has. There are moments where development is brought in stories that don't directly progress the main story, and some may also not find that way of handling things enjoyable. However, when taking consideration of the length, I felt that it was an effective way of handling the characters and it also stayed very relevant during and after they were completed. Before finishing this series I was convinced to dive into the visual novel, and I did. I read for some time and, while I never did get too far into the story, how this storytelling is handled in comparison to \"Fate/stay night\" will lead me to no doubts that there will be people who side with either one. I, personally, side with Fate/Zero when considering the canon story-lines as it felt more natural and unique in its style. Fate/Zero also feels more vibrant and alive with less things one would commonly find in a visual novel. Make one thing known though, I haven't read the Fate/Zero novel. For all I know, the novel could tell the story in what I consider an inferior way when considering the anime. If that was the case, some Ufotable treatment may very well fix the moderate difference between Fate/Zero's style and \"Fate/stay night's\". Many of these characters are memorable, and I have no doubts that I will appreciate a lot of this story even in the future. Although, I could see the soundtrack falling from memory as it failed to make itself truly unique and special. In that way, \"FSN2006\" did win in making the musical style more different and effective in connecting with the series it holds. If I listened to a track from Fate/Zero blindfolded, I couldn't tell you honestly if it was from \"Madoka Magica\", \"Sword Art Online\", or any other soundtrack Yuki Kaijura has done (\".hack//Sign\" being another). Watch Fate/Zero, but understand the potential spoilers for beginning in the Fate franchise with it. Most would recommend starting with the visual novel, and I would recommend getting a feel for the universe somehow before getting into Zero. Watching \"Fate/stay night\" 2006 might be an effective way of quickly doing that without spoiling too much, but they're definitely two different creatures. There is some exposition here though, and remember that delving into \"Fate/stay night\" will also in-turn spoil the ending of Fate/Zero (but it is intended to be that way, not that it has to).",

            "content": "THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS.\r\nFate/Zero answers the problem with prequels.  How do you make something compelling when the audience already knows how it will all end?  Embrace the darkness and finality. \r\nA word of warning, the rest of my review will assume that the reader has already watched Fate/stay night and the first season of Fate/Zero.  If you have not, then the best thing you can do is stop now and return after you have seen those chapters in the Fate series.  \r\nFans of Fate/stay night already know that things will end badly for the main characters, after all this is necessaryin order for the setup of what the audience has already seen.  But unlike the most infamous of dark prequels, Star Wars 1-3, Fate/Zero has the guts to take that challenge and turn it into an opportunity. \\n\\n\r\nThe protagonist of Fate/Zero, Kiritsugu Emiya, is presented as a cypher in the first and most of the second seasons.  He is shown as absolutely ruthless, a fitting characteristic for the ultimate victor of this round of the Grail war.  At the same time, Kiritsugu is oddly compelling since he is the badass of the series -- taking down opponents with guile and strategy rather than the nobleness of his character unlike his successor in Fate/stay night.  \\n\\n\r\nLike another cypher in the famous TV series Breaking Bad, Gustavo Fring, the writers eventually take the viewer into the backstory of Kiritsugu with a monster payoff.  In an effort to avoid giving out spoilers, lets just say that after you watch the two finest episodes in the franchise, you will not look at the main character in the same light. \\n\\n\r\nSimilarly, the primary antagonist in the series, Kirei Kotomine, is also fleshed out nicely.  Although his motivations are more unclear then Kiritsugu, the viewer is rewarded with actions that flesh out his \"big bad\" credentials nicely.  \\n\\n\r\nCombined with fan favorite Servants Saber and newcomer Alexander the Great, an excellent supporting cast, and none of the boring filler-subplots that plagued Fate/stay night to its detriment, Fate/Zero provides an excellent story for the anime fan craving more than the typical shounen of broody adolescents grappling with inner doubt and awesome powers.  Destined to become a classic piece of anime storytelling Fate/Zero provides the viewer with excellent animation, sound, story, and characters.  10 out of 10, for those that like their anime dark and action packed!",

            "content": "Tyrannical power and glory are two things that define a sovereign ruler with an iron fist. Many mythologies have been interpreted to fit these notions into their stories to create a different understanding of them. A series that has been long regarded with acclaim by many die-hard enthusiasts is the Fate series. Starting as a visual novel series, it eventually shifted its form to animation with Fate Stay Night to mediocre reception from fans. It was then that a man named Gen Urobuchi decided to make a prequel light novel series called Fate Zero, and thus a legendary phenomenon was born in animation form fouryears later.\\n\\n\r\nThough this is the 2nd season of Fate Zero that I\u2019m basing this off of after finishing it, it would be more tempting to critique it as a whole. Because it is merely a continuation of the series and nothing else. Do not feel disingenuous if you feel like you want to read the visual novels before going into it, or suffer through the horrible Fate Stay Night adaptation. Fate Zero is, by and large, its breed and it wouldn\u2019t necessarily warrant a lesser experience had one not experienced any of them. Going through the entire series to the inevitable conclusion, Fate Zero manages to pull off a strong emphasis on technical beauty and wonder; while it falls short on some levels.\\n\\n\r\nI remember when I first got introduced to the Fate series and couldn\u2019t make heads or tails on what it was about from looking at the plot summaries. Once you dive into it and it starts to explain in great detail about the ongoing war over the holy grail, it does make it more coherent, even if you haven\u2019t followed the visual novel to death. Fate Zero does a great job of explaining it from the first episode alone, which has a running time of an hour. Following the footsteps of several of our protagonists and their goal of achieving the holy grail, they are all given pretty substantial screen-time for us to empathize with their competitive drive against one another.\\n\\n\r\nNow this screen-time I mention comes from the pacing this show has with not only how we can identify with the characters, but also to showcase their unique fighting abilities. I\u2019ll give a lot of credit to the animation studio, ufotable, and bringing out their big guns into the production of Fate Zero. It also helps that they worked on a massive budget that they were able to work around, which is a rarity in this day and age. Their attention to detail in the color schemes, especially in the darker moments, is very astounding to look at. It\u2019s one of those instances where it is mandatory to watch this is the full high definition to get involved with the creative detail of the art and animation.\\n\\n\r\nWith animation comes to action scenes, which Fate Zero is not afraid to show, with true greatness. What is quite refreshing to see in an action scene is for characters to plan out their attack moves instead of just swinging their weapon until the enemy dies. Even so, it doesn\u2019t needlessly pad out the fighting scenes with constant dialogue in-between, at least most of the time. Visually exciting and epic in its ultimate nature, these will not disappoint your average action show fan.\\n\\n\r\nEpic storytelling has its roots in having a large cast of characters in it. The characters in Fate Zero are, unfortunately, hit or miss depending on the progression we get from the development they have. This includes the relationship we have with the human characters and the servants that protect them. The best example is the relationship between Rider and Waver based on the level of chemistry these two have whenever they are bickering between one another. However, the rest didn\u2019t speak to me as having great chemistry, only because their only purpose is to advance the plot and nothing else. With Rider and Waver, it felt like I was rooting for these people more to win the war because they bolster so many lighthearted moments that make them appealing to watch.\\n\\n\r\nSaber gets a lot of praise as being a strong character, and I do understand that from the perspective that she knows how to protect herself and her master. Other than that, she doesn\u2019t carry the show all on her own because of her bland personality, and all she does is tries to get her honor back, which feels so superficial. This is the case for most of the characters, except for Kiritsugu Emiya, in Fate Zero. Style with no substance is what I would generalize my point as for them. It could very well be the problem with adaptations that don\u2019t expand enough for people like me who hadn\u2019t read the visual novel, but that is hardly an excuse if you think about it.\\n\\n\r\nThe worst instance I can give for this is the characters Caster and Ryunosuke. Both of them are pure psychopathic murderers that take pleasure in killing children just for the fun of it and nothing else. That should not entail that I take these characters as bad only on the premise that it's completely unnerving or unsettling. What troubles me is that that\u2019s all that we get out of Caster and Ryunosuke. We don\u2019t know what makes Ryunosuke turn into the person that he is, and most of the blame can be put on him since Caster is already based on a real-life serial killer. They are there to emit shock value into the mix to make the show somehow more \u201cadult\u201d when it doesn\u2019t matter in the slightest, not that this was the first for Gen Urobuchi.\\n\\n\r\nNevertheless, the character development kicks into high gear when we explore Kiritsugu Emiya\u2019s troubled past. The only negative aspect to this is that the two episodes that chronicle his past felt unnecessary in the main broadcast and would\u2019ve fit better in a separate OVA. What makes it less of criticism is that it is done very well in delving into the psyche of Emiya and shows how different he has changed throughout his life. So in retrospective, my reactions to Fate Zero\u2019s attempt in constructing a narrative and character story are mixed, but they are far from terrible.\\n\\n\r\nPeople wanted to see the epic conclusion to Fate Zero, and they sure got it in good proficiency. Even though I felt the ending was a little anti-climatic to some degree, with some sequences feeling a bit rushed, they give at least some closure to the character arcs. Has this officially made me into a Fate series fan? No, not even close. But there are a lot of things to appreciate about Fate Zero and its attention for spectacle over substance. Sometimes that can work, and Fate Zero rests on that throne as one of the more enjoyable experiences. Now does this mean that Type-Moon will not stop milking their franchise and driving it into the ground in the future? You bet your ass they will.\\n\\n\r\nGrade: B\\n",

Fate/Zero has simple plot hiding behind rhetoric and long-winded speeches from rooftops just to look cool. The dialogue was uninspired at best and often times so dull that I felt that I could walk away to make a cup of coffee and come back knowing I missed absolutely nothing that contributed to the story.\r\nThe biggest problem is that none of the characters other than Waver and Rider were ever really developed, leavingno emotional impact on their deaths. In fact, when it came to a lot of the seemingly important events, I just didn't care. Pointless monologues and exposition, bad pacing (nothing happened in S1, while characters were dropping like flies in the second season), irrelevant story arcs, topped with shallow characters; Fate Zero puts a good effort at feigning depth and puts forth some interesting ideas, but is ultimately a train wreck of poor narrative with a plot that lacks any real complexity or substance.",

            "content": "\"Those who desire to rise as high as our human condition allows, must renounce intellectual pride, the omnipotence of clear thinking, belief in the absolute power of logic.\" -Alexis Carrel\r\nOverview: \r\nFate/Zero takes place on the stage of Fuyuki, a city based on modern day Kobe. Here, seven masters chosen by the Holy Grail- an omnipotent wish granting device- gather to do battle. The seven human masters, each from disparate backgrounds, experiences, and creeds assemble, and are granted a \"servant\", or the spirit of a fallen hero from ages past given physical form. With these servants, the masters wage a proxy war in the formof a battle royale: the last master/servant duo standing is the winner, as declared by the Holy Church. The pair is then granted a wish: that which they desire most. \\n\\n\\n\r\nAnimation and Art: 10\\n\\n\r\nHere's where Fate/Zero and ufotable really earned their keep. It\u2019s plain to see that this show had an enormous budget: a good percentage of it was spent in the animation department, and spent well. The 3D animation is an absolute gold standard for how modern day AAA anime titles can and SHOULD look. It\u2019s absolutely incredible to behold when the 3D CGI meshes with the hand drawn animation onscreen well, and importantly: doesn\u2019t look incredibly fake. For me, having 3D CGI onscreen can break the immersion, because it\u2019s typically a very jarring difference between the background and hand drawn, but not so in this case. \\n\r\nI thoroughly enjoyed seeing the vehicles and grotesque monsters that were given life through 3D animation here. I've had a sour taste for 3D for a long time, even in shows with high production values like Ghost in the Shell SAC, by the esteemed Production IG. A few standout moments include Saber's motorcycle, the F-14 jet commandeered by Berserker, and the fire and water effects that looked as realistic as I've ever seen in animation.\\n\r\nVibrant, dynamic lighting and shadow play along with particle effects rendered by the 3D beautifully. Swirling lights, darks, and brilliant displays of energy color the typically dark palettes of the show. Much of it takes place at night, and it really allows the lighting and brightness of the clashes to be cast against the darkness and shadows, further encapsulating the duality that the show embodies.\\n\\n\r\nSound and Voice Acting: 8\\n\\n\r\nFate/Zero has a rather sizable cast, with seven masters, servants and various supporting characters, but Aniplex didn't skimp on talent at all.\\n\r\nHeading up the group are Matthew Mercer as Kiritsugu Emiya and Crispin Freeman as Kirei Kotomine. Bridget Hoffman gives a great performance as Irisviel, and Liam O'Brien appears, nearly reprising his Vincent Law role as Kariya Matou. The ubiquitous Michelle Ruff and Johnny Yong Bosch also appear in supporting roles.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack by Yuki Kajiura (SAO, usw.) is comprised of many emotional orchestral themes, high tension string sections, and appropriately energetic or heartfelt compositions that mesh well with the action along with the more subdued moments. \\n\\n\\n\r\nStory: 9\\n\\n\r\nThis production takes a rather unusual route in the means of its storytelling. Rather than having a limited perspective of a single main character, or that of a typical protagonist/antagonist setup, Fate/Zero chooses an ensemble route that is at the same time very intricate, but not difficult to follow. Each master and each servant have their own motives and means at their disposal with which to defeat the others and capture the Grail. At no point in the series is it truly clear who's been dealt the best hand in terms of the abilities and willingness of the servant in conjunction with the cunning and ambition of the master. Again, this duality forms the spine of Fate: an individualistic war waged with individual goals, but having to unite as a team with another for a singular purpose. \\n\r\nThe Grail's choosing of the combatants is indiscriminate: there are kids with no business being involved in a war; in which the possibility they may lose their life is very real. There are others chosen who've spent their entire lives preparing for the Holy Grail War, ones who care nothing about the Holy Grail or even being involved with the war, ones who fight for the salvation of loved ones, and still others who fight for purely selfish motives- seeking the power of the omnipotent wish granter as a means of personal gain, or mutually assured destruction. \\n\r\nThis varied group of entrants further serves the dualistic ideal of Fate/Zero, a collection of persons from dissimilar motive and thought unified, yet vying against each other on this quest for the Grail. The prideful, the greedy, the lustful, the wrathful, the gluttonous for power, the envious, and the slothful are equally applicable to this story: 7 masters, 7 servants, each is clearly represented by (at least one of) the Seven Deadly Sins in line with their character traits and history.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 9\\n\\n\r\nEach character has their own morals (or lack thereof) which typically sit juxtaposed to their partner, who serve as a foil in many cases. Again, the duality dynamic that is signature to this series is put to excellent use here in reflecting the strict moral code adherence of the Saber, Arthuria against the postmodernist, win-at-all-costs mentality of her master, Kiritsugu. \\n\\n\r\nArthuria is defined early on as a strong willed woman, whose sole character traits consist of the aforementioned strict adherence to a code of honor, of loyalty, defined by her as chivalry, which is in line with her time period and legends. She has an extreme worldview, believing that even the battlefield should be a place where honor comes first. \\n\\n\r\nPart of what makes Arthuria unique is her unwillingness to change, no matter what she's faced with. It's both a noble, and ultimately futile goal. I make point of the speech Kiritsugu gives her in episode 16: \\n\\n\r\n---\"to Saber: No. Honor glory, there's no point in talking to a killer who extols such things. A knight cannot save the world. Knights call certain methods of killing 'good' and 'evil', acting as if there were some sacred nobility to the battlefield. Such illusions created by heroes throughout history have led countless young men to their deaths, all for the sake of this glory and honor they extol. \"\\n\r\nSaber: \"Even the taking of a life in battle as a human being must have ideals, otherwise every war would bring the fires of hell to this world.\"\\n\r\n\"There you have it, Iri(sviel), our heroic spirit considers a battlefield to be worse than hell... what a joke. A battlefield IS hell itself. There is no hope to be found on it, there is nothing but unspeakable despair. Just a soulless cry we call victory: paid for by the pain of the defeated, but humanity has never recognized this truth. This is because in every era, a dazzling hero has blinded the people with their legends, and kept them from seeing the evil of bloodshed they bring. True human nature has not advanced a step beyond the stone age!\"---\\n\\n\r\nArthuria cannot accept that the truth of battle is relative... what did it matter if someone was killed by unfair/unjust/unrighteous means VS in \"honorable\" battle? It's both her strength and her greatest hypocrisy, this eternal attachment to the values of Knight's Honor she embodies. \\n\\n\\n\r\nThe second relationship worth exploring here is that of Kirei Kotomine and well... himself. Kirei, as a clergyman and inquisitor (church assassin) despite the appearance of a fulfilled life, is an extreme nihilist. His duality is that he has no reason to seek the Grail, yet he wishes that the Grail would reveal to him the meaning of his own life. Brutal, bitter, and cunning, Kirei is a formidable adversary for anyone, but takes a particular interest in Kiritsugu Emiya. This interest being the first passion of his empty, desolate life. \\n\r\nThe man who fights for everything, yet can have nothing, and the man who fight for nothing, yet seeks everything: the crux of Fate/Zero.\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9\\n\\n\r\nWhat drew me into Fate/Zero wasn't the enormous expo dump at the beginning of the series. (Seriously, a 45 minute long dialogue about the intricacies of the Grail War and the underlying corruption, betrayal, and cutthroatness of the families who continually struggle to possess the Grail is a bit gratuitous)\\n\r\nNo, what drew me into this show was the tone. I harp about tonal inconsistency a lot, but this time the shoe is on the other foot. Type-Moon's story here is very well fleshed out, and maintains a dark, mature tone throughout. It's never tarnished by silly, untimely comedic moments or thoroughly unnecessary fanservice. Fate/Zero takes themes such as loss, despair, and tragedy and pairs them with idealism, of hope and honor, and justice creating an amalgam of duality that is really impactful. \\n\\n\r\nAnother bit I thoroughly enjoyed was the inclusion of historical figures as the Grail heroes. I was familiar with about half of them before, by my eyes were opened to some other historical and legendary figures, which I took to reading about immediately after learning their identities. \\n\r\nGilgamesh, King Arthur, Alexander the Great, and the Berserker were known to me upon their appearance, and their character roles fell deftly in line with how they're portrayed in legend and in actual history. \\n\\n\r\nThe Assassin was modeled after Hassan-i Sabbah, a 3rd Crusade Age Muslim missionary who founded a league of assassins (popularized by a video game series a few people might have heard of). \\n\r\nThe Caster, Gilles de Rais (or Bluebeard), was a mid-Dark Age companion to Joan of Arc, and also a notorious serial killer, particularly of children. He is also noted to have been interested in the occult, particularly summoning. \\n\r\nFinally, Diarmuid Ua Duibhne, a legendary hero of 2nd-4th century Irish origin. He was said to have used two spears, one red, and a yellow one which inflicted wounds that did not heal (likely poison).\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9\\n\\n\r\nOverall a very well done show. I was impressed by the lack of pulled punches: this show is very brutal at times, and doesn't shy away from some heavy themes and visuals a lesser show would have avoided or cut. Fate/Zero isn't for the faint of heart, there are some reviling moments, emotionally rending tragedy, and spots of tear inducing exuberance. Fate/Zero wasn't afraid to take some risks, and they paid off excellently. \\n\r\nI've thoroughly enjoyed the matureness of this show: it could have easily been an overblown shonen action show, but subtlety prevailed, and took a more nuanced route. A philosopher and a warrior, a scholar and an athlete- Fate/Zero is doing it all.\\n\\n\\n\r\ntl;dr\\n\\n\r\n+ Excellent, diverse cast, all interesting in their own right\\n\r\n+ The absolute best 3D animation there's ever been\\n\r\n+ Fantastic, nuanced plot and dialogue to match\\n\\n\r\n+/- Ensemble storytelling can be off putting to some\\n\r\n+/- Slow, exposition filled first half\\n\\n\r\n- Some characters are irritating, perhaps written to be so\\n\\n\\n\r\nRecommend?\\n\r\nYes, absolutely. Great dialogue, better characters, and excellent execution and follow through with a very mature, action based plot.\\n\\n\r\n\"But the tale of humanity will never come to a close, for the struggle of survival is a war without end, and war \u2013 war never changes.\"",

The story often highlights how the goals of the Masters often conflict with the values of the Servants, even the arrogant Gilgamesh. In Fate Stay Night the Servants have a close relationship with their Master's whereas in Fate Zero there is almost contempt.\r\nThe best episode so far hasSaber, Rider and Gilgamesh discussing and disagreeing about what good kingship means.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation goes to the next level with for some shots you wonder if they have slipped in real film.\\n\\n\r\nThe only downside is that the opening and closing songs and titles sequences are not as good as season one.\\n\\n\r\nYou know what is going to happen in the end but who cares.",

            "content": "Fate/Zero Review:\r\nThis is a review for both seasons 1 and 2\r\nAfter seeing the high praise given to this anime from Gigguk and Arkada on Youtube, I decided to give Fate/Zero a go. After watching it, I now completely understand why this show has such positive reception as it was an enthralling ride with hardly any real \"negative\" points to it.\r\nStory 9/10:\r\nFate/Zero takes place 10 years before the events of Fate/StayNight in the middle of what is known as one of the \"Holy Grail Wars.\" I had not seen F/SN before watching this anime, but thanks to the info dump of a first episode I wasquickly put up to speed. The \"Holy Grail Wars\" are battles fought in secret a few times each century. The war is between 7 historical or mythological legends that are brought into present time by their \"masters\" (AKA random people chosen by the grail). The goal is for one of the pairs to ultimately defeat all of the other servants and/or their masters and be the last one remaining. Once this happens, the Holy Grail should appear and grant the victor any wish they desire. Unlike F/SN, Fate/Zero has a VERY serious undertone. As a comparison, I like to akin these two series to the Batman franchise where Fate/Zero is more like the Dark Knight saga, while Fate/StayNight is more like the old tv series with Adam West. Both are good in their own ways, but one is clearly more serious than the other. One of the things that makes Fate/Zero special is that it doesn't rush to pick out a specific main character or good guy, and instead follows the stories of all 7 pairs with an unbiased view point. This let's the viewer really learn about what all the characters are like and their objectives in the war. The different viewpoints really eliminates a lot of the space for plot holes or lack of reasoning, and every event in the story seems to have a purpose. It really is rare to see a show with a concept as ambitious as this, that actually pulls through with barely any plotholes or errors in its writing. Although the ending was somewhat of a cliffhanger, it is also brilliantly done and gave me countless goosebumps as the results of everything that happened were revealed. The story in Fate/Zero was one to remember. Epic is truly the only way to describe it, and its execution was truly in a class of its own.\\n\\n\r\nArt 10/10:\\n\r\nHands down the best art I have seen in an anime series. Watching the show, it really feels like they had a very high budget for the animations. Movements are extremely fluid, and thus the fight scenes are spectacular. Facial expressions, character design, settings, lighting, everything was superb and I really haven't seen an anime nail the animation aspect quite this well. I really don't have anything else to say besides that the art was spectacular.\\n\\n\r\nSound 8/10 (edit: 9):\\n\r\nMuch like everything else in this show, the music was similar to that of a blockbuster movie. Heavy orchestra in the background accompanied by opera singing when battle scenes get intense. The quality of the music was brilliant. However, the show did lack \"memorable\" or \"catchy\" songs that you would like to see in an anime. But like I said, the show in general felt more like a long blockbuster movie than an average anime so the music fit the show perfectly. I found both of the OPs very well suited for the show and quite catchy compared to the background music, although the EDs were less spectacular. As far as voice acting is concerned, I found the Japanese voice actors all portrayed their characters brilliantly, particularly in Rider's case. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter 9/10:\\n\r\nThe fact that the show doesn't focus on a single character really strengthens all of the characters in the show. Due to the changing view points, you really get to see what each character is like, what their motives are, and just their personality in general. The first season really introduces you to the characters and the setting, while the second develops these characters and shifts the story into full swing. None of these characters are your stereotypical archetypes, and some of them really shine. All of the servants are extremely interesting, and Rider is one of the most charismatic characters I've seen in a while. For a good portion of the show, you really don't know who the good guys are and who the bad guys are. You may find yourself rooting for one character only to realize he is evil, or hating one only to realize he is very noble. Towards the end, it becomes pretty evident who the main character is due to an emotional and brilliant two episode arc on his past. My only qualm about the characters is that, because of the divided focus, I wasn't able to fully emotionally invest in any of them. And even though I did definitely feel for the characters and their struggles, I wasn't really completely devastated when bad things happened to them like I would be in an anime like Clannad, Steins;Gate, or Code Geass, where they really focused on one character's development. However, I feel that it would have been pretty much impossible to have the vast depth in the cast if they focused on one character, and the show probably would have been much worse. In short, this show has one of the most, if not THE most, fully fleshed out set of characters that I have ever seen, and just barely misses the 10 mark due to it not quite letting me attach to the characters as much as I wanted to.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 8/10:\\n\r\nFate/Zero was thrilling to watch. The first season was kind of slow as it was really just setting the stage for the madness in the second season, but was fun none the less. Like I said, watching Fate/Zero is similar to watching a movie like the Dark Knight. Everything felt real and all the decisions that characters made felt important, and this sense of seriousness and realism made the show truly a joy to watch. One of my complaints is once again, that I could not emotionally connect with any of the events as much as I have in other shows. It's weird because I know this show is almost flawless, but something about it just wasn't up to par with those on my top 3 anime from an enjoyment standpoint. I really can't put my finger on why I didn't enjoy this show more, but I did enjoy it more than the vast majority of the other shows I have seen so it still gets an 8.\\n\\n\r\nRecommendation:\\n\r\nI can't imagine someone hating this show due to it's unbelievable execution, but it is currently ridiculously expensive to buy so I can only recommend you stream it (available on Crunchyroll). \\n\r\nStream it! +.1\\n\\n\r\nOverall 9.1/10:\\n\r\nFate/Zero is probably the most technically sound anime I have ever seen. There are no huge errors to complain about with it due to the high production value in its art and sound, and nearly flawless writing in its story. If you found Fate/StayNight to be unimpressive, but are curious about this show, do not hesitate to watch Fate/Zero because it is truly on another level from most other anime. Fate/Zero is a grade A anime that is a must watch for all.\\n\\n\r\nThe Verdict:\\n\r\nAn anime that absolutely deserves its praise and an epic tale at its finest.\\n\\n\r\nPros:\\n\r\n+ Cinema quality art and sound\\n\r\n+ Remarkably deep cast of characters\\n\r\n+ Story is an epic to remember\\n\r\n+ Brilliant writing left little room for plot holes or inconsistencies\\n\\n\r\nCons (These cons are more \"reasons why this isn't quite a 9\" than cons, because it really didn't have distinct \"negative\" aspects or \"mistakes\"):\\n\r\n- Lacked a top tier emotional impact\\n\r\n- For ME it missed that \"oomph\" factor that would push it into my favorites\\n\\n\r\nIf you liked Fate/Zero, watch...\\n\r\nDurarara!\\n\r\nSimilar storytelling where they don't really zone into a main character til more towards the end, allowing all the characters to grow equally and the story to be viewed from all angles.\\n\r\nFate/Stay Night (by Ufotable):\\n\r\nWait until the ufotable version of Fate/Stay Night comes out because the original Fate/Stay Night, while pretty good, felt A LOT different than Fate/Zero and really wasn't on the same level.\\n\\n\r\n9.1/10 - Brilliant\\n",

            "content": "If I had to be fair to the greatness of this serie, I had to drop the rate of all the animes I've rated until now by 2 points or more.\r\nFirst, this is not an action show, though it have tons of beatifully done action sequences. This is the story of a man who believed in his ideals and fought for them, but no just him. This is the story of 7 Servants (counting the 1st season) and their troubled, weird, incredible masters, in a way that you can't really choose a villain or a good guy, but you choose the way of thinking thatbetter suits your own.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is amazing, well done, beautiful. If I have to choose a word to describe it it would be...Type-Moon-ish. Lots of drama, psychological issues and depressive as well as funny moments. The story is well paced and gets you sitting in the edge of the chair, waiting for the next episode.\\n\r\nThe art, probably the best part of the show. Imagine a show that, when the quality drops, it comes from \"godly awesome\" to \"oh my god, this film is sooo good\". Not too much to say for people like us, that like to watch animes, but a word for the directors: WATCH THIS to learn how to make a good animation!\\n\r\nThe sound is mine personal opinion. It's amazing, and has Kalafina! I love this group and almost anything they do, so I'm kind of biased to talk about sound.\\n\r\nThe character of the show is well done, so much to like and dislike (based on your mind alone, I've choose my villain and hero, what about you?), they made a protagonist along the 2nd half of the show, but there still some people that think that this one or that one are better, just the individual opinion, that's what make this show so good.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment? Silly question my friend, by the rates I think you can tell if I liked it. This show is in the top 3 of 11 out of 10 people. This is probably the best show I've ever seen in my life.\\n\r\nSorry for the long post, but I had to make this review and try to show all my passion fot it. I hope I did. \\n",

            "content": "Hello everybody Shawn aka TheKazeTrigger here and welcome to my first MVM Entertainment anime review project.\r\nFor the first anime I will be reviewing is Fate/Zero.\r\nNow I have mixed opinions of the Fate franchise because while my thoughts on Unlimited Blade Works by Ufotable are mixed and I personally hate the Deen adaptions of Fate Stay Night. I thought my love with the Fate franchise will die out because of this.\r\nDid my love for Fate Zero die out or it's still going strong as ever?\r\nWell let's find out.\r\nStory.\r\nThe story of Fate Zero revolves on something call the Holy Grail War.\r\nA Holy Grail war is a warbetween seven servants as well as seven masters (Magic Users) who through the power of the grail summon heroic spirits who are the people of legend, history fame, or myth. They all battle which each other to claim ownership of the grail which is said to be able to grant the owner any wish.\\n\r\nThe story of Fate/Zero is really good in my opinion because unlike it's squeal Fate Stay Night which was inconsistent Fate Zero stay consistent from start to finish containing some of the best story direction I have ever seen.\\n\r\nFate Zero is the story of the 4th Holy Grail War 10 years pearl to the events of the 5th Holy Grail War in Fate Stay Night what really separates this war for that is the player themselves.\\n\r\nUnlike in Fate Stay Night where the war focus on entirely on the main protagonist here it's much bigger more diverse, and more mature and\\n\r\nThis is war done right!\\n\r\nAliens and betrayals, well planned and thought out strategies and deposition, well directed fight sequences, really relatable characters movable tons, world building that is fully fleshed out.\\n\r\nNot to mention I really adore the use of heavy dialogue and exposition as seen in episode 1 and for that reason episode 1 of Fate Zero is one of my favourite first anime episodes in anime and it's in my top 30 favourite anime episodes.\\n\r\nIn short Fate Zero has it all!\\n\r\nThe story is original, externally well written, unpredictable, hardly and black and whites and it will keep you edge to your seat when watching,\\n\r\nThe ending of Fate/Zero is great and it really fits with the theme of Fate/Zero.\\n\r\nI won't spoil the ending here because this ending is a experience that you should watch for your own viewing.\\n\r\nFate/Zero also does an amazing job exploring its themes such as prides, responsibilities of being a king, sacrifices, tragicly, survival and future.\\n\r\nI honestly cannot  find any flaws with the story because the execution of the story is just wonderful.\\n\r\n10/10\\n\r\nCharacters.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters of Fate/Zero are very mature and well written compare to the cast of Fate Stay Night where they immature as hell and they usually fall into generic character tropes.\\n\r\nThe thing that makes the character cast so special is that doesn't really have a main character least for a while.\\n\r\nAll of the masters and servants are explored in depth and we get to see the war through each of their perspectives. Completely different to its squeal series Fate Stay Night.\\n\r\nNot to mention the character interactions with each other because unlike in Fate Stay Night where the character interactions are stiff, forced and sometimes have no substance at all Fate Zero character interactions are believable, relatable and have a great impact of the outcome of the 4th Holy Grail War.\\n\r\nMy favourite characters in Fate/Zero is Rider and Waver because not only they are great entrainment character but they are well written from start to finish. Not to mention Rider and Waver are some of the best duo I have ever seen in anime.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nThis is all thanks to Gen Urobuchi. If you guys don't know about him Gen Urobuchi is the series composition of Madoka Magica, Psycho Pass, Gargantia on the Verdurous Planet and Fate/Zero.\\n\r\nGen Urobuchi has a habit of writing ideologies rather than characters and fate zero is the prime example of that. Most of the character aren't really fleshed out or well developed  They serve  more as physical embodiment of the individual ideals rather than actual people. The focus is on the character interactions and not necessarily the characters themselves. All of the characters in Fate/Zero are really complex characters making for a nice change from the typically Black and White approach as well generic that squeal series Fate Stay Night suffers from.\\n\r\nAlso by the time you figure out who's good or evil chances are they already been killed in the battlefield. \\n\r\nBesides that this character cast is nothing but amazing.\\n\r\n9.5/10\\n\\n\r\nArt/Animation.\\n\\n\r\nVisually Fate/Zero is one of the best looking anime I have ever seen. Ufotable absolutely really did a wonderful job here as the animation is some of the best animation I have ever seen for a TV series.\\n\r\nThe action sequences are unbelievably beautiful  and the choreography is just perfect.\\n\r\nAlso unpopular option I think the art/animation here is better than Fate Stay Night UBW (TV) while the fights in UBW (TV) are greatly animated most of slice of life bits were kinda too bright and sometimes the character designs are not properly drawn and feel like plastic at times if you look very closely on the character during those scenes.\\n\r\nThe character deigns in Fate/Zero well thought out, very well drawn, animated and consistent from start to finish.\\n\r\nI personally have no complaints with the art and animation.\\n\r\n11/10 I definitely broke the scale for this one.\\n\\n\r\nSound.\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is just epic.\\n\r\nThis is Yuki Kajiura at her best because she utilises those badass choir vocals endlessly to give nearly every track that feel of epicness.\\n\r\nFate/Zero has 2 opening and ending themes and they are all just epic and very catchy in they own way.\\n\\n\r\nNow for dub or sub.\\n\r\nTo be honest go for what you want because both the Japanese and English voice actors really did a great job with they performance making each role more satisfying  to the audience.\\n\r\nI would say go for both sub and dub for this one.\\n\r\n10/10\\n\\n\r\nFinal Thoughts.\\n\\n\r\nFate/Zero is one of the best animes I have ever seen from 2010s era of anime and its one of the most entering rides I have ever been on.\\n\r\nThe story was addicting and seeing the characters ideologies clash with each other was absolute thrill. The animation is absolutely beautiful and the soundtrack is fitting epic from start to finish.\\n\r\nAlso both sub and dub are flawless in my eyes.\\n\r\nIt accomplishes something a few prequels have and far surpassing its sequel Fate Stay Night. At time point I mention why is Fate/Zero is better than Fate Stay Night and that because it is. Fate Zero manages to fix everything that I hated about Fate Stay Night and in my opinion Fate/Zero makes any anime adaptation of Fate Stay Night look like a joke by comparison.\\n\r\nFate/Zero is one of the best animes I have ever seen and its now in my top 15 favourites anime of all time.\\n\r\nFate Zero is a modern classic that should not be missed by anyone.\\n\r\nI give Fate/Zero Both Seasons a 10/10 ( Masterpiece of war)\\n\\n\r\nFate/Zero is available from MVM Entertainment in the UK and they currently licensed both seasons on DVD and Blu Ray.\\n\\n\r\nIf you can Fate/Zero is a must buy on Blu Ray for the better viewing experience.\\n\r\nThe DVD version of Fate/Zero is surprisingly good compare to the blurry looking Fate/Stay Night UBW (TV) on DVD which was a ugly experience in my opinion  \\n\\n\\n\r\nAnime recommendations.\\n\r\nFullmetal alchemist Brotherhood\\n\r\nCode Geass\\n\r\nKara no Kyoukai\\n\r\nHellsing Ultimate.\\n\r\nGinga Eiyuu Densetsu (Legend of the Galactic Heroes)\\n\r\nAnyway this was Shawn aka TheKazeTrigger and I will see you guys next time.\\n\\n\r\nNext anime review for my MVM Entertainment anime review project will be The Familiar of Zero S1 or Bakemonogatari.",

            "content": "***This review is comprehensive of both seasons of Fate/Zero.***\r\nIf your one and only wish could be granted, how far would you tread down the path colored in blood and embroidered with thorns?\r\nWelcome to Fate/Zero, an epic that explores the efforts of seven masters and their servants (heroic spirits such as King Arthur) to obtain the Holy Grail, a device said to be capable of granting any one wish.\r\nSorely disappointed by its sequel, Fate/Stay Night, I, like many others before me, was initially reluctant to watch the show. Turned off by the ridiculously pure ideals of Emiya Shirou and defiled by the constant repetition of thephrase, \"People die when they are killed\", Fate/Zero's appeal to me was minimal.\\n\\n\r\nOh, how wrong was I.\\n\\n\r\nFate/Zero is a delightfully dark deviation from its sequel and excels in almost every single category. Before I delve into the meat of this review, allow me to comment on the more technical aspects of the series.\\n\\n\r\nArtistically speaking, Fate/Zero is incredibly accomplished. The animation quality is outstanding, and falters not even for a second. Ufotable executes everything from simple character movements to brilliantly drawn action sequences in excruciating detail, using dark color palettes that encapsulate the mysterious and somber ambience of the show.\\n\\n\r\nAs expected of Yuki Kajiura, the mastermind behind several other breathtaking soundtracks, the music is top-notch. Incorporating choir and orchestra into many of her works, Yuki Kajiura creates tracks that fit each scene more or less faultlessly. Each track adds to the complexity of every mystery, complements the sorrow of every tragedy, and intensifies the scale of every battle.\\n\\n\r\nAll openings and endings add a little something special to the series, providing insight on some aspects of the show that, for the sake of spoilers, you must discover yourself.\\n\\n\r\nBetween its two seasons, Fate/Zero pulls a stunt that is both admirable from both a production and (in the long term) an entertainment standpoint. Fate/Zero discontinued its story for a rather short period of three months although there was no reason to do so in regards to the plot; that is to say, there was no point in delaying the continuation of such a fluid story. Although it may have vexed some viewers, this method of production ensured that the overall quality of Fate/Zero would be consistent \u2014 a wise decision, that, in the long run, provided even greater entertainment for the audience.\\n\\n\r\nThe most desirable decision would have been to release all episodes at a later point in time, but I would rather have Ufotable do this than rush production and suffer a drop in quality.\\n\\n\r\nNow, to discuss the story, characters, and my personal enjoyment...and if you thought there was a lot to read so far, then you've got another thing coming.\\n\\n\r\nThe story of Fate/Zero is carefully constructed so that there are no missing or remaining pieces of the puzzle upon completion. The concept of battling for an omnipotent wish granting device is not completely novel, but Fate/Zero's execution of the idea is, dare I say it, the best I've ever seen.\\n\\n\r\nAs the story is told from a variety of perspectives, it is not as easy to discern who the winner will be by the end of it all, unlike most survival game anime that may as well have just told us the victor in the first ten minutes of the first episode. As certain characters begin to get more development, the predetermined victor becomes more and more evident, but this is just a regrettably unavoidable aspect of such works. Regardless, the plot does well to attribute sufficient screen time to each tag team of master and servant to uphold the feeling of uncertainty in its audience.\\n\\n\r\nThe plot is also made unpredictable due to its dark nature. With such a dreary atmosphere (bolstered by the aforementioned animation style and music), we as viewers are never quite sure of how things will turn out. Things may seem to be heading in a somewhat predictable direction when suddenly, the plot throws a wrench in its works to turn the tables around.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, unlike in some series (such as Mirai Nikki), this technique not employed excessively, allowing the story to be told coherently and without much disruption.\\n\\n\r\nLikewise, the characters are also equally as amazing as the plot. It is rare to see an anime with such a large cast give each and every one of its numerous characters enough development to evoke strong emotion in the case that something should occur.\\n\\n\r\nWhy do viewers feel triumphant at the defeat of a villain? Why do they feel sad at the death of a hero?\\n\\n\r\nThe answer is empathy.\\n\\n\r\nIt is specifically because of proper character development that viewers form a collective and (nearly) unanimous feeling toward a specific character. It's the difference between being told a random person has died and being told that the closest person to you has passed away in a tragic accident. Without a comprehensive understanding of character motivations and their circumstances, it is impossible to FEEL anything for them; in other words emotional connections between characters and viewers are of vital importance.\\n\\n\r\nFate/Zero accomplishes this feat beautifully. There is enough development on each character that the viewers can understand each and every one of them (although some less than others). Everything the characters say or do has a purpose and reinforces the former \"emotional connections\" to the extent that every event holds at least some significance or meaning.\\n\\n\r\nTo very quickly summarize these thoughts, Fate/Zero has characters that make you actually CARE about what happens to them, whether that be in a positive or negative light.\\n\\n\r\nThe complexity and relatively unpredictable nature of the plot and the high amount of development that occurs in every single character is what makes Fate/Zero one of the masterpieces of anime, but it is for these exact same reasons that the series suffers. Simply put, these traits are double-edged swords.\\n\\n\r\nGoing back to the puzzle analogy, although there are no missing/leftover pieces, there are too many to begin with in the first place.\\n\\n\r\nHaving watched Fate/Stay Night prior to this, I had a full understanding of the concepts of the Holy Grail War. Since the protagonist, Emiya Shirou, was just as new to the Holy Grail War as the viewers were, the show eased its viewers into it. However, it is easy to see how newer members of the Fate franchise may have not had the time to wrap their minds around the basics of the plot before the exposition explodes into action.\\n\\n\r\nMoreover, the characters, and the heroic spirits in particular, are difficult to understand from time to time. Again, due to my interest in ancient folklore, I had a rather deep understanding of most servants and their incentives. It is exactly because the show tries too hard to give every character decent developments that it feels as if some characters were not done enough justice. Knowing the fates/stories of each and every one of the heroic spirits gave ten times more weight to every swing of their weapon and every word on their lips.\\n\\n\r\nNevertheless, not everyone may feel the same way \u2014 I still would have greatly enjoyed Fate/Zero even if I were not so informed on the pasts of the heroic spirits or on the Fate universe in general. These are merely things that, ideally, should have been done, but realistically, couldn't be done. It's completely unreasonable of me to expect that an anime accomplish so much in such a short period of time, and the truth is that Fate/Zero did an incredibly admirable job fleshing out such an enormous amount of substance in a mere 25 episodes.\\n\\n\r\nAlthough I enjoy a great variety of anime (from the pure and peaceful nature of Usagi Drop to the mindless action in Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann), I enjoy nothing more than dark, twisted, and thought-provoking series such as this.\\n\\n\r\nFate/Zero focuses largely on the idea of clashing ideologies, whether that be between two masters, two servants, or even a master and a servant. Do the ends justify the means? Is there defeat to be found victory, or must victory be absolute? Themes like these frequently appear in the world of Fate/Zero, each difficult to give a certain answer to.\\n\\n\r\nIn particular, the anime delves into the topic of the importance of chivalry and the definition of what it means be a king. How must one lead his or her nation? Is there honor and morals involved in killing others? Why is it that the code of chivalry must be tacitly upheld? Again, these are themes that may appear too foreign to some viewers and may even go unrecognized, but I spent a great deal of time contemplating my own responses to these questions, enjoying every minute and second of doing so.\\n\\n\r\nCONCLUSION:\\n\\n\r\nFate/Zero is a masterpiece \u2014 yes, a masterpiece. The animation and sound are arguably among the best in any anime, and the story and characters are complex yet adequately developed. Although the series could have benefitted even more by fleshing out more of its material and conveying its universe to potentially new viewers, it does all that it can in 25 episodes.\\n\\n\r\nThe reason I also endorse Fate/Zero as a \"masterpiece\", a word I don't like to throw around lightly, is that the show is just so incredibly well rounded. In almost every anime that I have watched so far (which isn't too many), there has always been at least one category in which the anime lacks. Be it story, character, art, sound, or my personal enjoyment, I could find little to no faults with any of these five categories. In fact, the anime is so balanced in everything that it accomplishes that it was only fair that I attribute the same amount of significance to every category in my final rating.\\n\\n\r\nSo, without further ado...\\n\\n\r\nSTORY (20%) \u2014 9.2/10\\n\r\nCHARACTERS (20%)  \u2014 9.2/10\\n\r\nANIMATION (20%) \u2014 9.8/10\\n\r\nSOUND (20%) \u2014 9.7/10\\n\r\nENJOYMENT (20%) \u2014 9.8/10\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL (100%) \u2014 9.5/10\\n\\n\r\nNow...\\n\\n\r\nBy the power of my Command Seal, I command thee, avid reader, to explore the magnificent universe of Fate/Zero!",

            "content": "This is mostly a review of the entirety of Fate/Zero rather than the second season in particular. I have not watched or read the Fate/Stay Night material before watching this. \r\nStory: 9\r\nWriting a prequel to an already well-established series has proven in many cases to be difficult to do (i.e. Star Wars) but Fate/Zero passes with flying colors. Even if you have seen Fate/Stay Night prior to watching this, it still provides many twists and turns that leave you guessing all the way up until the final episode, all the while seamlessly setting up the story for Fate/Stay Night. The dialogue is genuine and theways the characters interact with each other always make for great moments. The first few episodes are a bit of an information dump, but really help to explain the world you are immersing yourself in. Philosophically, it chronicles the eternal struggle of morality in the face of war that never becomes too preachy, but leaves you wondering what is right and wrong.  \\n\\n\r\nArt: 9\\n\r\nStaying consistent to the TYPE-MOON art style, it looks very nice in an updated setting. Although there is a rather consistent use of CGI, it does not take away from the action all too much. It does, however, enhance large scale attacks very nicely. The character designs, again, are the highlight as they are able to craft characters of unique traits and avoid making them appear hokey.     \\n\\n\r\nSound: 10\\n\r\nIn regards to the dub, I watched the English dub which I thought was executed very well. The voices matched the attitudes and statures of the characters and never once felt miscast.  Rider\u2019s voice in particular couldn\u2019t have been a better fit. Even the characters with somewhat deadpan personalities like Kiritsugu and Kirei are well acted and the subtleties of their emotions really shine through. The soundtrack is fantastic. Yuki Kajiura creates a very immersive and powerful score that has you on the edge of your seat during every battle. Also, the opening theme of the second season is one of the best anime openings I\u2019ve ever heard.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 10\\n\r\nThe character development in this anime is astounding and is easily the best part of the show. Rather than primarily focus on one main character, besides the two episodes of Kiritsugu backstory, the show really helps to flesh out each character\u2019s personality and their ambitions towards why they lust after the Holy Grail. Even if you don\u2019t particularly like certain characters, you still understand the reasons behind their actions and are interested to see how they act because of it.   \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10\\n\r\nI can\u2019t talk enough about how much I enjoyed this anime. I was captivated as soon as I finished the first episode. It was difficult for me not to pound out the whole show in a few days, which I have a bad knack of doing. Every character, good or bad, left an impression on me and were memorable no matter how large their role was. I will definitely be re-watching it to enjoy it again.   \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 10\\n\r\nA great anime that has awesome characters, a compelling story, and an intriguing philosophical battle to go alongside the well-choreographed fights. Definitely in my Top 10 Anime list. Great for both the casual and avid Anime fan. You can also enjoy it whether you've seen Fate/Stay Night or not. \\n",

            "content": "I am the bone of my prequels.\r\nEdge is my body, and dialogue is my blood.\r\nI have created over a thousand plotholes.\r\nKnown to elitists.\r\nBut not to you filthy casuals.\r\nHave withstood feels to create painful backstories.\r\nYet, those viewers only care about the fancy visuals.\r\nSo as I pray... UNLIMITED UROBUTCHER WORKS.\r\nFate/Zero 2nd! What a blast! Definitely a huge step up from its first season, Fate/Zero 2nd somewhat ditched the extremely slow motion pacing, and I mean somewhat because, it's the Fate franchise! The pacing will always be slow! Except in the last two episodes of course...\r\nThis season features much more action than the first season, as well asmuch more gripping and engaging drama! While it still holds the Fate franchise charm of taking forever to explain the simplest of situations, it does so much more interestingly than the first season, which totally makes up for it. There is still a lot of dialogue, but instead of info dumps and other boring conversations from before, this time you get people threatening to kill each other, people cursing each other, people explaining things that are actually interesting, and so much more! \\n\\n\r\nOf course, I can't really write a Fate franchise review without mentioning the PRETTY VISUALS! Due to their unlimited budget works, Ufotable has been named a god studio in terms of animation, and Fate/Zero has received the godlike animation style that this studio is now so famous for. In other words, no show can beat the Fate franchise in action scenes! And since Fate/Zero 2nd focuses more of its time on the action scenes, the breathtaking animation is highlighted even more! \\n\\n\r\nAnother thing that the Fate franchise is famous for is an amazing use of sound, and Fate/Zero is no exception. Not only is the OST either really beautiful or hype generating, the sound effects of the battles, the voice acting, all of it is on such a high level. Fate/Zero's budget isn't just limited to the art and animation.\\n\\n\r\nAnd of course, the characters. This is a huge reason why many believe Fate/Zero is so much better than Fate/Stay Night UBW. The characters going for the grail are all incredibly adept adults, with dark backstories and mature methods of obtaining their goals. Everyone's favorite character Saber kicked major amounts of ass, and her motorcycle skills are pretty sexy. TsundeRin's hairstyle is actually cool in Fate/Zero. Looks like Fate/Zero's budget also includes making badass characters.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Fate/Zero is one thrilling watch. So what if its an adaptation of a light novel, which is an adaptation of a porn game? It's an edgy survival game with tons of badass and gorey action, some borderline occult horror moments, and even some humor (since Rider is a character). \\n\\n\r\nTL;DR: \"Just because it's by Urobutcher, doesn't mean it's bad!\" - Shirou Emiya.",

I habitually don't like flashbacks which are always present in anime, but to be honest, it was very interresting here, thanks to the emotionnals scenes and how they show the things are very nice.\r\nThere are reversals situation we don't expect.\r\nThe sound is just great, it awakens ouradrenaline, it's exactly adapted at the scenes, mostly when it was dramatical. I can still feel my heartbeat.\\n\\n\r\nWhat about the characters... People's tastes are different, and some will focus on some of the other people will not like. It depend of your feeling, in my part it was Irisviel, she has a remarkable sense of duty and the chara design is just perfect.\\n\\n\r\nI really enjoy to watch this, really. Nowadays, stereotypes are everywhere, like virgin pervert and shy protagonist, for shonen.\\n\r\nWe can say that Fate/Zero is innovative where they don't hesitate to make reversal situation, as I like.\\n\\n\r\nThe final note is a 9, I will remember this anime for a long time. I won't say that it has changed my life but it make me think a lot. If you like action, fights, drama, romance; feel free to watch it, it's definitely worth.\\n\\n\r\nI finished my review, it was short, but I don't know how to express what I have seen. I'm going to repeat myself, but for someone like me who loves dramas, it made me feel a lot.

            "content": "*SPOILERS FOR BOTH SEASONS OF FATE/ZERO. ALSO, THIS REVIEW WILL BE RATHER LARGE, SO PLEASE BEAR WITH ME*\r\nWell, you made it this far. So far, no one died, but you know that things are about to get crazier. What do you do? Do you reflect on the past and reassure yourself? Do you betray your friend? Do you attempt to find a loophole in the war in order to get someone killed? Do you fight glorious battle to the death? Well, no matter what, chances are, you'll die a tragic and painful death, most likely having your ideals trampled in the process. Some of youwho don't get how this intro paragraph has just spoiled the ways most of the people here die, and are asking what the hell the point of this was? Well, if you're one of those people, let's find out, shall we?\\n\\n\r\nSTORY: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nCaster and Uuryu have made this crazy final stand that gets even some military passerbyes involved. Now, with that epic battle done, we have our first casualties of the war. Now, it's a downward spiral. If you came into the series thinking that this was about seeing who would win, then you'd be wrong. This whole this was a farce. In the end, it's about seeing who lives long enough to not see his or her ideals get trampled, and since the only two people who do that are Waver and Kirei, it would seem as if both have won, except that Kirei is the only one to have his entire team in tact. \\n\\n\r\nWe get two amazing back stories showing how Kiritsugu became the jaded mercenary he was, and get to see how his ideals burn gloriously, especially during the finale where that becomes just a bit more literal with the entire city of Futuki being burt to a crisp with the only survivor being the franchise protagonist, Shirou Emiya, who is adopted as his son. As for Waver, after Gilgamesh engages in an epic battle that allows Gilgamesh to show enough respect to actually show his trump card and speak in a non-narcissistic tone for once, Waver develops his own goal. Also, about those old people he brainwashed, they break free, but aren't mad since it turns out that he was a much better grandson than the real grandson. As for Lancer and his masters, their deaths were upset tingly unsatisfying and due to the masters being poor characters, the whole tragedy angle they went with didn't really pan out. Also, Lancer dies angry at everyone for deceiving him and not allowing him to fight an honorable battle. Kariya has it the worst though. After going practically berserk against everyone and slowly dying and being deceived by both Kirei and Zouken, he dies in front of his daughter, thinking that everything can go back to normal, only for her to criticize his for his tragic efforts. That moment pissed me off. As for Kirei, he nearly died, but out of everyone, he gets it the best, seeing as he had no wish, albeit, he lost a fight to Kiritsugu and can never understand why he fought, which was his only semblance of a goal. Tokiomi just gets betrayed and killed by Kirei, who also painfully kills Irisveil, achieving her destiny by turning it into the Holy Grail, but instead of making a wish, when Kiritsugu rejects its corrupted power, it ends up destroying Fuyuki.\\n\\n\r\nThe finale just made things rather unsatisfying since it has to set up for the Fate/Stay night series and all the possible routes, plus the fact that it is literally the ANTITHESIS to the concept of catharsis! That's when it becomes abundantly clear that it wasn't about an epic battle royale and seeing Kiritsugu and Saber overcome their differences for a climactic victory, but a tragedy. It may not be apt to say that this was about seeing how everything that season 1 built pays off or unfolds, but more apt to say that this was about seeing how exactly everyone fails! Everyone fails at some capacity. There is no true winner here. The ideals of many key players like Saber and Kiritsugu are trampled, when the city burns and Berserker reveals himself to be Lancelot aka Saber's most trusted knight respectively. Uuryu dies, but somehow feels solace in finally being able to see his own guts, and Caster realizes his mistake in his final seconds before being gloriously obliterated by Saber's badass sword, Excalibur, in one of the coolest scenes I'll ever get to see in an anime. Rider understands that the journey can count more than the destination, especially since he never gets to see it as he gets killed by Gilgamesh. The only surviving masters were Kiritsugu (who dies after the events of the series during the final scene), Kirei (who got nothing because he didn't want anything to begin with) and Waver (who loses his partner in battle but luckily has a new goal, making him he only one with a positive outcome). It's brutally nihilistic, and in many ways, a modern Greek Tragedy given what Kiritsugu in particular ends up doing throughout the events shown here, past and present.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS: 910\\n\\n\r\nKiritsugu gets even more reason to be as jaded as he is due to the beautifully done 2 part tragic backstory. His dad accidentally made a zombie apocalypse or Dead Apostle apocalypse (try explaining that one) as well as Kiritsugu's original love interest, Shirley, who sets up his whole wanting to be a hero thing, and becomes the first victim. He later loses his mother figure who picked him up and taught him the mercenary life. At the end, he realizes just how much his ideals have betrayed him, and poor guy really needs a hug. Too bad he's dead. He was amazing. Waver at least gets some good moments with BROSKANDAR and the old people, until BROSKANDAR dies to a temporarily respectful Gilgamesh, seeing as he's the only one who Gilgamesh considers to be worthy of his respect. Kariya Matou was a tragic man who grew insane due to his involvement in the war to save his niece and reunite the family, and dies as a result, with his efforts ridiculed. Everyone is basically the same, but this season fleshes them out and shows them at their most extreme, and this series does it beautifully, even if not everyone gets a decent outcome, and Lancer's masters were just meh overall. At least most of them got cool moments. Maiya and Irisveil die an emotional death, and Saber rides a freakin' motorcycle! To quote Uuryu, \"COOOOOOOOOOOLLLLL!!!!!!\" Well, this series did an excellent job with its characters, even if not all them got the ending they deserved. If you're wondering why this section is a bit short, it's because I already described their personalities in season 1 meaning I can only show off how far it takes them here, and the end results of these people have been covered in the story section so, yeah. \\n\\n\r\nART: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nUfotable is an animation legend, and the first season cemented this as such. This season invigorates us with even more action, allowing for some more epic battles, more cool camera tricks (like Kiritsugu v Kirei), some perfect scenery for battles such as in Saber v Berserker, a kickass dogfight between Gilgamesh and Berserker which looks amazing, and the Excalibur scene which is so beautiful that I literally tear up a bit every time. There is only the most minor of art slip ups in very few moments in an episode or two to hardly even hold it back. Even the CGI, of which there is plenty, is downright amazing, from Caster's mega Eldridge Abomination, to Gilgamesh's ship, the Vimana in its dogfight against Berserk when he possessed a brilliantly animated CGI military fighter jet. Also, while Fuyuki burning is tragic, it looks so majestic in how bleak and firery it is. Nothing looks bad, mediocre, or even just good. It all looks legendary, and this was made in 2012, and judging by the sequel route Ufotable chose to adapt first (UBW) it's clear that they've only just begun. \\n\\n\r\nSOUND: 9/10 \\n\\n\r\nOP 2, was done by Kalafina, and it is beautiful. The vocals are amazing, the atmosphere only compliment this OP perfectly, and this gets more beautiful the more you realize how this shows off Kiritsugu as a whole. The ED, just there. Yuki Kajiura is back at the helm, and most of the best tracks are here. \"This day and never again\" dogfight\" \"Fate to Zero\" and \"Sword of promised victory Fate/Zero version\" are all from this season, and are all amazing! Most other songs are good but these few really stand out. Also, the song that's used for the ending heme for he backstory episodes, titled \"Manten\" by Kalafina was just beautiful. Just listen for yourself if you have the time. The dub is as good as ever, but now given how the characters are at their most extreme because of how much their ideals mean to them more than ever, it's clear that more emotion was allowed to be put into display here, and it pays off brilliantly. I absolutely adore the moment in episode 24 as Saber yells for Kiritsugu to stop his command seal from making her destroy the tampered Holy Grail.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nThe backstory episodes, the Excalibur scene, and Iskandar v Gilgamesh are the biggest reasons as to why this show remains as one of my favorites. It wasn't perfect though. Episode 3 this season was kinda weak, and be finale wasn't really satisfying, but it was a stellar journey with incredible action and some rather great feels. It was certainly a lot of fun, and while there was a lot less philosophy this time around, there was a lot more tragic brilliance here, and I highly loved that as well.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL: 9/10    RAW SCORE: 94/100\\n\\n\r\nThis was an epic tragedy of a war that ended unspectacularly, but had an amazing and beautiful run throughout, and I can definitely attest to it deserving to be in MAL's top 50. This 2 season series is an astounding recommendation I'd give to anyone ready to see just how brutal an actually mature anime can get, as this was an impressive, albeit somewhat depressing ride. Plus, this is a great place to start if you wanna get into the Fate/ series as a whole, not just for chronology reasons, but because of how impressive this series is. It works as a Greek Tragedy, it works even better as a psychological piece about the true meaninglessness of each character's' struggles and ambitions and the advantages of embracing nihimism and not having a major goal, and it certainly works well as a brilliantly animated action series. Well, with all that said, I bid you adieu.",

            "content": "Alas, my part 2 remains unseen. Nyahaha. But well, focusing onto this wonderfully and fulfilling sequel, I'm having a loss of wording enough for me to write on a small piece of paper beside me.\r\nF/Z 2 or by most know as the conclusion, is another series that will take back a person of his past, whether it be filled with regrets or joy and will further pierce the fundamentals of what's the justification of killing.\r\nLet's get started already.\r\nStory, with an obvious sequel tag, the second season focuses on the much awaited conclusion but yet, another title who gave a lot of blasphemous wordings especially inthe first arc, I would certainly include my experiences of feeling goosebumps as I read the much vile and evil taunts onto the Almighty above.\\n\\n\r\nThe second season involves more dirty tactics, unearthly and unthinkable measures on how the characters move the plot in order to achieve their dreams of having to claim the prize of the tournament; the HOLY GRAIL.\\n\\n\r\nMuch of the hype from the first part is retained as it ended with a stiff cliffhanger. But hey, I forgot to mention that I've already seen F/Z dating back when it was still ongoing on a late Saturday night. Seeing the much awaited events ending one after another, the path F/Z chose was to include a series of flashback episodes that can further enhance our understanding on our main character. As much as I don't want to be a killjoy, I want to say, despite the over-dramatic juvenile days of the hero, I still failed to likened him as my top dog among the boys category. But we'll get here in the character thread part.\\n\\n\r\nStory... hmm... What I like about the second season is how the villain managed to grasp his long-sought pleasure searching. With a much-narrow and shallow reason, the point where the character is starting to realize what he wants to do excites me. But as far as my like goes, I also hate the fact that most of the other characters was disposed like they were trash-like burnable and left with much potential left untouched.\\n\\n\r\nAt the end of the story, I am not really that good with foreshadowing but as far as  I can remember, with FSN using the much-older Ilya as a vessel, I started seeing the development way back so it was not really much of surprising element which left me pouting.\\n\\n\\n\r\nFocusing on the other series contents like the art and the sound, I could never give an insulting 9 for it since it was definitely perfect. I am not much of a sound guru but I actually played instruments in the past and it made me touch a piano application on my smartphone and started playing the theme again. XD\\n\\n\r\nNow, the character thread!\\n\\n\\n\r\nAs much as I am so interested in the characters, I will focus more on the Heroic figures. There's also the fact that I am confused since the power balance was somewhat messed up in this sequel, (i.e Excalibur was enough to pulverized an Ultraman-like kaiju) the power distribution is enough to somewhat point me to wonder why is the likes of Lancer, Assassin and Berserker were included in the roster.\\n\\n\r\nWe already know that Gilgamesh, stands the most powerful in terms of offensive prowess but in the end, he wasn't able to manifest it due to some stupid antic for lusting to King Arthuria. Rider, on the other hand proved that his easy-going attitude delved him to his demise. Caster, who was someone stung me as a interesting character, died like a mushroom or a weed being cut out by a toddler. Lancer, on the other hand. I haven't seen any other better death of a Heroic figure other than his but truth to be told, his skills was just so much minuscule compared to the others since all he does was wave his pride-filled spears and nothing else. Berserker, was given too little detail to his potential. Other than his touch-thing-turn-to-Noble-Phantasm, he was such a duller watch compared to the other Heroic figure until his true identity was revealed. But I wish they could've prolonged the Saber vs Berserker fight and inserted more details since one dialogue is somewhat amiss where Sir Lancelot(oops spoiler...) said something about... I will refrain.\\n\\n\r\nOkay, at last, Saber. Alright, I already like Saber so much from the FSN title and seeing the side of hers 10 years ago, is quite refreshing. The demeanor of her remained untainted, with his chivalry sense still flowing onto her entire personality, cosplayed with a tuxedo suit and her usual battle gear. I certainly would care for another Holy Grail War with again, Saber on it.\\n\\n\r\nI would like to include Kariya and Kirei in this review but it will certainly be hard to refrain from spoiling spoilers since their characters, are too much surreal. Kiritsugu, on the other hand had been prototyped to a usual stereotype but made more dramatic-filled in order to become an equally disturbing and interesting counterpart to the villains. On the other hand, what makes the sequel funnier is how some proud Masters were killed in a fashion they could be dubbed as idiots esp. Kayneth and Tohsaka.\\n\\n\r\nConcluding, Fate Zero 2 is as much enjoyable for me but I could certainly tell that majority likes this one better. The price of destroying others in expense of having one's dream fulfilled, the outcome of the clash of ideals, the pleasure searching and the omnipotent grail that can grant miracles. Fate Zero 2 marvelously deliver a hell of a conclusion and it will certainly spell one of the best moments an anime watcher can experience.\\n\\n\r\nBut as far as my opinion goes, Fate Zero 2 is another title that took drastic measure in order to hit people's core that killing was never an option to achieve a dream. But hey, this is fiction we're talking about so why do I keep talking about real facts?\\n\\n\r\nI apologized but within the realms of humanity, miracles only occur to those who actually need it or more like, miracle in a fact, is just another unattainable dream.\\n\\n\\n",

The story is engaging and the interesting and thrilling subject and themes explored throughout the show left me on the edge of my seat for every minute it was on. One great thing about the writing of the show are the plot twists(occurring basically every episode). These plot twists kept me engaged and shocked me at every twist and turn, the second you think things are back to normal, another huge plot twist is thrown your way. This show is definitely not predictable, and very dark, which warrants ita 10/10 in story!\\n\\n\r\nArt\\n\r\n  Score:10/10\\n\r\n   -Although I'm terrible at art and know next to nothing about it, This show is beautiful! The characters costumes are so well thought out and the look fantastic! Also, the Environment or sets in the show were drawn very maturely and were, for the most part, realistic(The Castles particularly!). Although they used computer animation for some things and that is very apparent(and looks kind of cheesy in my opinion) this show still gets a 10/10 in art!\\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\r\n  Score:10/10\\n\r\n    -I'll keep this one short. The fighting sounds all sounded great, and the voice acting is PHENOMENAL(I watched the sub). \\n\\n\r\nCharacters\\n\r\n   Score:10/10\\n\r\n     -The characters are one of the high points of the show. Every character(and I mean EVERY character) is extremely well developed and all have their own problems and desires. There are very few static characters in this anime. Also, the writing of the characters is superb, the funny characters don't seemed forced and some of the characters are truly epic. This show absolutely deserves a 10/10 for it's awesome characters\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment\\n\r\n   Score:10/10\\n\r\n     -If you're still reading this I know it's obvious but, I freaking love this anime, It is probably my favorite of all time, it is beautifully written and extremely dark. All while exploring the themes of humanity and truly makes us judge ourselves!\\n\\n\r\nOverall\\n\r\n   Score:10/10\\n\r\n     -There it is. This anime is just so fantastic it can barely be put into words. I definitely recommend this to anyone with even the slightest interest. You will not regret experiencing this anime one bit!\\n",

            "content": "\"Being a hero is something time-limited,when you grow up it's hard to call yourself one\"\r\nWith the success of the first season the creators just passed the hard part and it was time for them to harvest what they planted before.this time the end is near and no one is safe and there is no place for honor nor false hope in this world anymore and those seeking it will only face failure.\r\nThe 2nd season starts right after the last episode of the 1st season with the battle against Caster.it uses the chance to show that most of the servants are actually heroes that count innocentlives above their war for a grail but it also shows that Fate universe is not kind enough to accept this kinda behaviors too often.even though most of the characters survived the previous season as we all know in this survival game there is only one winner and so the elimination game begun.\\n\r\nIn this season we also get to know more about those that are less explained before like Kiritsugu.four episodes of flashbacks tries to justify Kiritsugu\u2019s actions for the viewer specially after a cruel move and make him Sympathetic but at the same time it shows us the reason behinds his failure as a hero.as Kiritsugu was living with his past Kirei just forsaken it and became someone new(or old depend on if you played or seen F/SN before this).he finally finds his reason to fight and bought himself a one way ticket to insanity land.also Waver finally mans up and even imitate Alexander\u2019s \u201clolololo\" or w/e! in final episodes viewers will doubt their little hope for any good ending and Kiritsugu\u2019s meeting with grail confirms their doubts.as for the final it had so much to wrap up so it mostly favor those that already read the Light Novel and felt kinda rushed for the others.on the other hand you can say it was one of the few moments in an anime that one could enjoy Shirou.(although he is awesome in VN you know how he turned out in F/SN anime.he was ok in UBW movie too but could be way better).the moment when he tells Kiritsugu that leave everything to me and Saber gets Lights of Hope on herself was Priceless as one of last moments of the series.\\n\\n\r\nWith a lot of important fight scenes the animators had a lot to deal with this season and they managed to do a good job and they kept it up until the end.the music had to goes all out this season too,using most of the soundtracks from before in the first episode of the new season.also Kiritsugu and his master got their own theme with an special ED song as well.the promised OP song by kalafina for this series also is worth mentioning cause its one my favorites.as for the voice actors they finally found some challenge this season and they did a good job specially Miyu Irino (Kiritsugu\u2019s Voice actor) as he stole the end with his emotional talk with Shirou.you could feel everything that happened to him with his voice alone.also Ayako Kawasumi (Saber\u2019s voice actress) had some material to work with and handled it well.\\n\\n\r\nThis prequel managed to gave the viewer a better understanding of every character in Fate universe and what they had to go through and it also showed us the dark depths of the Holy Grail Wars.Fate zero Season 2 did justice to the Light Novel and while it puts an end to this epic struggle it marks an start for another and with all its strength or weaknesses it will always be remembered as one of the great animes of this era.\\n",

If this show is Jahseh Onfroy, then Unlimited Blade Works and Heavens Feel are Gekyume Onfroy no cap. To describe this masterpiece show in words is nearly impossible but I'll try my best. First of all, the animation in this series is just leagues beyond the competition. The animation is so good here even the CG is good. When Saber be destroying the Ops with Excalibur I feel like I am witnessing it firsthand. Thats the kindof effect this show had on me with its animation. The characters of this are no exception. Kiritsugu and Rider were my favs besides Saber as they had real motivations and were pretty dope as well. Gilgamesh really be hitting people with that yeetus deletus. Then the soundtrack is also god tier. The opening is just beautiful man (even though the opening of Unlimited Blade Works season 2 is better). To put it in simple terms, this show is Shaggy at 30% of his power level. That right there shows how godly this show is.",

            "content": "\" I shall grief, and i shall weep. But i shall never regret\" - Rider\r\nThe holy grail is an omnipotent wish granting device that shall be granted to the one mage who win the holy grail war. It was all started when the 3 major mage famillies the Einzberg, Tosaka, and Makiri discovered a way to create the wish granting device the holy grail. Upon success the grail turns out that it will only choose 1 wish to be granted thus resulting in a war in seek the true owner the grail. Every 60 years then 7 mage will be chosen by the grail tofight until there is only one true worthy owner of the grail left to be granted his wish.\\n\\n\r\nThe 7 chosen mage powered by the grail can summon a servant to aid them in their conquest. Servants are past heroes/ legends spirits from throughout the world. Some main servants from this series are Saber- King Arthur , Alexander the Great, Gilgamesh, and more.\\n\\n\r\nFate Zero is a prequel of the fate/ stay night series. The story takes us back 10 years before the current holy grail war that is being held at the fate/stay night series.\\n\\n\r\nStory : 9\\n\\n\r\nCompared to the fate stay night series, all i can say about this anime story is 3x better. It is way better but not to say that fate/stay night story is so much worse than fate zero. What can i say that fate zero completes fate stay night. You can actually respect the characterization of fate stay night from fate zero. A character you seem may hate in fate stay night can turn into a sorry feel/ compassion after watching his/her story in fate zero.\\n\\n\r\nUnlike many other anime where the story is mainly centered around the protagonist, this anime story rotates to every character deeply ( the 7 mages), and i must say every character story line is as interesting as the main character story line, some even better.\\n\\n\r\nFate zero will really pulls out every last bit of emotion you'll have. Warm , happy moments that put you to dream, the sad sad sorry feeling, to the thrill of epic speeches and battle roars that will electrifies your body.\\n\\n\r\nArt : 9\\n\r\nThe art is clearly great. The visual is very top notch that it will greatly enchants the viewing experience, and of course it is much better than fate/stay night. All those shining particle effects, DOP, and battle scenes are truly gorgeous.\\n\\n\r\nSound : 8\\n\r\nThe sound is very good. It has some very sad, mellow soundtracks, and some epic battle music. Though may it my taste the reason im giving an 8 not a 9 or 10 is because the soundtrack is not very memorable. I can still clearly remember naruto soundtrack in my head, blue bird, sadness and sorrow, but not the soundtrack from this anime.  Very good but not the best.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter : 10\\n\r\nOh the mighty king of conquest, Iskandar the great or should i say Alexander The Great, i shall be your servant after seeing this series. Gilgamesh your cockiness made every other jerky character i know seems so humble, and many other servants characters that i actually can speaks of for pages. \\n\\n\r\nAll i can say is give me a servant! The characterization of every servant is just pure gold. Some servants characters even out shines their own master characterization. \\n\\n\r\nThere are a lot of talking in fate zero, and many of the conversation are kinda heavy. Uniquely the vibrant characterization really makes the conversation to be very catchy. Its like sparks when each of their personality collides with one another ( Waver and Rider, best master and servant relationship!)\\n\\n\r\nMoving to the mages, their characterization is also as epic as the servants. Each of them is kinda have their own protagonist and antagonist self. In either way  its like you can root for everyone depending on your taste of course.\\n\\n\r\nThe true power of fate zero lies in its character. Its not everyday you watch an anime where you can root and love every main character even the one who should be the antagonist or even the sickest murderer of all.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10\\n\r\nDid i enjoy watching fate zero? Hell yeah! Its been a long journey with fate zero, those times you have to stop watching the next episode because you just realize you have watch 10 or more episode of fate zero today. AND BOY im ready to watch the reworked version of fate stay night now!\\n\\n\r\nOverall : 10\\n\\n\r\nYou can actually felt like being lectured by the real Alexander the great, grief with King Arthur for his loss of britain. Stop reading, and start watching!\\n",

            "content": "I really, really wanted to like this show, but I just couldn't. I wouldn't say I hate it either, I just felt bored most of the time, the show seems to be completely lacking in the very concept of context, and without that, I couldn't bring myself to care about anything.\r\nFor starters, how does literally anything in this world work? Pretty much all the magic in this universe just happens with no explanation whatsoever, a character can just do something and you just have to accept it. Like, what the heck is \"the root\"? Why do some characters want it? Why does the church wantto help Tohsaka get it? Why do some characters not want it anymore? Why have I clearly thought about this more than the writers of this show? It's even worse when they actually try to explain it though, for instance, at one point a character can outperform another character going at three times his normal speed simply by adjusting for where he's going to be or something like that. At the end, the show basically admits nothing makes sense, they just pull stuff out of nowhere, but they don't seem to understand that this is a massive problem that destroys immersion when noticed.\\n\\n\r\nNow, the world and magic system would have been relatively minor complaints if they were simply tools to set up ideological conflicts, the problem is those were utter nonsense as well.\\n\\n\r\nThere were plenty of characters that were at least good conceptually, like Saber for instance. She slowly comes to terms with the mistakes of her past but remains determined to follow her ideals and fight for her future. The only problem is that thing I mentioned earlier; context. What exactly were her mistakes? Something about serving her people instead of leading them, but at the end, Lancelot explicitly states he and all the Knights that served her believed her to be the greatest King to ever live and admits it's his own shortcomings, not hers, that led him down the path she wishes to save him from. It's implied she somehow failed to save Britain from being conquered, but did no one tell her Britain eventually goes on to become the greatest superpower in the world and even in this universe is the central power in the magical world? I can't tell what she has to feel guilty about.\\n\\n\r\nThen there's Kiritsugu, who at first I thought was a guy so devoted to saving the world he's willing to do whatever it takes to accomplish it, including some less honorable things, which got me really excited because in particular, that's a really interesting thing to put next to Saber who's all about honor. The problem is that juxtaposition felt forced as hell, he seems to go out of his way to make Saber see him do the sleeziest thing he does when he successfully hid all his other tactics from her up to this point, Saber says something about him not having honor, and it's never brought up again. That's like fumbling the ball at the one yard line, all the set up was there, you just messed up when it came time to make it all matter. Kiritsugu did salvage himself to some extent at the end with a decent take on the trolley problem, but it could have been so much better.\\n\\n\r\nAnd Rider. I think I actually liked Rider, but I can't actually tell what they were trying to say with him. Analyzing his actions, I got the impression he was someone who behaved the way he did for the thrill of it, and this kind of character would have been brilliant to include in order to contrast with the single minded goal oriented characters around him. The problem is his words contradict that, he claims he does have a goal, it's just unobtainable. In the end, I wish I could just ignore all of that because it's completely meaningless and I like the first interpretation way better, but then they go on and try to make it seem inspiring by having Waver make it his new purpose in life or something. Don't even get me started on Waver, he successfully grows out of being the annoying twit he is at the beginning, but he grows into a generic copy of Rider, but who lacks everything that made Rider interesting and cool.\\n\\n\r\nBesides those 3 characters, I can't even begin to understand what everyone else was supposed to be about. Take Kotomine for instance, the big reveal is that he was apparently born a psychopath and only just realized it. What? What am I supposed to take from that? Seriously, what? I want to call this stupid, but even that feels wrong. I feel like I have to have been missing something, like at one point Gilgamesh asks him if he wish he would have murdered his father, and had to rewind because I never at any point felt like they were hinting that. If I'm missing something, I'm sorry, but besides the three I talked about, I feel like every single character in this show is broken at a conceptual level and couldn't bring myself to care about them at all.\\n\\n\r\nI have to reiterate of course, I don't hate this show, I just found it boring. It tries to be deep and I applaud that, but it fails at almost every turn",

            "content": "After the build-up of the first season, it should have been extremely difficult to handle the second season with the same amount of care that went into the first season. This is because the first season handled the characters and storyline as well as the various perspectives in the show with a spectacular amount of ambiguity and care, and it sure as hell isn't easy to continue from there. \r\nThere's also the harsh reality that sequels to shows tend to be weaker than their prequels, since they're usually made with the mindset that since the show is already successful financially speaking, there's no real needto care as much about the sequel since it is going to sell anyway, and indeed many shows suffer from this line of thinking.\\n\\n\r\nThe trick here is after allowing so much build-up and all that dialogue to explain the show, now there needs to be execution and see how far the show goes in delivering. And oh boy, Fate/Zero's second season sure as hell delivers.\\n\\n\r\nThe battle tournament which didn't go too far in the first season went miles, hell some would argue a bit too fast, in the second season. The show holds no punches and doesn't treat the viewer like an idiot, taking the fact that you know all this information for granted and as such will not hold you hand or catch a break in delivering a powerful and engaging emotional narrative. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters' ideals are put to the test severely and punished for their flaws, which is engaging but also heart-wrenching and is extremely fascinating to watch. This show is filled to the brim with irony, and while that particular aspect stands well on its own, it gets even better if you're fully familiar with all of the historical legends that surround these heroes.\\n\\n\r\nThe character dynamics between each pair of Master and Servant reach a conclusion, and it's rather interesting how well their interactions mesh together and how some of them repel each other simply for being so similar (even if they'd never admit it). This works extremely well and we end up seeing the characters in even more perspectives than the first season.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is just as good as the first season, and the same applies to the voice acting. There isn't really much to say, and I never once felt that a track didn't fit the particular mood of the show at any given point. The composition is excellent and there is a lot of emotion put into every line spoken, and its clear that a lot of effort has been given to the second season in this regards in particular, since the directing feels like it has improved and the pacing is better than the first season.\\n\\n\r\nThe artwork looks the same as the first season, but special mention needs to be brought up to the animation quality, because I don't know how but this season looks even better than the first. There are hardly any still frames and every shot looks absolutely gorgeous, and it hardly comes as a surprise that one of the staff members responsible for the animation has a degree in Photography.\\n\\n\r\nThe show is a gut-wrenching ride, and while more could have been done to prepare for the ending (which makes sense in the context of the story on its own, in my honest opinion), they're nitpicks to what may just be the best life or death tournament out of anime.\\n\\n\r\nThe themes are well-explored, the story is resolved in a satisfactory manner and the characters are all fleshed out in a stunning amount of detail. Seriously, there isn't much this show doesn't do right, and it's the kind of show where there is something to love for everyone.\\n\\n\r\nIt's entertaining, captivating, well-written and tragic, and there really isn't much like it as far as anime is concerned. Easily among the best anime series in recent years, I honestly cannot recommend it highly enough.",

Sometimes, the plot confuses me but I tend to catch up.\r\nArt/Animation 9/10\r\nThe animation is a bit better than the first season. The antagonists like \"Berserker\" now has a CGI-ish effects. The character and environment designs seems to be the same to me.\r\nSound 9/10\r\nThe soundtrack is a little bit improved. Thebattle themes are a bit better than the first season. \"Emotional\" themes are the same. Opening soundtrack is ok but the first season OP was better and the ending soundtrack is way better than the first season ED.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 9/10 \\n\r\nIf you watch the first season then you already know who the characters are. It's basically 7 masters and 7 servants fighting for the Holy Grail.

            "content": "Fate/Zero is one of those few anime that get close to perfection.\r\nSTORY :\r\nBefore everything, you have to know that this show is a part of a whole series called Fate. Fate is an incredible universe, very rich (and although the anime adaptations don't cover all of it, they still managed to get ahold of the complexity of this universe).\r\nFate/Zero is the tragic story of a \"war\" between Mages, a war to get the Holy Grail which is said to have enough power to grant the wish of the winner.\r\nBattles, assassinations and treasons are some of the many ways to fight in this war.\r\nThe first importantthing to notice : there is no \"hero\". There's just people fighting for their own reasons. As a result, you don't follow only one character through the whole thing : each of the Holy Grail War participants have as much time as needed for their story.\\n\\n\r\nSecond thing to know : Fate/Zero is the prequel to Fate/Stay Night. The first tells the events that leads to the story of the latter. As a result, you (normally) already know what is bound to happen before it happens (because you are supposed to know Fate/Stay Night before Fate/Zero).\\n\r\nAlthough you can enjoy Fate/Zero without knowing Fate/Stay Night, you will lose a lot of the tragic atmosphrere : already knowing things is an incredible addition to the tragedy of this show. After all, you already know who will die and how, but you just can't do anything about it.\\n\r\nThis is fate, simply and all.\\n\\n\r\nThird thing to know : this is a very philosophical anime. This show will make you wonder things like \"What makes a good leader?\", \"Can we actually save everybody?\" or \"how far am I ready to go for my own wishes?\". You got it : \"heroism\" and \"wishes\" are the main themes, and they are handled very well.\\n\\n\\n\r\nART :\\n\r\nThe environments are stunning, the lightings are the best you can find in japanimation even today, the animation is fluid and dynamic.\\n\r\nMy only problem is with the chara-design : the characters viewed from aside have a weird face shape (like, the nose is in continuation of the face instead of being a protuberance).\\n\r\nAside from that, nothing to say : it is beautiful when meant to be, horrific when meant to be.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND :\\n\r\nKajiura Yuki is the compositor, so it is awesome. It adds a lot to the epic and tragic atmosphere. The seiyuus are incredible as well.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS :\\n\r\nThis is one of the strong points of the Fate universe. Even the side characters have a great background and some involvement in the main story.\\n\\n\r\nThe main two characters, Kiritsugu and Kirei, are a duality (just like Light and L in Death Note, or Lelouch and Suzaku in Code Geass). Thus, their relationship is interesting to follow : although they don't know each other, each considers the other one as their worst enemy in this war. They are mortal enemies from the start to the end.\\n\r\nThe other participants of the Holy Grail War range from a Master Mage to a loser Mage student, so there's a lot of variety there. But all of them have an interesting development.\\n\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT :\\n\r\nFate/Zero is one of the deepest anime outhere. It's also one of the darkest, which is perfect for a horror show like this (yes, it is a horror show, you have been warned xD). It is also one of the most epic, with many good battles through the whole 25 episodes, and one of the saddest, as Fate has no mercy at all.\\n\\n\\n\r\nAS A CONCLUSION : if you want a mature anime, there you have it. When it comes to atmosphere, it is as grim as Death Note.\\n\r\nDefinitely worth it, although I would suggest you watch one of the Fate/Stay Night anime adaptations before Fate/Zero as it adds a lot to the tragedy.",

            "content": "Fate/Zero is the magnum opus of the Fate franchise, and rightfully so. It is an excellent blend of great storytelling, excellent art and sound and memorable characters. Of course, by just watching the first season, this is nowhere near apparent. The first season while being just above mediocre for most of it\u2019s run, sets the stage for season two to shine. \r\nThe second season is where the story of Fate/Zero really gets kicking. While there was barely any plot progression for the first, the second is full of excitement. To put it bluntly, the Holy Grail War finally begins to start. A consequence of this,as Shirou Emiya from Fate/stay night says best, \u201cpeople die if they are killed\u201d. This cour of the show brings the death game to the forefront with characters dying left and right. This is to be expected, as only one person can obtain the Holy Grail. \\n\\n\r\nAs with the first season, Fate/Zero looks beautiful. There were several moments throughout the show where I felt like pausing and just taking a screenshot. As for the animation, it too was excellent. There were several more fight sequences in this than the first but each was animated with the high quality that ufotable is known for. The OST for Fate/Zero might just be my favourite part of the show. Actually as I write this review, I am currently listening to it. Of the entire work, my favourite is \u201cThe Battle is to the Strong\u201d. It is one of the more iconic songs from the OST and I absolutely recommend that everyone listen to it. \\n\\n\r\nFate/Zero is a show with a large cast, and many of the characters felt neglected during season one. In the second season, some characters die which leaves some room for others to be focus on. We finally get a backstory for Kiritsugu, which is appropriate as the stone-faced killer is our protagonist. When looking at the characters, I find them to be more like representations of ideals and philosophies than a real person. For this show, it works perfectly. Fate/Zero in it\u2019s entirety is a show that about clashing ideals and somewhat like another work by Gen Urobuchi Psycho-Pass, it tells us to not chase ideals in favour of reality. The world is not run on ideals, and as such to look at them as the only way for salvation is unreasonable.\\n\\n\r\nOf course, Fate/Zero is not without its faults. A major problem I have with the entire series as a whole is how magic is barely explained. While Fate/Zero is a prequel to Fate/stay night and it should be assumed that people have watched stay night before coming into Zero, Fate/stay night barely explains magic as well. One\u2019s only option to learn of the rules of this world are to read to visual novels or read the wiki. Also, the ending of Fate/Zero was a bit hamstrung by the fact that it needed to set the stage for Fate/stay night to occur. The ending is wholly confusing and does not make much sense unless you have read the light novel and/or the visual novels. I had to Google Search \u201cFate/Zero ending explained\u201d to figure out the how story behind Angra Mainyu and the Holy Grail. To put it bluntly, the ending felt somewhat convoluted and was ultimately a mess. \\n\\n\r\nIn the end, Fate/Zero second season is a show that manages to be absolutely enthralling due to the great production values and the clash of ideals which is brought to the forefront through it\u2019s story. It completely eclipses the first season, and just may be the best Fate story ever produced. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9 (Great)\\n",

            "content": "Fate/Zero review - \r\nThis was a really feel good anime. I mean, watching it through was really cathartic, when the writing/onscreen action strikes a chord, it can make for some very enjoyable and very funny moments.\r\nSo let's go ahead and critique the plot and characters of this anime. To begin, the plot is fairly decent, if overdone or predictable at times. However, this is hampered by some awful pacing issues, particularly prevalent in Season 1 where a great issue stems from characters talking too much but not doing enough. An example would be two characters fighting something while exchanging very very long sessions of dialoguewith each other but not doing much. I suppose it's a downside from adapting a light novel series, but the action scenes in Fate/Zero aren't that well put up. The animation quality is quite good, (3D issues aside), but poor pacing really hurts it and oftentimes action scenes last longer and are more boring than they should be.\\n\\n\r\nI rather enjoyed the deconstruction of the \"Killing the minority to save the majority\" trope in this, showing it to be fairly meaningless and destructive as actively participating in the chaos. And while I do despise Saber and her ideals, I did enjoy the scenes where her ideals are outright dissected for how awful they actually are in front of her, good stuff there. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter wise, some characters definitely work better than other characters. On one hand you have Waver and Iskandar's very well done friendship and on the other you have the very very boring Tohsaka household (of course the anime makes a point to how boring they are, but still). The main character is enjoyable to follow, and it was fun to see his rivalry with Kirei play out.\\n\\n\r\nI wasn't too big a fan of the ending however, it felt very different in tone compared to the rest of the anime, but it could have stemmed from being a prequel to the more lighthearted (and worse) proper Fate series. \\n\\n\r\nAll in all, Fate/Zero is a great lighthearted (most of the time) anime that's full of fun and laughs. \\n\\n\r\n7/10 - It was okay.\\n",

            "content": "Like most of you, I had already watched Fate/Stay Night before watching this amazing show, so the ending was quite obvious for me from the very beginning. When there is already the sequel, it is much harder to bring something out really good but Fate/Zero, both the first and the second season, succeeded in doing so. \r\nFirst of all, story develops in such a gradual way that it does not tire the audience or make them bored. Rather, it portrays the characters in depth (for example, I wrote in my review for Fate/Stay Night: Unlimited Blade Works that it could not bring depth to characters.)Unlike Fate/Stay Night: Unlimited Blade Works, Fate/Zero puts the characters more up front. I believe that this is one of the key points to the series' success because Holy Grail War is not only about fighting and showing some spectacular fighting scenes. Although the fight scenes are also great, both masters' and servants' motivations are equally significant in this war since the grail is choosing the most suitable one in accordance with their motivations. In the first season, the series is at its slowest pace and lets the audience learn about the characters and their motivations. However, with the beginning of the second season, the pace gets much quicker and the series becomes more action/fighting involved.\\n\r\nSecondly, the art is also much superior to that Fate/Stay Night (especially Lancer). I think the drawings of Lancer in Fate/Zero is revealing his nature and characteristics more, I'm still bitter about his early death, though :)\\n\r\nAnd I guess, I should write a few words on the ending or last episode. To be honest, I wanted to see more fight between Saber and Gilgamesh and this is my first disappointment. Secondly, I would love to see Saber resisting his master. But they are just my selfish wishes. They do not destroy the greatness of the series. \\n\\n",

This season is a direct sequel to Fate/Zero so I don't recommend you start Fate/Zero with this season. \r\nThe story was very well written and if you're looking for an anime with a great story with good characters I recommend you watch this anime. \r\nArt/Animation - Perfect. Ufotable always makes anime with brilliant animation. Character designs were excellent and the environment was beautifully designed. Fighting scenes were fantastic. If you're looking for an anime with excellent art and animation I recommend you check out this anime.\r\nSound - The music and sound effects in this seasonwere magnificent. This opening is much better than the first season's opening in my opinion. I definitely liked the music in this anime. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters - The characters were very good and I liked most of them.  Some characters in this anime are very unlikable in my opinion but overall the characters were very strong. That being said some of the characters were a lot stronger than others. Rider was probably the weakest character in my opinion. Compared to Saber and Archer Rider is just so weak.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - This season was only 12 episodes so my standards were very high for this season. The anime was quite enjoyable but some of the episodes were terrible in my opinion. I also hated the flashbacks. They flashbacks were extremely boring in my opinion. The last couple of episodes were very rushed.\\n\\n\r\nOverall - Fate/Zero overall is a great anime recommended to everyone. Sure this season wasn't as excellent and fresh as the first one but it was still extremely good.\\n\\n\r\nScore - 82% [Recommended]",

            "content": "Fate Zero doesn't really deserve the acclaim people give it and here are a few reason why,\r\nStory- people rank this anime as one of the best series out there but from my view it shows barley any and it only gets truly pumping when the second season arrives. But even in season 2 fails very badly at satifying me because of it's slow pacing drawn out thriller scenes that makes this anime lose potential. The authors style of writing was easy to expect as he really loves to make people feel despair and watching many of his works, I know that Gen Urobuchi is farfrom making me impressed and always fails because he relys too much on a repeated and vulgar writing style. Finally the whole point of the series is for the protagonist is to save the world, but what is he really saving the world from, that is because the world never needed saving to begin with. He thinks the world needs saving and he only makes worse for everyone, thanks a lot Kiritsugu Emiya ya big jerkoff and that is the one small plothole which drained the story's greatness and turned it into a cesspool of crap.\\n\\n\r\nAs for everything else the characters were dry, the sound was mediocre and the only redeeming factor was the animation which was excellent but is not able to rescue Fate Zero from my critical wrath.\\n\r\nAnother blunder was that my favourite character Berserker didn't get all the screentime he deserved and made a few more appearances in the final episodes only to be killed by Saber the heroine of the fate series (as expected).\\n\r\nThe biggest fault of all was the ending and we all know that Gen's endings are super confusing, weird, or cliffhangers which I totally hate from the bottom of my heart. I suppose it was needed for that to happen and let all the more popular characters appear in Fate Stay/night and fill the events in to make sense of what happened in the past but it doesn't I gotta like it one bit.\\n\\n\r\nFor my conclusion I say that Fate Zero was so bad it made Naruto look good and lost all its great potential because of one tiny plot hole because the author was absent minded or he wanted to play a sick prank on us for fun, it like they say nobody makes us feel despair and misery like Gen Urobuchi \\n\\n\r\nThis anime fits for two categories horrible and atrocities and like everybody on this website they all love the underdogs and despise the big 3 shounen anime. Everyone's got their opinion and I'll respect that but for me I like the stuff that isn't recommended by anime critics and ranked on a tedious scale of how people like one anime and hate another. I am a one man critic island and I am proud of what I like and what I review.\\n\\n\r\nCatch you later dudes and dudettes of my anime list and good day to you\\n\\n",

            "content": "Fate/zero\r\nTo put it simply, Fate/Zero is a story that is all about a war between seven masters and their servants to attain the Holy Grail, an omnipotent wish-granting device. Now, I would like you to know that I have yet to watch Fate/Stay night so everything in this review will be purely about Fate/Zero only, without questioning how well the transition between the two stories is. \r\nStory: Story-wise, Fate/Zero is interesting, but very linear. There were very little twists in the story, which made it quite predictable. You can pretty much tell who will win in each fight, although it might be predetermined due toit being a prequel( remember, I haven\u2019t watch stay night yet). Although with that said, I am most certainly not saying that the story sucks, it\u2019s just that it doesn\u2019t require you to think as much as other animes(like Steins;gate for example). Nevertheless, it has kept me interested so I am willing to give it an 8/10.\\n\\n\r\nArt & Sound: Fate/Zero did everything perfectly on this one. The graphics were beautifully drawn and animated, with CGI which looks fucking amazing(forgive the profanity). The fight scenes were especially stunning, one of the best I\u2019ve seen and believe me, I\u2019ve watched a lot of shounen animes. Now, if there\u2019s one way to describe the music, it is like an orgasm for the ears. The OP was so awesome that I\u2019d put it at the same level of epicness as FF7\u2019s One Winged Angel. The ED was also something, it had this calming feel to it, which is really good after watching some heated action. I swear I have never skipped a single OP or ED while watching this anime and i loved every second of it. I give both art and music a 10/10 and if you think this is biased, tell me that again after you\u2019ve watched it.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: One of the main selling points of Fate/Zero. Every type of character is in this anime, and there is bound to be one that you will like. Although I said that, I assure you that it\u2019s nothing like Naruto wherein they just introduce a crap-load of characters hoping that you would like one, no. Every main character is explored and character development is noticeable throughout the show. As the story goes, you will get to know the story of each character, their ideals, their personalities as well as the wishes they want to make. They explain each character to a certain depth and doesn\u2019t just leave them as cannon fodder to killed later. I give it a 10/10 because the characters are just epic, and you really will grow attached to some of them.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: It was enjoyable in the sense that it doesn\u2019t need you to turn off your brain nor does it require you to think a lot to enjoy it. It is also entertaining to watch the awesome fight scenes as well as some emotionally touching scenes. How I enjoyed Fate/Zero isn\u2019t really something that I can put well into words but I really enjoyed it, and I am willing to give it a 8/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall:  Fate/Zero has been a truly wonderful ride, and it has kept me wanting for more. The story, however predictable, was still exciting in its own way. The thing that kept me watching though was to see how the characters would turn out. I loved to see them being driven into a corner, seeing them turn into a slightly different person after every battle. While watching them grow, I even grew attached to them, and it pained me to see some of them die. It was wonderful overall and for that, I give it a 9/10\\n\\n\r\nThat is all I have to say and if you have any comments at all, please do write them at my page. Any criticism will be highly appreciated. Also if you have found this review helpful please do mark it as helpful. Thx :))\\n",

FATE/ZERO\r\nBefore reading this review, note that this is a review for both seasons of Fate/Zero and may contain spoilers.\r\nStory: 9/10\r\nThe story is very captivating and the Fate universe is detailed quite well in the anime. The double episode special right at the beginning takes care of this. The Holy Grail War, a bloody battle between 7 Mages and their 7 Servants for the ultimate prize. The Holy Grail, the ultimate device said to grant the wish of the person it deems worthy. \r\nThe story is paced quitewell 99% of the time except some parts where, I think there's a little to much dialogue. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 10/10\\n\r\nThere's not much I can say about the art and the quality animation here. It's just awesome. Truly a sight to behold. The fights are choreographed very well and the animation overall is very good.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9/10\\n\r\nThe soundtracks are written by Yuki Kajiura, same composer from Kara no Kyokai movies. The soundtracks are very inspired and fit the anime very well. Especially \"You Are My King\" for Rider. That thing is pure gold. \\n\r\nThe first Opening and Ending, while good, do not really stand out, except for the animation. The second Opening and Ending on the other hand, are so very good.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 10/10\\n\r\nLeave it to Gen Urobuchi to flesh out these kind of chharacters. This is probably the best thing about this anime. The characters are so well written that I can't really pick a favorite one. On the other hand, there really isn't one. This is a 7 people bloody Battle Royale, and each of them has a Servant. Each of these characters compliments each other, either by having similar emotions or by being the opposite. \\n\r\nThe clashing ideas and philosophies are really interesting because they bring out the flaws in each character's personality.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:10/10 \\n\r\nThis anime kept me to the edge of my seat and always wanting more. From the fantastic character development and dialogue, to the godly animations during an action scene.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 10/10\\n\r\nOne of the best animes I've seen recently and I don't see it changing anytime soon. If anyone has not seen it yet, I totally recommend you watch it, you will not be disappointed. The experience is even better if you are familiar with the Fate universe either by reading the Visual Novel Fate/Stay Night, by watching the 2006 anime adaption (not very good) or by watching the UBW 2014 anime.",

The story evolving one of the most famous legends out there: The King Arthur in an outstanding way, it's a great story and a great adaptation to a story and I can't say anything bad about it.\r\n\tWell, we have a lot of animes  that have a good storybut f**king stupid character but this isn't the case here, in Fate/Zero on of the major brilliant aspects is the characters, first the show lacks a protagonist they show you the story from all characters perspective without focusing on one or two so you may choose the one you see is right and you mostly won't have any idea who is the winner till the very end of the show, also none of the characters has any relates to high school, moe girls, lolis or any stupid trsundres (Oh God, Finally!!!!) all of them have an interesting personalities and they all (except one) are adults which gives the show an atmosphere of maturity.\\n\r\n\tThen what about the soundtracks and the music overall? well, all I can say to describe it's awesomeness is what ever a fight you would see while listening to it would seem fantastic even if it's just between to cats, yes it's that awesome.\\n\r\n\tNext the art and animation, hahahahahaha do you really have to talk about it??it's UFotable. it's just the most awesome, fantastic, great, brilliant animation I've ever seen in my life, I assume that there is not only a geniuses worked on it but a crazy budget too, it's just top-notch crazy beautiful animation.\\n\r\n\tNow last but not least, my personal enjoyment:\\n\r\nThere is nothing perfect as they say and F/Z has its flaws, the start of the show was little slow and somewhat boring and the ending confuse the people who's not familiar to The King  Arthur story or the novel the show was built on and it's the most affecting factor to my score of F/Z because any adaptation should stand on its own and it shouldn't acquire a previous knowledge from the viewer at all, oh another thing is the show has almost no fanservice which was a pleasure to me.\\n\r\n\tWith that being said my overall feeling about the show is other than that ending it's a must watch anime and almost a masterpiece and I would recommend it to anybody and I give it a score of 9.7 .",

            "content": "While this anime was good and excelled in many categories, it still had short comings that kept it from being one of the greatest animes of all time. \r\nThe Good:  The animation is AMAZING and easily is the most beautiful anime that I've seen. It rivals animated movies from Studio Ghibli. The Characters  are all interesting and had well developed back stories and clear motivations. The music was always fitting for the moment and gave a sense of awe and epicness to the battle scenes. \r\nThe Bad: The actual battle scenes between the different masters and servants were great when they were actuallyfighting. The problem this anime suffered from was drawing out battles to talk amongst eachother which really draws from the experience. This is not Naruto or Dragon Ball Z for gods sake. >_< Had they fixed this I would easily give it a 9. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: Good story, great character development, and stunning animation however the battle scenes while managing to be amazing at time are undermined by characters not shutting up and conversing with eachother. Granted its worse sometimes than others it is a major detraction. It just in my mind ruined all the build up to just talk some more. \\n\\n\r\n8/10",

            "content": "Fate Zero 2nd season is one of my favorite anime. As expected from Urobutcher, this anime is dark and many characters died. Here's my opinion :\r\nStory (9/10)\r\nActually, the main theme is simple, a battle between 7 masters and their servants to obtain the holy grail which is said to have the power to make any wish come true. What makes it become interesting is the characters background and their development and act in that one simple theme. We were showed their backgrounds, their purpose, and what they protect and treasure most. Well, but it doesn't really have a good end. Oh, and compared to season1, the story is more fast paced. \\n\\n\r\nart (10/10)\\n\r\nI can't say anything except, 'amazing'. UFOTABLE really did it! The animation is superb.\\n\\n\r\nSound (10/10)\\n\r\nThe OP ED was good. But the best is the BGMs. It is not just enhancing the situation, but also building and developing the atmosphere of every scene. It really fits the scenes very well.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter (9/10)\\n\r\nCharacter development was superb. All characters have amazing development. We can see some dark side of the MC that would sacrifice anything in order to obtain his wish, also his dark, sad and tearing past. And the main antagonist finally become the real bad guy. We can also see some development of relationship between masters and their servants. Characters development made the story become really interesting.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (9/10)\\n\r\nAfter watching all those awesomeness, of course I really enjoy it, i'll give it 9. \\n\\n\r\nOverall (10/10)\\n\r\nWell, from previous scores, i'll give it 10. It is a masterpiece. I really love it. I hope the remake of Fate Stay Night would be great too.   \\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Because I watched the season 1 and 2 simultaneously, this will be the review for both seasons\r\nFate/Zero told the story about fourth holy grail war. Seven masters and their servants fight together in order to use the mighty power of holy grail, that known can make any hope and wish to be true.\r\nAction animes usually filled with fighting, explosions and not really focuses on the story, but this one is different, fate/zero can make a really good yet complex story through it deep and emotional dialogues. Plus, a lot of unpredictable twist make the story is even more interesting.\r\nThe art is gorgeous, it's perfect. Bothof its character or its background. All drew perfectly, even there are some part especially in the latest episode when they reduce the quality in texture and color, but still awesome and just really good. The animation is also great, the character move really smooth and especially for berserker, I can't imagine how they can put that kind of art and animation like that in this anime, last time I see art and animation like that is on some \"expensive budget\" animation west films. The color gradation puts perfectly, it successfully bring the dark atmosphere which fits to the story throughout the show.\\n\\n\r\nThe music are nice, bring me pumped sometime. And the BGM is also good, it really fit to the scenes like deep conversation, battle scene, sad moments etc.\\n\\n\r\nNow the characters... Unlike most anime when only focusing on the main character, fate/zero focuses on all seven masters and their servants.\\n\r\nCharacter development is what I like in here, Saber who was acting heroic to her people and believe that her way of justice is right just totally wrong. She just turn into different person, who look the world into a more and wider visions. The other characters also have a big development which I can't put it here because most of them contains major spoiler.\\n\\n\r\nFor those who love serious action animes, I really recommend this show for you.",

            "content": "So this is the second season of the Fate/Zero anime, and it is the better half story-wise and enjoyment-wise. First, off I do want to point out that even though in my opinion the second season was better than the first, PLEASE dont skip the first season. Its definitely worth watching before this finale. \r\nSTORY:10\r\nSo a continuation of a story thats already a great story with the more boring bits of set-up in the rear makes for a perfectly interesting story. It has the one element that was missing before, which was quicker pace. And this is what sets this story apart from before. Itswas already amazing in setup, but the change of pace really set it apart from before. It has great premises, ideas, and a strain of originality on an overused subject, which gives it intrigue. Overall a continuation of an outstanding story with a change in pace makes an even more outstanding story. \\n\\n\r\nART:10\\n\r\nSurprisingly enough, the art was exactly in the same style as before (/sarcasm) and that pretty much made it a 10 out of 10. Again, no animations were made sloppily, no artwork was done hastily. Character designs stayed the same, which is good for continuity's sake. Again the quality is high, as good as any new anime in 2017. Also, some CGI scenes returned as per the last season. Though again not bothersome in my opinion, just a heads up. \\n\\n\r\nSOUND:9\\n\r\nSame dealio as before, sound is great. In-story songs are good, not much change was needed, and not much change was done Luckily the VA's stayed the same, so we got continuity. Epic orchestral music is as epic as always. But, again, the OP/ED failed to impress, they lacked character, uniqueness, and a catchiness, that my favorite songs do. It was an average OP/ED. \\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER:10 \\n\r\nA good bulk of the enjoyment is here for this anime. Here, the characters really grew more and faster, which was a bit lacking in season 1. the story becomes more character- centered, mostly around Kiritsugu and his conflict with Kirei. Probably the most impressive part of it was the conflict within kiritsugu's self, where he changes his ideals. More characters die, which is sad, but it advances the plot. And their deaths themselves build upon the character personality that is already there. So overall 10/10.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT:10\\n\r\nAnd so, the concluding finale of the Fate/Zero anime gets the 10 on enjoyment. The major factor here is pace and story. The pace picked up in comparison to the other season, and this pace really elevates the enjoyment you get from it. The second factor is story. Since the story was getting towards the end of itself, there was a good amount of suspense and tension, which made the closure more enjoyable. \\n\\n\r\nOVERALL:10\\n\r\nIn conclusion, a great anime series if judged as a whole. But in halves, this one does it better. It takes all the good parts of the last season, and adds a quicker pace, which was what was missing from the first season. Story-wise it was faster, and avoided the burden of set-up and introduction. Art and Sound are not sacrificed and come back with the same quality as before. Characters undergo massive upheavals of progress and overturned ideals, making for a very interesting story. The changes that come with more end-game content make it a better anime than it's predecessor. So broken down, again a 4 for story + 3 for characters + 2 for enjoyment+ 1 for Art/sound = 10/10\\n\\n\r\nPeace.",

With no prior knowledge or information regarding anything to do with this franchise I come with a clean slate to review this anime. Some tertiary online research has shown me that if I had reviewed this show as it aired I'd likely be hung in the town square for heresy. As it stands I foundFate/Zero to be the perfect example of a 7/10 anime that you should watch with a healthy amount of beer and friends.\\n\\n\r\nThe story and world of Fate itself is actually pretty interesting. A magical world where every *so often* a death battle is fought by powerful magic families over ownership of a \"Holy Grail\" to grant them power. The concept is strong here and the world isn't too close to anything I can put my finger on so it feels fairly original. This however is all betrayed by the actual execution of the story.\\n\\n\r\nVisually a lot of the show looked quite good at a glance but heavy amounts of CG objects and effects really took me out of a lot of this shows action. On top of that the action itself seemed impressive at a glance but lacked impressive key frames and fell back on a lot of blurred lines and \"to fast to see\" situations. Character designs were 50/50 for me as well. Some I loved and some seemed like standard anime bargain bin fare. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter development in this show was solid. The characters had motivations, dreams, and goals and getting the perspective of all parties in this death game anime was a unique feature to be commended on. The problem that arose was yet again in execution. \\n\\n\r\nThis show really fell apart for me with it's narration. The show presents mountains of dialogue that felt meaningless. The show presents explanations to rules that are broken at the drop of a hat, character motivations that are illogical at best, and philosophies that are pseudo-intellectual drivel.\\n\\n\r\nThe best this anime had to offer was just about anything from the perspective of the character Emiya Kiritsugu, but even this badass Spike Spiegel look-a-like was plagued with some snakes on a plane tier shenanigans that broke a lot of my immersion.\\n\\n\r\nOverall this anime from a narrative standpoint is an absolute mess, but the actual death game portions of the show are something that I could recommend. So in other words this should be enjoyed with friends and booze. (you'll need a buddy to get through the monologues about ideals).",

            "content": "This is a review of parts 1 and 2 of the series as a whole. Spoiler free.\r\nAs someone who has always enjoyed historical legends and heroic fighters in a fantasy setting I was instantly drawn to look into this series. The base concept of the series is a group of magi summoning heroic spirits of legend to fight for them in a battle royal style fight over a magical item said to grant any wish, The Holy Grail. \r\nThe setting gives way to an abundant amount of possible outcomes and situations for the viewer to experience and enjoy. The tone of the show is instantlyset the moment you begin watching it. It's mature and serious. If you're looking for something lighthearted to watch this wouldn't be it. On the other hand if you're looking for a series that has meaningful character interaction, a powerful story and some well written characters you've come to the right show.\\n\\n\r\nThe story can be heavy at first when starting with an hour long episode, but all of the info is needed to understand everything that's going on. As an English speaker I must admit when I first started the show in Sub I was having a hard time and even dropped it for awhile, but since the English Dub had an excellent cast I chose to go with it instead since the series could be dialog heavy at times. This instantly helped me keep track of everything more easily.\\n\\n\r\nAt first with all the technical information being shot at the viewer it can be a bit overwhelming at first but as you start to settle in and follow along it all starts to click. As stated before the story is what i would describe as \"heavy\".                 The series has dark tones and themes throughout, dealing with human nature and desire. It has some of the deepest character conflict I've ever seen in a series, as characters struggle with their own personal ideals and beliefs. What really stands out in the series is the constant back and forth between characters and their interactions between one another as these ideals clash with each other.\\n\\n\r\nThis brings me to the characters. You can have a really good story but with some horrible characters that bring it down completely, but then you can have really good characters with a terrible story that cause you to enjoy the series  just from those characters alone. Fate/Zero does have a pretty cut and dry story at its core (Battle Royal style fight for a magical object that can grant a wish), but its the characters who are put into that story's setting and how they interact and their actions that make that story move forward so interesting. The aspects of each character of the series gets explored very well and each one of them has a defining moment in the series. Something special I love about this series is no character is perfect. ALL of them have some kind of flaw like any person would have. This allows for interesting characters that constantly keep you engaged.\\n\\n\r\nAs far as the sound quality goes, Yuki Kajiura does a fantastic job on the sound track. The music fits perfectly for this fantasy thriller and the music enhances each scene only to help immerse one's self into Fate/Zero even more. I've found myself going back to listen to the shows OST often just for background music for whatever I may be doing at the time. As far as sound quality goes, the Sub and Dub are both excellent since I have heard them both at this point, but I must say I think if want to give the series a shot as an English speaker I have to say this is one of the few dubs that in some ways surpasses the original Japanese in certain aspects. The emotion the English actors and actress put into this is very clear. Very notably Kari Wahlgren (Saber) and Matthew Mercer (Kiritsugu) do an amazing job at conveying emotions when it really counts, though honestly so does the whole voice cast, those two just deserve a special mention.\\n\\n\r\nThe art and animation quality is just astonishing. There is -NEVER- any flat colors. The air itself has texture and life, and any CGI blends nearly effortlessly in with the 2D animation. At no point while watching was I ever jarred or became un-immersed because of it. I cannot stress enough about how mind blowing and well done the animation of this series is. Ufotable did an amazing job with it and I have to say that really only anime movies come close to the level of quality this 25 episode series has. Ufotable really knew how to spend the budge they were given for this.\\n\\n\r\nThis series is something that to me is really deserving of words like \"Epic\" or \"Masterpiece\" words that get thrown around too often in my opinion. I enjoyed it so much and it had a good deal of re-watch value, I've always found something new and interesting each time I watch it.\\n\\n\r\nThis series honestly has made an impact on my life in a few ways, and I think mot anime and even non-anime fans should at the very least give it a try.\\n",

Death note is DBall compared with FZ.\r\nThe story is very well written. Betrayals, secret stories and all because of the events. Which seems to me that is was wasted rider, 2 short and long speech fights.\r\nThe soundtrack is very good and the characters are well developed\r\nThe fights are very short.\r\nEntertainment is limited because when you think a good fight comes,it turns out that they spend talking and drinking.",

Which is wtf because is has to set up for Fate/Stay night ( Fate/Zero is Far superior), but this hurts it from getting a 10/10, and thus got a 8/10 for story (im picky with endings, deal with it). Yet,every other category  was nearly flawless, the art budget is 2nd only to possibly sword art online for this year, and a score so epic that it puts lord of the rings to sham. TheCharacters each had their own motives, and wants which really added to the amazing story(besides the ending). All in all Fate/Zero does amazingly in the action Category with beautifully choreographed fight scenes, ranging from duels to dogfights, and on top of the action the amazing music and story create a truly epic and a dark piece. Fate/Zero ( IMO) is the must watch of 2012.",

            "content": "Fate/Zero Second Season Only\r\nFate/Zero's second season starts off in episode 14, straight off with action in the battle between Caster and Saber/Rider/Lancer and also the battle between Gilgamesh and Berserker. This sets the tone for the whole second season, giving it an even darker and more focused tone.\r\nStory: The story from here continues on as smoothly as the first season's story did. It picks up right where the first season left off, and keeps moving forward with as much momentum. I thought the flashback episodes of Kiritsugu's past gave for a very interesting subplot and gave better development for our favorite morally grey protagonist. Ican talk about the ending in two ways. If you have already seen Fate/stay night, then the ending gives the full explanation for the events leading up to Fate/stay night. If you haven't seen it, then you might think this ending a little anticlimactic. It's your choice as to watch this or Fate/stay night first, but I'd say watch this first.\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt: UFOtable does what UFOtable does... This is one of the best looking animes of all time. It has amazing character designs, being rather orthodox with small flares hearkening back to the servant's historical stories. The color pallet is very nice, with many dark colors outlining the backgrounds and lots of bright colors in the foreground and battle scenes especially.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound: The music, composed by Yuki Kajiura, is absolutely brilliant. This is one of her best works, complementing the great voice acting in the English dub and the original alike.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: The characters in this get much more development, as characters dying off calls for a more focused development of our main characters. The 180 that Kirei pulls and the back story of Kiritsugu are both great, and the development of Rider & Waver's friendship, coupled with the woes of Kariya Matou, made for some very memorable characters.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: The second season is much more focused and fast paced than the first, providing for a much more enjoyable experience overall. The action mixed with the character developments/interactions are definitely worth watching the show for, being complemented by the outstanding music and animation.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall (Both Seasons): Fate/Zero is an example of slow and steady winning the race. The first few episodes, while excruciatingly boring, provide for a great introduction into the world that is Fate. Although being very slow for the first half, it lays the foundation for the masterpiece that the second half made this show into. The only downsides of this show are the ending and the beginning, the beginning being rather slow, the ending being rather anticlimactic.",

            "content": "So Fate/Zero the prequel to Fate/Stay Night is utterly fantastic. It is more mature than it predecessor, great animation, fantastic fights and it has the distinction of being a story with no heroes in it. Because of this fact that there are no heroes everyone is ruthless and brutal in all out contest for ultimate power. Though like its predecessor the main theme deals with the nature of ideals. More importantly how far are you willing to go for your ideal and how much are you willing to sacrifice. However, if you sacrifice everything for an ideal, does it remain an ideal? Regardless i enjoyedthe raving psychopaths and the egomaniacs conduct their evil schemes to sacrifice mankind on a high altar for the own power but i enjoyed the grey characters all the more. All with their own ideals and wishes for a better world which makes it hilarious that they have to bathe their hands in increasing amounts of blood just so they can lie to themselves that they are working towards a better world. On its own Fate/Zero stands out but as a whole for the Fate Series it compliments the whole and corrects nearly all the problems of its predecessor. Even adding nuances which makes a second watch of the original series all the more worthwhile as histories and relationships which are never addressed are brought to the fore adding a new layer of complexity. This is one i will watch again and using this this as a springboard for the remake of Fate/Stat Night has made it all the better. 9/10",

I won't say more to the story because this is something you should experience without any kind of spoiler.\r\nI must give a warning to everyone who expects something more lighthearted from this Anime. If you are seeking fanservice, comedy or romancethen this Anime is clearly not for you. But even so, my biggest wish for everyone who reads this review is to give it a chance even if you're not a fan of action or a more serious plot. \\n\\n\r\nArt: I thought Kyoto Animation was the king of animation quality in this medium but guess I was wrong. Ufotable is presenting us satisfing, sharp pictures, strong and highlighted colors with gorgeously crafted animation . Surely, you won't be disappointed when it comes down to quality.\\n\\n\r\nSound: To be honest, I expected a better soundtrack for this Anime but there's no denying that it works perfectly with the action within the show. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: Probably the most unique, outstanding and realistic characters I've seen. This story is basically killing everyone else for your own ideals and dreams to come true. Otherwise you won't be able to win in this war and Fate/Zero deals alot with the psychologic struggles of the participants, not only the masters but also the servants, effectively developing their character without completely cutting off from the main event in the story. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Absolutely satisfing to watch, especially with that smooth animation. You'll definitely find enjoyment in the action and the whole tragedy which Fate/Zero mostly is.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: Absolutely outstanding, after completing this Anime I couldn't stop thinking about it since it had a great impact on me but for a good reason. \\n\\n\r\nMy last words for this review: Watch it, you won't regret anything.",

What a wasted opportunity.\r\nStory:\r\nWe pick up right where we left and as I hoped for, the second season gives us some more action (though I\u2019d still not call it an action festival by all means). The fronts are clarified and now we get to see the actual \u201ctournament\u201d happening. Of course this makes for some emotional scenes as, inevitably, some of the likeable characters bite the dust. All the leftover questions get answers and we finally receive a conclusion. I have to say though, I found it a bit confusing and unsatisfying. Sure, there isn\u2019t muchspace for Fate/Zero to end, as it is a prequel, but I would have liked something else better. That\u2019s not saying it was bad, just not what I would have preferred.\\n\r\n8/10\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nThere isn\u2019t anything left to say that I didn\u2019t already in my season one review, it\u2019s breathtaking.\\n\r\n10/10\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nPretty much the same here as well, though I came to really enjoy some of the voice actors, mainly those of Saber, Irisviel and Gilgamesh. They managed to really sell their respective characters to me. Otherwise, we still have the awesome soundtrack by Yuki Kajiura and new openining and ending, both solid performances (I did like the first opening a teeny tiny bit more).\\n\r\n10/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nThe main focus of this season is Kiritsugu, whose motives were established before, but not elaborated on. I found his backstory somewhat\u2026confusing. Suddenly we have a vampire zombie outbreak? That was truly bizarre and felt like it belonged in another show altogether. Putting that aside, it was still interesting and entertaining, but man was that bizarre. Sadly, Saber was still a little too moody for my taste, but at least she got some really cool highlight scenes. The Kirei-Gilgamesh-Tokiomi triangle got more intense and Kariya also got some more time. They have cut back a bit on Rider/Waver scenes, but that\u2019s okay, they had plenty exposition in the first season. In total, everybody received a reasonable continuation and those that got more spotlight were fleshed out more.\\n\r\n9/10\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nSeason two followed up the first one really well, even if it turned out a bit different from what I had imagined it would be. It still managed to keep most of the promises it made and had me glued in front of my monitor just as much as season one had. If I had to pick just one, I\u2019d probably go with the first, but I was not disappointed.\\n\r\n9/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\n9.2/10\\n\\n\r\n(Yes, it\u2019s a little shorter this time around, I didn\u2019t feel like repeating myself too much)",

            "content": "This review covers both seasons because they're both parts of the same story and reviewing them individually is stupid.\r\nFate/zero is yet another badly written anime by the shitty writer gen urobuchi and this review explains why.\r\nI'll talk about the good aspects of fate/zero and then the majority of the review will be the bad aspects (because there are too many) the mediocre aspects are anything that i don't end up mentioning\r\nThe Good:-\r\n1- Great Visuals that make the scenes and the backgrounds in the anime look great, but the anime doesn't have alot of animation in it.\r\n2- high quality instruments and sound effects, but the soundtrackitself is not that amazing in fact most of it is forgettable.\\n\\n\r\nThe Bad:-\\n\r\n1- the grail war in this anime never had any clear rules at all.\\n\r\nNo rules were mentioned at the beginning, instead the writer inserted any rules he wanted as the anime went on, even the basis of how magic works were unclear and he wrote them as he went on and made magic adjust to any given situation, which shows how badly written this anime is. An example of this is Kirei blocking Kiritsugu's origin bullets using command spells which doesn't make any sense. \\n\\n\r\n2- Character problems:-\\n\\n\r\nThe masters\\n\r\nKiritsugu Emiya: used to live happily in an island and after like five minutes it turns into hell with zombie infection, so cheesy and unrealistic, then he kills his father who raised him because he was only partly and indirectly responsible for the zombie infection and it was only by accident, it seems like the writer doesn't even know how people normally behave.\\n\\n\r\nKotomine Kirei: starts as a normal guy who works with tokiomi but after archer tells him that he seems intrested in kariya's tragedy he gets rewritten into a one-dimensional villan by instantly betraying tokiomi and seeking the grail that will help him understand himself, which is dumb since an individual normally understands himself more than anyone else, like i said earlier, the writer doesn't even know how people normally behave.\\n\\n\r\nMatou Kariya: who suffers to join the war so he can save sakura, but fails to do so and suffers even more, the only reason he exists is because the writer is obsessed with tragedy, kariya's story has no point, no meaning, it's a complete waste of time.\\n\\n\r\nEl-Melloi Archibald Kayneth: an uninteresting and boring asshole.\\n\\n\r\nThe servants\\n\r\nSaber (king arthur): ripping a character straight from historical books into your anime without bothering to include her background which is necessary to understand her unremarkable struggles in the anime, it seems like the writer has achieved new levels of bad storytelling.\\n\\n\r\nBerserker (Sir Lancelot):same problem as saber.\\n\\n\r\nCaster & his master(Gilles de Rais & Ryuunosuke): both of them don't even care about the grail, they simply spend their time killing kids and talking about how they enjoy killing kids, they're too delusional to even see the possible consequences of their actions like being the first ones killed in the grail war, which actually happens, but why are these characters in the anime anyways? oh yeah because they need SHOCKING scenes in it to attract viewers who only care about SHOCK FACTOR.\\n\\n\r\nArcher (gilgamesh): an egoistical asshole with hax god powers (which he used to kill rider) he doesn't have to worry about anything thanks to his hax powers, which lets him remain as an egoistical asshole with zero character development till the end, he could have also won the war straight from the beginning but he doesn't care about the war, why is he in this anime again? You can remove him from the anime without any changes.\\n\\n\r\n3- Shoehorned philosophy & themes.\\n\r\nThe writer adds unnecessary philosophy & themes to the anime with a very bad handling of them.\\n\\n\r\n- the anime wasted time by having rider and archer talk about how they think saber was not a good king, her life as a king was not shown in the anime and wasn't even part of the anime story in the first place, so why are they discussing it? It makes no sense, even if it made sense it still wouldn't matter because it doesn't affect the anime story, and why are they referring to her as king? she's a woman which makes her a queen.\\n\\n\r\n- after lancer's death saber complains about Kiritsugu's evil actions in the grail war, out of stupidity she forgets that he will use the grail to end war.\\n\r\nthen Kiritsugu claims that honor and valor are the cause of war and bloodshed, yet any one with half a brain can tell how stupid that claim is, the people who got honor from war did it by not commiting war crimes against anyone during war and did what it takes to reduce the losses and hatered of war after it was over, the war itself was not caused or started by them ,The people who cause or start a war usually do it for other reasons without bothering to think of the consequences, they can't do it because of honor since it has no way of starting a war by itself, there is always another reason behind it, if the writer knows of significant bloodshed caused by honor he should mention and explain it, otherwise it comes of as pretentious and stupid, another fact is almost everybody nowadays knows that war itself is bad and nobody think's that war itself is honorable or anything, yet Kiritsugu acts like he figured out something special, it's as if the writer lives in his own small world and keeps including topics in the anime that he himself doesn't even understand.\\n\\n\r\n4- The ending:-\\n\r\nWhich literally ruined the entire story with it's bullshit.\\n\r\nAt the beginning everyone talks about how the grail will grant any wish and nobody doubts it at all and they do all it takes to win the grail but then right at the end it's revealed that the grail won't actually grant any wish, more specificly it won't be able to grant the wish of the winner (Kiritsugu) and then it explodes and kills everything around him, this happened because the grail was cursed before fate/zero and that's only known in other parts of the fate franchise which you have to through to understand this because it wasn't mentioned or probably foreshadowed at any part of the fate/zero anime, if fate/zero doesn't even make sense on it's own and has many writing problems then how can it be any better than the rest of the fate (porn game) franchise? even if the grail got cursed, then why didn't any of the characters know about the curse or doubt the grail? it makes no sense either.\\n\r\nand this ending basically makes the entire anime feel like a pointless waste of time.\\n\\n\r\nKiritsugu, after bad writing destroyed everything he was doing without any explained reason is still happy because he saved and adopted shirou at the end which ties this with fate/stay night, yay i don't care.",

            "content": "[This review contains spoilers and concerns the whole Fate/Zero anime because it's hard to analyse each part alone knowing the whole serie, it's also very long if you want to read everything]\r\nI have to say, I'm not a big fan of Fate at all, but the thing that I like with the franchise and the reason why I think it has become so popular is the \"promise\" of Fate. I haven't read Fate/Zero novel so I'll be covering my experience of the anime, I also haven't read Fate/Stay Night VN but I've watched both F/SN 2006 and UBW (still reading HF's manga)\r\nI mean a battlebetween 7 masters each commanding a servant based on either History or Mythology with unique abilities including Magic and real weapons in a urban city, with high violence, intense lore, mysteries, mindgame etc. All of that to acquire an artefact which can grant any wish you want, IMAGINE THE POSSIBILITIES. How many characters and psychologies you can exploit and write with such a concept !\\n\\n\r\nAccording to MAL, Fate/Zero has an higher score and is overall better than Fate/Stay Night, the reason I often see is because the story is more mature and better written, but is that entirely the case ? Indeed the characters (Masters, Servants and side characters) are way more mature and relatable than Emiya and his Top Tier harem, but concerning the purpose each character has in the story, Stay Night feels way more realistic than Zero.\\n\\n\r\nSTORY : 8\\n\r\nLet's start with the plot  : It's the same for all Fate series (sorry it just bothers me that people to give an higher score to Zero plot than SN while it's the same story but with different characters and motivation and almost the same goal for some routes). The main difference being that Zero is prequel, so we know HOW the story is going to end, and that said, everything that happen in Zero must properly lead to the start of SN. But it isn't entirely the case. The pacing is good except some slower episodes, it's not the best thing that almost every character dies in the second part and make the whole kind of unbalanced. \\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS : 7.5\\n\r\nThat's also a point that people often use to promote Zero, all characters are different and interesting, with their own backstory, goals and personality. In this iteration, our main protagonist isn't the highschool kid Emiya Shirou but Velvet Wav... I MEAN SHIROU'S FATHER, EMIYA KIRITSUGU ! My bad it's just that usually the main protagonist is supposed to be the one with the highest screentime and which evolve and take decisions all along the serie so I mix them up in my mind ...\\n\r\nThat's the biggest problem of Zero, people acclaim it to be like \"The mature story which follows adults traumas during a war\" but I swear that half of the show is dedicated to the relation between Waver and Iskandar and it's not a bad thing, but why the hell Waver's not designated as \"Main\" on his MAL description ? To prove me right, everyone's according that the destruction of the grail should technically be the \"END\" of Fate/Zero, the moment where Kiritsugu discovers Shirou's body in the ruins of Fubuki is instantely the beginning of the \"Fate\" route of SN. Then, why there is an epilogue of Waver's story arc right after it, okay this is a prequel but let us at least finish the story with our main characters. And we got like this bittersweet boring dialogue between Waver and his uncles and aunts that goes nowhere and feels completely out of tone because it follows a tragic event of the city's destruction, and they're just like \"lul idk what happened but i'm proud of you kid\".\\n\\n\r\nThere is also an epilogue about Kirei's and Rin's future but it's informations we should already have because this is a prequel : we know that Kotomine is hiding Gilgamesh, we know that Rin's will be the head of the Tohsaka family and we know he will be his mentor. So why showing us Tokiomi's funeral if it's useless, just to show us that Rin's mother is alive and braindead ? Incredible, no one cares.\\n\r\n\"But we see a dialogue between Shirou and Kiri at the very end of Zero what do you mean\" Yeah a dialogue cut straight out of Fate/SN with the exact same lines. There are so much better way the could have shown us the end of Kiri story arc, he could have been doing a inner monologue of his regrets, burning a photo of him with Iri and Illya to represent that he wants to forgot his past, I don't know something original maybe.\\n\\n\r\nWell anyway, the cast overall is really great but some of them are really put in the shadow. The most developped ones being Waver as I said (even if he's a bunch of clich\u00e9s but still cool to watch progress), but of course Kiritsugu have a lot of development (recessed in 2 flashback episodes), Kirei is probably the most interesting character of the whole, each of his appearance feels either terrifying/mysterious and make you question yourself of how does this guy thinks and his interactions with Gil are the best dialogues in all of the serie. I agree all of the Masters have good designs and personality but the rest of the cast still basic tropes and really die like a bunch of idiots honestly, even if it's what's good in Fate : you can't escape your destiny, and death can happen at any moment. Tokiomi is handsome but you hate him just because he acts like a coward and his death just make him even more ridiculous but make Kirei more badass, Kayneth is an obnoxious fucker the serie wants you to hate and does this well (Lancer do not deserves him), Ryuunosuke is just a psycopath and dies so quickly it make you think how not a single cop could have shot this guy before (his interactions with Caster stills pretty nasty and fucked up but in a good way). Kariya should have been the most tragic one of the bunch and redempt the honor of the Matou family but ends up failing everything, he failed to honor is name, he choked his only love interest and failed to save Sakura before dying in front of her, good depiction of madness actually. He does not even seem like a Master when you think about how his servant his doing whatever the heck he wants to do and never use a single command spell by himself.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the Servants it's way better than Masters, Gilgamesh is sexy and sassy as ever but deserves more screentime with his clever and manipulative side and less moment of showing him as a pretencious OP guy who insults any person he meet. Rider is probably the best character in Fate/Zero, no debate possible : his design is cool, his over-the-top dumb muscle guy makes him funny as hell and badass, he has by far the best voice actor, he starts as a servant, progress as a king, dies as a legend, will be remembered as a friend, perfection. Lancer is such a cool guy with a lot of honor, not the most original of the bunch but his death is the most terrific and heartcrushing one of all. Does Assassin exists ? I'm sorry he was so invisible I thought he haven't done anything cool the whole show, at least he dies first, too bad his Noble Phantasm seemed original. Caster is such a FREAK ?! His voice is obnoxious but fit him so much, his obsession for Jeanne is touching me as French guy with a little patriotic side (If only Jeanne was a big tiddy blonde girl), Ufotable did a great job showing his inhumanity by doing hardcore killing of children. His death almost made me shed a tear while I was hating since his first appeareance, the dramatic end of a man who lost the figure who kept him sane, and so became the very thing he swore to destroy, very good hateful character. The plot twist of Berserker could have been great if done better, according to novel readers they were more flashback of his past, don't know why they cut it, he was really not interesting overall, just your average \"ARGHGHGHG KILL EVERYONE\" madman (that was not the image I had of Lancelot). \\n\\n\r\nAnd now we're reaching Saber, the main girl of our story, or the second one, no even the third one ? Wait how many characters were more interesting than her ? Yeah almost all of them ! Once again the part I hate the most about Zero, trying to convince me Saber is a main character while she clearly ISN'T ! She spend most of her screentime being mad for no reason, her interactions with Iri are cute but feel blank, she talked perhaps twice with Kiri ... \"Relation with your servant is the most important part to win the grail war\" as they say. She's just a shell of SN's Saber, she still has the same \"fight with honor\" but it's used in just like 2 eps, the kings reunion and after Lancer's death with Kiri. Those are also the best dialogue of the serie but I would have like to see more of her trying to live in Fubuki like Rider, preparing strategies, exposing her weakness and psychology, to be brief, more of the SN Saber, okay perhaps they didn't wanted to exploit Saber as much as in SN but then why is she the biggest character in both covers of s1 and s2, marketing obviously ? \\n\\n\r\nCharacters in Fate/Zero are diverse, it's true, but except Kiritsugu and Kirei, none of them feels different than what we already have in other Fate (except Rider best man). Side characters are mostly here to serve the plot and backstory, Iri/Maiya for Kiri (endearing but I expected better of them), Waver's fake family, Sola-Ui for Kayneth, Zouken for Kariya etc ... The show even reach a certain level of fanservice by adding Sakura, Ilya and Rin to the story, just because they also appear in SN. I agree of the backstory utility of Sakura and Ilya but Rin is useless to the main plot, while she even get a whole episode dedicated to her to just show us she was a strong mage since her childhood, no way dude. (saving those kids didn't stopped Ryuu/Caster and improving her relationship with her father while we know he's gonna die anyway is useless). The backstory of Kiritsugu brings a lot of depth to the character and it's truly original, but I can't help but think he just took by himself all the worst decisions that led him change his goal and abandon his past life, the turnover seems a bit drastic considering of what he'd done during the whole serie.\\n\\n\r\nART/ANIMATION : 9\\n\r\nIt's hell of good, I don't know what else I should say, it's just beautiful for 2010. Close-ups are always perfecly drawn, fighting scenes are epic, particle effect are used just as enough to make the magic feels real, Ufotable shows everyone CGI can look good if you know how to use it : Berserker, monsters, vehicles, spells, weapons looks gorgeous even in 3D (except a small problem of framerate sometimes). My only complain would that background art aren't that great and characters ESPECIALLY WAVER seems off-model with messed-up face half of the time during panoramic shots. \\n\\n\r\nMUSIC/SOUNDS : 8.5\\n\r\nI'm not an expert, but I can say music fits every situation perfectly. Dramatic when it needs to be, sad, mysterious, disturbing and most importantly COMPLETELY EPIC with all these chorus singing together. Not a single sound effects seems off if I remember well, but it's not the most important part of a serie dedicated on plot and characters. They could have more thrilling sound effect during death scenes though. Openings and endings are especially good and epic, I think I prefer the first Opening more than the second one because the animation and clips used feels more \"FATE\", second season's ed is one of the saddest Eds I've heard, no need to put flashback of Kiri/Iri relationship, just show all of it in a single ED and every shot is palpable, fantastic job. Voice acting is on point, all voices fit and do their job perfectly (especially Rider), Kirei and Kiri feels like empty human weapon, Iri is sweet and brainwashed, Caster and Kayneth sounds like sadistic fuckers, Waver is a relatable crying kid but a smart one, Saber and Gilgamesh put their all their throat into actions, and once again Iskandar the great is a badass omg !\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT : 9.5\\n\r\nEven after everything I said, I enjoyed the majority of Fate/Zero, but mostly the second season more than the first one, more dramatic, it contains better dialogues, better fight scenes and conclusion of character arcs (and doesn't have a filler episode).\\n\r\nOf coures the second season feels better because it use properly all elements the first season set up. But the anticlimatic ending is probably the reason why I could never give Fate/Zero a 10. For those still thinking you can start the Fate franchise by Zero : Absolutely not in any case. It was created as a prequel and SN's plot twists are more interesting than Zero's plot twists, the main reason a part of the old cast is still there is because the serie is adressed to Fate fans and not newcomers. Fate/Stay Night starts with a colossal fight of 2 hidden figures which you think have destroyed the city, but at the end of Zero it tells you that they never fought at all and city's fire is due to the grail's implosion. And thus Maiya, Ilya and Saber died for nothing because Kiritsugu turned back his mind. It becomes a story about how someone can fail because of him ambitions but it's not the kind of story that appeal to me, I'm sorry, or at least not this way.\\n\\n\r\nThis is not the most analytical review possible but I put in what I wanted to say about Fate/Zero (or what I could remember about a week after finishing it). \\n\r\nEnglish is not my first language so I hope it's still readable by any audience (otherwise I'll be pissed)\\n\\n\r\nFINAL SCORE : 9 \\n\r\nPerhaps I will come back to Zero years later and take it down to 8, or perhaps take it up to 10 I don't know. A rewatch is always possible and I'll do it when I find the time, thank you if you have read this (because it took me some time and is kind of messed up)\\n",

            "content": "Prior to watching this series, the only exposure I had with fate was with the original FSN anime and the UBW movie by Deen. That is to say, they didn\u2019t leave a good impression for me. After watching Fate/Zero however, I can say there aren\u2019t many series quite like it. On the surface, it\u2019s about mages that bring ancient heroes to the modern and fight against each other for the right to have a wish granted. However, the tale is deeply enthralling and excellently written and I would liken it to Shakespearean tragedies. To judge this series and any series by story alone doesn\u2019t dothem justice, for what makes a story truly great is the writing and narrative. All of this paired with high quality production. The production of the series is truly exceptional. At a glance, it presents cinema picture standards, fluid animation, great details and boasts great sound. \\n\\n\r\nMuch of the series perspective is put into dialogues, and lots of it. A large portion of the dialogue in the beginning consists of explaining the world and rules of Fate. As we get further into the series, the dialogue becomes much more meaningful to building characters, understanding them and their relationships. It does much to the benefit of the series, but at the same time it can be a bit too excessive. There are pros and cons to this. In cases like Caster\u2019s conversations with his master and Gilgamesh\u2019s exchange of words with Kotomine Kirei, their dialogues build so much of their characters and relationships. On the other spectrum, there are points where there isn\u2019t enough detail given from the dialogue but mostly they can be deduced from piecing things together. Whether or not it strikes a good balance, I will address it later in the review.\\n\\n\r\nWhat is truly remarkable about the series is that every detail in the writing counts. Every episode serves a purpose, every key character plays a role and every event results and leads to another from key decisions and set circumstances. In the beginning, we are presented brief introductions of each characters and have some idea of how they are like, but we truly begin to understand them as the series goes on. \\n\\n\r\nFor the ancient heroes, their respective backstories are often told through imagery and play a key role to where they stand. While loosely referenced, if you have done readings on works like The Epic of Gilgamesh, The Arthurian legends, Alexander The Great, The Pursuit of Diarmuid and Gr\u00e1inneand, Joan of Arc, etc., they will further your understanding of the servant characters. Assassin is the only one who doesn\u2019t receive much backstory because he doesn\u2019t play much of a key role. And while Gilgamesh\u2019s backstory remains a mystery throughout the series, his character\u2019s interpretation is very likened to the actual Gilgamesh in the Epic prior to experience the loss of his friend Enkidu. If you have not read those works, I highly recommend them as fine pieces of literature and you will only enjoy these characters\u2019 further.\\n\\n\r\nThe masters that control their servants(heroes), all have unique qualities and personalities that are circumstantially matched with their servants. Kiritsugu and his servant Saber have an interesting dichotomy in characters, while both do have the intentions of \u201cgood\u201d and a desire wish for something impossible. Waiver is a timid boy, brought down by the discrimination of half mages by pure-blood mages and that enters the war by chance upon finding out his pure-blood teacher Kayneth enters the war. Rider was supposed to be Kayneth\u2019s servant but through chance, Waiver takes him instead and Kayneth is left with another servant. Through these circumstances, Waiver\u2019s relationship with his servant allows him to develop as a character and Kayneth\u2019s new servant conflicts with his own ideals and unintentionally charms his wife. Kariya, who has abandoned the life of mages enters in hopes of saving the child of the woman he loves and holds a personal vendetta against Tokiomi, the husband of said woman. Kotomine tries to find purpose in life and is recruited by his father to help Tokiomi win the war. Ryuunosuke is a serial killer who happens to be part of the war by chance, but is the only one of the characters I\u2019d consider an \u201ceasy\u201d villain. All of these characters including the servants and their perspectives/ideology are masterfully interwoven in this tale of tragedy.\\n\\n\r\nThere are a few episodes that are somewhat diverted from the attention of the war, but they do serve a purpose. Rin\u2019s episode furthers the perspectives of Tokiomi and Kariya, all the while experiencing the gruesome behaviors of Caster\u2019s master. Kiritsugu\u2019s past is an interesting part of the series and does an excellent job to further unravel the mysteries of his character, following from his actions taken to killing Kayneth, his wife and Lancer. Episode 19 is my favorite episode of the series because of its powerful presentation of his tragic character. This further impacts the ending of the series as he eventually reaches the end of his farce. Episode 19 also shows how well the series can present itself without heavily relying on dialogue.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, for a medium that\u2019s exclusive to visual arts, I\u2019d expect that storytelling in anime should make good use of visual imagery. That isn\u2019t to say this series doesn\u2019t have any. It certainly does contain strong and impactful imagery. The flashback scenes of ancient heroes and events that take place towards the end of the series are full of them. Personally I would prefer that it used it more from the beginning of the series as the dialogue endlessly explains so much, for better or worse. Does it extend to the point that it disrespects the intelligence of the viewer? That\u2019s difficult to say, because I\u2019m sure it was done with the intention of easing in the audience who is unfamiliar with Fate. Still, even though at times there is an excessive use of dialogue to explain things in great detail, it doesn\u2019t do too much to disrespect the audience\u2019s intelligence even though there are times when they explain too much.  Even so, I don\u2019t consider this a flaw because it is just the series way of presenting itself. I may not agree with the presentation 100%, but it is still exceptionally executed.\\n\\n\r\nWhile Fate/Zero does help me appreciate the FSN story a bit more, which is the purpose of this prequel, in some ways it is being held back. I personally think the series can do well as a standalone but it\u2019s by no means any less exceptional. The ending to Fate/Zero is an inevitable impactful tragedy and leaves a shining glimmer of hope. Ironically, that ray of hope does not necessarily include a well written sequel according to my prior experience of the Fate series. \\n\\n\r\nI don\u2019t believe any work is \u201cperfect\u201d but Fate/Zero is no short of a masterpiece among anime. Very few have I seen boast such a well written and impactful tale and I recommend this series be watched many times over, because it is just that good.\\n",

It also changesome stuff from the previous series, but the direction and development here makes that they have little in common besides the characters and setting. I'd recommend completly skipping Fate/Stay Night (2006) to not spoil anything here, as the series cannot be compared you really don't benifit a bit from watching it before, just lose some good discoveries that would make Fate/Zero experience way more intense - and as for the main timeline events, other entries will tell them better too.\\n\\n\r\nFate/Zero is intense, dark and tragic, the characters have their good and their bad and sure will make you anxious to keep watching as the development is fast but also cruel. Outstanding story and characters, very good art and sound.",

            "content": "Machiavellianism - \"the employment of cunning and duplicity in statecraft or in general conduct\".\r\nThe term comes from Italian Renaissance writer Niccol\u00f2 Machiavell's publication The Prince and was written as an ideology of how a leader should rule. It is a theme that Fate/Zero demonstrates in it's story and dialogue with flying colors. \r\nIf you aren't familiar with the Fate series, then you should know that every Fate story revolves around something called the Holy Grail War. The Holy Grail War is a competition, a grand battle royale, for the use of the Holy Grail - a wish grating device. It wasn't originally the intent ofthe creators of the device for there to be a competition, rather the Holy Grail decided this. The grail picks 7 magi in the world that it feels have the potential to be its owner, fits them with a hyper powerful \"servant\" that they must sustain with their own mana, and not until all but one are dead or forfeited, is a victor decided.\\n\\n\r\nThis is important because the Grail War sets the tone for the events that ensue and the big picture ideas that emerge. These include conversation between priest and Grail contestant Kirei and self-directing servant Gilgamesh about Kirei's lack of own will. In these conversations Gigamesh (another magi's servant) attempts to bring out the latent self that has been repressed by the clergy, having lived his entire life in selfless dedication to his duties.\\n\\n\r\nAnother key theme event is the king's discussion or a meeting between servants saber, archer, and rider who were all great kings in life - king Arthur of Britain, Alexander the Great, and Gilgamesh. In this discussion, while they may disagree about a number of things, Gilgamesh and Alexander the Great are in agreement on one thing; that the way king Arthur ruled was incorrect, that a leader should be driven on their own ambitions and that the best kings do not get tied up in ethics, but drive the world forward with their vision. This is precisely what Machiavelli argues a successful leader should look like in The Prince.\\n\\n\r\nOther strongly Machiavellian undertones come up with grail contestant Kiritsugu and his methods to achieve his vision for the world. He is a known \"magus killer\" that on the outside looks like a man who will do anything for a job, his internal motives and ideas unclear. He is a contestant that will use any means coldly and disconnectedly to achieve his end goal, which is ironically a world free of needless fighting and death. \\n\\n\r\nThe story escalates as anti-hero Kiritsugu and self-seeking antagonist Kirei move to claim the grail for themselves. As the story approaches its climax the Machiavellian undertones that have been brooding come to full focus with a doozy of an ending. If this story got me thinking something, it is the value of the self, the self-interested, and the self-willed. What is the world, what is great power, if there is no one great there to use that power and give the world form? Someone has to DO something at the end of the day, whence comes the not \"everyone can be saved\" language as is the ringing cry of Kiritsugu and his successor Emiya. Some of the real genius of the story is how Kiritsugu's character skirts so close to being truly Machiavellian. He is someone who without hesitation will kill some people to save just slightly more people. \\n\\n\r\nThat is the shape the main vein of the story takes. There are many sub-plots, one of the more interesting being the case of grail contestant Kariya. The old mage family of Matou use parasities, something of a disease to strengthen the magic potential of the weak. What makes Kariya interesting is his \"berserker\" nature, that he will run his health to pieces, allowing the parasites to near kill him, so that he can save his sister Sakura. I will say no more, but he meets a nasty end for his unrestrained willingness to help her.\\n\\n\r\nThe story and dialogue are among some of the best I have seen an anime. The dialogue is adapted from Urobuchi's light novel of the same name. The novel gives insight into the internal life of some of the characters, which helps clarify some events that are convoluted in the anime, especially certain parts of the ending. The visuals are are also great, the action and fight scenes being top notch blockbuster affair. Dark colors are used throughout and black clothing is adorned by Kiritsugu and company (Saber included). \\n\\n\r\nHopefully, if you haven't watched Fate/Zero yet or started it, but haven't finished, this perks your interest. The universe of Fate to me is best described as \"good fun\", and Fate/Zero is no exception, to me being a stronger entry then the original Fate/stay night, and upon further inspection, yields more then one may have expected.",

The anime had me hooked after the first episode and each episode after that just got better and better. The story is about Masters fighting with their companion Servants (historical figures such as King Arthur, Alexander the Great, Gilgamesh and many more). These characters fight for the Holy Grail, an omnipotent device that can grant any wish. I consider this anime a 10/10. I became a fan immediately and I enjoyed watching each episode. The STORY was awesome, the CHARACTERS were awesome, the ANIMATION was awesome. This anime is also a LONG SERIES with movies,visual novels, so it's an awesome series as well. I recommend this anime to all anime fans. It had a lot of action, magic, and dark/sophisticated themes. \\n\\n\r\nFINAL SCORE 10/10",

            "content": "Undoubtedly, Fate/Zero was one of the best anime I've ever seen ...\r\nThe anime is a prequel to \"Fate / Stay Night.\" The story tells about 7 wizards fighting in a war for the Holy Grail, which is an object that holds desires. But, to fight this war, is necessary to invoke servants who are heroic spirits of other ages. The servants are divided into 7 different classes: Saber, Rider, Berserker, Archer, Assassin, Lancer and Caster .\r\nWe are introduced to a serious and mature environment where we are shown the interests of each one of the war. Each has a different reason to fight in thewar, Fate / Zero gives us a sense of surprise at any time, for there is no protagonism, which means that any time anyone can be eliminated from war. The characters are extremely charismatic, and they are well exploited in the anime.\\n\\n\r\nOne thing that is very common during the series, is the debate about ideal, as each character has its own personality and different thoughts.\\n\r\nThe first cour is a little slower, it's like the preparation of the war, since the second is busiest, is the application of the strategies formulated in the first cour.\\n\\n\r\nThe art of anime pleased me greatly. Speaking in the animation, CG in general is very well applied, only had a poorly made here and there, but nothing that has muddled. The Ufotable is one of the few studios that knows merge 2d along with CG. The fights are also very well animated.\\n\\n\r\nFate / Zero is a mix of fantasy with tragedy, I could not expect less Gen Urobuchi. The anime soundtrack is wonderful! one of the best, and fits perfectly with the theme of the anime. I'm not handing out 10, but this one deserves!",

            "content": "Story:  8.97/10\r\nBecause this is a prequel, the overall story of this show is told a dark and violent tragedy with fight scenes used only as spectacle to further emphasize the fact that the characters are fighting in a never-ending war that is as pointless as it is cruel. With the unique setup of this show, legendary heroes and a battle royal over the Holy Grail, the plot takes an intriguing turn and pits the ideology of each master and servant against each other. \r\nThe point made earlier about this being a tragedy is made evident by the story when the viewer realizes that allthe characters have nothing to gain in this war that they have pinned their hopes on. With the exception of the main antagonists (Tohsaka, Gilgamesh, Caster, and Kirei Kotomine), the majority of participating masters and servants view the Grail as a means to their goal and one that can be achieved by hard work alone. The one thing that turns the show from being a \u201cdark\u201d show, into a tragedy is the fact that the necessary sacrifice for the Grail makes it obsolete. This sequentially gives the message that, dreams and goals can\u2019t be fulfilled by the means of an object or a miracle. The other blatant message, given the dark themes of the show is that: the ones who care less are the ones who have less to lose. The prime example of this in the show involves the primary antagonists,(Kirei Kotomine, and Gilgamesh)and how they are in the war just for the sake of participating/collecting the Holy Grail. This lack of motivation and risk give them a sense of security in which, they don\u2019t have to risk everything for the Grail, because they have no interest in it.\\n\r\nTo contrast the aforementioned characters, Kiritsugu Emiya and Saber are the characters who have the most to lose. Kiritsugu is fighting in the Grail war for a kinder and gentler world, while Saber is trying to save her people and stop the collapse and death of her beloved kingdom. The message that is displayed as the most prominent internal conflict is that of \u201cAt what cost?\u201d This question reminds us all that there is no greater gift than the gift of life, and that there is no worth in sacrificing a loved one for any cause, when that cause is against inevitable when concerning any society or community of humans.\\n\r\nOverall, the plot is a psychological masterpiece involving the legendary heroes of past, and the ideals and psyche of each of those characters. The one major flaw that holds the story form being an addicting story is the singular fact that, Fate Zero was a prequel. Most of the tension and suspense is dialed down because of the fact that, if the viewer has already seen the sequel, than the ending should already be known. Despite this, the third-person point of view presents the show in a way that doesn\u2019t rehash stated facts from the sequel and adds on unique interactions that we don\u2019t usually see in anime.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:  9.78/10\\n\r\nOn the subject of characters, Fate Zero easily has one of the biggest casts in all of anime, but one that isn\u2019t generic and brings unique interactions to the show. A unique point can be made that there is no blatant attempt at a \u201cMain\u201d character as the show presents itself from a perspective of an outsider, and deals with the internal struggles in a way that gives the viewer every perspective when gazing into the psyche of each individual Master or Servant. \\n\r\nSaber is one of the more beloved characters within the anime community within the last 10 years, and is well deserving of that position. At times while watching her, viewers often feel humbled in her presence because of the general formality and manner that she puts on as a Servant, and as the King of Knights. Saber\u2019s motivation for being in the war is mainly driven by her eternal dream of saving her kingdom from ruin. This is a really thought provoking motivation in its oven way, because of how the viewer grows to wonder, how would one go as to achieving this goal. Unlike the methods of Caster, Kirei, and Gilgamesh, the methods in which Saber uses to achieve her goal, have a restraint that helps to make the battles a waging of strategy and ideals instead one of brute force and power.\\n\\n\r\nArt/Animation:  9.98/10\\n\r\nThe unique combination of lighting, animation, gorgeous background visuals, and attention to small details and effects help to glorify this show as the crowning jewel of Ufotable. The unique visual appeal that raises Fate Zero above all other anime is the breathtaking lighting that put major emphasis on the \u201cGlory\u201d side of the struggle for the Holy Grail. The lighting that they use on the background visuals make you feel insignificant and minuscule, and wonder how much of the Type-Moon world is in the \u201cunknown\u201d. As with all of Ufotable\u2019s works the animation is a guaranteed factor that is often overlooked and taken for granted because of how Ufotable\u2019s reputation speaks for itself with other works, namely (Fate Stay Night Unlimited Blade Works). The former two works slightly out-shadow Fate Zero in terms of sheer animation, but are held back by the fact that the background lighting doesn\u2019t match the tone of the show at times. With Fate Zero, the golden and dark themes of the show help to glorify the Holy Grail, while the crimson and grey themes that are present in Unlimited Blade Works, slow down the tone and pacing of the story. Small visual effects like the invisible air on Saber\u2019s sword are fine details that animation studios never pay any attention to, because of the extravagant budget that it would take to produce such a work. Luckily, Ufotable has been one of the better funded studios as of late and has had the luxury of working for the writer, Gen Urobuchi and his masterpieces of idealistic deconstructions, with Fate Zero and Puella Magi Madoka Magica.\\n\\n\r\nSound:  9.39/10\\n\r\nBack to the original 2006 Studio Dean Adaptation, the main problem with the soundtrack by Kenji Kawai was the lack of \u201cEpic\u201d and \u201cBreathtaking\u201d soundtracks. With the composer as Yuki Kajiura, this soundtrack is as beautiful and elegant as it is noble and grand-scale. This sort of music is associated with royalty and spectacular battles. \\n\r\nAs far as criticisms go, the only one I have is that the soundtracks \u201cExcalibur\u201d and the instrumental version of \u201cManten\u201d weren\u2019t in the Fate Zero Official Soundtrack. The \u201cExcalibur\u201d soundtrack has one of the greatest vocal performances by a choir and has the tone of a soundtrack that blows away listeners while they are enveloped by the majestic tone of the song. With Manten, the vocal version is already amazing in its own respect, but the piano version brings a sense of elegancy and beauty to the song that can only personified by the dignity and manner in which royalty act. \\n\r\nOther themes, such as \u201cLet the Stars Fall Down\u201d display and put the spotlight on the fast paced action and spectacle that the viewer is experiencing. While the aforementioned soundtrack is glorious in its own way, \u201cThis Day and Never Again\u201d is a great example of a amazing soundtrack that puts the emphasis on the cruel aspects of this show. The soundtrack is a vocal representation of what the characters have to gain and how it is insignificant in comparison with what they have put out as a gamble.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:  9.24/10\\n\r\nAs far as pure enjoyment goes, this was one that was a pleasure to watch, and one that will be memorable as being in my top 7 anime of all time. This show felt like a masterpiece to me, and will forever be a classic example of action that doesn\u2019t have to follow the generic Shounen action formulas present in the majority of anime.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:  9.47/10\\n\r\nIf the thought process going into this show is that of a Popcorn/pure action series, this doesn\u2019t fit the bill, but for viewers who like to indulge and sit back after a long day of work. Although, this is great anime to drift off into, a certain level of attention has to be given to this series to enjoy it thoroughly. If you are a fan of thought provoking action and suspenseful plot, this will be a masterpiece that you will enjoy and remember for years to come.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "This review is going to be my review of Fate/Zero as a whole, not just the second season.\r\nThis show was epic.  It was able to create some extremely interesting characters and throw them all together into a battle where they need to interact, have philosophical discussions, and ultimately see whose ideals are the best.  The animation of this show is freaking gorgeous.  The soundtrack is pretty dece.  The characters are great (although there are definitely some weaker ones).  So many great things can be said about this show, and I'm sure they have been said many times, so I amgoing to focus on the things I didn't like.\\n\\n\r\nThe first season fails to give the audience (at least in my experience) a character to latch onto.  It is not until mid second season, where I think the show went from \"good\" to \"great\", that I really started to understand the motivations behind certain characters' beliefs and actions.  Other than that, my only complaint about the show is the fact that the story was almost presented in a way that assumes the audience is aware of the different elements in this magical universe already.  This became extremely apparent towards the end of the show, when it became increasingly hard to understand.  I get that this is a prequel, and many of the viewers already know how it is going to end, but I did not.  I think, since \"Fate/Stay Unlimited Bladeworks\" came out after, they they should have just started over from scratch and assumed their viewers were new to the franchise.  Again, this is just my opinion.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, though, Fate/Zero was a fantastic show.  It had awesome characters, animation, and dialogue all thrown together in an interesting thought-provoking way.  I would definitely recommend it.\\n\\n\r\nSentence: I look forward to watching \"Fate/Stay Unlimited Bladeworks\".\\n\\n\r\nNote: After I finished, I went to the internet to try to accumulate my thoughts, and I came across this video talking about the possibly nihilistic stance the show takes.  It really helps tie everything in the vast story of the show together into one condensed video-essay.  I highly recommend watching it here if you have already finished the show:\\n\\n\r\nhttps://youtu.be/rUT038OSEu8",

Not much to say here, it simply is one of the best visual experiences out there.\r\nThis makes the anime so enjoyable that I would say that even though there are some minor flaws, this is a must watch for almost everybody, and if you like action andyou haven't watched this series yet, do so now.

            "content": "I didn't expect much of this anime to start with. What a nice surprise it was after all! Hahaha...\r\nSo I will make this quick. Do you like the old myths about mighty heroes like King Arthur, Alexander the Great or stories about Holy Grail or old legends about long forgotten gods? Then this anime is just for you. I started to watch it exactly for that reason and found out that there is much more than that.\r\nAfter the first episode I was a bit confused about everything. What the hell is this all about? However after some episodes you'll start to love all the characters.You cannot simply say which one is a bad guy and who's a hero. The background of each character is kinda mysterious but eventually you'll discover more about them and find some deep connections and very interesting philosophical\u00a0 problems.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is good enough too. The fights are really dynamic and you can see a combination of a modern style fighting (pistols, explosives, radio etc.) and fantasy style combat (magic, swords,...). But that's not all, now imagine an awesome epic music in the background....oooh my dayum. Yes, truly a masterpiece. (btw the OST contains some songs from a famous amazing Japanese group Kalafina, that just got me)\\n\\n\r\nThe most valuable thing for me was the ending. The personal stories of the characters escalates and you look inside the minds of two most badass characters of this anime. The conclusion is truly incredible. Nobody saw it coming I guess. I was just speechless thinking about the point of the whole plot. Don't wanna spoil but this anime has a really deep message for all of us. \\n\\n\r\nDon't live like waiting for a miracle. Don't expect that something will change your entire life, that you can make a light with darkness, that you can sacrifice goodness in your life in order to win a bigger one. Your dreams are not something far away, it is what you are.... \\n\\n\r\nPS: Not gonna watch the other Fate anime. This one was written by a different author and animated by a different studio. From what I've read about the rest, they are not worth watching.",

            "content": "(Please note: This review covers both the first and second half of Fate/Zero)\r\nOK\u2026..I\u2019m going to be honest. I wasn\u2019t really a fan of the Fate/stay Night anime adaptation and I probably would\u2019ve never watched that show if I didn\u2019t hear how great Fate/Zero was. It could be that it was made by a different animation studio, different production as Aniplex was in part of that, Urobuchi is responsible of the series composition and yet the weirdest thing about this is that the director Ei Aoki\u2026.directed Girls Bravo. (So, that person moved on up from that.) Knowing that all the disappointment that Fate/stay Night is andeven though the movie Unlimited Blade Works actually worked for a little bit and prequels aren\u2019t always guaranteed gold, there could be a way for this to work.\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe story of Fate/Zero takes place ten years prior to the events of Fate/stay night, detailing the events of the 4th Holy Grail War in Fuyuki City. The War of the Holy Grail is a contest in which seven mages summon seven Heroic Spirits to compete to obtain the power of the \"Holy Grail,\" which grants a miracle to each member of the winning duo. After three inconclusive wars for the elusive Holy Grail, the Fourth War commences.\\n\\n\\n\r\nFounded by the Einzbern, Makiri, and T\u014dsaka families centuries ago, the Einzbern family is determined to achieve success after three consecutive failures, no matter the cost. As a result, they have elected to bring the hated magus killer, Kiritsugu Emiya, into their ranks, despite his methods and reputation as a skilled mercenary and a hitman who employs whatever he can use to accomplish his goals. Though Kiritsugu had once wanted to become a hero who could save everyone, he has long since abandoned this ideal upon realizing that saving one person comes at the cost of another's life. For the sake of humanity, he will ruthlessly destroy anything and anyone who threatens the peace of others.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, Kiritsugu finds himself deeply torn between the love he has found for his new family - his wife Irisviel and their daughter Illya - and what he must do to obtain the Holy Grail. Meanwhile, Kiritsugu's greatest opponent appears in the form of Kirei Kotomine, a priest who cannot find any sense of fulfillment in his life and sets his sights on Kiritsugu as the possible answer to the emptiness he feels.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nI can think of other reasons why the show is hard to get through mainly through the first episode, which gives a lot of exposition, which I may remind you is a 46 minute episode (as in, that\u2019s the length of any Walking Dead, Breaking Bad, Mad Men or any other TV drama you saw) and it also helps to watch that episode again but in smaller scales but after that, the show is actually quite the darker tale that I actually wanted from the last series, meaning it doesn\u2019t pussyfoot around the hero angle and actually display some consequences that people make when playing that role as in, to save millions of people, you have to kill a few and often that can backfire on you and it will make your choices even harder. The way they set up these servants fighting for the Holy Grail War almost feels like a sophisticated version of Mortal Kombat and yeah, things do get violent but equally of gory violent and psychologically violent. The philosophies display in the show does got me questioning the choices that most of the characters make, even with the Servants and what they\u2019ll do with the Holy Grail. Some want it for fame, fortune, to be on top of the world, or even just to be the fair ruler that the people will love but realizes that they can turn on you and go against you.\\n\\n\r\nThere is a rich and unique assortment of characters throughout the series as they are centered on more than just one character at a time like Kiritsugu Emiya and I find his journey in the series of what it means to be a hero and battling to win the Holy Grail with his servant Saber more so than I did with Shirou in stay night only while I detect some traits from Shirou in Kiritsugu but he\u2019s less annoying than him and actually has good meaning even though you\u2019ll question his methods in some episodes. Kirei Kotomine makes a captivating antagonist of the show, even when his antagonism doesn\u2019t show until the second half of the series but nevertheless a formidable opponent to Kiritsugu and shows a great threat to him. At first, I though Waver Velvet was annoying in the first few episodes but luckily after they introduce Rider, one of the more charismatic characters on the show, Waver was actually tolerable although there isn\u2019t anything to hate on him. BTW, you got to love how Rider is in the show, compared to Saber (who is more guarded much like she was in F/SN) and Gilgamesh (also fuck Gilgamesh\u2026..); Yeah, not a big fan of him. I know he\u2019s the intentional asshole in the show but damn, he just pisses me off but yet the character that really pisses me off is Ry\u016bnosuke Ury\u016b, the master who\u2019s a child killer and overall sick fuck, and while he is a character that is intentionally unlikable, I kept thinking \u201cOh, please, somebody kill this guy already!\u201d While I can explore some more characters in the show, but it would take forever Irisviel (who I really did like among with her and Saber bonding), Kayneth El-Melloi Archibald (prick; also his wife Sola-Ui Nuada-Re Sophia-Ri\u2026.weird name by the way\u2026a bitch), Maiya Hisau (Kiritsugu\u2019s partner-in-crime and lover??), Lancer (worthy Servant), Tokiomo Tohsaka (father of Rin Tohsaka and a bastard), Caster (the weird creepy servant to Sick Fuck) and Kariya Matou (the one guy I really felt bad for in this).\\n\\n\r\nThe animation from Ufotable, whose credits I only know are the Garden of Sinners movie series (really need to see those movies BTW), and the contemporary anime art style definitely surpass most recent anime out and this was made in 2011. The glorious animation in the action scenes are amazing, especially in all its HD glory. The character designs and everything in general feel slicker and cleaner than what Studio DEEN did with F/SN.\\n\\n\r\nYuki Kaijura does it again with the score as this is where she shines as the music gives the heavily orchestral epic tone that compliments its scenes, whether it be the dialogue scenes or the action scenes, the music gives it more strength than it already has. The opening and ending songs is what really capture me with LISA doing the first opening, \u201cOath Sign\u201d, which in my opinion a much better song than \u201cCrossing Field\u201d and the first ending with Eir Aoi\u2019s \u201cMEMORIA\u201d was easily one of my favorite ending themes. The 2nd opening \u201cTo the Beginning\u201d performed by Kalafina was also another highlight for them considering their ending song for Madoka is already golden.\\n\\n\r\nNow for the English dub, which I got to say my thank you to Aniplex of America, Bang Zoom Entertainment, Neon Alley, and Tony Oliver because this was the best dub I have heard all year in 2013. When you heard that cast list announcement, people were going to be psyched for this as they put out the names. All the performers did a phenomenal job on the dub and whatever little flaws they got, they are mostly forgettable or something I really don\u2019t give a damn about. Matthew Mercer, Bridget Hoffman, Crispin Freeman, Lucien Dodge, Johnny Yong Bosch, Dan Woren, Jamieson Price, and Kari Wahlgren taking over the role of Saber (3rd English voice actress to do so). Also, I\u2019m really glad that this show got a dub because most of the show is dialogue-driven while having action in it.\\n\\n\r\nFINAL VERDICT: Fate/Zero has done the inevitable by proving to be better than its successor and being bold to go into that dark direction that was heavily needed. The show, like Berserk, is another example of being an epic anime although going into it will be a struggling journey. Those who were disappointed with stay night will definitely love this show.",

            "content": "Fate/Zero 2 is the concluding half to the Fate/Zero saga and one of the most entertaining seasons of any action anime ever. With a cast of fun characters, amazing animation, and some great fight scenes sprinkled throughout, as well as some of the most intense drama you could ask for, Fate/Zero 2 doesn\u2019t screw around with conventions of the genre and instead carves out its own private niche from which many action anime would do good to analylze.\r\nFate/Zero 2 continues where the last season left off with the big battle between everyone and Caster raging in the river. It\u2019s a visual spectacle, but doesn\u2019t setthe perfect tone for the rest of the series. Now, I am not going to detract anything from the tone of the show changing dramatically (the big action scene is the biggest of the series, it mellows out and becomes one on one battles the rest of the show) because this second season was supposed to be part of a single, full season. But the animation department wanted to beef Fate/Zero\u2019s second half up so released it later because of that.\\n\\n\r\nDespite that, the show is not as action heavy as it is made out to be. The series has some excellent action sequences, but hits its stride more so during moments of intense drama than fighting. None of the fight scenes are particularly memorable but for the final one between Kiritsugu and Kirei which I found to be very well done. The rest are good, but never anything you\u2019ll talk about later. Meanwhile, the sequences of intense drama are so much more involving and, especially in later episodes, they leave you at the edge of your seat wondering what is going to happen next. These scenes are very brutal both emotionally and violence-wise. Anybody who has seen episode twenty-four concerning Kiritsugu, his wife, and his daughter know exactly what I am talking about and probably had their mouths agape, as did I, during that scene.\\n\\n\r\nThis season expands on Kiritsugu\u2019s past through two episodes that don\u2019t really fit in at all. While I appreciate the thought of adding that extra layer to Kiritsugu\u2019s already badass character, the placement in the middle of the season was not particularly smart and broke things up too much. On top of that, the two episodes were probably the weakest of the twelve of the season. They weren\u2019t bad, but they were average. I could see them as OVA\u2019s more so than part of the series proper.\\n\\n\r\nOne thing I can appreciate about Fate/Zero as a whole is the fact it is brutal and unapologetic about it. It is a series with a fairly adult tone and kills characters you grow to like without giving us a long drawn out monologue or something of the like to see him/her go. Probably the one episode that will always come to me when I think Fate/Zero is the one where Kayneth is in a wheelchair and has given his command spells to Sola. This was an episode that had the drama down, it had brutal execution, and it reminded me that I was watching a no-nonsense anime. And that is truly what I appreciate from this series is the fact it doesn\u2019t treat me like a child and announce everything going on, it doesn\u2019t slow down to have characters talk about their pasts and teach lessons. While it does have these elements, they aren\u2019t the slow going you expect from action series. The clip is fast enough to keep you interested.\\n\\n\r\nAs I said in my previous review of Fate/Zero, I love the wide array of very distinct personalities the series provides and the way they play off each other. That is one of the strong suits of Fate/Zero, if not the greatest strength of the show. No two characters are alike and none are just cookie-cutter or cardboard. While some are weaker than others, they are distinct, and those distinctions are what drives the series forward.\\n\\n\r\nFor those looking for a huge finale, you will be sorely disappointed. The final two episodes are very, very good but, other than a maybe five minute fight between Kirei and Kiritsugu, there is no real physical combat. As far as wrapping everything up goes, the series does a great job and, as this is the prequel to Fate/StayNight, it does lead into that series quite nicely.\\n\\n\r\nOverall I find it hard to mention anything new that I did not mention in my previous review. This series is distinct, and that is something that I like. It is not moe, it is not a high school drama. It is something different with a lot of adult tones that gives it that edge that many fans of anime want. While it is not in any way perfect, it\u2013to me\u2013recalls my time watching Ghost in the Shell when I was surrounded by intelligent characters, an interesting world, and a lot of good drama with the occasional sprinkling of action sequences. That\u2019s just me though.\\n\\n\r\nDark, haunting, dramatic, and brutal, Fate/Zero is an excellent anime that I\u2019m sure will be popular for many years to come.",

            "content": "\"The most beautiful things in the world cannot be seen or even touched, they must be felt with the heart.\"-Hellen Keller and Fate/zero definitely made my heart melt. To many and also myself, this was probably the best anime of 2012, and not just the second season, but the first one was great as well. Overall this whole series really has it all, action, animation, great fight choreography and also major plot twist here and there.\r\nStory-10\r\nAlthough this may be a prequel to fate/stay night, the story didn't really required me to know much about the sequel at all. For a person like me which didnot watch fate/stay night before this, i was able to comprehend and enjoy the story as much as i could, which is definitely a great thing which many anime nowadays fail in doing so. Fate/zero's story-line can only be described with one word \"captivating\". for much of this anime it leaves the audience at a cliffhanger or a climax at the end of the episodes and really make the audience wanting for more. Fans of Gen Urobuchi's works should definitely savour this anime as Gen once again shows us how awesome he actually is. His dark style of writing, tragic and sad moments and plot twist was basically what captivated me to give it a fully deserving 10.\\n\\n\r\nArt-9\\n\r\nUfotable has once again displayed brilliant, consistent and high quality animation throughout Fate/zero and what made me enjoyed most was the great visual aspect of this anime. This together with well-choreographed fights was definitely magnificent and appealing.\\n\\n\r\nSound-9\\n\r\nThe sound effects was good throughout the anime but it was not as good as compared to anime like guilty crown or psycho-pass. However this show made it up by producing good opening and endings throughout the 2 seasons(oath sign-Lisa and To the beginning- kalafina)\\n\\n\r\nCharacter-10\\n\r\nFate/zero develops each character well, each  with their own specialty and attractiveness. Each character blends in well with the show and it also displays how the clash of different personalities and lust to figure out different personalities bring about conflict. Overall, with characters like Iskandar, Saber, Lancer and Kiritsugu Emiya, this show displayed great depth and development in each character, making everyone of them simply captivating and enjoyable to watch.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Fate/zero excites, captivates and allows the reader to fully enjoy the art and beauty of the anime.",

            "content": "I am rewriting this review after watching fate/stay night which I should have watched before this one.\r\nStory - 7: Now, I think the fate zero seasons are better than fate/stay night. The background story is the same, magicians fighting each other using a summoned hero to obtain the holy grail, which would be used for either good or evil purposes. We see quite a few more adult characters involved in the holy war than in fate/stay night which makes us feel somebody actually cares about that war (I would say as opposed to fate/stay night). I still think the main story is not that original,the servants are more or less D&D archetypes, and the holy grail war is well... a holy war. That said, the story is quite consistent and flows very well, with a few surprises.\\n\\n\r\nArt - 9: The artwork is very good and the animation is very decent. I have nothing bad to say about.\\n\\n\r\nSound - 7: Average, not really standing out and not getting in the way either.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 8: I really like some of the characters in that series, the servants are archetypes, but well designed ones. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 7: Sometimes the pace is a bit too slow (mainly a comment on season1, a lot more happen in season2), the fights are very entertaining. Some things are fairly predictable though.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: I rate it 8/10 because it's actually better than fate/stay night and the very high artwork/animation quality. I think it misses originality to be up in the 9-10 range.",

            "content": "The pacing for the second season is a bit odd. It has its moments where things speed up and then it slows back down. I felt that although I did enjoy the story, the way it went about being portrayed was a bit off. I will not discuss spoilers here but one issue I have is how the ending felt rather convoluted and not thoroughly explained. There were moments where something occurred and I had to think to myself, what did I just see?\r\nAside from the pacing, there were moments that were not necessary. Thinking about it now, often enough there were scenes where therewas no point to them at all. Could have removed them and it would not affect the series at all. They were the type of scenes that occurred and you have to ask yourself, what was the point of it and why did it seemingly just move on without any transition.\\n\\n\r\nWith all that said, I did enjoy the series. The anime did have its share of annoying characters but the ones that I liked left an impression on me. For the most part, the characters did not feel two-dimensional and had some depth to them. Rider is still my favorite spirit; his personality makes him all the more awesome and his words carry weight. Whereas spirits likes Saber felt incredibly annoying and the purposefully portrayal of her to make her seem naive was rather spot on. \\n\\n\r\nAs a prequel to the series, I think it did a good job of giving us a back-story as the the events that took place in the past. I do recommend the series and I am glad to have finally finished it.",

            "content": "Another fantasy/action anime that excels in character and thematic work rather than action elements; I am beginning to wonder whether the medium will ever be able to generate another series with action that is well integrated, important, and well-choreographed.  Fate/Zero attempts to create epic fights, grand in scale and power, between mythical heroes. It also attempts to place emphasis on single moments during more static conditions. The difference in these approaches makes the majority of the grandiose scenes seem unimportant and eventually boring. And the static scenes mostly come down to whose special attack will beat the special attack of whom.\r\nFate/Zero is obviously beautifulwith the least jarring use of CG that I have seen so far. I feel they should have stuck with the fight scenes like the one between Saber and Berserker towards the end. No my power beats your power, a nice character focus, a more believable battlefield, a more efficient and equally effective portrayal of power. \\n\\n\r\nUnlike most action series, the boasting and banter exchanged between those in fight scenes is connected to character and story and builds on itself nicely. This series tries to be very thoughtful and theme heavy and surprisingly succeeds. You will want to hear the sides of both hero and villain and will find difficulty in picking the right side. You will feel the conflictions of the characters, making their actions all the more compelling. Finally there are strategic manipulations at play during the fight scenes as well as any other time in the series. Some of them feel contrived while others provide intrigue, all freshen the experience. \\n\\n\r\nA lack of a story dominated the first season and lingered into the first three episodes of this season. The character of Caster should be removed from the series in my opinion. He gave rise to many Madoka-esque vomit inducing battle scenes consisting of the mindless slashing of monsters with an out of place art style. His character may have been useful in creating fear and suspense (like they mastered with Kirei), but instead they take a more humorous approach and make him fixate on a character that isn\u2019t even in the series. Thankfully and amazingly, I did not drop this series after episode 3. \\n\\n\r\nThe series could do a lot better here and there, but overall I am glad to have experienced it. I hope that they can continue to utilize the world they are shaping, but that\u2019s definitely enough of the heroes and Grail plots for me. \\n\\n",

            "content": "[This review is based on both 1st and 2nd seasons but mainly the latter. Contains spoilers]\r\nWhen you watch an anime, it's quite easy to identify whether or not the encompassing structure of the show is adapted straight from a light-novel or visual-novel. Now whether or not that's a good or bad thing greatly varies. In the case of Fate/Zero, it's a mix of both.\r\nFirstly, the show is very dialogue heavy. Now that's to be expected from a show like this and it's an effort by the creators to squeeze as much writing as possible in order to properly match the show's vision and intention. However,the way it's executed is one of the biggest problems with Fate/Zero. The exposition scenes for the most part are very static to the point it becomes almost tedious at times. It's the case where the phrase \"Show, don't tell\" applies here perfectly. In many of the scenes that feature characters talking, the people and the objects remain stationary; with an emphasis of long/wide shots of the background landscape. While on the flip slide, you can at least admire the pretty animations and historical-inspired atmosphere of the show. However, the cinematography decision unfortunately leads what's called a \"Talking Heads\" syndrome. Scenes like this are obviously designed so we can get an insight to learning about the characters, overall plot-line and world-building. However, the fact that a typical watcher of the show will mostly see just still images of characters just mindlessly talking greatly breaks the immersion of both the people and overall universe. Worst case scenario, there are times in a show where I would just lose interest to what the Servants and Masters are saying because there's not even a hint of body language, gesture that would otherwise hint of their personality and traits. Again, going back to the phrase \"Show, don't tell\", we must consider that this is anime after all; a medium where animation, visuals, and kinetic movement should be primary objectives of telling an interesting story. It doesn't help that the 1st season of Fate/Zero is meant entirely as a \"set-up\" season for the 2nd half, since the universe of the show is quite large in scope. So there's a lot of character and world information we have to get to. Hence, I suspect that most people would enjoy the Season 2 a lot more than the first.\\n\\n\r\nSo how does the Season 2 fare? This is the season where everything \"pays off\" so it's a near obligation that all the \"info dump\" of Season 1 has to be properly utilized for the story later on. For the most part, the latter half of Fate/Zero is quite solid. Of course, most of the major action scenes take place there and as you would expect, the fight choreography is splendid and authentic. When I describe it as \"authentic\", I'm taking into context of the fact that there are historical references that are put into place of the show. Thus, with characters such as Saber and Lancer; their fight scenes in general doesn't feel \"out of place\" amidst of a modern, technology-heavy world setting. Therefore, their sequence of movements and manoeuvres are properly treated in respect and merit of their Middle Age-related periods. The art style of the show seems styled decent enough, and from what I've seen there are some influences of Castlevania, Romanticism and other Gothic-related stuff that is embedded. \\n\\n\r\nOf course, we have to talk about the characters since they play a major influence in the show's quality. With a large cast, it can be difficult for a studio to properly develop each of them within only 26 episodes. I dare say, I feel like the show should've actually went on longer for this reason. And this goes hand-in-hand with the show's pacing problems. There are still several episodes even within Season 2 that's dedicated entirely upon character-building (through flashbacks) which should've been done in Season 1. As a result, the in-between episode transitions in the present timeline through these character-building episodes feel jarring at times. I still felt like the way that Season 1 ended was entire unnecessary in the first place and could you imagine the wait people had to endure back when the show just came out? They would've pondered why end just before this battle? It wasn't really a logical decision to set-up a second season like that when nothing happened up until that point. There were still loose ends that need to be tied up. \\n\\n\r\nSo why did I have to address about the show's pacing problems within the subject of characters firstly? It seems irrelevant and odd to not get into the nitty gritty but it actually is the reason why the characterization and chemistry of the characters could've been better. Not bad per se, but more along the lines of unfulfilled potential. I think it's better to talk about the people in the show by grouping both the servants and masters together as one. Because much of how I judge characterization in this particular show comes from their overall chemistry, not just by themselves individually. Hence, you see a lot of dialogue come when both the servants and masters are interacting one another outside the battle. \\n\\n\r\nLet's start with the main characters of the show, Team Saber which consists of Kiritsugu, Saber and Irisviel. Kiritsugu is portrayed as probably the driving force behind Fate/Zero's attempt of bringing a message to viewers of how different people have their own ways of living; whether it's morally (or ethically) correct or not. I think the charm of Fate/Zero is bringing historical-inspired figures to the table just for the sake of adding another dimension and perspective to the subject manner. Most of the time through other animes, it's often confined to the actual real world so I have to applaud the creators of the show for finding a creative way in going a step beyond what's most currently available out there. Besides, it's not like we viewers are taking some history class just by hearing what Saber says for example, on how she lived as the ruler of Britain periods ago. Actually, the times in an episode where we experience on how Saber reacts to the modern world only adds to the interest behind her personality. There's nothing particularly bad about the way Saber is portrayed throughout the show; her flaws only add to the conflict and drama which is exposed near the end of the series. Kiritsugu is rather less so in terms of execution of his character and origins, but that's only because it was slightly crammed quickly right when the show was starting to end. Both of them hardly interact, and while the show is supposed to heavily imply that there's a personality conflict in between them, there's not enough scenes that actually illustrate this. So it's rather hard to judge on their chemistry. Team Lancer which consisted of Lancer himself, Kayneth and Sola-Ui have a more distinct chemistry. Kayneth itself is an egotistical asshole which I'm sure the show is being deliberate with in terms of his characterization. So naturally, I was rooting against his presence the entire time and was eagerly waiting for his demise. Lancer's views on chivalry, nobility and honour; similarly expressed by Saber emphasis again on the Fate/Zero theme. But the disagreements of these values by Keyneth while annoying to bear; for all it's intended purposes work well. Sola-Ui is an interesting case because I had the expectation that she would succeed Kayneth as the master and become a more permanent \"villain\" if you will for the rest of the show. She was obviously a schemer and her seemingly innocent \"femme-fatale\" looks was a hint. What I didn't expect was how she went out. It made her look kind of pathetic and the other 2 went out quickly in a similar fate. I did feel sympathy for her death but only because I was wanting more of this group. I have no qualms with the creators having the guts to kill off characters early in a gruesome manner to illicit a sense of shock and tension within the universe. What I don't appreciate if it ends up sacrificing better development in the process.  There has to be a sense of established build-up for a death scene to be genuine . Take a cue of Game of Thrones and how they did it; as formulaic as it is. Archer's group was an oddity. Gilgamesh despite how he acts all high and mighty  in most of his scenes, I find him extremely intriguing when he's outside fighting. I find the scenes with Kirei to be really interesting to listen to because we clearly get a sense to how he is. We know he enjoys seeking the pleasures in life such as treasure and such (with some philosophy behind it). He's one of the few characters in the show where his charisma didn't make his long exposition scenes entirely boring. Likewise, it's a double positive that his chemistry with Kirei is both a plot and character enhancer for the latter. I find Kirei to be pretty boring as a character itself, but the fact his motives throughout the show aided by Gilgamesh that serves an antithesis of the show's main message is still interesting nevertheless. \\n\\n\r\nThere's nothing much I have to say about Team Caster, Berserker and Assassin since their depiction for the sake of the plot was valid I guess. I don't need to mention Assassin again since I already talked about Kirei. Only noteworthy mention is that I didn't care much about Uryuu at all. His characterization as a serial killer was totally unconvincing for me to the point of absurdity. I know he was intended to have a certain \"charm\", beauty or whatever behind it but it wasn't well-rounded enough to the point of believably. Caster fit this role much, much better and their chemistry was dictated by him in the end. The pair of Rider and Waver was a big surprise for me in terms of progression. When it first started out, the appearance of Rider just screamed out \"brawn over brains\" for me and I thought he was a filler for most fight scenes. It didn't help that Waver was the wimpy, unreliable \"Shinji-type\" and that impression stayed with me til the end. However, Rider grew on me because his moments with Waver about his previous life as king and life lessons in standing up to one's self was genuinely touching. In the end, Rider acted like a \"father figure\" for Waver and the father and son type of relationship was a major highlight of the show. It's only logical that Waver became a slightly more likable character in the end because of Rider. \\n\\n\r\nSo overall, what is there to really say about Fate/Zero as a series? It's seemed like throughout of my review, it was dominated by major, fundamental flaws of the show which might come off as a 5 or 6 type rating that I'm giving. Funnily enough, that's only if you really look deep and dissect it. However, on the surface and for what it is, it's an anime that most audiences including me would enjoy. It has a great scope of story and characters, the animation is good and the fight scenes are exactly what you hope for. Despite my long string of criticisms, it's a testament to the show and the creators of how a visual novel adaptation ended up like this. And that's how the show should be remembered for years to come in terms of overcoming it's fundamental limitations.",

There were many aspects of the story that I loved such as the addition of intriguing backstory for a few of the characters as well as progressively darker themes and characters.  But the show sometimes strays away from these things and becomes a disengaging mess of poetic nonsense; however, the majority of the show is not like that, so it does not detractfrom the experience too much.  The opening theme, yet again, took a while to grow on me, but it now one of my favorites.  As for the score, it did not amaze me in any way, but it was respectable nonetheless.  There are less characters in the 2nd Season which may seem like a negative; however, the show uses this as advantage giving the viewer more time with the remaining characters.  My biggest complaint with this series is the ending.  The poetic bullshit I was writing about before comes to a painful climax in the last few episodes.  This anime is good but not great.",

            "content": "The latter season of Fate/Zero left a decidedly sour taste in my mouth. I did not outright dislike it as such, but there was a definite feeling of disappointment that I began to feel from as early as halfway through the season, and it was not immediately clear to me why that was. This review is meant to explore what exactly went wrong, and of course the whole package.\r\nFirst of all, for background I should point out that I began my journey into the Fate series with the Fate/stay night: Unlimited Blade Works anime. I'd say it was a good choice, as I was prettymuch immediately hooked and my positive impression of the anime maintained pretty much all the way through and left me with the interest to look into the rest of the Fate series. I will be proceeding with the assumption that anyone considering watching Fate/Zero will have at least a similar level of background with the Fate series; largely because of the series itself works on much the same basis, expecting the viewer to have a solid grasp of the basics the setting and the premise of the Holy Grail War.\\n\\n\r\nSeeing as Fate/Zero was where I headed immediately after, totally skipping the two other routes in the original work, I probably don't have the background knowledge of all the characters necessary to fully appreciate their appearances in Fate/Zero. Nonetheless, it did not pose any significant issues in delving into the story, and the first season of the series largely matched up to my expectations formed based on F/SN: UBW and praise I had seen for the series.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, I think I already began to see the potential for serious issues by the end of the first season, and unfortunately my worries were realized by the second season. Suffice to say, the first season of Fate/Zero saw very little actual progress of the plot at large, and neither did it sufficiently set up the second season to wrap up the whole story. Saddled with both elaborating the backstories of all the characters and providing satisfactory conclusions to their personal story arcs long after their most memorable and characteristic appearances had already happened in the first season, it is not surprising that many of these conclusions fell rather flat.\\n\\n\r\nSeeing as these character arcs were the meat of the story, this lackluster realization also resulted in the main plot of the series struggling, lacking the same level of excitement that I felt with the various changes in the direction of F/SN: UBW's plot. The fact that the story was written as a prequel to the original one is sure to have played a part here, but I can't help but think that there could have been some more unpredictability to it nonetheless. In fact, not once do I recall feeling genuine surprise at the movements of the plot, even the parts clearly set up elicit such a reaction - quite the opposite, it all felt forced to fit a mold that I already knew, devised solely to achieve a conclusion to the story that had been written before any other key part of it was realized.\\n\\n\r\nBut while my first instinct was to put the blame with the ultimate realization of the character arcs in general, I think a more general look at the series as a whole still makes most of them sufficiently interesting to justify a higher evaluation of the series than I intuitively ended up with. So with a more in depth exploration of the matter, I believe I've largely narrowed down the major issues for the series to just occurring in a few characters. Or, to be honest, mainly just one.\\n\\n\r\nSo, after that lengthly preamble, let me get to what was originally supposed the main part of the review, dealing with the different characters and their stories in as much detail as I can manage without spoiling anything, as that was indeed the meat of the story itself. I'll use this mainly to highlight the specific issues that I had with the characters and their stories, particularly the ones I felt to be most crucial for the plot at large.\\n\\n\r\nCaster's team: It feels appropriate to deal with these characters first for the simple reason of their relative insignificance to the plot at large. In that way they are in fact rather exemplary of the flaws of the whole narrative structure, though hardly the biggest offenders. \\n\\n\r\n   Despite the seemingly central role they play in the storyline taking place at the end of the first season, and the start of the second, a more careful examination of that event shows that it served as little else than a cool battlescene showcasing the abilities of the other servants, with minimal impact on the overall course of the story. Similarly the duo's other appearances served simply as backdrop to the advancing of the rest of the cast's stories.\\n\\n\r\n   That said, having a couple of supporting characters serve in such a role is not really such a sin, provided they perform that role well enough and have some merit on their own as well. For both those criteria, I'd give the duo passing marks. Unfortunately, this kind of a role becomes a bigger problem when there are also other characters that seemingly serve the same purpose.\\n\\n\r\nLancer's team: This trio of characters has neither the most obvious strengths or weaknesses of the bunch, but their largely shared personal stories wrap up into a rather satisfying package. You could even take their personal plots and make it into a neat little story of its own, without much involvement from most of the other characters at all. \\n\\n\r\n   The problem with that of course comes in the fact that it means that they also have rather limited importance to the story at large as a consequence. This is all the more unfortunate for the fact that there was clearly a great deal of effort put into them as a means to advance the plot at large. To the writer's credit, this trio's involvement does serve as big character development for some of the main characters of the story. The issue is that this development comes in the form of conflict between these main characters that is subsequently left with pitifully little exploration, much less resolution, making the whole set up appear rather pointless, especially considering the effort put into it.\\n\\n\r\nRider's team: Now here is the clearly best pair of characters in the entire story. Which unfortunately means that I'm going to have less to say about them than almost  all the others.\\n\\n\r\n   Suffice to say, pretty much everything is done right here. Rider and his Master provide much needed comedic relief, but unlike Caster and his Master they do that all the while having perhaps the best character development - both individually and as a duo - in the whole series. At the same time, despite not being main characters as such, they do more work than almost anyone else to advance the main plot and shaping it into a coherent whole. Like pretty much everyone else, the conclusion of their character arcs is not quite satisfactory, but even there they beat out most others.\\n\\n\r\nBerserker's team: This is one case where it'd probably help if I knew more about the other two paths of the original work, because of the connections that Berserker's master has to other characters. Nonetheless, this duo of characters has some of the biggest problems in the entire series, as one might perhaps expect from two people that each suffer from a rather incoherent variety of insanity. \\n\\n\r\n   But this level of nonsensical actions and general inefficacy as contenders in the Holy Grail War is not something I can excuse based on just 'insanity'. As another duo with minimal impact in the actual main plot, mainly because of the aforementioned inefficacy, they also don't have any real redeeming qualities in their personal story arcs, which actually seem to be solely for the purpose of emphasizing just how tragic the story is, and not actually developing them as characters at all.\\n\\n\r\nArcher's team: Here's another few characters that are clearly among the better ones. This is to be expected based on the fact that this team plays a key role in the main plot all the way through the series, which clearly resulted in extra thought being put into their motivations and characters. This doesn't actually result in a great deal of development on that front, but this is forgivable for the type of characters that they are, very well established from the outset.\\n\\n\r\n   In particular Archer himself is another one of the best characters in the whole series, doing work on every front to build the overall narrative. His master is perhaps less so, but with very consistent motivations and stable character he nonetheless also functions well in his role in the story.\\n\\n\r\nTohsaka Rin: Actually a rather minor character with little role in the plot, it is actually more of a matter of the narrative serving to set up her character as one of the central ones in the Fate/stay night. This, I'm very happy to say, was achieved pretty damn well, and I thoroughly enjoyed every moment of little Rin's adventures on the screen.\\n\\n\r\nSaber: A main character in both Fate/Zero and F/SN, she is luckily one of the better performers in the series overall. In fact, I find her character to be portrayed better in Fate/Zero than in F/SN; at least the route that I've watched the anime on, which admittedly wasn't the one particularly centered on her. She is obviously very much central to the plot's progress as well, and does that job well enough. That said, her personal story arc, while obviously continuing into F/SN, was unfortunately left rather unfinished even for the parts that could have been delved into more in this series itself.\\n\\n\r\nEmiya Kiritsugu & his backpack: And here we are, finally at the part that made me start writing up this whole review. The one clear reason that I can point out for my dissatisfaction with the entire series. Kiritsugu was an utter disaster for the plot of Fate/Zero, not just failing to carry his weight as THE main character that he was set up to be, but rather dragging down everyone else with him.\\n\\n\r\n   In F/SN: UBW Emiya Kiritsugu was a rather vague background character that only just served as inspiration for that series's own main character's actions, and quite frankly he'd have been better if left as such. Where Emiya Shirou's character concept already stretched believability, but was nonetheless a nice twist on a regular shounen main character, Kiritsugu completely escapes the realm of plausibility in an apparent attempt to live up to the original work's expectations for him.\\n\\n\r\n   If, for just a moment, I pretend that Kiritsugu's actions had the backing of logic that the everything about the writing seems to imply, instead of being utterly fucking nonsensical most of the time, I still could not find him remotely sympathetic as a character, which adds another layer of inplausibility, in his ability of attract sympathy from other characters.\\n\\n\r\n   Further, with him comes a whole slew of minor characters that do absolutely nothing for the narrative as a whole, existing for the purpose his personal character building. Or, more specifically, not building it, but rather just to really hammer home the idea that Kiritsugu is such a tragic character and totally worthy of sympathy - in spite of all evidence to the contrary on the latter count. \\n\\n\r\n   Their existence might have been forgivable if not for the fact that their totally unmemorable presences stole so much time from the rest of the story and the better characters, at one point stalling out the whole series, which for the most part kept a good pacing, for at least two whole episodes that were solely dedicated to Kiritsugu's distant backstory with these characters who had no other role in the story. This all happened in the place of Kiritsugu having actual dealings with the other competitors of the Holy Grail War; he was an almost total non-exisence when it came to the conversations and shared character building of the rest of the cast, all the whole his backstory full of unwarranted self-pity was force fed to the viewer despite having no real relevance to the actual plot at hand.\\n\\n\r\nIrisviel and Illyasviel: While these two characters are very much linked to Kiritsugu, and thus inevitably made worse for it, they are nonetheless distinct from the other characters I mentioned in association with him, and they connections have purpose for the plot and the characters themselves. Irisviel is a rather central character, if not an especially good one, while Illya is another character that plays a role in F/SN, but who happens to have a rather minimal role in UBW in particular and thus is one that I can't examine in great detail.\\n\\n\r\nNow, I suppose it's about time to wrap this all up. I should mention that on the art and sound categories the series is rather excellent, which, despite such a minor role in this review, are a great part of what nonetheless made even the latter season an enjoyable watch at many points. Again, I did not really hate the series, and would even recommend watching it just for the stories of the better characters, but I definitely think it had the potential to be much better.",

            "content": "With the first season big success, the second season comes with an even better plot, art, and animation. Fate/Zero 2 has definitely shown a great improvement over the first season. Let's start with the plot; the story continues where the first season left off. But, Unlike the first season, this time, the plot is much easier to follow and understand, So, this is a huge improvement over the first season. A great development in animation and art can be seen too! The choreography in some of the action and battles scenes is outstanding.\r\nOne of the greatest things that can be experienced in this season isthe characters development. There are some episodes that shed the light on the background story of one of the main characters which give the story more beauty and makes it more thrilling. The dialogues in this season are easier to understand than the first one. However, I had to repeat some of the scenes more than once in order to comprehend what is happening.  \\n\\n\r\nThe storytelling is kind of unique in Fate/Zero. Instead of focusing on one or two protagonists, the story shows each character perspective and each character way of thinking. It's like telling a story which has no specific hero in it. Which is really unique, and I believe that this was done successfully.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, in the story there are still many questions remained unanswered. The story didn't really answer a lot of questions, and this leaves the viewers with more questions than answers with a rushed ending. I hope that we can find some answers to all these questions in the coming seasons or in the movies.\\n\\n\r\nTo conclude, Fate/Zero 2 was a big success over the first season. Ufotable improved nearly everything that the first season lacked. With this, the only negative point that this season showed is that there are still many things remained unknown and that the ending was really rushed. \\n\\n\r\nOverall rate: 9/10\\n\r\nA highly recommended anime.",

I think the reason why was simply because, obviously, the closer I got to the end of the season, the more I knew what was happening because I'd seen it already in Fate/stay night. \r\nI think the thing I love the most about this prequel is the focus on the Servants and their relationships with each other as well as the Servants' relationships with their Masters. Of course, in the main Fate/stay night series, there's plenty of focus on Shirou's relationship with Saber and Rin'srelationship with Archer, but Fate/Zero went much deeper and with more Servant/Master pairs; I really enjoyed watching it.\\n\\n\r\nI also found it interesting to constantly remind myself throughout this whole series that, no matter what route you're watching for Fate/stay night, Fate/Zero is the prequel for all of them. It was nice to have this series as a constant, unchanging predecessor to the main series. \\n\\n\r\nOther than that, I'm feeling accomplished for having finished the main line of Fate works, and it was bloody awesome. One of my favorites. It hooked me for sure.\\n\\n\r\nP.S. Rider and Waver are friendship goals.",

Also, the character development for Kirei and Kiritsugu is amazing! Ishkandar and Gilgamesh were interesting characters as far as their core motives are concerned. The episodes focusing on Rin's first adventures in Fuyuki and Kiritsugu's childhood were a joy to witness. This show has minor moments of infodumping in the early to mid-season episodes, which did not slow my enjoyment down, but can serve as a deterrent for some. I am still steadfast in the belief that Fate stay/night is the ideal starting point fortotal newcomers to the Fate series even after watching Fate/Zero. Saber's misgivings are made apparent early into Fate/Zero and those who have watched \"Deen stay/night\" will better appreciate how Saber handles her flaws in character, especially after seeing the final episodes of Fate/Zero. Also, it is easier to understand Kirei's mysterious character evolve over the course of this series having watched \"Deen stay/night\". This series is one that ought to be appreciated from the lens of \"Deen stay/night\" because it is easier to understand why certain characters in the Fate Route did what they did due to their eventful formative years. Overall, this show is nothing short of a masterpiece done by studio giant ufotable. Hats off!!!",

            "content": "Continuing from the 1st Season of Fate/zero comes its 2nd season, which aired 3 months after. If you have seen my review of the 1st season of Fate/zero, you already know how great it was for me. Did the 2nd season live up to the expectations that it would be as good as the 1st season. Let's find out!\r\nStory - 10/10:\r\nThe story of the second season of Fate/zero builds up from its 1st season, carrying on the strategic tactics in the Holy Grail War, and the price to pay for trying to win it, but with even darker meaning than the already-dark 1st season. Fate/zero's2nd season goes on to show how much selfish desires corrupt people into doing anything for it, even if it means killing the ones he respected (as seen in Kirei Kotomine).\\n\\n\r\nArt - 12/10:\\n\r\nThe animation has not downgraded from the 1st season, but rather much remains the same godlike one seen in it. However, another bonus point was added for how amazingly-animated the fight between Kiritsugu Emiya and Kirei Kotomine was, which felt like the animation during the fight was on a whole new level.\\n\\n\r\nSound - 8/10:\\n\r\nWhile the soundtrack has improved since the 1st season, it wasn't necessarily saying much. The opening song, \"To The Beginning\" by Kalafina wasn't the godawful type of bad as \"Oath Sign\" by LiSA, the opening to the 1st season. The endings songs were mediocre at best. The soundtrack however, was saved by the darkness it provides during the anime.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 9/10:\\n\r\n Most of the characters in this anime were actually really likable and were diverse. However, there were a few you will probably hate when you watch this anime, but I will let you find it out for yourself.\\n\\n\r\n Enjoyment - 10/10:\\n\r\nOverall, this anime had the biggest enjoyment factor of all anime I have ever seen. With badass fights, psychological moments, dark and meaningful themes, proper use of magic, a different approach of cast members from the typical \"high school characters\" cast, and more, this will be worth a try.\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 9.8/10:\\n\r\nThis is a masterpiece of an anime and I can assure you this will be very exciting to watch. But just don't forget to watch the 1st season of Fate/zero before watching this season.",

Since there are so many characters within such a short series the story lines become a bit convoluted. \r\nThe only thing that I had a hard time swallowing was the desire and motivation of each master or hero pursuing the holy grail, a select few character had some innate desire to fulfill some wish or fantasy, but for a majority of the characters the viewer is unsure of why both hero and master quest for the relic. Nevertheless, Fate Zero puts on a entertaining display of action and magic, with aboveaverage graphics and story telling. I'll be waiting for the production of Fate/stay night.",

            "content": "This anime was phenomenal in story, music, and character development and is by far one of the best anime's I have had the opportunity to come across and watch. \r\nThe story develops quickly and efficiently. In the beginning I will admit I was almost turned off by the slow moving pace of the first two episodes as they set up the story, but the rest of the anime quickly made up for it. The show was extremely quick paced and eat episode leaves you waiting in anticipation for the next installment to the arc. The events are unexpected and you never actually know what isgoing to happen and certain events will leave your stomach turning while others will stir up emotions of anger and disgust.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are also phenomenal. The truth behind the personalities of many of them remain hidden for much of the series as well as their true intentions for their pursuit of the grail. All of the characters will draw you into them and whether you hate them or not you will enjoy every moment of the presence. For example, the character Caster created extreme feelings of hatred and contempt for him for the entirety of the series to the point of when he would appear I would feel sick like the others characters. Characters such as Kiritsugu surprise me at every turn and no matter how much you believe you get him and know his limits, he will surprise you at every turn. \\n\r\nThe pairings of the characters provide the perfect foils and make them even stronger as people. From the wimpy Waiver Velvet and Rider to Kiritsugu and Saber, the differences in their goals and personalities only make the show all the better.\\n\\n\r\n The battles and the music were also fantastic. While watching the series the music will draw you in and hold you riveted as you watch every scene. It is well written to fit each and every scene and amplify the emotions that the characters are feelings to draw you into them even more as well as amplify the badassness of the battles. No battle is like the other and each will leave you with varying emotions and opinions.\\n\\n\r\nOverall this anime is extremely good and I would recommend it to anyone who is looking for a phenomenal story and amazing characters. It is also great for the intense action scenes and gruesome characters that foil the pure hearted ones.",

So I watched it twice, both seasons of Fate/Zero and not I am writing a review on both seasons of Fate/Zero here.\r\nStory: 10/10\r\nBased on a Light Novel series this time and NOT a visual novel as is it's sequel anime, this particular story does NOT have different routes so it's story is absolute and unchanging depending on choices made. This is the prequel to the events that occurred in Fate/Stay Night and it did an excellent job on connecting and further developing on thecharacters that survived and returned in the sequel. \\n\\n\r\nART: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nThis was created much before ufotable's Unlimited Bladeworks so it's quite obvious it wont be the same as it but it is still excellent!\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nAnother great soundtrack, I had to get them all! \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nExcellent character development, for each from the inspiring rider, the arrogant archer, the deranged caster, the honorable lancer, the furious berserker and sad, confused saber (LOL). I have to say that the rider of this story is one of the most inspiring servants I've ever seen in this franchise. I swear Gilgamesh is an extremely over-powered servant.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nI laughed, I worried, I had tears welling up in my eyes, I was inspired, I came to understand, I empathized, I resented, I enjoyed.

There are a lot of likable character which you wish to see more of in the future, and a lot of unlikable characters which you wish to be dead by the end of the series. \r\nThe art is amazing, every scene leaves you jaw dropped, the lighting and how it emphasizes the characters in outstanding. Good jobfrom Ufotable on the art.  \\n\\n\r\nMusic is great and fits the scenes especially the battles. \\n\\n\r\nIt's a really nice watch, however there is a bit of explicit gore/screaming involved which might be disturbing for some.",

The execution (ooo wee a pun) was utterly juvenile. The story was an amateurishly woven grimdark train wreck.\r\nLet's take Kiritsugu's plane wreck backstory. An entire episode is built around his mother figure mentor being trapped on a plane with parasitic mind controlling wasps. \r\nRational resolution: Nuke the plane with Spectracide\u2122 Wasp and Hornet Killer Aerosol.Result: mentor lives, 100% wasps dead.\\n\\n\r\nForced Grimdark resolution: Nuke the plane with a heat seeking anti-aircraft missile. Result: mentor dead, 70% wasps dead.\\n\\n\r\nI'll let you guess which one Fate/Zero decides on.\\n\\n\r\nStory rating: 1/10\\n\\n\r\n** Art/Aesthetics **\\n\r\nAs a Tsukihime fan, I absolutely love the character aesthetics. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 8/10\\n\\n\r\n** Animation **\\n\r\nAnimation is completely different from aesthetics. The fluidly and detail in each sequence was lacking. The fight scenes had cinematic shots (3 point perspective wide angle launches, landscape shots, extreme close ups, slow motion, etc) which would awe an inexperienced viewer. Seeing through all that, all that's left are lazily choreographed fights. \\n\\n\r\nLet's take Saber for instance. Saber is suppose to be the strongest hero, specializing in god tier sword fighting. Yet her swordplay is restricted to 2 moves: swipe and jab. She performs no meaningful parry/counters, feints, etc. Why is her repertoire less interesting than an 8-bit NES sprite? Because it's so much easier to animate, and make up the deficiency with cinematic details (i.e. wind rushing during attacks, ground cracking after taking blows, electrical discharge, etc). Those are all cheap tricks in the literal sense: they're cheap to animate and take little imagination.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: 4/10\\n\\n\r\n** Sound **\\n\r\nI'm a big fan of Yuki Kajiura. With that said, the soundtrack was bland and unmemorable. Nothing compared to Noir or Madoka Magica. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 3/10\\n\\n\r\n** Character **\\n\r\nInitially, characters showed strong potential for realistic development and depth. The first episode did an excellent job of establishing clear and real motivations. However, they all devolve into one-dimensional dark tropes. \\n\\n\r\nLet's take Saber for instance. She's suppose to be a strong female lead, with experience leading an entire nation as a King. As the series progresses, it turns out she's an emotionally distraught insecure 15 yo girl. The authors devolve her into the vulnerable female trope for ecchi reasons (i.e. helpless girl needs a real man for emotional support), and it just blasphemous to her character. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 3/10\\n\\n\r\n** Enjoyment **\\n\r\nDespite all the flaws, I enjoyed the show enough to finish it. I'm fond of strong female characters, and I kept on watching for Saber's shining moment - unfortunately that never comes. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 6/10\\n\\n\r\n** Overall **\\n\r\nThis is not a series I would recommend to an adult - it's just not worth the time. With that said, I can see why it appeals to teens and newcomers of the genre.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 4/10",

As the goals are slowly drifting in sight, the people struggling to achieve them are reaching a point of no return. The scales are higher than ever.\r\nAdmittedly, the story is not perfect, and I can see why some people might dislike the way the show ended. I personally thought the fit was very applicable to the more mature take on the Fate universe. In general the story improved throughout the length of the entirety of the show, and this is very noticeable when you compare this season to thefirst. If you managed to stick with the premise and plotlines the first season presented, you are sure to follow the second season even better.\\n\\n\r\nRather than introducing new plotlines or characters, the show builds upon what the first season established. All in all this makes it a very pleasant continuation to watch, and as the intensity is turned up slowly throughout this season, there is a clear sense of both purpose and dread to be found within the character cast.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of the characters; They are satisfyingly similar to their counterparts in the first season. As the story progresses towards a heavier plot, so do the characters, which can be seen with an increased sense of purpose and determination. This purpose can be conflicting, and there are many times where the characters are faced with dilemma's and concepts of moral ambiguity.\\n\\n\r\nThe more 'physical' appearance of the show has not changed compared to the first season. The art is still excellent, the sound (In both OST and design) stays amazing throughout the shows' lifespan. \\n\\n\r\nI'd say that if you enjoyed the first season of Fate/Zero, there is no doubt in my mind that you will also heavily enjoy this season as well. An excellent experience, and surely to stay confined within my list of favourites.\\n\\n\r\nThank you for your time, dear valued reader, and hopefully you enjoyed my written experiences concerning \"Fate/Zero 2nd Season\".\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

Probably the best anime since FMA brotherhood a masterpiece and a beautiful one at that. The best part of the anime is its art and animation its mind blowing i can find only few other anime that can come close. The story picked up during season 2 with a faster pace and my favorite part the story about kirisurugus childhood in episodes 18-19. Almost as good as the animation is the music its epic thats all i can say. Andevery of the characters are interesting and fun to watch my favorite is emiya kiritsugu his like spike spigel version 2.\\n\r\nall in all a fantastic anime recommended to any anime fan the only thing that i can take from the anime is its ending i liked it but it was kinda  anticlimactic but thats only one episode.

To somebody such as myself who has never watched fate/stay night it did not feel conclusive, which it obviously can't be as it has to set up the rest of the franchise!

            "content": "Action Total Score: 92/100\r\nFate/Zero is a towering masterpiece of an anime that everyone must watch once when they are introduced to the medium, and once again when they are more seasoned. On the surface, it is an action-packed 2-cour roller-coaster ride but underneath the tracks of this roller-coaster, you'll find that the pylons supporting it are nothing to scoff at either.\r\n-Art Style: 19/20\r\nFate/Zero aired in Spring 2012 and it doesn't look a day old. Seriously, this stuff is better than the shows we see season after season. It's clear that ufotable understood the series well and wanted to capture the essence of the Fate/ seriesto it's fullest potential and they did perfectly with Fate/Zero.\\n\\n\r\n-Animation: 20/20\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is top drawer too. Fight scene after fight scene after fight scene, the quality never seems to drip but instead increase exponentially. Even the CG is done well, and coming off the back of CG-horror shows such as Goblin Slayer and Berserk, well-placed and well-choreographed CG is a breath of fresh air. You'd be hard pressed to find something animated using CG had you not been looking out for it, and I sure was traumatised by the above-mentioned shows. Particle and smoke effects look like they belong and I can only imagine nothing less than a team of equally skilled animators looking to prove their worth, working on Fate/Zero.\\n\\n\r\n-Storyline: 19/20\\n\\n\r\n/u/Enarec from /r/anime summarises the storyline better than I can, \"And thus did we count down to arrive at Zero - not the instant the Grail was destroyed, but instead the moment a young boy named Shirou was saved by a broken man called Kiritsugu. Fate/Zero, the prequel, has ended and from here on Fate/Stay Night picks up the pieces.\"\\n\\n\r\nThis story is set before Fate/Stay Night and unsurprisingly enough, it's a more fleshed out story than the Studio Deen adaptation 6 years prior. I cannot remember a part where I was confused where the plot was taking me, not because I was in full control of it and I knew what was going on - but instead the opposite. I wholeheartedly trusted the story before stepping into the Fate/ universe and my trust was not broken by Fate/Zero. There's a reason why this show remains in the top 100 on MyAnimeList after 6 years and counting, and I don't see a reason why it should ever be forcefully removed from the top 100 if anything. \\n\\n\r\nThis is a tragedy. Not just how it is underrated, but in the literal sense of the story.\\n\\n\r\n-Music: 15/20\\n\\n\r\nThe opening and ending were not very memorable to me, only because it stood in the shadow of the show itself. The background soundtrack was felt where it belonged, in the background, and was not overbearing.\\n\\n\r\n-Enjoyment: 19/20\\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed Fate/Zero to a very large extent. Even days before my major exams, this show managed to hold my interest even after the very end - I wanted answers for the ending and the meaning and relevance of the ending scenes since I was not a Visual Novel reader. This show gave me depression - in a good way, because I detested my slothful nature of binging shows 4 hours consecutively and now I want to study, carrying the momentum of such a good show to my studies. My only complaint was that the beginning was a tad slow for my enjoyment.",

            "content": "Full closure here: I'm writing this review after re-watching the anime not once, but twice. While little has changed in how much I adore this show, I should probably warn you that without knowing every bit of lore from not only the servants' legends (mainly Caster, Saber and Lancer) but also the Fate universe itself, a lot of themes and plot twists in the show are probably going to have less of an effect on you. For me though, that wasn't a problem.\r\nAlso let me say that this will not be a review of just the second season of Fate/Zero, but of the entire series.I will do my best to avoid any substantial spoilers, but i cannot promise you that you'll leave this review completely blind to what this anime is about.\\n\\n\r\nNow let's get on with the review:\\n\\n\r\nStory: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nSeveral anime deal with the concept of heroism. Some do it in an over the top, epic and dazzling story featuring warriors with unmatched figures and battles which blow your mind away. Some take a more comedic route, portraying their heroes as absolute idiots and making a parody out of the concept, resulting in hilarious moments.\\n\\n\r\nThen there are shows like Fate/Zero. Shows that take the heroism of a character and turn it against them. Shows that show the fight between not just the hero and the villain, ut also the hero and his ideals. Shows that can show you the aftermath of such a fight. To me, a show like that has to tread very carefully around the subject, else it may seem edgy or pseudo-intellectual. But for anyone who didn't see my score, let me asure you that Fate/Zero doesn't fall into that trap\\n\\n\r\nThe plot centers around Emiya Kiritsugu.\\n\r\nAge: Around 40 probably idk\\n\r\nOccupation: Assassin, particularly good at killing Mages\\n\r\nSpecial Abilities: Controlling the Speed of time, proficient at using arms, greatest dad in the universe\\n\\n\r\nAn anomaly among mages and an insult to their traditions and ideology, he is hired by the one of the founding families, the Einzbern, in order to bring them the Holy Grail. Emiya Kiritsugu enters the Holy Grail War alongside Tohsaka Tokiomi, a more traditional mage who seeks to reach the root of all magic, Lord El-Melloi Archibald, a powerful mage who simply finds this war interesting, Waver Velvet, who wants to prove himself as a distinguished magus, Kotomine Kirei, an enigmatic priest who joined the war by Tokiomi's side, Matou Kariya, who once rejected magic but chose to fight in order to save his childhood friend's niece, and Ryuunosuke Uryuu, who's a freeter as an occupation and homocidal maniac as a hobby. They each summon a heroic spirit, a hero of historical or literary importance, to aid them in killing the rest and claiming the grail as their own.\\n\\n\r\nThe premise was enough to get me hooked, but the story develops into several plotlines, which will make you question your ideals and take you to an emotional roller coaster ride. If I had to comapre it to anything, it would be an ancient greek tragedy. What truly is the duty of a leader? Is a heroic ideal damned to turn against yourself? Is it a simple illusion? Is it ok to believe that 2 serial killers are some of the most hilarious and simultaniously most disturbing characters in media as a whole? these are just some of the questions that were stuck in my head after finishing this anime.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the more technical aspects of the story, there really isnt that much to say. The pacing is perfect, the mystery is well thought out, the pay off is satisfying and there's enough fore-shadowing and tiny details that re-watching it is an incredibly pleasant experience\\n\\n\r\nThe story is a gem and i don't think it's an exaggeration to call it the writers Magnum Opus\\n\\n\\n\r\nPresentation: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nOh Ufotable, I appreciate you so much its not even funny. What is funny though is that, while unlimited bladeworks and heaven's feel look objectively better, this show has one thing that I can confidently say the abforementioned shows lack: Character. The only thing animated in 2-D here, as far as I could see, were the characters. But the CGI is so spotless that it fits in incredibly well, and the sheer amount of it helps that even more. Though I will admit I prefer the eye candy of the Stay Night series, my love for this style remains overwhelming to this day and I don't believe it will age a single bit even after decades\\n\\n\r\nAgain, on the more technical side of things, the cinematography is really good and the art always suits the feel of the scene, even sometimes adding onto it\\n\\n\r\nAnd while we are on the subject of things that will never grow old, the soundtrack of Fate/Zero is easily one of my favorites of all time. The tracks always fit the scene like a glove and I'm having a hard time not remembering them every time i come across a piece of fanart. The music takes many shapes in this show. It can be epic, sad, endearing and any combination of the above.\\n\\n\r\nAlso, allow me to state something: I take the subject of OPs and EDs very seriously. They are arguably the thing that you're gonna be seeing and hearing most of in every anime. And for this series, the animation team and the music groups created some of my personal favorites. \\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nThis is the most subjective part of any review, as well as the toughest one for me to write. That's because, even though this anime changed my perspective on a lot of stuff, even if it has some of the most skillful uses of cinematography and some of the most deep and well developed characters of any anime my pure eyes have ever seen, I wouldn't necessarily call it enjoyable, because I dont think that it was meant to be. The anime handles a lot of tragic themes and it will leave you with not just a lot of questions but also an empty, odd feeling in your chest.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\n....or that's what I would've said. But Waver and his servant are here.\\n\\n\r\nThese 2 bastards are some of the most fun and enjoyable comedy duos not just in any anime, but any show. They work so well off of each other that a scene with them can momentarily undo all the existential trauma that you were exposed to in the previous scene, allowing you to be caught off guard again next time something hideous and disturbing happens. These 2 alone make the show an incredibly enjoyable experience.\\n\\n\r\nConclusion:\\n\\n\r\nI've used many words to describe this show, but if i could sum up all the praise i gave it into 2 words, those would be \"Complete Masterpiece\". It is legitimately difficult to find any mistakes in all 25 episodes of this series. It goes without saying that i recommend this to anyone who has the ability to watch it, but more than that, rewatching it after a few weeks is also highly suggested. All in all this series, along with its sequel, proudly stands as one of my 3 favorite anime of all time, from which I cannot choose one over the other cause im a huge coward without the innate strength a critic ought to have.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 10/10\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "- English Review (Translated version)\r\nThere are times when an anime doesn't please you, no matter how much it is a reference in terms of quality and/or popularity. Whether it's for whatever reason is not for you and you don't enjoy it, at the same time you are astonished by a cascade of praise that you don't understand. Personally, this has happened to me more than once, to a greater or lesser extent. In terms of quality I could mention \"Code Geass\" and in terms of popularity the perfect candidate is \"SAO\". And unfortunately something like that happened to me again with \"Fate/Zero\". The first seasondidn't meet my expectations, but I thought that this second season, which is even better valued, would dispel that bad taste in my mouth so I could understand the great popularity of this complicated and prolific series. Not only has this not been the case, it has also made my already warm initial impressions a little worse.\\n\\n\r\nI'm not going to extend myself too much because no matter how much this is considered a second season, it's really a second part, so in general terms it doesn't differ at all from the first \"season\". Even so, there are certain details that have made this second set of episodes seem to me a point below the first one and it's on them that I'm going to focus. If you'd like to read a more general and wide-ranging opinion, you can read my review of \"Fate/Zero\".\\n\\n\r\nOne of the things I liked about the first batch of episodes was how they were able to intersperse the battles with calmer moments, moments of reflection that \"humanized\" the characters to empathize with them in a better way. Even scenes with long dialogues bordering on philosophical debates. All this is something that in \"Fate/Zero 2\" has been lost almost completely. In the meantime, there has hardly been time for anything else. This is something that subtracts variety from development and personally I think it vulgarizes completely the rich background they had created before.\\n\\n\r\nAnother point against and although this is much more subjective (it may be otherwise in a review?), has been the management of characters in the plot. Basically, I would say that the characters I liked most died without time to do nothing or they had little or no apparitions/relevance. The only exception to this is probably Iskandar (Rider). On the contrary, the characters that have never aroused my interest have been absolute protagonists in \"Fate/Zero 2\". Even more.\\n\\n\r\nOtherwise, everything is practically the same as the first batch of episodes. The technical and artistic section is a cast (obvious), with the exception that perhaps the horrendous 3D models they use have been out of tune even more. Or so it seemed to me. In my opinion the animation is simply correct from episode 1, without too many boasts. I'm surprised to read things like \"it's the best animation in anime history and it hasn't been surpassed yet\". I have read this literally. No comments. \\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is still a real masterpiece. This is probably the best section of \"Fate/Zero 2\". Epic melodies and perfectly integrated in the scenes. Of course, the opening of the first season played by LiSA is unsurpassable, however much the new one is not bad. And neither, in my opinion, the best melody (The Legend) doesn't appear, so even in this case it can be considered the sequel a little bit below.\\n\\n\\n\r\n- Spanish Review (Original and faithful version)\\n\\n\r\nHay ocasiones en las que un anime no te agrada por mucho que sea un referente en cuanto a calidad y/o popularidad. Sea por la raz\u00f3n que sea no es para ti y no lo disfrutas, a la vez que asistes at\u00f3nito a una cascada de elogios que no terminas de comprender. A m\u00ed personalmente esto me ha ocurrido ya m\u00e1s de una vez, en mayor o menor medida. En cuanto a calidad podr\u00eda mencionar \"Code Geass\" y en cuanto a popularidad la candidata perfecta es \"SAO\". Y por desgracia me ha vuelto a pasar algo parecido con \"Fate/Zero\". Ya la primera temporada no cumpli\u00f3 mis expectativas, pero pens\u00e9 que esta segunda, que est\u00e1 mejor valorada a\u00fan, disipar\u00eda ese mal sabor de boca para as\u00ed poder entender el gran \u00e9xito de esta enrevesada y prol\u00edfica serie. No solo no ha sido as\u00ed, sino que adem\u00e1s ha empeorado un poco mis ya tibias impresiones iniciales.\\n\\n\r\nNo me voy a extender demasiado porque por mucho que esto se considere una segunda temporada, no deja de ser en realidad una segunda parte, por lo que en t\u00e9rminos generales no difiere pr\u00e1cticamente nada de la primera \"temporada\". Aun as\u00ed hay ciertos detalles que han hecho que esta segunda tanda de episodios me parezca un punto por debajo que la primera y es en ellos en los que me voy a centrar. Si te apetece leer una opini\u00f3n m\u00e1s general y que abarca m\u00e1s apartados, puedes leer mi review de \"Fate/Zero\".\\n\\n\r\nUna de las cosas que me agrad\u00f3 de la primera tanda de episodios fue c\u00f3mo supieron intercalar las batallas con momentos m\u00e1s tranquilos, momentos de reflexi\u00f3n que \"humanizaban\" a los personajes para empatizar con ellos de mejor forma. Incluso escenas con largos di\u00e1logos rozando los debates filos\u00f3ficos. Todo eso es algo que en \"Fate/Zero 2\" se ha perdido pr\u00e1cticamente por completo. Entre tanto combate y combate apenas ha habido tiempo para otra cosa. Esto es algo que resta variedad al desarrollo y a t\u00edtulo personal creo que vulgariza completamente el rico trasfondo que hab\u00edan creado antes.\\n\\n\r\nOtro punto en contra y aunque esto es bastante m\u00e1s subjetivo (\u00bfaunque puede ser de otra forma en una review?), ha sido la gesti\u00f3n de personajes en la trama. B\u00e1sicamente dir\u00eda que los personajes que m\u00e1s me gustaban o han muerto sin tiempo a nada o apenas han tenido apariciones/relevancia. Probablemente la \u00fanica excepci\u00f3n a esto haya sido Iskandar (Rider). Por el contrario, los personajes que nunca me han suscitado ning\u00fan inter\u00e9s han sido protagonistas absolutos en \"Fate/Zero 2\". A\u00fan m\u00e1s.\\n\\n\r\nPor lo dem\u00e1s, todo es pr\u00e1cticamente igual a la primera tanda de episodios. El apartado t\u00e9cnico y art\u00edstico es un calco (obvio), con la salvedad de que quiz\u00e1 los horrorosos modelados 3D que usan han dado el cante todav\u00eda m\u00e1s. O eso me ha parecido a m\u00ed. En mi opini\u00f3n la animaci\u00f3n es simplemente correcta desde el episodio 1, sin muchos alardes. Me sorprende leer cosas por ah\u00ed como \"es la mejor animaci\u00f3n de la historia del anime y no ha sido superada a\u00fan\". Esto lo he le\u00eddo literalmente as\u00ed. Sin comentarios. \\n\\n\r\nLa banda sonora s\u00ed que sigue siendo una aut\u00e9ntica genialidad. Probablemente sea el mejor apartado de \"Fate/Zero\" (de \"Fate/Zero 2 con m\u00e1s raz\u00f3n). Melod\u00edas \u00e9picas y perfectamente integradas en las escenas. Eso s\u00ed, el opening de la primera temporada interpretado por LiSA es insuperable, por mucho que el nuevo no sea malo. Y tampoco est\u00e1 la, bajo mi punto de vista, mejor melod\u00eda (The Legend), por lo que hasta en esto se puede considerar la secuela un puntito por debajo.",

I still don't know why ufotable decided to cut it into two seasons and bizarrely leave the first season with no real climax. Moreover I think it should have just been one season of 25 episodes, but I guess there might have been budget reasons. This is perhaps my biggest complaint about Fate/Zero.\r\nBy far the two biggest strengths that the 2nd season is that it has great battle sequences and a strong plot.It doesn't simply delve into a slasher flick where the characters don't really matter and that they need to be brutally murdered for shock value. Every character has a motivation for what they do. Whether they realize it or not is part of the story.\\n\\n\r\nFate/Zero is about a war that continues to happen and the winner gets to make a wish. The narrative, however, is that there are no winners in this brutal cycle of murder.",

            "content": "Fate/Zero Review (NO SPOILERS)\r\n.......................................................................................WHAT.\r\nOk. Fate/Zero. A show that I saw a lot of pictures of for a while and it just had something about it that made me think it would become one of my favorite anime series ever. Did that end up being true? Well, let's see. Now, before I begin the review, let me make it clear that first off, this is a review of BOTH seasons. Not just 1 or 2. Just so we're clear on that. You can't really just stop at the first season, anyway, so I feel this is justified. And second, this review is being done by someonewho has ZERO (teehee) experience with ANYTHING else Fate, related. I haven't seen Fate/Stay Night, I haven't seen Unlimited Blade Works. I chose to start with Fate/Zero, because it's first in the timeline. So if my opinions seem a bit strange, due to not knowing anything else that happens in the future, that is why. Ok. Now that that's settled, let's jump into the review.\\n\\n\r\nNow, again. This review is being done, before seeing anything else Fate related. Fate/Zero may be first in the timeline, but it was released after Fate/Stay Night and Unlimited Blade Works. So maybe this complaint would be null and void if I watched it in release order, but I really had a hard time following what was going on, a lot of the time. The first season is very slow, in my opinion. It focuses a lot more on building up the world and characters, but in a bit of a weird, almost awkward sort of way. While the second season completely focus on tearing everything apart, and ripping any and all hope you had for anything and anyone to shreds. The second season was much more intense and engaging to watch, but I still wish that kind of intensity was sprinkled all around the entirety of this show, rather than just solely the second half. For the most part, I knew what was going on. I know who's on whose side. I know which characters I'm rooting for. I know what they're fighting for. I get the main gist of it, but it tends to get a bit convoluted in terms of explaining its history. Stuff like the connections and relations with all the characters in the past, explaining the details of the Holy Grail War, the different classes and creatures and rules of magic in this world. It got better in the second season, which is a lot more action oriented. But then it wen back to being confusing in the ending. And I still don't entirely know what just happened.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters either range from very interesting, to not at all. Personally, I much rather preferred watching the servants be on screen and interact with one another, while the master characters were a lot less interesting and overall kinda quiet and bland. It's like, the show knew that they were taking a back seat to the servants, who were the real stars of the show. But still tried to focus the main story elements all on them. The masters have the deep story, while the servants have the fun personalities. If only we could've gotten both traits within both groups. Though, the masters did have their moments. Even if it was usually only when they were interacting with their servants. Specifically Irisveil and Waver. It certainly helped that they had the most interesting servants, out of the bunch.\\n\\n\r\nNow the place where this show REALLY shines, is in its animation. I'll just say it right here. I'm not sure if I'd call Fate/Zero's animation my favorite that I've ever seen. But I'm willing to say that it's one of, if not THE best animation I've ever seen in an anime series, not counting movies. This show is downright gorgeous in every way! Seriously, it looks like it was released just yesterday, it looks so good! I'd go as far as to say that you need to watch this show, only for the amazing visuals. Because it's seriously stellar, 100% of the time. As for the music, I'm pretty much neutral on it. Nothing really jumped out on me, but it certainly wasn't bad, by any means, either. And as for the sub vs dub debate, considering the type of show that this is, with medieval knights and warriors and whatnot, I think it's a bit more appropriate to watch in English. The dub is pretty fantastic, with every single character. The only complaint I could come up with is that Kirei and Kiritsugu had VERY similar voices, and I often got their characters mixed up, because of that. But still, the performances were amazing, nonetheless. Though, I should probably warn you that if you plan on watching the entire Fate series in English, you'll have to watch out for some casting changes. As the main character, Saber, goes through a whopping THREE English voice actors, throughout the series. So if hearing characters lose their voice actors is a turn off for you, then you might wanna stick with the Japanese. The Japanese dub is amazing, as well. And I feel it actually adds to Saber's personality, specifically. Honestly, both the Japanese and English get my complete and total approval. So pick whichever one you like.\\n\\n\r\nSo then.... did I like this show? Well.... there were a couple times where I was heavily considering dropping it. The first season is VERY slow, and while the action parts are fun to watch, it was just very rare to see any of those, on top of the story being rather confusing. If it wasn't for the FIRST episode of Season 2 getting REAL intense REAL quickly, I probably would've dropped this show. Season 2 was much more enjoyable, and incredibly intense and mind blowing until the very end. Speaking of the end...... WHAT!? Like, seriously. WHAT!? Ok. If they were planning to get people like me to immediately want to watch Fate/Stay Night, after Zero, they succeeded. You outright can't just watch Fate/Zero. Not with that ending! I am definitely very much intrigued to find out what happens next, now. For those who watched Fate/Zero after Stay Night and UBW, I'm not sure how you'd feel about this show. Personally, I'm sure I would've appreciated learning about the backstory a bit more, but having THIS be the last Fate thing I ever watch would've been very... weird. So I'm glad I decided to watch Zero first. And while it may not be right away, they definitely sold me on eventually watching the rest of the story unfold.\\n\\n\r\nFate/Zero gets a 7/10",

            "content": "NOTE- this is a review of both seasons. And I am assuming that you've already watched/played Fate Stay/Night or at least heard of it.\r\nSTORY- 8/10\r\nThe setting of the story is Fuyuki City, Japan, where seven Masters summon seven Servants of various class to fight against one another for the Holy Grail, which many of us would know from watching Fate/Stay Night, be it the original 2006 adaption, the Unlimited Blade Works movie, or the new 2014 adaption. Fate Zero follows the events of the 4th Holy Grail War. Fast-paced, engaging, and full of twists and turns, the story is definitely above average from your averageanime and the nonexistence of fan service makes it a rather mature anime, since a lot of concepts on heroism and whether the ends justify the means is thrown in the viewer's face. My only issue is probably the double length episode that ufotable likes to throw at its viewers that discusses the rules and mechanics of the Holy Grail War, but is necessary to the plot. And at one point the three most dangerous people in the series were all sitting together drinking, so that was kind of weird (though they did it for understandable reasons).\\n\\n\r\nART- 9/10\\n\r\nWell, it's ufotable, so it's going to be good. The art is beautiful, with great action scenes (although not as good as Fate Stay/Night's 2014 adaption). Static scenes are also excellent, making Fate/Zero one of the most visually amazing anime I've ever seen.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND- 9/10\\n\r\nThe voices for each character fits them very well, ranging from the calm, deep voice of Emiya Kiritsugu to the light, almost joyful tone of his wife Irisviel. Yuki Kajiura's music is as good as ever, with tracks that are easily identifiable as the predecessors to SAO's great OST's grand choirs and orchestras. The openings are also great, foreshadowing the tragedies that would occur (and that you should probably know if you've watched Fate Stay/Night). \\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER- 9/10\\n\r\nAnother strong area- Fate/Zero's characters are great. All the Master-Servant pairs are matches for one another, whether they be friends or loathe each other with conflicting ideals. The story also doesn't really have a main character, leaving the POV omnipresent, which allows the viewer to look at the personality and backstories of the various groups fighting for the Grail. The characters themselves range from Hassan from Assassin's Creed to a ninja priest to Alexander the Great. The show delves into each Master's motives for fighting in the war, as noble or tragic as they may be, and in many cases, tears them apart. A more in-depth character profile without major spoilers.\\n\\n\r\nKiritsugu Emiya- the closest thing to the main character that this show has. Foster father of Emiya Shirou (the biggest idiot in the franchise) and a secret agent who's primary hobby is shooting a hole in a mage's head. One of the most interesting characters in the series, reminding me of Archer from the original Fate Stay/Night (for good reason). \\n\\n\r\nTokiomi Tohsaka- father of Tohsaka Rin from Fate/Stay Night. Skilled mage who is the teacher of Kotomine Kirei and wishes for good futures for his family, even if others don't agree. \\n\\n\r\nKotomine Kirei- rival of Kiritsugu is unsure of why he was chosen to fight in the war and seeks for a source of enjoyment. Also a hacker when it comes to combat, he could probably take on some of the weaker Servants.\\n\\n\r\nKariya Matou- family friend of the Tohsakas whose love for them puts him on edge with Tokiomi. Decides to fight in the Grail Wars to protect Tokiomi's wife Aoi and her children. This guy is kinda depressing what he has to go through, one of my favorites from the series. \\n\\n\r\nRyuunosuke- a psycho young adult who decides to summon a demon and accidentally puts himself in the war without him even knowing it. Really creepy kind of guy.\\n\\n\r\nWaver Velvet- college student who fights in the war mostly to gain recognition. A bit of a coward and almost useless in actual combat apart.\\n\\n\r\nLord Kayneth Archibald- (second) most annoying guy in the series for me, is kinda a jerk to everyone he fights against. Accomplished mage and is a teacher at the college Waver attends.\\n\\n\r\nSaber- the same Saber from F/SN who serves under Shirou. Fights for the Grail for the good of her country; her ideals clash with that of other Servants.\\n\\n\r\nArcher- the ancient king Gilgamesh, who is a hacker and narcissist. Believes that everything belongs to him and spends a lot of time drinking and making couches dirty with his clothes (but never gets drunk somehow). Has long conversations with Kirei about life and such. Arrogant snob knows honorable opponents and bravery when he sees it and isn't a total prick.\\n\\n\r\nRider- an extremely buff, muscular warrior who strives to take over the world and is pretty hax himself if needed. A really fun character and a fan favorite.  Likes to spend all his Master's money on video games, TV shows, and food, but is willing to defend his Master with his life.\\n\\n\r\nLancer- another fan favorite who is a handsome spearman who puts chivalry above victory, and would rather die than betray a fellow knight. Also a badass for using two spears and is really good with them. \\n\\n\r\nCaster- the most annoying character in the series for me. SPOILERS- Servant of Ryuunosuke and also likes to go around murdering kids, but has his motives for doing so and fights in the Grail Wars for an understandable reason (even if it's kinda stupid). He also is kinda weird since he's suppose to be a knight but he looks like a Satanist almost. \\n\\n\r\nBerserker- a mysterious Servant who dons a suit of armor and has this cool black fog/smoke emitting from him. Has the ability to touch weapons and use them for himself. \\n\\n\r\nAssassin- well, based on reading the review up to here, it's pretty obvious who he is. Skilled in maneuvering and stealth missions but not good for direct combat, unlike the Assassin from the F/SN series. \\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT- 8/10\\n\r\nAt times I felt rushed with the story (probably due to me being fairly new to the \"good\" anime like Code Geass, Fate series, etc.) and didn't have enough time to take everything in, but the moral struggles, the fights, and the conflicting characters easily makes up for that. Although I did watch this show in the middle of the night, so that might explain why I didn't enjoy this show as much as I enjoyed other shows similar to it. \\n\\n\r\nOVERALL- 9/10\\n\r\nFate/Zero is a good balanced anime that combines great animation and sound with interesting characters, a good plot and interesting premise, and discussions on morality and heroism. A must-watch for all anime viewers, be it elitists or casual viewers.",

            "content": "This Review is out of 100. 35/100 for Story, 35/100 for Characters, 15/100 for Sound, 15/100 for Animation\r\nStory - 31/35 -Just when you thought Fate/Zero couldn't be more epic. Everything gets better in this series. More action, some unexpected plot twists, and much more. The story continues where season 1 stopped, and it uses the buildup to its advantage. The story flowed along nicely, and I especially liked the ending. The ending itself was good, but what I really liked was how the last episode was more like an epilogue to the series. I like that everyone and everything seemed to get wrapped up afterepisode 25, and the only loose ends are the ones explained in Fate/Stay Night. The problems with the show are the fact thats you needed to know some stuff about the Fate Franchise to understand everything that happened, and if you know about the franchise odds are you saw Stay Night, which means the ending came as no surprise to you. It's one of those problems that comes from being a prequel. Also, it sets the stage for Fate/Stay Night, so you will have to watch it to get the \"complete story\", and that anime is garbage (compared to this). \\n\\n\r\nCharacters - 32/35 - When I said everything get better, I meant it. The main characters all got more developed, especially Kiritsugu and Kirei. While we see Kirei develop the most out of the cast, we learn little about his past. For Kiritsugu, we learn a lot about his past (2 full episodes worth), and he doesn't start changing until the end. This show likes making the characters break down, and I must say it is really effective. The endings for each character is different, some get good endings, others are more bittersweet, while others are just sad. All of the characters (the ones that lived anyway) get more interesting compared to season 1. \\n\\n\r\nSound - 14/15 - I still found the openings and endings to be lackluster. While the score is still great, this is not the composers best work (really good, just not the best). \\n\r\nAs I said before the dub sounds acceptable (for people who prefer dubs) but if you are like me and don't really care I say pick the sub on this one.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation 15/15 - I want to give it more, like a 16 because it STILL looks this good after 2 season. Most shows start to deteriorate a little after a while, but this show looks great up until the very last scene. \\n\\n\r\nOverall - 92/100 - I gave Season 1 a 86/100, which would put this show around the 89 to 90 mark. A great series indeed. Not perfect, but easily one of the best I have seen and one of the best of 2012. \\n\\n",

            "content": "Lets be realistic, most prequels SUCK! Especially comparing against the original work that ultimately originated them. This is something very common to most of them, gadly Fate/Zero and 2nd Season is a exception. I will only review 2nd Season though.\r\nStory: Picking were it was left on the first season, the season start strong with one of the best battle scenes of the whole series!! From there on, the story keeps the flow till the end, not letting the viewers get boring or uninterested. One main divergence about the first season, it is the action, there is alot of it here, the quality is the sameif not higher that of the previous! Less mysteries, but lots of twists, and there were some episodes (18 and 19 I think) that really nailled it for me, got me very emotional, I could seriously feel the pain of the characters faced with such adversity and cruelty of the reality on their lives... The story was very well done, the only restrain IMO was that I already knew what would happen in the end, because I had seen Fate/Stay Night long ago, and so though there some twists and some pretty sorrowfull things that ocurred, most of them I was expecting them to happen, so there wasnt that suprise factor. Still very well built story, that touchs lots of different ideals and PoV of different characters, itself takes place in fictitious universe of mages, monsters and heroic spirits, BUT there is soo much humanity onto the story, the actions and decisions taken, the dark side of humanity behavior is showed alot (more into the first season though...)! \\n\r\nHumanity at its best, and its worst!! A very dark story.  \\n\r\nSTORY 9\\n\\n\r\nArt: One of the 2 key points of the anime, I have seen better fighting scenes, more flashy ones, that scream EPIC all the times... BUT for the nature of the anime, it was perfect, I mean you couldnt have whole cities exploding or a epic scale kinda all out war kinda action, though the action itself it is still amazing, great battle scenes, the best of all are the facial animation and feelings of the cast, that perfectly manages to transmit them to the viewers! Be aware that there are some strong scenes that some may not enjoy seeing at all, personally it maximazes the emotions that it was suposed to transmit to the viewer, so it was well used and not exagerated IMO. Definitly one of the best point of the anime!!\\n\r\nART 10\\n\\n\r\nSound: Great Op's and End's, mixed with some great music themes for when the scenes call for them, those that see the anime, cant say the sound was bad!! Some of the more emotional parts where very well accomplished, and much of its praise is the result of a great Original Soundtrack, that Fate/Zero comes with, both for the first and for this second season!\\n\r\nSOUND 9\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: In the Fourth Holy Grail War, 7 masters and 7 servants take part of, and lets not forget about Irisviel and other characters... all great, some better than others, but every one is at least fairly enough developed for the importance of their roles into the story!! Great and distintive personalities, Rider (The King of Conquerors), at first on season 1, views the world as a conquest, but there is alot much deeper meaning for is action latter on, Gilgamesh is an asshole, but he is charismatic, interesting and with Kirei(doesnt knew what entertainement was... dumbass!!), their nasty plots bring much misfortune!! Then you have Kiritsugu and his dark sorrowfull past, that serves to explain this cold mage assassin killer, and his calculative way of seeing and measuring life, Irisviel is more than it seems to be, Saber like in the sequel shares grief for her past life and is on a quest to redeem herself, Berseker master just wants to save a little girl, that he has much affection for, and things just turn worst and worst for his side... And I could keep going on and on (even talking about the Psycho maniac duo Master and Servant)!! What most surprised me were the characters, the sequel doesnt have half the quality seem here, it is wonderfull, to have seen 25 episodes, all interesting and fun, much of it because of the great cast! \\n\r\nIt is hard, especially nowadays a show to have this quality of ideals, personalities, valors, ways of thinking and living from and to... \\n\r\nRemarkable!!\\n\r\nCHARACTER 10\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: With pretty much of what I said, I had a great time watching season 2, it was very amusing, keep on ride till the end, a great production, surely a great time for the people that spent their time into the anime, you will be reward constantly until the very end!\\n\r\nENJOYMENT 9\\n\\n\r\nOverall: I said all that, and I would like to give even more praise to the anime, but I cant, I would love to give it a 10, but I want to be true to myself!! For the first time never was so hard for me to review a anime, it deserves more than 9, but less than 10, I m really pissed the scoring couldnt be more sub-divided... and I will explain why. \\n\r\nIt is true that the whole anime, both first and second seasons, are full of many great, memorable and enjoyable moments that I wont ever forget, but I come to watch this knowing what would be the end of the anime, like I said the sequel was firstly released (and people insist to see stuff in chronological order), so I came here knowing, these, these and these survive, you, you and you all, ARE DEAD, kinda of thing, most of the surprises for a newbie to the whole series, werent surprises to me, and that downgraded the experience for me!! Also even knowing the ending, I was expecting a better \"battle\" between the last 2 servants, even though the one of their masters was EPIC, this one failed into my consideration! So what can I say more, I would had give 10 to the anime if I hadnt seen Fate/Stay Night from before(and probably would had give a less score to the sequel be influence of this), and IMO this would had been the best course of action!! \\n\r\nI reccomend to everyone interested, SEE this much better prequel first, and then see the not bad, not so great sequel, knowing the past, it will still be enjoyable, and you wont regret your decision, having had even a better experience with this amazing anime prequel's !! \\n\r\nOVERALL (9+10+9+10+9)/5= 9.4 (cant give it a exact 9 either!! Too low, compared with some other 9's of mine...)\\n\\n\r\nWishs, miracles, saving the world, it is all \"pretty & sweet\"!!!... unlike reality.\\n\r\nSome paths you have to take alone, others you have to choose the lesser of both evils! Kiritsugu Emiya goes for both...\\n\r\nThis is how prequels are done, if more like these are in the making, I welcome thee for sure!!",

            "content": "DISCLAIMER: My full thoughts on this anime can be extensively detailed in my review of the first season this will just be a quick run down of how the 2nd season held up in comparison (also I forgot this was 25 not 26 episodes which I wrote in the first review sorry about that but its not a big deal this story was paced well enough with enough 45 min episodes to basically make it 26 episodes).  So regarding the 2nd season of Fate/Zero I think that is gives a mostly proper ending to the series emphasis on mostly.  I should warn theremight be some spoilers but I'll try to avoid them the best I can.  So to give a quick run through of every master servant combo all except one had a proper end.  I'm obviously referring to Kiritsugu and Saber who lost the final battle resulting in the destruction of Fuyuki while yes I'm aware this was necessary to set up Fate/stay night the series especially in the latter half wants you to root for Kiritsugu and Saber which maybe is why they fail but I feel the end could've have been better executed.  Now overall I still enjoyed this anime and is one of my favorites like for example the scene where Kiritsugu is in the grail is fantastically shot and written this is a classical example of the journey being more important than the destination",

            "content": "[Contains SPOILERS; skip to last paragraph to avoid all possible spoilers]\r\nFate/Zero, a series that has captivated me in many facets, refuses to budge from its deadlock position it has held me in from the very first episode with its servant summoning ritual spells, to the last episode with our battle-weary protagonist\u2019s last few moments with his adopted son in the moonlight. (Just the first episode alone spurred me on a marathon consisting of the rest of the first season and all of Fate Stay/Night.)\r\nThe mechanics of the series dictates a part of the plot, and in its dictation, the master\u2019s strategies and the plot slowlypiece together like a puzzle, and this enigmatic facet of F/Z is what contributes a part to capturing not only attention, but interest; it\u2019s often not the most efficient or logical way to charge into your opponent\u2019s domain without researching them or making a coherent plan. The way the series immerses its audience in the conveyed environments and the way it does what it does is through its sublime art style and underlying, complementary music; least to say, the combined effect leaves an emotional aftertaste. Additionally, check if you\u2019re an earthling if you denied Ilya or Rin\u2019s adorability, not the most crucial constituents to the series but rather evidence of the indescribably likable art style. The opening and endings are appropriate sheaths and caps for the series collectively and the ending Manten is even more so the silver platter beneath the scrumptious serving, albeit a relatively small one. \\n\\n\r\nThe ambient sentiments make it immensely enjoyable and more vicariously palatable. Even though some acknowledged Fate/Zero for its action, it should be known also for its characterization and developments, which is executed well eminently for Kiritsugu, Saber, Kirei, Waver, and Rider to name a few. For instance, episodes that exemplified such quintessential characterization were the ones that provided the necessary parts of Kiritsugu\u2019s backstory; he was originally an ordinary boy who would one day inherit the Emiya family crest and continue the inherited work on a seemingly typical island with its mythic, underlying tale. That changed when he ran away from the reality of the product of his father\u2019s work and his crush\u2019s aspirations; his action ultimately led to his newfound ideal and justification for his deeds. He was notorious for his tactic of downing an entire jetliner just because his target was there; however, the full circumstances are disclosed in just one episode and the old image of Kiritsugu, the one that Kirei had initially speculated upon, shattered. For Saber, Berserker and Lancer\u2019s participation complemented her characterization well; Berserker sufficed in doing so for her past and new reason to obtain the Grail, Lancer for building on their chivalrous principles, and Kiritsugu for contrasting combat methods. \\n\\n\r\nSimultaneously, aside from the thriller, action, and magical aspects, the series also tells a tale of budding friendship (between Waver and Rider), and love and tragedy between Kiritsugu and Irisviel and (unreciprocated love for) Kariya, whose dreams went unrealized. The series correctly implemented the elements needed to evoke certain emotions: memorable scenes include Caster\u2019s conviction of a pure and fresh form of terror, Waver\u2019s relinquishment of his status as master (when he and Iskandar start to see each other in a more vis-\u00e0-vis fashion in the symbolic solvation of the distinction between master and servant), Kiritsugu\u2019s final conversation with Natalia, and Rin\u2019s adventure, the last of which was a well-done deviation. \\n\\n\r\nThe series overall offered a cornucopia: elegant dialogue and lyrics, broad character (and relationship) development, solid mechanics, an enticing plot and conflicts, immaculate visuals (especially for the Blu-ray), and last but far from least, highly gratifying, enjoyable set of music (particularly the OP/EDs). \\n",

Too many back stories, crammed into so few episodes. Like I said in my review for season 1, when it came time for the plot to wide down, it's like the author had too many loose ends and everything got sloppily tied together.\r\nNow don't get me wrong, it actually a pretty good anime. I just think it's a little bit over-hyped. I don't think it's worthy of such a large fan base because it isn't anything that's exceptionally unique. \r\nI mightre-watch it sometime in the far away future, just to see if I like it better a second time around, but for right now, I was disappointed with the way things started to turn out half way through the 2nd season.

It's just epic!\\n\r\nThe story goes dark pretty damn fast. Already from the first episode things start to get depressing. Some characters walk down the road of destruction. Some characters sit around and drink fancy Mesopotamian wine. And others goes on a children killing-spree.\\n\r\nThe show also have some of the most intense and intruiging dialouge in anime-history, some leaving you with chills down the spline.\\n\r\nBasicly, every second of the series is awesome epicness.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 10\\n\r\nUfotable did an amazing job here, and 99% of the time, everything looks gorgeous. The landscape, the animations, everything looks fantastic. The action-scenes are probably where the art can be most appreciated, but the show's visuals shines constantly through the series.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10\\n\r\nAs expected, the soundtrack is fantastic. Along with superb voice-acting and sound-design, the sound it top-notch all the way though. Along with a fantastic second opening and three amazing Endings, there isn't really anything to complain about.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 10\\n\r\nEven though Fate/zero is an all-rounder, it's strong-points most likely lies in the characters. Never have I seen any show manage to add +15 characters to a show and make them all so interesting and threedimentional. There wasn't a single character I could honestly say I disliked, sinply because they were all so well-made. I never felt any of the characters were unrealistic, and they all had their own morals, some more twisted than others. Include it with an amazing character-development for both the protagonist, antagonist, and some of the other main-characters, it's really hard not to feel with any of them.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10\\n\r\nAwesome action-scenes, deep and interesting dialouge, Awesome visuals, Awesome soundtrack, Fantastic characters. I couldn't ask for more. It's just epic.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 10\\n\\n\r\nIt's definately one of, if not the best anime to come out in the last 12 years. It is a must-watch for anyone that feel introuged by anything mentioned here. You will not be dissapointed.",

            "content": "In first season, or first half, I found genre really off putting. I was here for Urobuchi, but what I got was a lot of excuses to throw flashy fights, kinda reason why I dropped Fate/Stay Night, except this really is way way better in every way. Even flashy fights were amazing, but I found their context and consequence really annoying. I guess I was hoping it would tackle the Free For All conundrum in a new and interesting way, kind of like Mirai Nikki at least tried. But Fate/Zero wasn't really interested in that, in first season it really looks as classical overuse offights to death consistently ending with excuse to off put the fight for later. Excuses felt a bit dishonest, as if only here because plot demanded it. And plot does demand it, plot goes on to expand the character cast and introduce a lot of things, little by little. Well, little by little was my problem with it, there was seemingly too much fighting minus consequences, and too little what I've come to expect from Urobuchi. I had to wait till second half, episode 16 to get to the Urobuchi goodness. \\n\\n\r\nIt's then, in second season, or second half, that characters and world views start to get explored in detail. Where shit starts going down. When stuff starts mattering. Like it genre shifted from shounen into psychological thriller. There are some goodies in first half, as well as some baddies in second half, naturally. It's part of what's keeping this from being a masterpiece in my book. Another part of it, now... Hulk would smash me for this, but another part is plot logic. The fantasy magic setting just felt overused as a cop out sometimes, where you aren't supposed to question stuff really. I just can't respect that as much as plot that pulls everything off with super solid logic. Maybe it's just my aversion towards magic in serious works. And this is very very serious work.\\n\\n\r\nEven though the plot logic feels clunky at places, storytelling wise, second half really does tell a very compelling story, that left me staring at credits screen at the end just being overall impressed. Though part of it was not being sure what exactly went on, and/or pondering how I should feel about what went on. I disliked the brutality, it was his most brutal work I've seen yet. Some of those scenes... just NO... just fuck you no! I'm also slightly annoyed that one plot thread never got explored, even though it's not exactly a plot hole as possibility of exploring the thread died together with the character. I was at first very impressed anime decided to tackle the thematic, just to see it completely ignored later. I guess its point was only to further characterize one of the characters, but even so, it's somewhat unforgivable to me as I really looked forward to see how it would be handled. It goes without saying how deep and nuanced characters are, along with their philosophies that get examined really nicely, though there is little of it in the first half. Funnily enough, second half/season also has far superior OP/ED, though mostly music wise.\\n\\n\r\nUfotable is the studio behind the production. It means production quality is ''holy shit how much did this cost?''. Ufotable visuals will surely help you get through the first half, definitely helped me.",

            "content": "_Fate/Zero_ is as arbitrary as the other Fate stuff I've watched, but gets the absurd exposition out of the way earlier and actually has characters worth a damn (Shiro is not a character in the F/SN anime, he is a shonen buffoon). I have a few quibbles with the rest of _Fate/Zero_, but overall - fantastic. And now I know why Kuritsugu is an admired character. The Banquet of Kings, the partnership with Alexander, the betrayal of Tokiomi, the last stands at the Grail, Kuritsugu's backstory... So many great moments.",

All of the 25 episodes were amazing and it was really easy to understand even for who didn't watch Fate/Stay Night before\r\nStory (9)\r\nWell, I really don't know how to evaluate a story. \r\nEvery thing where well explained, it was fluid and good enought to keep me interested in every episode, so, that should mean that is great\r\nArt (10)\r\nThe art and animation in this anime is completly outstanding. All said\r\nSound (9)\r\n- I'm always listening the music of the openings and endings\r\n- The OST are really amazing, but just on the backtrack.I will not listen any of them just for listening\\n\r\n- For all the saiyuus, you all did a really good job\\n\\n\r\nCharacter (7)\\n\r\nEasly the lowerest category score\\n\r\nDon't understand me wrong, almost all the characters were amazing but it lacks that special character that you always want to show up.

            "content": "I have no idea what Fate Stay/Night is about. That being said, I imagine that many first-time watchers are in the same boat. \r\nFate/Zero is a series with a lot of promise. Its premise allows for a plot that is filled with fast-paced action, war-time politics, and moral dilemmas. Season 1 does an okay job setting the stage, and Season 2 does an okay job reaching a resolution. The bottom line is that the series doesn't execute properly, with generally poor action sequences, poor character development, and too many instances of simply 'missing the beat'. The conclusion to the plot is pretty decent and youget good feelings of resolution on the main character, but that isn't enough to salvage this show from being just another decent anime.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\n[Rating]\\n\r\nStory: 7\\n\r\nArt: 9\\n\r\nSound: 5\\n\r\nCharacter: 7\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 7\\n\r\nOverall: 7\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\n[Story: 7]\\n\\n\r\nThe story doesn't develop well and has pretty little forward momentum. The series has to rely on characters saying things like 'I have a feeling this is going to be my last fight' to properly set the stakes for the scene when these sorts of things should be set up organically. Since the audience isn't in the mind of any of the planners, things sort of just 'happen'. They may be dark or surprising in essence, but the viewer has no expectations for these actions to measure up against, and when measuring up against nothing, they just fall flat. The story-telling just misses beats and can't seem to plan effectively. \\n\\n\r\nThat being said, the conclusion is quite good. It resolves the two real characters and doesn't do it too heavy-handedly.  I imagine that many would point to the conclusion as one of the bright spots of the series, and it is good, but not enough to elevate the series to stardom especially since the consistency of the characters is generally quite poor. The conclusion could be great if the audience could get very invested in the characters.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\n[Art: 9]\\n\\n\r\nNothing can be taken from the art. Mature. Exceptional lighting and shadow work. Higher detail than can be expected from a television series. Even makes the 3DCG look good. Even noteworthy variety in shot composition.\\n\\n\r\nThere are a few small things to fault the art for. Poor action choreography. It is slightly lacking in punch, and sorely lacking in interest. 'Hazy' visuals far too often. Strange, probably intentional, but happens more than I'd like. And lack of stylistic risks. Takes nothing away from the piece, but I like seeing fresh, interesting styles.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\n[Sound: 5]\\n\\n\r\nWell, the tracks are pretty good in theory and hold their roles quite well. However, the sound is often quite scratchy and balanced poorly. Like it actually caused me pain to hear. The voice acting can also be forced, loud, and ugly. Particularly Kotomine Kirei and Kariya Matou. It takes away from the series, so it... must be pretty poor.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\n[Character: 7]\\n\\n\r\nAnother instance where the characters, in theory, are quite good. They are diverse and fit their roles exceptionally well. But they don't really get the proper exposition. I would say the positive characters are Emiya and Rider. Waver is good, but only in his relationship to Rider.\\n\\n\r\nSo many characters have solid motivations that just don't come to fruition because the characters just don't compel the audience. Characters like Saber, Archer, Berserker, Archibald, Maiya, Tokiomi, Kariya, etc. just don't give you enough reason to connect with them. The list goes on and on. They have their place in the story and fit a concrete role, but that's it. People go beyond role-fitting, and creating convincing characters takes more than that.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\n[Enjoyment: 7]\\n\\n\r\nThe show misses many beats, but it isn't bad. Forward momentum in the plot would help so much. Just an inside perspective on Kiritsugu where he monologues about the grand scheme of the war could help a lot. \\n\\n\r\nAction could definitely be stronger. Better choreo or better sound design to give the battles more punch would be great. \\n\\n\\n\\n\r\n[Overall: 7] \\n\\n\r\nNothing else to be said. I'm not too familiar about the critiques of this movie, but I would guess that its grand reputation is survived by praise given to the variety of moral compasses and the conclusion. The show does a pretty good job with these things, but this alone should not have us exalt the series when it has equally destructive flaws that prevent it from connecting with the audience. \\n",
