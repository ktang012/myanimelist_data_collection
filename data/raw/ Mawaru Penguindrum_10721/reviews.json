            "content": "Remember during an English/Literature class and your teacher would recommend you a book to read for an important exam/lesson? Some of the contexts contain what you may think as a simple room painted in \"red\" actually hides a message of violence and anger. Another example is the book \"The Little Prince by Antoine de Saint-Exup\u00e9ry\" shares many symbols such as the rose being a symbol of vanity. Mawaru Penguindrum is definitely like a classic book. A classic book that uses objects as symbols.\r\nPractically, the whole anime in itself is a pure symbol of what you may think is a child's play is actually much morethan that.\\n\\n\r\nThe thing that made me drawn into the anime was pretty simple, the cute little blue penguins. I barely took the anime that seriously because I don't really check out the summary of an anime just for an element of surprise and the picture cover of the anime made it look like a children's show. The first few episodes did turn out to be a joke and I had a great time laughing and admiring the fun atmosphere the anime was giving. But once the anime started to take the story in a different direction the anime turns into an anime worth raising an eyebrow for.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 9\\n\r\nDuring the start of the anime, more likely the word \"fate/destiny\" does keep on repeating a dozen of times and mainly that is the general story line. Likely avoiding the destined future a person takes is not plausible -- and so that's when the penguindrum comes. Symbolism can never die down in this anime and it is unavoidable. What is unique about how the anime's flow of story goes is the endless amount of flashbacks you will receive in every episode. It surely is annoying and confusing because they do show you flashbacks in random but then it isn't much likely a bother if you are serious about getting to know this anime better. Another word you'll be hearing a lot of times in this anime is \"punishment\" and in life happiness doesn't come along the way you like it. There will always be hard times and consequences no matter how painful it is. The way I see with this anime a reward has to be equal to its punishment -- but I think that's just me. The greatest part of the anime for me was the ending. I think it was a pure masterpiece. I was overflowing with tears and anger but if you look at it in the story line itself and the meaning of destiny that ending did not fail to surprise me. An ending worth crying and worth inspiring.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 10\\n\r\nPractically the reason is that once we see a colorful piece of artwork the logical meaning is \"fun & happy\" but that picturesque is just a cover up and so that's when the \"Psychological\" genre clearly explains it. The bright colors was well-spot on with the anime. I always loved the transformation part of Himari. The splashing of colors, the angle shots and the well-detailed animation are all worth praising for. The opening and ending animations are both done beautifully. If I may, the Opening Animation or even the title screen of Mawaru in itself holds a lot of clues. They sure took their time planting these clues very well and hiding it from the viewers and with these colorful images it is a very bright idea that the director was hiding the \"main\" plot.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10\\n\r\nOne of the best soundtracks out there. I fell in love more with the OSTs rather than the Opening and Ending songs. What is so great about these OSTs is that the music is so perfect with the scene it was trying to match. My favorite OSTs would be \"The Children of Fruit and Destiny\" or \"Unmei no Ko Tachi\" -- listen to it and let the music feel you. I still cry to this OST and it still holds a deep meaning to me.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9\\n\r\nExcellent character development. The characters made this anime possible. Let me remind you, this has a psychological genre so more likely you'll see a lot of out-of-the-box characters. The anime didn't just focus on the four main characters but also all those characters around them had a big role in the anime and what can be more realistic than that. Today, we live our lives thinking that the people around us are just individuals who will be nothing more than just strangers not knowing that these people can change our life or more likely our destiny and that's how Mawaru Penguindrum explains it so well. The beautiful way of how the director connects all these minor/major characters makes you ask at how much more can this anime get more realistic as it is.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10\\n\r\nOne of the most rare animes that truly uses my brain to unfold the story. As I go beyond the episodes it becomes more intriguing and exciting. So much were happening in this show that I actually grabbed a pen and paper (literally) to try to unfold the life of all of these characters -- and it was a bliss. For a show to be called as an \"anime\" that kept me pre-occupied with questions was something I haven't really experience in my time being of watching animes and that's what makes this show so special. Penguindrum also holds my most favorite anime quotes. This is so far the only anime that truly made me experience happiness, sadness, anger, suspense and even madness. It practically is the only anime that moved me to think over my life (I know, what the hell) and the great deal of Penguindrum being able to touch me so much is a much better work than any masterpiece.\\n\\n\r\nOver-all: 10\\n\r\nMawaru Penguindrum is not like any normal anime. It's a work of art that is in need of 100% of your attention and fairly \"a lot\" of brain power. Like any great literary piece, not all would understand the point of view of the creator but then if you are able to, most especially in Penguindrum, you'll feel how beautiful this creation is.",

            "content": "When someone on the Internet describes a work of fiction as 'visionary', it's usually meant as a form of praise, referring to a willingness to defy convention in favor of something more thought-provoking and enticing. As defined by a dictionary, 'visionary' refers to embracing fanciful and often impractical ideas.\r\nMawaru Penguindrum falls under both definitions.\r\nWhat Kunihiko Ikuhara of Utena-fame has created here is a show that takes philosophical musings on themes such as fate, love and death; and combines them with slapstick antics involving ghost penguins and ping-pong balls that erase people's memories.\r\nIf that sounds difficult to take seriously to you, don't bother watching this show.It's going to get a lot weirder.\\n\\n\r\nThe overall product is audacious, if nothing else; presenting the story 2 brothers, Kanba and Shoma, who promise to help a mysterious entity track down an object called the Penguindrum in a desperate attempt to ward off the death of their sister, Himari. Their quest has them run into a slew of  messed up characters and situations, and before long the narrative turns into a complete mess.\\n\\n\r\nThere are several reasons for this.\\n\\n\r\nA big problem is that the series has absolutely no regard for logic and consistency, even within its own narrative. At the start of the series, Himari is brought back to life after succumbing to an incurable disease. Her death and subsequent revival are treated as tragic and miraculous, respectively. Makes sense. What doesn't is that this is repeated several times over the course of the series, treated with the same impact every time. Viewers, however, might be puzzled or annoyed by this repetition seeing as it raises the question as to how severely this series treats the concept of death. This is exacerbated once another character reveals that he's been dead for over a decade, after which the story moves on, completely unaffected by the revelation.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter development also tends to be very inconsistent. Motivations, personalities and even backstories can change from one scene to the next just to suit the needs of the plot. The aforementioned memory-erasing ping-pong balls are liberally used to retool previously established plot-points to the narrative's convenience. \\n\\n\r\nOther, basic issues also plague the storytelling: many of the back stories feel interchangeable (crappy childhoods galore), some characters who get a lot of screen time end up being completely insignificant while others are introduced seeming important only to be forgotten about before anything could even be done with them. The latter goings-on of the story also feature hackneyed  developments involving terrorism, delusions (it's all in your head!) and cliffhangers (someone was stabbed! but who?) that end up not mattering in the slightest. \\n\\n\r\nMost damning of all, however, is the clumsy way the overall product comes together. The shifts in tone \u2013 from whacky to dark and vice versa \u2013 are as frequent as they are jarring, and it all too often feels that the subjects about which characters are philosophizing have very little to do with the story of two brothers who are attempting to ward off that which should be inevitable.\\n\\n\r\n*WARNING! The following paragraph contains spoilers about the general tone of the ending! WARNING*\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of which, the ending cops out on that in a major way. The series spends a lot of time emphasizing how ordinary people are  powerless in the face of fate and that struggling against the inevitable will often result in greater tragedy. One would expect such a story to end on a tragic note as is befit for a something that fancies itself an exploration of fate, but the actual ending turns out rather bittersweet; mostly leaning towards the sweet considering the dark events preceding it.\\n\\n\r\n*END SPOILERS*\\n\\n\r\nAll that said, the series must certainly be praised yet again for its unique style. This show isn't just different for the hell of it. Ikuhara combines audio and imagery in striking ways, constantly delivering scenes that will shock and surprise. Even if you end up disliking the series, there's a definite guarantee that you'll remember it. Which is more than can be said for a lot of other stuff.\\n\\n\r\nIn closing, I'd like to say that while many others would opine that the Mawaru Penguindrum's unique style, impeccable direction and interesting themes make for a wonderful anime, I think that there are too many issues with the overall product to really consider it great. Many of which, I feel, can't be chalked up to mere artistic idiosyncrasy.",

            "content": "Mawaru Penguindrum is a beautiful piece of art. It can inspire either much love or hate, and new details are discovered with each viewing. Intelligent symbolism and heavy themes span all of Penguindrum's 24 episodes. Despite its surreal delivery, Penguindrum remains very real.\r\nThe story of Mawaru Penguindrum is completely absurd. Not absurd because of the surreal elements, but how it makes something so imaginative and implausible seem real. We start off with a dying sister, her revival, and eventual search for a mysterious object, called the \"penguin drum\". Yet, somewhere along the way, the story becomes a situation of life, death, and existence itself. \r\nTheplot takes a while to reach its climax. Half of the show is spent on character development, craziness, humor, and seemingly random events. The first half is exciting, and the absolute insanity never stops. However, this slow-developing plot is crucial; the characters grow on you. And if you have any siblings, it'll hit close to home. The second half, on the other hand, takes a dark turn, and the plot moves much quicker here. The development and random elements from the first half are pieced together, and nothing ends up being random or useless. Nevertheless, the show's thematic elements are certainly strange. There's comedy, terrorism/cult politics, moral ambiguity, philosophy,  all tied together by the overarching theme of family and friendship. The story isn't just unique; it's relevant without being pretentious and forceful. As stated before, its absurd, but the themes, feelings, and other elements that Penguindrum invokes is very real. \\n\\n\r\nBrain's Base put quite some effort here. As the makers of Natsume Yuujinchou, the art quality is outstanding. The story isn't the only thing that's surreal; the art is too. From the strange angles and fantasy-esque scenes, the art has a Shaft feel. How a studio is able to go from a calm slice-of-life, realistic style to flamboyant, Bakemonogatari-like flair is beyond me. The art truly complements the story.\\n\\n\r\nSound is just as great as the art. The music is simply stunning. The opening themes are performed very well, and their compositions are genius. The ending themes are mostly covers of ARB (old Japanese rock band) with a cool twist. Dear Future (first ending theme) is exceptional--extensive use of hemiola, polyrhythms, layering, and the most angry/painful sounding minor chords. In other words, the music was made for musicians while being very accessible. This isn't you regular J-Pop or J-Rock fair. The rest of the soundtrack is appropriate, but not exactly memorable. Sound effects are also well-done.\\n\\n\r\nAgain, character development is crucial to Penguindrum. \\n\\n\r\nKanba: You'll hate some of his decisions, but you'll always have sympathy for the Takakura siblings. He's a cool guy, and he will do anything to save his family, no matter the consequences. He does some immoral things.\\n\r\nShouma: He's innocent but brave. He will only do what is right, but just like Kanba, he tries to protect his family whenever he can. \\n\r\nHimari: She's the little sister of the Takakuras'. She's rather intelligent and insightful, and unlike the majority of sisters in anime (or in media in general), she's not filled with moe/kawaii or tsundere-ness. The Takakuras are very likable, and each have their own quirky personalities.\\n\r\nRingo: She'll creep you out for most of the show, but you'll eventually love her too. Confused but wholehearted.\\n\r\nPenguins: THEY ARE THE CUTEST THINGS IN THE UNIVERSE. They provide most of the comedic relief in the show, and each penguin takes its personality quirks from their respective owners.\\n\r\nThe remaining cast are interesting, and they all add quite a bit to the story. \\n\\n\r\nI loved Mawaru Penguindrum. It has its own peculiar charm through its humor and its tragedy. I thoroughly enjoyed Penguindrum's use of literary themes (foreshadowing, allusions, etc.) and overall artistic approach to everything. In addition, it made me feel a wide-range of emotions, from joy and confusion to sadness and anger, and by the end of it, I was left crying with tears of sadness and joy.\\n\\n\r\nBut that's not to say that you'll love it too. As with any work of art, it will inspire love or hate. In any case, if you happen to enjoy this show, it will open your eyes quite a bit--if you're not used to opening them. Otherwise, you'll be very amused. So, give Mawaru Penguindrum a shot. It will take the whole show to truly appreciate it, although I question your humanity if it doesn't make you interested. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Before I started watching this anime, even before I knew what it was called, I already had a feeling it was going to be special. \r\nAfter watching the first episode, I said aloud: \"This is the weirdest anime...!\" But despite that, I was very drawn to it and kept watching. I wasn't disappointed. \r\nMawaru Penguindrum has made me both laugh and cry more than once, and after episode 8 I could hardly wait to watch more, putting all the other anime I had been watching on hold for this. \r\nThe story is very touching, and the Takakura family's close bonds with each other was somethingI really loved. I was rather surprised at the plot twists(I won't give anything away, but beware- Penguindrum isn't all sweetness and light), but I do like anime that's darker than it first appears to be. The story also gets much deeper, and although by the end some things are still left unexplained, I think that's part of the magic of the show.\\n\\n\r\nThe artwork and soundtrack both left me speechless. I felt like the music fit perfectly, whether it was a moment of happiness, sorrow or a gripping dramatic scene. I also got incredibly attached to the opening and ending themes, both music and art-wise. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters are amazing. The Takakura siblings are all lovable, and some later characters (which I won't name because of spoilers) are just to die for. Ringo's existance annoyed the hell out of me, but now I've grown to love her as well. \\n\\n\r\nAll in all, I think Mawaru Penguindrum was a fantastic show. I couldn't reccomend it more, and it's one of the best I saw in 2011. Magic, mystery, love and tradgedy- it's all there. I've seen several people say that \"it isn't a show for everyone\", but doesn't that apply to most anime? I think it would be a shame to go through life without seeing it. \\n\\n\\n\r\nBut watch and see for yourself-\\n\r\n Penguindrum may just leave you spellbound...",

            "content": "Mawaru Penguindrum is one of those rare anime that doesn't have some form of source material. It was created by Brain's Base, the same studio behind Durarara & Baccano. The co-writer and director was Ikuhara Kunihiko. You may not know his name but you probably recognise his other works. He created and directed Revolutionary Girl Utena and served as the director for large segments of the Sailor Moon anime. I have to say, this sounds promising. So far, the two anime I've seen from Brain's Base have been at least decent and Ikuhara does amazing work. If they screw this up I'm going to besorely disappointed. So, let's proceed with cautious optimism.\\n\\n\r\nStory:\\n\\n\r\nOur tale opens with three siblings, Shouma, Kanba and Himari. The three are living on their own since their parents went missing and things aren't going very well. Himari is dying of an incurable disease and her brothers have been told that she doesn't have long. They decide to do everything they can to make her final days happy and take her to an Aquarium that they all used to love going to. It's there that Himari collapses. She's rushed to the hospital where she dies only to quickly come back to life and start adopting odd mannerisms whenever she wears a penguin hat. She brings her brothers to a strange psychedelic space that even Lewis Carroll would find excessive, calls them worthless low lives and tells them that they'll have to find something called the \u201cPenguindrum\u201d to save their sister's life and things only become crazier and crazier from that point on.\\n\\n\r\nAs usual, let's begin by looking at the series' faults. The biggest one is that it's fond of bringing up really serious issues for dramatic moments that don't tie into the plot in any substantial way and are never brought up again after they happen. The primary examples being scenes where someone will very nearly be raped and the next episode they'll interact with the person who made the attempt as though nothing happened and it will just go completely unaddressed for the rest of the series. Which just begs the question of why something as serious as rape is being brought up at all if they aren't going to bother doing anything with it. Really, any source of drama should have some plot relevance instead of just being there for a cheap shock moment but there's something particularly terrible about using such a grotesque crime, and the number one cause of PTSD, in such a tawdry fashion. There are also quite a few humorous moments that fall short, mainly because they'll try to pull off humour at parts of their cheap shock scenes or really close to them which results in a tonal clash. The romance elements in this are absolutely atrocious. Most of it involves incestuous undertones, stalking and/or some other factor that makes it really skeevy. The problem being that a lot of it is played as uplifting or otherwise positive instead of having some self awareness of how messed up the situation is. Although, in all fairness, they do always show rape as being a terrible thing, even if they never bring the attempts up again after they're done with. \\n\\n\r\nLet's move on to the positive aspects. I will give the series credit on three points. The first is that the premise is very creative and had a lot of potential, even if that potential was largely squandered by meanderings into the realms of pointless irrelevance and general stupidity. I'll also give credit for having some legitimately good dramatic scenes, when it's actually doing plot relevant stuff and can refrain from trying to inject humour into it. The series also does have some funny scenes, when it's putting them in at light-hearted bits instead of trying to cram them into really serious moments. So, the series does manage some good bits during the rare stretches when the writers were on their Ritalin.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are, largely, not bad. Every single one does suffer from the writing's general lack of focus, but in terms of characterisation and development they aren't bad characters. They are, however, pretty standard with little, if anything, unique to define them. There are some really good familial scenes with Shouma, Kanba and Himari. They still aren't very complex characters, though and there are times when the series takes those bonds into creepy territory which does weaken that aspect.\\n\\n\r\nThen we have the penguins. Those of you who have seen Utena might remember the little purple monkey that existed solely for comic relief but was bearable because he largely stayed in the background and did, in all fairness, have some funny moments. Now, imagine that same basic character with a more prominent role and with four slight variations running around. So, now you have four largely pointless comic sidekicks taking up screen time and being highly obtrusive. I would like to tell you that at least none of them makes any attempt at sexually assaulting anyone, but one of them does, albeit in a much more mild form than most of the similar scenes in the series. Because tying someone up and forcing kisses on them without consent is still a type of sexual assault. \\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\\n\r\nThe art is good. Ikuhara's fondness for symbolism that's extravagant and kind of bizarre is fully on display. The visuals are highly engrossing and appealing to look at. The character designs are very reminiscent of Utena. For example, Natsume Masako looks similar to Arisugawa Juri in terms of hairstyle, facial structure and even expressions.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\\n\r\nThe actors in this really put a great deal of effort into their performances. They do deliver their lines as over the top or seriously as the current scene demands. I appreciate the effort they're clearly putting into it and I won't say that any of them were bad, but I really can't call them good performances either. Due to the tonal issues, A lot of scenes require them to fluctuate from serious to exaggeration in the space of a few sentences and it just sounds awkward. There aren't many scenes that let them show any subtle emotional range. Most just have them fluctuating between extremes. Honestly, the music is the one thing I didn't notice tonal problems with. Maybe it does fluctuate during those horribly executed scenes and I was too overwhelmed by everything else to notice but, as far as I can recall, the music was really good.\\n\\n\r\nHo-yay:\\n\\n\r\nThere's certainly some. One of the attempted rape scenes is between two characters of the same sex. There's also a case of two female characters being portrayed as having had sex, consensual too as rare as that is for this anime and there are some scenes that definitely come across as homo-erotic, usually between girls. That being said, it isn't a huge part of the anime since a lot of the focus is on Shouma and Kanba. As such, the ho-yay factor is going to be a 5/10.\\n\\n\r\nFinal Thoughts:\\n\\n\r\nThis anime is a classic example of style being valued over substance. It has some amazing visuals and it has some good scenes both dramatic and comedic and it does portray familial bonds pretty well. But taken as a whole, it doesn't hold up. The narrative is an unfocused mess with tonal problems and lots of dramatic moments that serve no purpose to the plot and come across as pretty offensive and demeaning towards serious issues. Because it's one thing to address serious issues and quite another to bring them up and then do bugger all with them. This series chose poorly and took the latter route. In the end, every good scene is over-shadowed by two or three bad ones and my final rating is going to be a 3/10. Next week, we'll ignore the requests for a moment because it's time to take another look at that franchise, in the name of the moon.",

            "content": "\"Survival Strategy!\" -That involves so many things, and so many of it is just amazing.\r\n*This review will be updated as more episodes are available, It is up to episode 14, also I have yet to watch Utena, so I can't make completely accurate comparisons to it*\r\nFIRST IMPRESSIONS: Now this one's a real head scratcher, is it a brilliant new story that's trying to break into new boundaries? Or is it just pure nonsense with a penchant for philosophical babble? Or a comedy about watching penguins do funny and out of the ordinary things?\r\nWhat I'm talking about (If you haven't figured it out yet) is thelatest bizarre anime that is causing a lot of buzz right now, Mawaru Penguindrum, a new anime by Kunihiko Ikuhara (Who has not been in the director's spot for more than ten years), the creator of a legendary (From the great things I have heard about this series to call it that) psychedelic anime series from the 1990's: Revolutionary Girl Utena.\\n\\n\r\nBefore the anime kicks itself into \"Survival Strategy,\" it starts out to be a family tragedy drama story with an in-and-out-of-the-hospital younger sister of the twins Kanba and Shouma, Himari who's in poor health, who one day while at a family trip to an aquarium, suddenly collapses and seemingly dies later at a hospital only to miraculously revive, thanks to the power of a penguin hat... and soon insanity insures as penguins start doing chores around their house, but only the three main characters can see only them.\\n\\n\r\nHere is when the story drops out of being something typical, and walks ambitiously into possible obscurity, now normally, I would be hesitant to jump into something as bizarre as this first episode shows it wants to become, but from what I hear about the director, I have no doubt that he isn't incompetent enough to just throw out something strange without wanting to show everyone something spectacular and fabulous.\\n\r\nBut there is a lot of daring concepts that Mawaru Penguin is willing to dabble in, most noticeably right before the ending theme song starts to play: (Warning, spoilers coming up) *coughincestcough* and that is enough for anyone to want to avoid this show completely and there's enough philosophical speeches to make it seem arrogant or deep depending on how you take it, but I have enough curiosity and definitely enough interest to see where it wants to end up. \\n\\n\r\nAFTER 14 EPISODES: And where it wants to end up... Is anyone's guess now, in a good way.\\n\r\nThe brothers Kanba and Shouma have gone through quite a good bit of things as their quest for the Penguindrum continues and their only lead? A psycho of a stalker, (or maybe she's a normal stalker, I wouldn't know how a stalker operates) Ringo Oginome with a diary.\\n\r\nBut that's not the only thing going on, other than hilarious penguin antics (One of them goes around peeping up girl's skirts), there are many things happening in the sidelines, but a good amount of focus goes to Ringo, with her motives for stalking, her sad past, and her attempts to date the one she obsessed with. And the way the anime ends off the whole thing with Ringo is done flawlessly, which all of that build up is used in continued use in the later part of the anime, with everything revolving around the \"penguindrum\" and a mysterious white haired man.\\n\\n\r\nThe anime also challenges the concept of forbidden love, which honestly can be very off putting, but none of it is shallow, and everything is used to great effect. \\n\r\nThe anime constantly breathes creative animation, and drama to all who crave it, as this anime continues to keep you on the edge of your seat even as far as the show gotten so far, it is none the less impressive and shows that is the strongest to be best anime of 2011.\\n\\n\r\nANIMATION: I know what Revolutionary Girl Utena looks like, and Mawaru Penguindrum looks like an updated version of that show, in more of the lines of fitting in with the standards of current animation.\\n\r\nIt has the look of shojo anime as the characters all look pretty (Both the girls and boys), and there is a lot of artistry in the back grounds, everything is very bright and colorful, nothing dull looking at all, especially with a certain scenes that involves the \"survival strategy,\" it's nothing short of amazing.\\n\r\nAnd several episodes include very creative sequences going further than the previous episode, that are extremely reminisce of Utena.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND: It's mostly the catchy pop back ground music that stands out, though the theme music is quite good.\\n\r\nThe voice acting for the main characters is good and all, but I hope there isn't too many scenes with the sister yelling, it doesn't sound terrible and this is just a nit pick of mine but, the voice actor just doesn't sound capable to produce a yell, it sound like she's yawning actually.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL:\\n\r\nThe Good:\\n\r\n+ This centuries' Revolutionary Girl Utena.\\n\r\n+ An anime that's willing to take risks right away with the story to try to be original.\\n\r\n+ Delightfully unpredictable.\\n\\n\r\nMixed:\\n\r\n+/- Dazzling and colorful animation. / Maybe too flashy and colorful much for some (Which is disappointing).\\n\\n\r\nI'm willing to stick around to see what Mawaru Penguindrum is capable of doing, even if it falls flat on it's face, and hope others will be as enthusiastic as myself about this anime. \\n\r\nI strongly believe this to be very best of 2011, and hope the ending will blow me away.",

            "content": "Mawaru Penguindrum; also entitled 'I Have a Lot of Feelings'\r\nI won't lie. This was amazing. Absolutely beautiful. Stunning script, clean art, a unique plot line and music that wrenches at your gut in the most despairing moments of the series, whilst enhancing the humour and light-heartedness that this series needed as a preventative measure for hearts breaking and tears overflowing everywhere.\r\nWhere should I even start?\r\nThe story itself was...definitely unique. I heard the title of Penguindrum and passed it off as a simple family orientated fantasy adventure, but when I saw that it was categorised as 'psychological', my curiosity was piqued and I began to watchit. Boy, was I in for a journey. In typical Ikuhara-esque manner, the themes dealt with in this anime are at times questionable, offensive, immoral, philosophical; an all encompassing myriad of emotion and thought at the same time. I've actually had a friend I recommended this to, who refused to watch past the first episode as she found some of the themes unpalatable. Only a few directors are able to pull off such a jumble of themes as artfully as Ikuhara while retaining an appeal to a wider audience. Complicated, but watchable. I especially loved how all of the characters intertwined with each other, reminding the watcher of the underlying theme of 'fate'. Every character in this series is fated to meet in some way, to make an impact on another's life whether for better or for worse, and the sheer curiosity and interest behind the slow reveals and the twists in personalities are a joy to experience. Originally, I was going to drop the series as it started off so slowly. It was bizarre and it moved at a snail's pace, and the main characters did not seem to be going anywhere but in circles. It all changed around the halfway mark of the series, when the characters began to show their dark sides, their hidden personalities, their motives, the appearance of ghosts and the disappearance of logic and morals.  Of course, the pace is uneven every here and there, but the variance in almost pointless humour and fast paced drama is a welcome contrast; it keeps you hooked and on edge, wondering what will happen next. \\n\\n\r\nThis isn't a story about just familial love. This is a story of revenge, passion, the futility and cruelty of humankind, of fate and of salvation. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters portrayed all of this beautifully. One of the most masterfully written scripts in terms of character development, characters whom you initially expected to be stereotypes found in anime (the playboy, the 'motherly' character, the girl with the crush, the beauty, the teacher, the Innocent) are all turned on their heads when the series comes to its climax and tapers to an end. Characters whom you initially thought unimportant are really the most important of all, and they are all linked so intricately together in a web that Ikuhara has spun to pull the story together, coupled with flashbacks of their pasts which explain their motives and their philosophies, creates such rich personalities. None of these characters are shallow. For example, when I first encountered Ringo Oginome I found her irritating and obsessive for what seemed like a schoolgirl's mere crush, but with her past tragedies being revealed as the story went on, as well as her understanding of her self and of others developing, I grew attached to her;  I cried for her and I cried for her conflicting circumstances. The initial set up of all of these characters is for you to either hate them, then grow attached, or to love them and sympathise with them, then when the series hits its climax and their darker sides are revealed, it's hard to hate them, knowing what they've been through. Even the main villain, Sanetoshi, is charming and elegant, first shown as a miracle worker and slowly evolving into a darker entity, but even then I didn't hate him. Sure, I was angry at him, I was angry with what he had put our heroes through, but the initial charm still lingered and I couldn't bring myself to outright hate him (also because damn, smooth talking while attempting to break humanity? Let me have some of that).\\n\\n\r\nThe art as well. Oh, god the art. I've always been a fan of Lily Hoshino, so when I found she was doing the character designs I was immediately interested. The animation is smooth and fluid, with a clean style and bold colours. However, there are discrepancies within the animation at times, with one episode (the episode at the hospital where Natsume makes her debut) being horrendously animated in comparison to the rest of the series, but I can forgive this for the outstanding beauty that the rest of the series brings. It's not just the clean, pretty style that makes the animation stand out; its the symbolism. During the series, the backgrounds are often a plain colour, interspersed with small symbols such as penguin logos, apples or train signs. It's not until the end of the series when you recognise their significance that you fully appreciate the bizarre symbols. What you thought was artistic bloodshed, you realise to be a symbol of love and fate. What you thought was a strange, alien ritual, you realise to be a portrayal of sexual intimacy. You realise things, the second, the third, the fourth time around. You don't stop realising things even when you know the script off by heart. The art is so rich and intricate, that even small symbols and inconspicuous posters have a meaning to them That's part of the beauty that Mawaru Penguindrum has so carefully placed and has me rewatching to find all of these subtle nuances.\\n\\n\r\nBut really, what has me coming back to this series time and time again, to rewatch and analyse and have sudden epiphanies is the thematics that Ikuhara plays upon. The anime starts off with Shouma Takakura stating that he 'hates the word fate'. 'Okay,' you say to yourself. 'An anime about fate. Interesting. Goes along nicely with the family love theme.' \\n\\n\r\nIt's at the end of the series where you realise that you were so very wrong.\\n\\n\r\nSo very, very wrong.\\n\\n\r\nYou kind of wish that someone, a reviewer, a kind, hopefully non sadistic friend or a big caution sign had warned you of the emotional journey that you were about to embark on. \\n\\n\r\nYou see, this anime isn't just about fate. Okay, well maybe a large proportion of it is, but that's just the running theme. Fate is the cause; fate caused grief, passion, murder, revenge and sacrifice; in turn these caused each character's own unique motive. The futility that all of the characters feel in the face of their destinies is heart-rending, and their efforts to change their fates, and the fates of their loved ones is valiant and littered with tragedy. \\n\\n\r\nWhen I finished watching this series, I cried. There is a sort of melancholy beauty that accompanies a bittersweet ending and this was no different. Some would call it a happy ending, some would not, but in each case the emotion behind the climax and the finale of the series was so utterly raw that you cannot help but grieve and rejoice at the same time.\\n\\n\r\nBecause when you finish watching, you realise that this wasn't an anime about the futility of the human race in the face of their destinies. This was about the hope, the courage, the unwavering love for another human, or the love for the entirety of humankind to FACE their destinies head on and sacrifice their being for someone to have a better fate. \\n\\n\r\nThis was a story about salvation through sacrifice.\\n\\n\r\nYou finish watching, and you think about the themes and subplots. You think about YOUR fate. You think about the sacrifices you would make, the extremes that you would go to to protect what you love. That's what makes this such a though provoking series, because really, as hard as it may be to imagine, all of these characters are like us (but hopefully without the tragic backstory). They just want normal lives, normal families, normal relationships and an unconditional love (unlike Sanetoshi, who was probably there to hate everything). I cried during the series out of laughter, but I also cried watching the gradual loss of innocence and hope that each character suffers. I cried because I grieved at the end, but I also cried because I sympathised with our heroes' final decision and I cried because I was overwhelmed by the lengths that they would go to to protect what they loved. In this series, you realise; sacrifice is the ultimate act of love.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoy the music while you watch the series for the first time, because believe me, at the end of it, just one track will have you blubbering on the train during rush hour. The mood is set beautifully by each track, be it humorous, tense, sad or pensive, and enhances the emotion during these scenes. I can't listen to either 'Ash-Grey Wednesday' or 'I Love You, Sons of Destiny' without getting a lump in my throat anymore.\\n\\n\r\nIf you're wavering about this anime, don't be put off by the weirdness. Don't be put off by the somewhat bizarre relationships that each character has with each other, and don't be put off by the erratic pace and initial characterisation. It's a beautiful series, it really is. Art-wise, music-wise and story-wise, its a masterpiece in all fields. Watch a story unfold before your eyes and watch as secrets are revealed to you.\\n\\n\r\nMost of all, don't be surprised when you finish, face damp with tears, that you begin to wonder about humanity, fate and salvation.\\n\\n\r\nAnd I assure you, five months down the line, you'll watch it again for the fourth time and catch all of the symbols and hints that you missed the last three runs, and your newly gained knowledge won't soften the grief any more.\\n\\n\r\nI applaud you Ikuhara. I applaud everyone on the production team. It truly was a work of art. \\n\\n\r\nIt truly was...'fabulous max'.\\n\\n",

            "content": "STORY\nHonestly, I feel that Ikuhara had many good ideas in terms of the plot. However, the end result is a clusterfuck of stories and themes mashed together. On their own, each arc stands up quite well, and a lot of ideas are well executed too. I liked the Child Broiler idea for one, ignoring the fact that it was a tad overused. \nThe plot is extremely convoluted and confusing. Unlike other anime that explain their convoluted storylines like, say, Kyousougiga, Mawaru Penguindrum does not make any attempt to do so. The viewer is left wondering what the fuck is going on as plot development afterplot development happens without any explanation whatsoever. In the last 8 or so episodes in the series, everything just goes completely apeshit, with characters suddenly changing personalities and sudden \"twists\". The viewer is not given any time to think about the twist or what the plot development means. Instead, the show simply shoves the ED in his face and tells him to deal with it and watch the next episode.\\n\\n\nDon't even get me started on how pants-on-head retarded the ending was...\\n\\n\nPRODUCTION QUALITY (ART+SOUND)\\n\\n\nThe art was very well done. Unlike some others I have no problem with the cardboard cutout background characters since a blurry or improportionate man would distract me from the show even more. The environments were all very colourful and varied. The vibrant use of colours was a major plus point for me too. Animation is smooth enough, and there aren't any noticeable drops in quality.\\n\\n\nAs for sound, voice acting was great. Nothing out of the ordinary though, but that's perfectly fine. I greatly enjoyed the soundtrack, although I got a bit bored of them playing the same tracks in the second half of the anime. The sound direction was very good too, with the tracks playing a prominent role in many scenes to create a bigger impact.\\n\\n\nProduction quality was definitely up to standard. However...\\n\\n\nCHARACTER\\n\\n\nI would suppose the characters in the show are just decent. I didn't find any of the characters particularly likeable or interesting. They're kind of like background characters. Himari takes on a minor role of the damsel in distress. Kanba is your typical angsty teenage badass.\\n\\n\nThe only characters I liked were Shoma and Ringo. I feel that both had a significant amount of character development by the end of the series. They also have very good chemistry, and I enjoyed their scenes together.\\n\\n\nENJOYMENT\\n\\n\nNo, I did not enjoy it at all. Except Ringo x Shoma.\\n\\n\nOVERALL\\n\\n\n\"Warning\", Spoilers of the ending following this. I recommend you just read it and spoil yourself so you spare yourself the pain of watching this.\\n\\n\nAll in all, the show had some great ideas, but failed to execute them well. It would have been way better if the director didn't have such big visions for the show and fall short completely. Perhaps he should have used his ideas for different anime series. There is also a stunning lack of attention to detail, which is something that continuously broke immersion for me and annoyed me immensely. The ending was just shit too, why the fuck did Shoma and Kanba die and be revived? And why the fuck was Himari's penguin walking with Kanba and Shoma at the end(lack of attention to detail, see)? \\n\\n\nMawaru Penguindrum, like the Kyousougiga TV series and Kyoukai no Kanata,  is a prime example of why every anime needs a solid plot, not just good production quality to be good. \\n\\n\nDo yourself a favour and take this out of your backlog.",

            "content": "Mawaru Penguindrum. What can I possibly say about it that hasn't already been said? Pretentious. Confusing. Beautiful. Terrible. A Masterpiece. Overrated. Genius. You could say anything of these things and you would be correct. But, in my eyes, Mawaru Penguindrum is an anime unlike any I have ever seen. It pushes the boundaries of the medium in a way that hasn't been done since the End of Evangelion movie.\r\nStory(9/10)- Penguindrum's story is one wrapped in what seems to be endless layers of symbolism. One can easily be overwhelmed by the sheer vastness of it. Everything from a single line of dialogue to an unusual cameraangle is there for a reason. It will probably take many years for this show to be fully deciphered, it goes to show us that A LOT of effort was put into this story. The reason why I hesitate to give story a perfect score is because of how hard it is to fully comprehend. I must admit, I almost dropped the show in the first few episodes because I had no idea what was going on. Undoubtedly, most of you reading this review probably did the same thing. But, if you are willing to stay for the ride, I guarantee  that you will be thankful for doing so. \\n\\n\r\nI cannot simply talk about the story, without talking about the themes Penguindrum covers. It ranges from Rape, Nihilism, Existential Longing,  and isolation. But the biggest theme here would have to be, \"Fate.\" What is fate? Does fate truly exist? The show starts off with narrator saying he hates fate. These themes are tackled in an unconventional manner, using slap-stick comedy and symbolism. The mood generally sways between both drama and comedy. Ultimately, the ending itself, I found it to be cathartic yet bittersweet. A saddening, yet fitting end to such an audacious show.\\n\\n\r\nArt(9/10)- The art in this show is great to say the least. The presentation is bombastic and erratic. All scenes in this show are breathtakingly beautiful and will capture your attention. There is a meticulous level of detail in every scene. This is something that should be appreciated.\\n\\n\r\nSound(9/10)- The soundtrack is music to my ears, no pun intended. It is bold, unique and different. It varies from pop tracks, to melancholic soundscapes. You would be hard pressed to find a soundtrack better than this.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter(9/10)- Penguindrum's cast is unique........to say the least. You won't be able to easily understand characters until later in the show. Still, the cast and antagonists are very well written. Their intentions aren't so cut n dry that you can understand them immediately. You will sometimes have to rewatch certain scenes, in order to fully grasp certain characters EX: Sanetoshi and Momoka.\\n\\n\r\nMawaru Penguindrum is probably one of the most mentally straining anime I have ever had the pleasure to watch. This is not a show for everyone as I mentioned earlier. It is a must see for those anime watchers who love having their minds stimulated. After watching this show, other shows that have been released seem mediocre compared to it. My final verdict is, a 9/10.",

            "content": "Mawaru Penguindrum is a zany, wacky, twisted, messed up jumble of an anime that is so absolutely insane, yet it surprisingly turns out to be an interesting and compelling story in the end.\r\nPenguindrum is the brainchild of Kunihiko Ikuhara, who also conceived Revolutionary Girl Utena over a decade earlier. Penguindrum bears many similarities to Utena: the repetition, the odd humor, the heavy handed symbolism, and the silly yet loveable characters are all here. Fans of Utena will definitely feel right at home with Penguindrum.\r\nThe story goes a little bit like this: Two brothers, Shouma and Kanba Takakura, have a sweet little sister, Himari, who isunfortunately dying from a terminal illness. On a trip to the aquarium, Himari collapses and dies. But she is oddly revived by the penguin hat that Shouma had bought her minutes before. The penguin hat\u2019s miracle does not come without a price though. After having their sister\u2019s body temporarily hijacked by the Princess of the Crystal in a flashy over the top transformation sequence, the brothers are informed that they must find the mysterious Penguin drum in order for their sister to keep the life she was so graciously given back. \\n\\n\r\nBut that only scratches the surface. Soon, the brothers get involved with shady organizations, a stalker schoolgirl, the homeroom teacher she\u2019s stalking, his nutty celebrity girlfriend, a cold rich girl barring their path, magic mumbo jumbo, and a mysterious man who holds power over Himari\u2019s life.\\n\\n\r\nThe diverse cast of characters is what really shines about the show. Aside from Himari, who scarcely seems like more than a plot device, equal development and care is given to a number of characters in this anime. They\u2019re all a little nutty, but they\u2019re also all unique individuals with their own goals, personalities, and beliefs. It\u2019s also impressive to note how the anime ties all the characters together. Not since Monster have I seen such a large cast of characters who seem like they\u2019d normally have nothing to do with each other tied together so intricately.\\n\\n\r\nThe two brothers, Shouma and Kanba are polar opposites and serve as each other\u2019s foils. It\u2019s also interesting to note how this plays into their roles in the family. Everything about Shouma screams maternal figure: He\u2019s kind, caring, level headed, rational, and even takes care of the cooking and housework. Kanba can be seen as the more typical masculine father figure. He is smooth, articulate, hot headed, popular with the ladies, and also the sole breadwinner of the house. \\n\\n\r\nBoth love Himari dearly and want to save her, but they have drastically different methods of doing so that fit almost too perfectly with their personalities. It\u2019s almost scary seeing Kanba\u2019s apathy for the world and even his own body swell up as the story proceeds, blinded completely by his desire to save Himari. \\n\\n\r\nWe also have Ringo Oginome, a high school girl who is as obsessed with curry as she is with Keiju Tabuki. A big chunk of the first part of the anime is dedicated to her stalkerish obsession with Tabuki and her plan to win his heart, as told by a mysterious diary she holds. Her sworn enemy and rival for Tabuki\u2019s affection is a pretty actress named Yuri Tokikago. Unbeknownst to Ringo, this woman has a far more sinister side than her well groomed fa\u00e7ade lets on, as well as a hidden connection to the both Tabuki and Ringo\u2019s pasts. \\n\\n\r\nMasako Natsume is another character whose brother also has an unknown illness, but is being kept alive by another penguin hat. She seeks out the penguin drum as well, interfering with the brother\u2019s attempts to get it. All these characters are revealed to be connected to each other in some way, as well as to the main villain Sanetoshi and Ringo\u2019s deceased older sister Momoka. \\n\\n\r\nSurprisingly, three small penguins are what really steal the show. These little buggers are hilarious; doing the most insane things even while the main characters are having a serious conversation. Whether it\u2019s reading dirty magazines, putting panties over their head, trying on blond wigs, or spraying errant cockroaches, these hilarious little guys are always up to something. It\u2019s also interesting to note that the 3 penguins\u2019 actions, appearance, and mannerisms closely resemble the three Takakura siblings. The fourth penguin, belonging to Masako, is the same. Some may find them distracting as they act out in scenes that are supposed to be serious. And you\u2019d be right to assume that they are there just for the cute factor. But they add a bit of charm and humor to the story. It\u2019s hard to imagine the anime without them. \\n\\n\r\nNow the story itself can be a bit of a confusing mess until the very end when mostly everything is resolved and cleared up. It keeps you on your toes and guessing until the very end, slowly unveiling one twist after another without being too ridiculous. \\n\\n\r\nThe first part of the anime seems more like a wacky slice-of-life, while the second part heavily leans toward the metaphysical and supernatural. That of course means the second part of the anime can be quite difficult to grasp at times. And that right there is one big problem with the story: it can be incredibly pretentious at times. Similar to Utena, some of the symbolism is very clever, while some of it just seems like it was thrown in there just because, making some concepts and plot elements needlessly complicated and confusing. The dialogue can be a little too much as well, with its constant rambling about fate, fate, fate. Like the symbolism, sometimes it\u2019s clever, other times it just sounds pretentious. \\n\\n\r\nAs an anime heavy in symbolism, it\u2019s important for the visuals to be sufficiently up to snuff. And it definitely does not disappoint. The animation is high quality, colorful, flashy, and smooth. The soundtrack is phenomenal, containing a plethora of great tracks for any given situation. The character designs are all beautiful and unique. No two characters look anything alike. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, Penguindrum is an amazing anime that was clearly made with a lot of care and heart. It\u2019s got almost everything, flashy visuals, amazing characters, a silly yet enjoyable story, and a great soundtrack. It\u2019s understandable that some will be turned off by its confusing story and heavy symbolism at first, but sticking with the anime to the end is well worth it. Watching it again is well worth it; you\u2019ll see all kinds of things you may have missed the first time. \\n\\n\r\nThis crazy, mysterious, psychological rollercoaster is one hell of a ride, and once you get on you won\u2019t want to get off. \\n",

            "content": "**SPOILER FREE REVIEW**\r\n\u201cWhat is Mawaru Penguindrum?\u201c If ever there was a more loaded question in the realm of anime, I\u2019m not sure I\u2019ve heard of it, because this show is an absolute enigma. Adequately reviewing this show is a daunting task for reasons that will soon be clear, but let\u2019s give it a shot: First of all, what is this show? Well, it\u2019s a lot of things. A moving story about the importance of love. A detailed commentary on the way society treats children. A unique perspective on mental health issues. An insightful interpretation about the concepts of fate and destiny. Etcetera etcetera etcetera. Whilethe vast majority of anime are driven by their plot or by their characters, Penguindrum is instead driven by its themes, style, and the artistic messages that lurk in the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th layers of the show. It is extremely complex and jam-packed with more symbolism, motifs, and allusions than you can shake a stick at, but it\u2019s simultaneously intriguing and investing enough that you could miss all of them and still enjoy the show. For that reason, Penguindrum is on the remarkably short list of shows that manage to have vast and flawlessly executed themes while simultaneously managing to have an engaging story and fleshed out characters. It\u2019s one of my all time favorite shows and, as far as I\u2019m concerned, a masterpiece.\\n\\n\r\nSynopsis: Twins Kanba and Shouma Takakura lost their parents long ago, and now live alone with their younger sister Himari. They lead relatively normal lives until Himari is diagnosed with a terminal illness that could cause her to drop dead at any moment. Distraught, the twins attempt to make the best of the time they have left with their beloved sister, until she finally collapses during a family trip to the aquarium. Himari dies. However, when the souvenir penguin hat that Shouma bought for her finds its way onto her head, she miraculously comes back to life with her illness cured. The only condition to keep her alive? Find the Penguindrum.\\n\\n\r\nThe plot of Penguindrum has always been intriguing to me because, in theory, it should be a total disaster. You\u2019ve got this unbelievably absurd concept of a penguin hat that grants immortality, an evil mastermind who controls your destiny with the help of two of his rabbit sidekicks, and comedic relief penguins who serve no immediately apparent purpose, yet you\u2019re going to try to tell a heart-wrenching story of love and betrayal that delves deep into philosophy, ethics, and social commentary? I mean, does that sound for a second like it\u2019s going to even remotely work? In any other circumstance, it probably wouldn\u2019t have. Luckily, this anime was directed by Kunihiko Ikuhara, who is also known for Revolutionary Girl Utena and, more recently, Yuri Kuma Arashi. Ikuhara, if I may be so bias for a second, is a complete and total artistic genius. I\u2019ve said before that his style is not for everyone; the repetition of sequences, the abstract environments, the use of vibrant color dissonance, etc. It all serves to provide this show with a remarkable artistic flair that will dazzle you and ensure that there is never a dull moment.\\n\\n\r\nGetting back to the plot, the reason that Ikuhara is so widely praised is for his ability to convey information without words; to connect the events of the show to the real world and make the viewer question what the meaning of it all is. Of course, the storyline of Penguindrum can be taken at face value by all means. It is complete with exciting plot twists, intense moments, and general excitement. The thing is, there are LOTS of anime that can give you those things. However, there are virtually NO anime who can give you those things on top of the sheer depth and artistic passion that went towards conveying a refined, emotional message to the viewers. This serves to make the humble story of the Takakura family all the more memorable, as it can only be described as a rollercoaster of emotions. Penguindrum will make you feel every emotion that you have over its duration, and I think that is saying something.\\n\\n\r\nThe character cast of Penguindrum adheres to the writing technique known as \u201cThe Mystery Box\u201d. For those unaware, this is when the characters are presented to the audience, but the show has no intention of letting you get to know them at first. No real backstory is given; all you know about them is what you see. Then, slowly and steadily, you begin the learn more and more about them. Their pasts. Their motivations. And finally, their deepest darkest secrets. Every time you think you know everything there is to know about the large cast of Penguindrum, wham! Another twist! This is a remarkably impressive accomplishment because it is only through the viewers\u2019 sheer exasperation after their perceptions of the characters get turned on their heads again and again and again do they begin to realize just how much depth that all of them have. Note the emphasis on the word \u201call\u201d, because no character in Penguindrum is left behind. All of them, no matter how seemingly minor, are fleshed out and manage to feel real. The icing on the cake is that this anime manages to accomplish all of this without ever feeling contrived; these are not twists \u201cjust of the sake of twists\u201d. They are all thematically coherent and well thought out. For that reason, I can\u2019t see anything to complain about with this cast. They are likable, relatable, well written, dynamic, and they have depth. What more could you possibly want?\\n\\n\r\nDiscussing the presentation aspects of an Ikuhara anime is never easy simply because of how unique and simultaneously profound it manages to be. As I mentioned earlier, Ikuhara is a master of visual storytelling. He frequently conveys more information with animation and shot composition than he does with dialogue/monologue, and that\u2019s something you just don\u2019t see often. I won\u2019t even try to describe the myriad of techniques used in this anime, because I don\u2019t think I could do it well without writing a separate essay. Speaking purely in terms of aesthetic appeal, the art style of Peguindrum is extremely pretty. The colors are immensely bright and everything pops right off the screen. The animation itself is also very fluid, and even memorizing at times. In short, it\u2019s one of the most visually impressive anime I\u2019ve ever seen for reasons that are hard to describe without demonstrating specific examples. As for the sound design, I struggle to find legitimate complaints yet again. The OPs and EDs are both unique and worthy of listening to in your spare time. I can\u2019t tell you how long I had OP 1, \u201cNornir\u201d, on repeat when I first finished this show. What really makes the OST work is the directing; Penguindrum\u2019s mood and tone fluctuate a lot, and the soundtrack never fails to provide the proper accompaniment. Songs always end right when they need to and begin right when they need to. By the way, the voice acting is spot-on. There\u2019s not a single VA who didn\u2019t totally nail the character they are attached to. Penguindrum\u2019s story and themes may be its main talking point, but by no means whatsoever does the presentation lag behind; it is just as superb as the rest of the show.\\n\\n\r\nWhat more is there to say about Mawaru Penguindrum? Well, a lot actually. I could quite literally gush over this show all day; it has turned me into a hopeless Ikuhara fanboy. However, fanboying aside, I think this show is an absolute must watch. Not everyone is into the whole symbolism thing, and I get that, but it\u2019s an enjoyable show even without paying mind to the themes. For people who ARE into critical analysis, this is your dream come true. Penguindrum is a show that means a lot to me and has genuinely made me reassess several of my worldviews. The effort, passion, and sheer emotion poured into this anime is palpable, and rivaled only (in my opinion) by Neon Genesis Evangelion in terms of how well you can feel the creator\u2019s pain. It is one of my absolute favorites and it is one of the few anime that I can say without hesitation is indeed a masterpiece.",

            "content": "This is my first review on MAL and normally, I wouldn't be too interested in writing reviews, because honestly, I'm not very good at it, but in the case of Mawaru Penguindrum, it was inevitable.\r\nI felt like if I did not write what I'm feeling after watching this anime, then something inside my mind will definitely break...\r\nSo here I go.\r\nI found out about the famous ''mawaru penguindrum'', when I overheard two girls in my college talking about how mindblowingly amazing it is. Perhaps , it was then, that i made a mental note to maybe check it out.\r\nWhen I came home that day, Isearched it up: \\n\r\n\"Best anime ever\"\\n\r\n\"I can't believe something as good as this anime exists\"\\n\r\n\"Amazing\"\\n\r\n\"10/10\"\\n\\n\r\nI was super excited. I couldn't wait to watch it.\\n\r\nI waited until my exams were over and cleaned my room and brought lots of popcorn and turned off the lights and opened my laptop and put on the first episode. \\n\\n\r\n23 and a half minutes later, I was a little confused. \\n\\n\r\nOHH! this must be like those anime, you know...the ones that start out fairly weird but get super interesting a few episodes later. \\n\r\nI continued watching.\\n\\n\r\nExactly 144.5 minutes and 6 episodes later, I was very, very confused. \\n\r\nFrustrated, I googled: \"Is mawaru penguidrum really worth watching?\" \\n\\n\r\n\"ITS A MUST WATCH\"\\n\r\n\"You cant miss it\"\\n\r\n\"I strongly, strongly recommend it\"\\n\\n\r\nAre the answers I got. You see, I'm a simple woman. I value the opinions of my fellow anime fans. They have never let me down. 3 to 4 MAL reviews alone, guide me enough about the worth of an anime and 99 out of 100 times, I agree with majority, if not all, of the reviews.\\n\r\nBut this wasn't the case with Mawaru Penguindrum. \\n\\n\r\nI decided to watch it till the end. \\n\\n\r\n576.5 minutes and 24 episodes later, I sat there fuming, with a burning ache in my head. \\n\r\nIt felt like I had wasted a quarter of my life and I felt incredibly stupid for still not being able to find a single thing that was \"mindblowingly amazing\" (or even remotely interesting) about this anime that I had just finished watching. \\n\\n\r\nI still go to blogs and MAL reviews sometimes, to find some explanation for this anime...an explanation that I missed, yet I always thought I was that one person that always searched for a meaning in everything I watched or read, which is one reason I like anime, because I believe that it is a medium of entertainment that is capable of conveying deeper meanings to seemingly shallower things, because everything can be visually explained.\\n\\n\r\nAt some points, I saw a bit of potential in this anime. Some scenes were nicely portrayed, the BGM was fitting. It even had a bit of nice comedy. The character designs were not bad. It could have been a nice romantic comedy or a heart warming story about two brothers trying to save their ill sister. Even earned some points from a psychological aspect (the stalker business and child boilers and terrorist organizations)...but it took all of its nice potential and smashed it together into a wannabe deep complex drama that was really just meaningless. \\n\\n\r\nEverywhere I looked, they talked about some deep ''symbolism'', some ''hidden meanings\", a \"relation with art/history/religion/etc..\". \\n\r\nAt first it frustrated me and annoyed me, but now I just laugh. \\n\\n\r\nDespite the fact that it was a ridiculous anime, that poorly conveyed/did not convey at all whatever hidden meaning it was supposed to carry to an average viewer, and that it was only meant to confuse people, and that it tried WAYY TOO HARD to become a psychologically thrilling masterpiece and for that it even tried to steal ideas and symbolism used to in many pieces of literature (such as night on the galactic railroad), it FAILED MISERABLY. And people like me, who were disappointed to see the anime they had such high hopes for fail so badly, forcibly tried to put it on a pedestal. These are the same  people who gave excellent reviews and ratings to the most troll anime of 2016, \"Erased\" , that won everybody's hearts at the first episode but failed miserably by the last, but people couldn't deal with it so they refused to even acknowledge its failure...\\n\\n\r\nDespite all that, I have taken a strange liking to Mawaru Penguindrum. It is my wonderland. My crazy world.A haywire fantasy. Because whenever I search it up, or hear about it, its like reading or hearing about somethingremarkable, something that only exists, but explodes and sparkles and flashes and shimmers...but is invisible to me.\\n\\n\r\nBut I did learn that it is possible to attach a meaning to anything if you try hard enough. \\n\\n\r\nTLDR;\\n\r\nI do not recommend this anime to anyone. \\n\r\nIf you're really such a fan of deep symbolism and hidden meanings, then I suggest you invest yourself in anime that successfully delivers at least SOME of it when you watch it. So I'd say go watch ghost in the shell, or perhaps even Angel's egg (yes, even that does a wonderful job with symbolism) and there's plenty more. You'll love those. \\n\\n\r\nCheers.",

            "content": "Mawaru Penguindrum to me is a show that had lots of potential, but ultimately fell flat towards the end, due to a convoluted plot and wonky character development. Let me tell you why (I'll try to keep it as spoiler-free as possible):\r\nThe Story:\r\nThe show starts with our main characters in a state not that unusual in anime: orphaned teens living on their own, doing alright. The little sister is sickly, but is miraculously saved by a hat. While being possessed by the hat, she tells her two brothers that they must find the \"Penguindrum\", and that's our set-up. \r\nThe story follows our heroes as theytry their best to find this Penguindrum and with it, solve all their problems. The story is all over the place in the beginning, with some seemingly random events and flashbacks here and there. Towards the end it becomes too much. Too many themes and events are introduced to the viewers and it all felt quite silly in the end. \\n\\n\r\nThe Art:\\n\r\nNot much to say here, to be honest. The art is nice, as it usually is nowadays. Pretty generic character design as well.\\n\\n\r\nSound: \\n\r\nGreat voice actors and a good soundtrack makes this the best part of the series. Short of a 10, but at random times the music would not fit the scenes.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nOh man, the characters. Some of them are pretty generic, like the na\u00efve girl (Ringo) and genuinely good guy (Shoma). Most characters have some sort of twist though. The thing that bothers me sometimes with anime is that the characters have vastly different values and interests than me, and such is the case here. I simply can't put myself in their shoes and understand their decisions, because many of them are as if pulled from thin air to make the plot work. \\n\\n\r\nOne thing that especially baffled me is this: one character consistently is in the way or ruining the events and lives of the other characters, but nobody seems to mind. It is just accepted without much doubt and the bad events it causes are never mentioned.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nI gave it a pretty low score, but I would be lying if I said that I haven't enjoyed Mawaru Penguindrum. The sad part is though, that I spent more time being infuriated with some of the characters and some very odd plot turns. There was more confusion and sadness then pure enjoyment for me, which is a shame.\\n\\n\r\nI'll save the worst for last. \"Fate.\" The word is prominent in the series and everything is circling around it. Fate is story-writer lingo for \"this doesn't really make sense, but here's a word to make it better\" to me, and having a series revolve around the shallow premise of \"what ever happens, it's fate,\" is unacceptable to me, and it is the biggest reason I didn't enjoy most of my time with Mawaru Penguindrum. \\n\\n\r\nThe Verdict:\\n\r\nLike I said, i felt like Mawaru Penguindrum had a lot of potential. It unfortunately throws that away and the end result is not terrible, but not that good either. Ultimately there is more good than bad and I'll weigh it in at a 6/10.\\n\\n\r\nDespite the bad grade, I still think that this is an interesting series that might fit you well. If you consider yourself a believer in \"Fate\", this might be right up your alley. The series is quite quirky and fun at times and usually is quite light in atmosphere. I recommend you check it out if you find the plot interesting, and I hope you enjoy it more than I did.\\n\\n\r\nPost-review:\\n\r\nHi ya'll. It's been quite a while since I wrote a review, so I tried to keep it short and to the point. If you didn't like the interview, I'd love to know why. Hit me up with a PM or post a comment on my profile with any criticism. Also, if you'd like to know more about the series, I'll try my best to answer. Cheers.",

            "content": "The first time I saw this anime I was expecting some easy-going plot with magical stuff all about and whatsoever, as the animation, art and mascots made it seem like it was so. However, I was wrong, and both in a good and bad way.\r\nI'll give much credit where credit is due; I thought there was an interesting character development; I think Ringo's backstory was splendidly well done. She may seem annoying, creepy (what with every single thing she did and how far she went), but the reasons to how she behaves are acceptable (in the sense that one can be satisfied, and it answersquestions quite well). Nevertheless, there are way too many other characters with a lack of an intriguing backstory. Yes, they do have dramatic and drastic story, but they are bland and too similar to the \"fate is everything\" concept that is already attached to Ringo. They also behave in such an immature and unthoughtful way that it is so easy to get pissed off at characters, even if you have a bias. I did have a bias, don't get me wrong, but it was horrible to see that a character who seemed so interesting and mysterious get a lousy past with lousy raison d'\u00eatre's. Honestly, I find it anti-climatic.\\n\\n\r\nThe storyline is not flawless. It may seem so because it is complex, with many links between the various characters who seem so out of the blue. Yet, the complexity goes overboard. It's that feeling you get when you've too much of something that the situation becomes as if you didn't have enough of it. Think of a parabola, after you've reached the top, the effectiveness starts going back down. The links between the characters are random twists, in my opinion, that were added in as if just to make it more complex on purpose, and I personally think that was not really needed and it ruined the plot, if anything. The thing is, if you want good complex plot, you need good complex material. \\n\\n\r\nThe anime started off light-hearted even though it was a rather serious issue going around (Himari dying etc). It even started to go nowhere with Ringo's arc, and only came around at some later point. The comeback was interesting for a little while and then it fell into the chain of twists. I thought the addition of mascots was strange. Nothing against it, but it doesn't add to anything. I love the penguins, though. \\n\\n\r\nI disliked this series mainly because of personal reasons, I will admit that. I do tend to stay away from disturbing series with characters who've gone beyond perverse with no character development. Here I am getting character development, but it seems still too banal to me, save for Ringo's case. Yet, even for her case, she develops to a certain point, and stays at the same line for a while. \\n\r\nI also dislike that it is too focused on \"fate\" even though it is the main theme and is bound to be that way. I thought they were all too obsessed about it, and a variety of non-obsessed characters would have been a good idea.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, because of the somewhat uniqueness it has that I cannot deny, I'd say this anime would still pass as a fairly okay anime. \\n\\n",

            "content": "Firstly, let's get it out of the way. Mawaru Penguindrum is a show which is by no means an easy watch. It is not a simple show with a linear plotline, nor is it one that is willing to spoonfeed every single piece of information to its audience. Instead, it is a highly cryptic show that prides itself on its ability to pile mystery upon mystery onto the show, leave the audience thoroughly confused by blending reality and metaphorical imagery, and leave much of its message to personal interpretation. \r\nIf you are one who doesn't enjoy thinking too deeply into a show, it would bebest for you to avoid this one. Although there are many aspects which can still be enjoyed even if you choose not to look at the show beyond a superficial level, such as the excellently done humor and its slick sense of style, you would be missing out on the many small things that make this show special. It is filled with tons of literary devices, ranging from the constant usage of imagery and symbols to allusions to obscure works. It requires some work to fully get the show, and not taking the effort to do so will often leave you confused or even frustrated at your inability to grasp just what is going on.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, if you are one that finds fun in figuring out what each of these little things mean, Penguindrum is the perfect show for you - it is easily one of the richest shows that the medium has to offer, exploring a wide range of themes such as fate, family, love and revenge, packing plenty of content within its short run within 24 episodes. One of the interesting things about the show is that things are often not made fully clear - and how each person interprets it can be completely different. It truly is up to you to make your own view of the show and its messages, so I won't go too much into that, as each individual will experience the range of events differently.\\n\\n\r\nDespite having some of the cutest and adorable penguins in the show, it must be warned that this show is a very dark one. This is a show wherein the characters are very, very screwed up. A common thread around them is the theme of shitty parents - this show contains some of the most worthless and shittiest parents I have personally seen in most works. The development here is extremely well-done, managing to create a excellent balance of emotions within the viewer. We will often feel disgusted or creeped out at the many sick and demented actions the characters take, yet we will manage to understand why they might want to go to such lengths. It manages to paint them in a pitiable light whilst not downplaying the fact that yes, these people are messed up and are doing some horrible things. That aspect is without a doubt my favorite aspect of the show, managing to humanize horrible humans and make us care for them.\\n\\n\r\nThat is not to say that it isn't flawed. There are certain characters which may do a complete 180 and completely shift their personalities or motivations to fit the plot. Whilst some might argue that these instances are well foreshadowed and thus acceptable, it is in my opinion that some instances are poorly done. I would say that this doesn't happen too often within the show, but it does sometime feel that the show is creating a twist for the sake of creating one. Thankfully, as mentioned, this happens rather rarely, and the overall quality of the characterization is excellent.\\n\\n\r\nPlot wise, this is undoubtedly a very intriguing show. What it excels best at is creating that sense of mystery - you never know what the hell is going on, yet are given enough hints throughout the show, many of which come full circle at the end of the series. It can be said that this show demands a rewatch to fully understand all the little things packed into it, and even then, it can be very difficult to understand what truly is going on. Things are very often left unexplained, and several plot threads are left hanging. Whilst some might feel that this is a good thing as it leaves more to interpretation, I personally find it a little too much, as many things make very little sense, and I am sure that there are many gaping holes throughout the plot which are never fully resolved.\\n\\n\r\nThe production values on the show are excellent, and there is nothing to complain about. The art style is gorgeous, and it's clear that plenty of effort was put into the art and animation, making it one of the more beautiful shows of recent years. It also boasts an excellent soundtrack that is used excellently, often bolstering the effects of many scenes. There are close to zero complains regarding the technical aspects of the series.\\n\\n\r\nIn the end, how you would judge the show ultimately relies on how much effort you are willing to put in the show, and how far you can let little flaws slide. It is one which I enjoyed, but didn't manage to love as I felt that things were often a little too cryptic. Everyone's response to penguindrum will be very different, but what is undeniable is the fact that it is a truly unique and daring show, one which dares to challenge the mediocrity of the industry, and mostly succeeds in doing so, delivering an engaging and thought-provoking product.",

            "content": "I've seen many people compare this anime to a novel or another work of literary art. In a sense, they are correct. I found this anime to be very reminiscent of some of the books my english class had assigned in high school: well-written, full of symbolism and poetic imagery, but not engaging/captivating.\r\nStory - My biggest issue with this show is the story. The basic plot (which you can read in the above synopsis) seems simple enough. However, there are many side stories, background stories, and things that are hinted at that are never resolved, explored, nor explained. Many times an episode would end witha very interesting turn of events, only to have the next episode hand-wave it away and pretend that nothing had happened, in favor of focusing on the \"main story\".\\n\\n\r\nThe story in general felt unfocused, like several different vignettes were hastily strung together chronologically, and then some details were added after-the-fact to create some vague impression of continuity. \\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters - As far as characters go, none were very memorable; with the exception of the doctor who replied to everything with \"how overwhelming\". He was great. \\n\\n\r\nThe problem with this show is that you learn over the course of it that the character relationships between everyone are in fact very complicated, so complicated that it becomes difficult to keep track of each character's motivation and backstory. \\n\\n\r\nSound - \\n\r\nI enjoyed the soundtrack throughout the show. The opening themes are by far the most memorable parts of the show, and the second one is especially well-written. The original Japanese voice acting is standard quality Japanese voice acting. Moreover, I would not recommend the dub. Some of the performances do not do the characters justice, and feel awkward to hear. However, if you're really inclined on not reading subtitles, then the dub is acceptable and you shouldn't run into too much trouble.\\n\\n\r\nArt - The art is arguably the most interesting part of this show. There are many stylistic choices which make the scenes very interesting to watch from an outside perspective.  Additionally, artistic themes are present throughout the show, all hinting at some deeper meaning and adding to the atmosphere of the show.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - Throughout the series, I was never thoroughly interested nor invested in the story. Even in the final few episodes I found myself wanting to put the show on hold because I wasn't very concerned as to what would happen. However, this isn't to say I was bored the whole time. There were some very memorable scenes and I did enjoy both the symbolism and the philosophical dialogue that was scattered throughout the show.\\n\\n\r\nSummary - It's tough to summarize an anime like this. The writing and ideas had such potential, but the execution was lacking. The show is unique in that it is both not compelling and yet leaves something to be desired. Unless you really enjoy symbolism and don't mind it when plot lines go completely unaddressed, watching this will only disappoint you.",

            "content": "Mawaru Penguindrum is an anime unafraid to break conventional rules. Its story is lucrative and all over the place, and is hilarious yet profound. It has an extensive use of symbolism to convey its morals and message, similar to Kunihiko Ikuhara\u2019s other piece, Revolutionary Girl Utena. It has a nice set of characters each with their own quirks that make them interesting and diverse. The animation is well-done and the soundtrack is stunning. But most importantly, it has irresistibly adorable penguins that you just can\u2019t help but feel like hugging. Such qualities should make Penguindrum an outstanding anime. Unfortunately, various problems, such as its abuseof drama and its messy form of narrative, plague the anime and bring it down from what it could have been.\\n\\n\r\nImmediately in the first episode, we are faced with a serious issue: the world is not fair. The issues of the world are incredibly pressing and parallel very well to serious issues in the real world. Take, for example, the relatively recent shootings in Newtown, Connecticut. What did the children do to deserve such a tragic fate? Why did this happen to the poor innocent children? If God is omnipotent and infinitely generous, how could he let such a fate take place? There is no doubt that these questions went through the victim\u2019s parents heads after the incident. Shouma and Kanba Takakura are faced with the same questions when their little sister, Himari, a kind, sweet girl dies an untimely death from her terminal disease. The tragedy of fate is explored throughout Mawaru Penguindrum as the two brothers try desperately try to save Himari from her inevitable death written by destiny and by God.\\n\\n\r\nThough it may seem that this is a \u201cweighty\u201d anime, Penguindrum actually has many comedic and lighthearted moments, mostly in the first part of the anime. This bring us to an important point- The anime is, to many people, divided into two parts. The first half of the anime is something more familiar \u2013 it\u2019s like a crazy slice-of-life romcom almost. Many people drop it in the beginning, but it should be noted that Penguindrum is not what it initially seems like. The second half takes a more psychological take, and its use of symbolism drastically increases. It also becomes more supernatural and magic becomes ever more prevalent. The introduction of magic as well as other elements make the second part much more convoluted and messy, leaving viewers often wondering \u201cwhat is going on?\u201d Multiple events start happening at once and at the same time we have flashbacks throughout each episode, making episodes go all over the place.\\n\\n\r\nMany people say that Penguindrum\u2019s story is \u201cweird,\u201d which is a legitimate complaint. The anime starts with two boys, Shouma and Kanba, losing their sister to an inevitably fatal illness. However, a magical penguin hat reincarnates her but will only keep her alive if Shouma and Kanba find the \u201cpenguindrum,\u201d which we don\u2019t know the exact information about. The first person they meet is a highschool girl that stalks a teacher in hopes of having a romantic relationship with him and carries around a diary that tells the future, which is suspected to be the Penguindrum. Sound strange? Well, it only gets more radical from there. They later meet the teacher\u2019s famous, Yuri wife named yuri, a girl with a gun that shoots memory-wiping balls, and a pink haired, ghost doctor who uses magic to try and destroy the world. However, the different feel of Mawaru Penguindrum is also highly refreshing. It\u2019s safe to say that Mawaru Penguindrum is unique and is not very similar to any one anime, making it a nice break from run-of-the-mill series. Its daringly eccentric story creates a fun and new experience. Its production is also very well done, making the story all the more captivating. The brutality of fate, the yearning of someone\u2019s love, the pain of loneliness, among other things are explored through the anime.\\n\\n\r\nWhat made Penguindrum awesome for me was its astonishing use of symbolism throughout the anime. Many symbols were thought-provoking and cleverly done, a real treat to someone who ponders on them. Some carry with them strong messages and morals of the story, making symbols a large component of the anime. Hell, Penguindrum itself is one grand, magnificent symbol. However, not all symbols were so spectacular. Some of them were one dimensional and had little thought behind them. Many symbols are open to interpretation just like a poem, so you take your own meaning out of each one. There isn\u2019t a universal meaning for some symbols and you figure out your own, though some are flatly explained. Because of this subjective judgment for symbols, I\u2019ll refrain from saying which ones are good or not, and let you pick your own favorites.\\n\\n\r\nProbably one of the biggest problems I have with Penguindrum is its use of drama. A prime example of this is its use of death scenes. Death scenes are repeated over and over to a point they are meaningless and don\u2019t deliver nearly the same effect as the first time (like medicine, to those who have watched it already). *spoiler (though not a big one): Himari dies so many times throughout the anime, and always comes back after a little mourning. When she is finally dead for good, or as we think, we have the crying scenes, the \u201cfate is cruel\u201d monologue, and are left feeling awfully depressed when the episode ends. Then the next episode, she\u2019s alive again like nothing ever happened. A few episodes later, you\u2019ll forget it ever happened. Death is only used as a dramatic component for sadness, but has little real meaning. The triteness of death is just one of the numerous examples of abuse of drama. Another example is meaningless and even misleading suspense. For example, many episodes end or scenes are cut with the main character in the face of danger, leaving us with suspense and excitement. This suspense turns out to be meaningless as the danger actually never existed. The anime deceives the viewers making them feel excited and scared for what is about to happen, only to say that it was just kidding soon after.\\n\\n\r\nAnother major problem I have with Penguindrum is its use of magic, especially in the second half of the anime. For an anime trying to depict the brutality of reality, the unfairness of life, and the powerlessness against fate, it\u2019s not apt that the anime uses magic mumbo-jumbo. Now, the problem isn\u2019t the existence of magic in the anime, but rather its use- it is used as a solution to real problems. Fate is brutal and written in stone\u2026 unless you have a magic hat of course. Then you can solve all your solutions by just resetting fate. The implementation of magic puts a strain on Penguindrum\u2019s overall message, and makes the second part even messier.\\n\\n\r\nBut by far the greatest issue of Penguindrum is how crazy its narrative gets in the second half. Many things starts to happen at all once on top of frequent flashbacks to events in the past, leading to large confusion. The direction the anime takes is also very obscure and random at times. It attempts to do many things at once, and unfortunately does not succeed.\\n\\n\r\nPenguindrum has a nice, diverse set of characters that have their fair share of strengths and weaknesses. In the Takakura family, we have 3 of the main characters, Kanba, Shouma, and Himari. Their parents have been missing for a while, so the siblings actually take different family roles. Kanba is the masculine head of the family, he\u2019s cold and often resorting to dirty tactics to save Himari, who he dearly cares about. Shouma is the more maternal part of the family, he\u2019s kind and thoughtful, and even cleans and cooks. The two highly contrast each other, and this contrast is further apparent as the anime goes on as their differences go to the point that they part ways as they take their own path to save Himari. The relationship between all 3 family members of the family is beautifully developed and portrayed. The side characters are for the most part interesting and each develop throughout the series. It should also be noted that there are adorable blue penguins that are representations of these three characters.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, this part of Penguindrum is not all sunshine either. Though the characters do develop over time, the development is highly inconsistent and changes to suit the story. This is especially true in the side characters, whos motivations are enigmatic and always changing. Many characters are also forgotten about after their major part in the story, and end up having little impact on the outcome. A prime example of this is Ringo, one of the 4 main characters. The first part of the anime focuses on her quest, known as \u201cProject M,\u201d but soon after, she quickly forgotten. She appears again at many times after this, but by then is little more than a bystander and no longer plays such a significant role.  The backstories for the characters are also sadly all too similar, kind of like the universal \u201cdaddy problems\u201d in Neon Genesis Evangelion. They all are suffering similar situations (which, for the sake of no spoilers, will not be explained) and there isn\u2019t much variety.  And by the end of the anime, we still only know this much. Though similar and unknown backgrounds isn\u2019t a major problem, it still is somewhat disappointing.\\n\\n\r\nAnother fault of the characters is the lack of individual development. Though the relationships between the characters is strong, development on a person basis is weak and highly inconsistent. This is especially prominent in the side characters, but for the sake of brevity,let's just focus on the main characters. We have Kanba, the masculine head of the family. He develops little until the second half, where he takes a radical turn into evil and doing shady business. This transformation made little sense, and was merely to conveniently match with the plot. Shouma doesn't develop much if at all throughout the whole series.  Himari is also not a very strong character, as she is, in my opinion, little more than a plot device. She doesn\u2019t develop much throughout the anime, and though she does have things like regret from the past, nothing really comes out of it.One side character with the most flagrant development that I'd like to mention is Dr. Sanetoshi.  We know little about him except he supposedly died 10 years ago, his ghost lurks around and plans to destroy the world with magic. \\n\\n\r\nNow let\u2019s get to one of the brighter parts of the anime: its art. The animation is brilliantly colorful, and the image is clear and sharp. At times, especially later on, the art adds a more surreal effect fitting for the anime. Character designs are also very well done, and few characters look completely identical. The background characters are unmoving figures similar to those in bathroom signs. The soundtrack is also top-notch and beautiful, and there is a plethora of very well-done openings and endings, my favorite of which is \u201cDear Future.\u201dThe OST is just as spectacular, and fits into scenes seamlessly and perfectly.\\n\\n\r\n With the flaws in mind, Penguindrum's refreshing uniqueness alone does not label it as an outstanding anime. Criticism aside though, I enjoyed almost every minute of Penguindrum, and despite its flaws, it was very enjoyable. Yeah, Penguindrum was a crazy, convoluted, wild ride, but in the end it definitely worth the experience.",

            "content": "Overview:\r\nAs a longtime anime fan who has been watching anime since the 1990s, I divide anime into 3 categories of \"uniqueness\" , based on what I consider to be the composite average of all anime and how far a title is from that average core. First let us picture the most generic, average anime in existence to serve as the Sun of our Solar System. How about Naruto or Bleach? Either would be a good candidate as the most average an anime could possibly be. The first category are \"inner planets\" anime that are fairly close to the Sun.  These are your generic animelike battle shonen, ecchi harem, and slice of life. Next, you have the \"outer planets\" that are farther from the Sun, but not TOO far and still visible on a clear night like Jupiter and Saturn were for the ancient Greeks. These are the slightly unusual anime like Axis Powers Hetalia, Detroit Metal City, or Psycho Pass. Finally, you have the Trans-Neptunian Objects that lie on the very edge of the Solar System. These are the anime that are WAY far away from the average \"Sun\". Examples of these would be Kuchuu Buranko, Ergo Proxy, or Spice and Wolf. These don't HAVE to be surrealist, artistic anime as Spice and Wolf proves, but rather an anime that isn't like anything else and feels completely unique in the universe of anime. With a title like \"Penguindrum\", it shouldn't be a huge surprise that this is one of the Trans Neptunian anime. In other words, prepare for a bizarre and unique experience!\\n\\n\r\nStory: Spoiler Free! I promise!\\n\\n\r\nThe plot of Penguindrum is that 2 brothers named Kanba and Shoma are highly concerned about their critically ill little sister named Himari, who was recently given a prognosis of only having a few weeks left to live. The 2 brothers decide to take her to an aquarium and show her a good time, since they used to have fun at the aquarium as kids. Shoma even buys Himari an unusual looking penguin hat. Unfortunately, Himari tragically collapses and dies right there. Shoma and Kanba take her to the hospital, but are told that it is too late. However, the penguin hat suddenly comes to life and resurrects Himari! It even seems to have cured her illness. However, the spirit residing in the magical penguin hat demands a favor from Shoma and Kanba in exchange for saving their sister. They must find a special artifact known as the \"penguindrum\" and bring it to the spirit of the hat, or their little sister will die! The hat tells the brothers that the first person they need to investigate is an unusual girl named Ringo, who is obsessed with fate and has a massive crush on the brothers' teacher. As the story progresses, you learn more and more hidden background and history about the various characters and the revelations are revealed bit by bit. This eventually makes Penguindrum a rather addicting and tense anime. However, the first part of the series is actually a little slow and some viewer's may not be used to starting on such a snail's pace. I don't want to spoil anything, but there are many plot twists and you will probably not see a lot of them coming! The only warning I will give is that this series does have some sad parts, but it is more bittersweet in its tone rather than ever becoming a full blown tragedy.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\\n\r\nOne of the most immediately likeable characters is the sickly little sister Himari. She is eternally optimistic and just oozes with kindness and caring. The 2 brothers Shoma and Kanba are quickly shown to be polar opposites, which is reflected by their red vs. blue hair colors. This is a reference to a Japanese cultural trope called \"red oni, blue oni\". Kanba is ladies man who easily just accepts things, even if a situation becomes completely absurd. If a giant demon penguin were to appear out of nowhere, he would simply accept that this is now happening and not even be shocked or disturbed. Kanba is also a moral utilitarian, meaning that he believes that the ends and the ultimate goal always justifies the means. Shoma is much more introverted, easily shaken up, and possesses a more traditional morality. Ringo is extremely obsessive, creepy, and at first seems to perfectly fit the \"yandare\" archetype. However, there is more to her character than the typical yandare, as you would expect from an acclaimed series like Penguindrum. There are actually quite a few more characters I could talk about, but I don't want this review to drag on forever. Instead I will just say that Penguindrum has an excellent cast of characters that you will slowly get to know better and better as the series goes on.\\n\\n\r\nThemes and symbols:\\n\\n\r\nPenguindrum is a philosophical anime that focuses largely on the topics of fate, free will, existentialism, the paradox of theodicy, and filial love. Penguindrum does a rather nice job presenting these themes and never feels like it is trying to be deeper than it actually is. It is not needlessly confusing, doesn't have throwaway allusions and symbolism that have no reason to be there, and basically feels comfortable with itself. Many anime TRY to be deep, but not all anime are able to execute their goals with the same precision. Penguindrum is top tier in this regard. You will immediately notice the extremely bright color palette that was chosen for the art in this series. This is because color actually plays an important role in the symbolism of the series. The most prominently featured color as virtually every critic before me has already mentioned is the color red. Seriously, only Suspiria can compete with Penguindrum in obsession with showing red everywhere! The reason for this is likely due to the \"red string of fate\" used throughout East Asian mythology and legends. Fate is an extremely important theme of Penguindrum. The red is also often interpreted as representing the fruit of original sin, which in Western art is often portrayed as an apple, even though the Bible itself makes no mention of apples. The fruit of original sin also makes an appearance in this series, so that is of course a distinct possibility. I don't want to talk too much more about the symbolism, because I fear I will spoil something if I go too far in depth. Just be aware that there IS plenty there to find, so be on the look out and pay attention, even during the seemingly boring parts!\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\\n\r\nHave you ever read a Haruki Murakami novel? Super Frog Saves Tokyo perhaps? This question is asked in Penguindrum, likely as a reference to the influence that Murakami's writing had on Penguindrum's writing. Murakami always seamlessly combines really weird stories, dark situations, quirky comedy, dense symbolism, and existential philosophy into a highly memorable package. I had never seen anything else that reminded me of his writing until I saw Penguindrum! I'm not saying Penguindrum is on par with the master himself of course and is HIGHLY unlikely to win the Nobel Prize for Literature, like Murakami almost inevitably will in the next couple years. However, Penguindrum is a great little series and is well worth a watch. The only strikes against it are some pacing issues, especially in the beginning of the series, a soundtrack that I personally wasn't crazy about, and an art style that you may or may not like. I will end though by saying that Penguindrum is well worthy of your time and I highly recommend it! I give it a very solid and well deserved 8/10.",

            "content": "Mawaru Penguindrum is not a show for everybody, but for those who are able to appreciate what this show has to offer, it is truly a treat.\r\nThis series, first and foremost, focuses on the messages that it wants to convey, and then weaves the plot around it. The show approaches things quite differently than most animes, and leaves us with a thematically tight, but quite confusing show. The premise is basically two brothers trying to save their younger sister from a terminal illness. She dies, but a mysterious penguinhat revives her and commands them to obtain the penguindrum if they truly wish to save her.Mysterious penguins are also dropped onto their doorway. The first half of the series presents itself as a comedic slice of life with some supernatural elements, however the second half shifts in tone and mood completely. Basically, if you become too comfortable with how the story progresses in the first half, you're in for a rude awakening. \\n\\n\r\nMuch of this show often makes makes references to fate, and potentially defying it, but  much deeper themes and messages comes to light as the series progresses. As stated earlier, this show can be quite confusing, as a lot of elements that are presented in this show become surreal. The fine line between abstraction and reality become blurred. Many plot twists are thrown at its viewers, and certain plot points remain ambiguous, leaving the audience to make their own connections. This show is highly symbolic, so it can be either highly compelling, or extremely frustrating. For those who are able to make the connections, and understand the symbolism in this show, it can feel very rewarding.\\n\\n\r\nMusic is fantastic. Some of the tracks are god-tier, while some are forgettable. What I noticed about this show is that certain tracks are only used once or twice throughout the entire series, showing how diverse the music can truly be in this show. Many many variations of the same tune are used as well. It's also worth noting that a lot of the songs that are in the show are actually redone version of songs that belong to an old Japanese rock band called ARB.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation in this show is gorgeous. The colors and characters are vibrant, and the the movement is fluid. It has wonderfully drawn background artwork, and presents very \\n\r\ninteresting visual ideas all together. Much of visual ideas are reminiscent of fairy tales. This show also has an excellent sense of composition and lighting. Repetition is utilized quite a bit in this show, so expect some stock footage. However, there are very noticeable drops in production value for certain episodes. Despite that, this is probably Brain Base's most beautifully animated series to date.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters have a very cute design, sporting a sort of romantic comedy style. At first, it is difficult to become emotionally invested for a majority of the main cast though. The interest of the how the plot unfolds seems to outweigh what actually happens to the characters. Certain characters may even seem to be downright unlikeable. Fortunately, by the end of the show, you will most certainly grow to care for most of, if not all of, the main cast. The voice actors and actresses do an excellent job as well. Himari's voice actress might need some getting used to though.\\n\\n\r\nWhat purpose do the penguins pose? \\n\r\nThey are reflections of the characters inner selves. They do not really become plot relevant after the second episode.\\n\\n\r\nThis show is truly a breath of fresh air. While I would not call this the perfect show, what this show offers is so rewarding that I'm able to look beyond that. Ambiguity in a show does not bother me so much when it's done right, and this is definitely the sort of show worth re-watching. Despite the somewhat contrived plot and occasional frustration this show can bring, the ride while watching this show was a extremely exciting one.",

            "content": "Remember during an English/Literature class and your teacher would recommend you a book to read for an important exam/lesson? Some of the contexts contain what you may think as a simple room painted in \"red\" actually hides a message of violence and anger. Another example is the book \"The Little Prince by Antoine de Saint-Exup\u00e9ry\" shares many symbols such as the rose being a symbol of vanity. Mawaru Penguindrum is definitely like a classic book. A classic book that uses objects as symbols.\r\nPractically, the whole anime in itself is a pure symbol of what you may think is a child's play is actually much morethan that.\\n\\n\r\nThe thing that made me drawn into the anime was pretty simple, the cute little blue penguins. I barely took the anime that seriously because I don't really check out the summary of an anime just for an element of surprise and the picture cover of the anime made it look like a children's show. The first few episodes did turn out to be a joke and I had a great time laughing and admiring the fun atmosphere the anime was giving. But once the anime started to take the story in a different direction the anime turns into an anime worth raising an eyebrow for.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 9\\n\r\nDuring the start of the anime, more likely the word \"fate/destiny\" does keep on repeating a dozen of times and mainly that is the general story line. Likely avoiding the destined future a person takes is not plausible -- and so that's when the penguindrum comes. Symbolism can never die down in this anime and it is unavoidable. What is unique about how the anime's flow of story goes is the endless amount of flashbacks you will receive in every episode. It surely is annoying and confusing because they do show you flashbacks in random but then it isn't much likely a bother if you are serious about getting to know this anime better. Another word you'll be hearing a lot of times in this anime is \"punishment\" and in life happiness doesn't come along the way you like it. There will always be hard times and consequences no matter how painful it is. The way I see with this anime a reward has to be equal to its punishment -- but I think that's just me. The greatest part of the anime for me was the ending. I think it was a pure masterpiece. I was overflowing with tears and anger but if you look at it in the story line itself and the meaning of destiny that ending did not fail to surprise me. An ending worth crying and worth inspiring.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 10\\n\r\nPractically the reason is that once we see a colorful piece of artwork the logical meaning is \"fun & happy\" but that picturesque is just a cover up and so that's when the \"Psychological\" genre clearly explains it. The bright colors was well-spot on with the anime. I always loved the transformation part of Himari. The splashing of colors, the angle shots and the well-detailed animation are all worth praising for. The opening and ending animations are both done beautifully. If I may, the Opening Animation or even the title screen of Mawaru in itself holds a lot of clues. They sure took their time planting these clues very well and hiding it from the viewers and with these colorful images it is a very bright idea that the director was hiding the \"main\" plot.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10\\n\r\nOne of the best soundtracks out there. I fell in love more with the OSTs rather than the Opening and Ending songs. What is so great about these OSTs is that the music is so perfect with the scene it was trying to match. My favorite OSTs would be \"The Children of Fruit and Destiny\" or \"Unmei no Ko Tachi\" -- listen to it and let the music feel you. I still cry to this OST and it still holds a deep meaning to me.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9\\n\r\nExcellent character development. The characters made this anime possible. Let me remind you, this has a psychological genre so more likely you'll see a lot of out-of-the-box characters. The anime didn't just focus on the four main characters but also all those characters around them had a big role in the anime and what can be more realistic than that. Today, we live our lives thinking that the people around us are just individuals who will be nothing more than just strangers not knowing that these people can change our life or more likely our destiny and that's how Mawaru Penguindrum explains it so well. The beautiful way of how the director connects all these minor/major characters makes you ask at how much more can this anime get more realistic as it is.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10\\n\r\nOne of the most rare animes that truly uses my brain to unfold the story. As I go beyond the episodes it becomes more intriguing and exciting. So much were happening in this show that I actually grabbed a pen and paper (literally) to try to unfold the life of all of these characters -- and it was a bliss. For a show to be called as an \"anime\" that kept me pre-occupied with questions was something I haven't really experience in my time being of watching animes and that's what makes this show so special. Penguindrum also holds my most favorite anime quotes. This is so far the only anime that truly made me experience happiness, sadness, anger, suspense and even madness. It practically is the only anime that moved me to think over my life (I know, what the hell) and the great deal of Penguindrum being able to touch me so much is a much better work than any masterpiece.\\n\\n\r\nOver-all: 10\\n\r\nMawaru Penguindrum is not like any normal anime. It's a work of art that is in need of 100% of your attention and fairly \"a lot\" of brain power. Like any great literary piece, not all would understand the point of view of the creator but then if you are able to, most especially in Penguindrum, you'll feel how beautiful this creation is.",

            "content": "When someone on the Internet describes a work of fiction as 'visionary', it's usually meant as a form of praise, referring to a willingness to defy convention in favor of something more thought-provoking and enticing. As defined by a dictionary, 'visionary' refers to embracing fanciful and often impractical ideas.\r\nMawaru Penguindrum falls under both definitions.\r\nWhat Kunihiko Ikuhara of Utena-fame has created here is a show that takes philosophical musings on themes such as fate, love and death; and combines them with slapstick antics involving ghost penguins and ping-pong balls that erase people's memories.\r\nIf that sounds difficult to take seriously to you, don't bother watching this show.It's going to get a lot weirder.\\n\\n\r\nThe overall product is audacious, if nothing else; presenting the story 2 brothers, Kanba and Shoma, who promise to help a mysterious entity track down an object called the Penguindrum in a desperate attempt to ward off the death of their sister, Himari. Their quest has them run into a slew of  messed up characters and situations, and before long the narrative turns into a complete mess.\\n\\n\r\nThere are several reasons for this.\\n\\n\r\nA big problem is that the series has absolutely no regard for logic and consistency, even within its own narrative. At the start of the series, Himari is brought back to life after succumbing to an incurable disease. Her death and subsequent revival are treated as tragic and miraculous, respectively. Makes sense. What doesn't is that this is repeated several times over the course of the series, treated with the same impact every time. Viewers, however, might be puzzled or annoyed by this repetition seeing as it raises the question as to how severely this series treats the concept of death. This is exacerbated once another character reveals that he's been dead for over a decade, after which the story moves on, completely unaffected by the revelation.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter development also tends to be very inconsistent. Motivations, personalities and even backstories can change from one scene to the next just to suit the needs of the plot. The aforementioned memory-erasing ping-pong balls are liberally used to retool previously established plot-points to the narrative's convenience. \\n\\n\r\nOther, basic issues also plague the storytelling: many of the back stories feel interchangeable (crappy childhoods galore), some characters who get a lot of screen time end up being completely insignificant while others are introduced seeming important only to be forgotten about before anything could even be done with them. The latter goings-on of the story also feature hackneyed  developments involving terrorism, delusions (it's all in your head!) and cliffhangers (someone was stabbed! but who?) that end up not mattering in the slightest. \\n\\n\r\nMost damning of all, however, is the clumsy way the overall product comes together. The shifts in tone \u2013 from whacky to dark and vice versa \u2013 are as frequent as they are jarring, and it all too often feels that the subjects about which characters are philosophizing have very little to do with the story of two brothers who are attempting to ward off that which should be inevitable.\\n\\n\r\n*WARNING! The following paragraph contains spoilers about the general tone of the ending! WARNING*\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of which, the ending cops out on that in a major way. The series spends a lot of time emphasizing how ordinary people are  powerless in the face of fate and that struggling against the inevitable will often result in greater tragedy. One would expect such a story to end on a tragic note as is befit for a something that fancies itself an exploration of fate, but the actual ending turns out rather bittersweet; mostly leaning towards the sweet considering the dark events preceding it.\\n\\n\r\n*END SPOILERS*\\n\\n\r\nAll that said, the series must certainly be praised yet again for its unique style. This show isn't just different for the hell of it. Ikuhara combines audio and imagery in striking ways, constantly delivering scenes that will shock and surprise. Even if you end up disliking the series, there's a definite guarantee that you'll remember it. Which is more than can be said for a lot of other stuff.\\n\\n\r\nIn closing, I'd like to say that while many others would opine that the Mawaru Penguindrum's unique style, impeccable direction and interesting themes make for a wonderful anime, I think that there are too many issues with the overall product to really consider it great. Many of which, I feel, can't be chalked up to mere artistic idiosyncrasy.",

            "content": "Mawaru Penguindrum is a beautiful piece of art. It can inspire either much love or hate, and new details are discovered with each viewing. Intelligent symbolism and heavy themes span all of Penguindrum's 24 episodes. Despite its surreal delivery, Penguindrum remains very real.\r\nThe story of Mawaru Penguindrum is completely absurd. Not absurd because of the surreal elements, but how it makes something so imaginative and implausible seem real. We start off with a dying sister, her revival, and eventual search for a mysterious object, called the \"penguin drum\". Yet, somewhere along the way, the story becomes a situation of life, death, and existence itself. \r\nTheplot takes a while to reach its climax. Half of the show is spent on character development, craziness, humor, and seemingly random events. The first half is exciting, and the absolute insanity never stops. However, this slow-developing plot is crucial; the characters grow on you. And if you have any siblings, it'll hit close to home. The second half, on the other hand, takes a dark turn, and the plot moves much quicker here. The development and random elements from the first half are pieced together, and nothing ends up being random or useless. Nevertheless, the show's thematic elements are certainly strange. There's comedy, terrorism/cult politics, moral ambiguity, philosophy,  all tied together by the overarching theme of family and friendship. The story isn't just unique; it's relevant without being pretentious and forceful. As stated before, its absurd, but the themes, feelings, and other elements that Penguindrum invokes is very real. \\n\\n\r\nBrain's Base put quite some effort here. As the makers of Natsume Yuujinchou, the art quality is outstanding. The story isn't the only thing that's surreal; the art is too. From the strange angles and fantasy-esque scenes, the art has a Shaft feel. How a studio is able to go from a calm slice-of-life, realistic style to flamboyant, Bakemonogatari-like flair is beyond me. The art truly complements the story.\\n\\n\r\nSound is just as great as the art. The music is simply stunning. The opening themes are performed very well, and their compositions are genius. The ending themes are mostly covers of ARB (old Japanese rock band) with a cool twist. Dear Future (first ending theme) is exceptional--extensive use of hemiola, polyrhythms, layering, and the most angry/painful sounding minor chords. In other words, the music was made for musicians while being very accessible. This isn't you regular J-Pop or J-Rock fair. The rest of the soundtrack is appropriate, but not exactly memorable. Sound effects are also well-done.\\n\\n\r\nAgain, character development is crucial to Penguindrum. \\n\\n\r\nKanba: You'll hate some of his decisions, but you'll always have sympathy for the Takakura siblings. He's a cool guy, and he will do anything to save his family, no matter the consequences. He does some immoral things.\\n\r\nShouma: He's innocent but brave. He will only do what is right, but just like Kanba, he tries to protect his family whenever he can. \\n\r\nHimari: She's the little sister of the Takakuras'. She's rather intelligent and insightful, and unlike the majority of sisters in anime (or in media in general), she's not filled with moe/kawaii or tsundere-ness. The Takakuras are very likable, and each have their own quirky personalities.\\n\r\nRingo: She'll creep you out for most of the show, but you'll eventually love her too. Confused but wholehearted.\\n\r\nPenguins: THEY ARE THE CUTEST THINGS IN THE UNIVERSE. They provide most of the comedic relief in the show, and each penguin takes its personality quirks from their respective owners.\\n\r\nThe remaining cast are interesting, and they all add quite a bit to the story. \\n\\n\r\nI loved Mawaru Penguindrum. It has its own peculiar charm through its humor and its tragedy. I thoroughly enjoyed Penguindrum's use of literary themes (foreshadowing, allusions, etc.) and overall artistic approach to everything. In addition, it made me feel a wide-range of emotions, from joy and confusion to sadness and anger, and by the end of it, I was left crying with tears of sadness and joy.\\n\\n\r\nBut that's not to say that you'll love it too. As with any work of art, it will inspire love or hate. In any case, if you happen to enjoy this show, it will open your eyes quite a bit--if you're not used to opening them. Otherwise, you'll be very amused. So, give Mawaru Penguindrum a shot. It will take the whole show to truly appreciate it, although I question your humanity if it doesn't make you interested. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Before I started watching this anime, even before I knew what it was called, I already had a feeling it was going to be special. \r\nAfter watching the first episode, I said aloud: \"This is the weirdest anime...!\" But despite that, I was very drawn to it and kept watching. I wasn't disappointed. \r\nMawaru Penguindrum has made me both laugh and cry more than once, and after episode 8 I could hardly wait to watch more, putting all the other anime I had been watching on hold for this. \r\nThe story is very touching, and the Takakura family's close bonds with each other was somethingI really loved. I was rather surprised at the plot twists(I won't give anything away, but beware- Penguindrum isn't all sweetness and light), but I do like anime that's darker than it first appears to be. The story also gets much deeper, and although by the end some things are still left unexplained, I think that's part of the magic of the show.\\n\\n\r\nThe artwork and soundtrack both left me speechless. I felt like the music fit perfectly, whether it was a moment of happiness, sorrow or a gripping dramatic scene. I also got incredibly attached to the opening and ending themes, both music and art-wise. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters are amazing. The Takakura siblings are all lovable, and some later characters (which I won't name because of spoilers) are just to die for. Ringo's existance annoyed the hell out of me, but now I've grown to love her as well. \\n\\n\r\nAll in all, I think Mawaru Penguindrum was a fantastic show. I couldn't reccomend it more, and it's one of the best I saw in 2011. Magic, mystery, love and tradgedy- it's all there. I've seen several people say that \"it isn't a show for everyone\", but doesn't that apply to most anime? I think it would be a shame to go through life without seeing it. \\n\\n\\n\r\nBut watch and see for yourself-\\n\r\n Penguindrum may just leave you spellbound...",

            "content": "Mawaru Penguindrum is one of those rare anime that doesn't have some form of source material. It was created by Brain's Base, the same studio behind Durarara & Baccano. The co-writer and director was Ikuhara Kunihiko. You may not know his name but you probably recognise his other works. He created and directed Revolutionary Girl Utena and served as the director for large segments of the Sailor Moon anime. I have to say, this sounds promising. So far, the two anime I've seen from Brain's Base have been at least decent and Ikuhara does amazing work. If they screw this up I'm going to besorely disappointed. So, let's proceed with cautious optimism.\\n\\n\r\nStory:\\n\\n\r\nOur tale opens with three siblings, Shouma, Kanba and Himari. The three are living on their own since their parents went missing and things aren't going very well. Himari is dying of an incurable disease and her brothers have been told that she doesn't have long. They decide to do everything they can to make her final days happy and take her to an Aquarium that they all used to love going to. It's there that Himari collapses. She's rushed to the hospital where she dies only to quickly come back to life and start adopting odd mannerisms whenever she wears a penguin hat. She brings her brothers to a strange psychedelic space that even Lewis Carroll would find excessive, calls them worthless low lives and tells them that they'll have to find something called the \u201cPenguindrum\u201d to save their sister's life and things only become crazier and crazier from that point on.\\n\\n\r\nAs usual, let's begin by looking at the series' faults. The biggest one is that it's fond of bringing up really serious issues for dramatic moments that don't tie into the plot in any substantial way and are never brought up again after they happen. The primary examples being scenes where someone will very nearly be raped and the next episode they'll interact with the person who made the attempt as though nothing happened and it will just go completely unaddressed for the rest of the series. Which just begs the question of why something as serious as rape is being brought up at all if they aren't going to bother doing anything with it. Really, any source of drama should have some plot relevance instead of just being there for a cheap shock moment but there's something particularly terrible about using such a grotesque crime, and the number one cause of PTSD, in such a tawdry fashion. There are also quite a few humorous moments that fall short, mainly because they'll try to pull off humour at parts of their cheap shock scenes or really close to them which results in a tonal clash. The romance elements in this are absolutely atrocious. Most of it involves incestuous undertones, stalking and/or some other factor that makes it really skeevy. The problem being that a lot of it is played as uplifting or otherwise positive instead of having some self awareness of how messed up the situation is. Although, in all fairness, they do always show rape as being a terrible thing, even if they never bring the attempts up again after they're done with. \\n\\n\r\nLet's move on to the positive aspects. I will give the series credit on three points. The first is that the premise is very creative and had a lot of potential, even if that potential was largely squandered by meanderings into the realms of pointless irrelevance and general stupidity. I'll also give credit for having some legitimately good dramatic scenes, when it's actually doing plot relevant stuff and can refrain from trying to inject humour into it. The series also does have some funny scenes, when it's putting them in at light-hearted bits instead of trying to cram them into really serious moments. So, the series does manage some good bits during the rare stretches when the writers were on their Ritalin.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are, largely, not bad. Every single one does suffer from the writing's general lack of focus, but in terms of characterisation and development they aren't bad characters. They are, however, pretty standard with little, if anything, unique to define them. There are some really good familial scenes with Shouma, Kanba and Himari. They still aren't very complex characters, though and there are times when the series takes those bonds into creepy territory which does weaken that aspect.\\n\\n\r\nThen we have the penguins. Those of you who have seen Utena might remember the little purple monkey that existed solely for comic relief but was bearable because he largely stayed in the background and did, in all fairness, have some funny moments. Now, imagine that same basic character with a more prominent role and with four slight variations running around. So, now you have four largely pointless comic sidekicks taking up screen time and being highly obtrusive. I would like to tell you that at least none of them makes any attempt at sexually assaulting anyone, but one of them does, albeit in a much more mild form than most of the similar scenes in the series. Because tying someone up and forcing kisses on them without consent is still a type of sexual assault. \\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\\n\r\nThe art is good. Ikuhara's fondness for symbolism that's extravagant and kind of bizarre is fully on display. The visuals are highly engrossing and appealing to look at. The character designs are very reminiscent of Utena. For example, Natsume Masako looks similar to Arisugawa Juri in terms of hairstyle, facial structure and even expressions.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\\n\r\nThe actors in this really put a great deal of effort into their performances. They do deliver their lines as over the top or seriously as the current scene demands. I appreciate the effort they're clearly putting into it and I won't say that any of them were bad, but I really can't call them good performances either. Due to the tonal issues, A lot of scenes require them to fluctuate from serious to exaggeration in the space of a few sentences and it just sounds awkward. There aren't many scenes that let them show any subtle emotional range. Most just have them fluctuating between extremes. Honestly, the music is the one thing I didn't notice tonal problems with. Maybe it does fluctuate during those horribly executed scenes and I was too overwhelmed by everything else to notice but, as far as I can recall, the music was really good.\\n\\n\r\nHo-yay:\\n\\n\r\nThere's certainly some. One of the attempted rape scenes is between two characters of the same sex. There's also a case of two female characters being portrayed as having had sex, consensual too as rare as that is for this anime and there are some scenes that definitely come across as homo-erotic, usually between girls. That being said, it isn't a huge part of the anime since a lot of the focus is on Shouma and Kanba. As such, the ho-yay factor is going to be a 5/10.\\n\\n\r\nFinal Thoughts:\\n\\n\r\nThis anime is a classic example of style being valued over substance. It has some amazing visuals and it has some good scenes both dramatic and comedic and it does portray familial bonds pretty well. But taken as a whole, it doesn't hold up. The narrative is an unfocused mess with tonal problems and lots of dramatic moments that serve no purpose to the plot and come across as pretty offensive and demeaning towards serious issues. Because it's one thing to address serious issues and quite another to bring them up and then do bugger all with them. This series chose poorly and took the latter route. In the end, every good scene is over-shadowed by two or three bad ones and my final rating is going to be a 3/10. Next week, we'll ignore the requests for a moment because it's time to take another look at that franchise, in the name of the moon.",

            "content": "\"Survival Strategy!\" -That involves so many things, and so many of it is just amazing.\r\n*This review will be updated as more episodes are available, It is up to episode 14, also I have yet to watch Utena, so I can't make completely accurate comparisons to it*\r\nFIRST IMPRESSIONS: Now this one's a real head scratcher, is it a brilliant new story that's trying to break into new boundaries? Or is it just pure nonsense with a penchant for philosophical babble? Or a comedy about watching penguins do funny and out of the ordinary things?\r\nWhat I'm talking about (If you haven't figured it out yet) is thelatest bizarre anime that is causing a lot of buzz right now, Mawaru Penguindrum, a new anime by Kunihiko Ikuhara (Who has not been in the director's spot for more than ten years), the creator of a legendary (From the great things I have heard about this series to call it that) psychedelic anime series from the 1990's: Revolutionary Girl Utena.\\n\\n\r\nBefore the anime kicks itself into \"Survival Strategy,\" it starts out to be a family tragedy drama story with an in-and-out-of-the-hospital younger sister of the twins Kanba and Shouma, Himari who's in poor health, who one day while at a family trip to an aquarium, suddenly collapses and seemingly dies later at a hospital only to miraculously revive, thanks to the power of a penguin hat... and soon insanity insures as penguins start doing chores around their house, but only the three main characters can see only them.\\n\\n\r\nHere is when the story drops out of being something typical, and walks ambitiously into possible obscurity, now normally, I would be hesitant to jump into something as bizarre as this first episode shows it wants to become, but from what I hear about the director, I have no doubt that he isn't incompetent enough to just throw out something strange without wanting to show everyone something spectacular and fabulous.\\n\r\nBut there is a lot of daring concepts that Mawaru Penguin is willing to dabble in, most noticeably right before the ending theme song starts to play: (Warning, spoilers coming up) *coughincestcough* and that is enough for anyone to want to avoid this show completely and there's enough philosophical speeches to make it seem arrogant or deep depending on how you take it, but I have enough curiosity and definitely enough interest to see where it wants to end up. \\n\\n\r\nAFTER 14 EPISODES: And where it wants to end up... Is anyone's guess now, in a good way.\\n\r\nThe brothers Kanba and Shouma have gone through quite a good bit of things as their quest for the Penguindrum continues and their only lead? A psycho of a stalker, (or maybe she's a normal stalker, I wouldn't know how a stalker operates) Ringo Oginome with a diary.\\n\r\nBut that's not the only thing going on, other than hilarious penguin antics (One of them goes around peeping up girl's skirts), there are many things happening in the sidelines, but a good amount of focus goes to Ringo, with her motives for stalking, her sad past, and her attempts to date the one she obsessed with. And the way the anime ends off the whole thing with Ringo is done flawlessly, which all of that build up is used in continued use in the later part of the anime, with everything revolving around the \"penguindrum\" and a mysterious white haired man.\\n\\n\r\nThe anime also challenges the concept of forbidden love, which honestly can be very off putting, but none of it is shallow, and everything is used to great effect. \\n\r\nThe anime constantly breathes creative animation, and drama to all who crave it, as this anime continues to keep you on the edge of your seat even as far as the show gotten so far, it is none the less impressive and shows that is the strongest to be best anime of 2011.\\n\\n\r\nANIMATION: I know what Revolutionary Girl Utena looks like, and Mawaru Penguindrum looks like an updated version of that show, in more of the lines of fitting in with the standards of current animation.\\n\r\nIt has the look of shojo anime as the characters all look pretty (Both the girls and boys), and there is a lot of artistry in the back grounds, everything is very bright and colorful, nothing dull looking at all, especially with a certain scenes that involves the \"survival strategy,\" it's nothing short of amazing.\\n\r\nAnd several episodes include very creative sequences going further than the previous episode, that are extremely reminisce of Utena.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND: It's mostly the catchy pop back ground music that stands out, though the theme music is quite good.\\n\r\nThe voice acting for the main characters is good and all, but I hope there isn't too many scenes with the sister yelling, it doesn't sound terrible and this is just a nit pick of mine but, the voice actor just doesn't sound capable to produce a yell, it sound like she's yawning actually.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL:\\n\r\nThe Good:\\n\r\n+ This centuries' Revolutionary Girl Utena.\\n\r\n+ An anime that's willing to take risks right away with the story to try to be original.\\n\r\n+ Delightfully unpredictable.\\n\\n\r\nMixed:\\n\r\n+/- Dazzling and colorful animation. / Maybe too flashy and colorful much for some (Which is disappointing).\\n\\n\r\nI'm willing to stick around to see what Mawaru Penguindrum is capable of doing, even if it falls flat on it's face, and hope others will be as enthusiastic as myself about this anime. \\n\r\nI strongly believe this to be very best of 2011, and hope the ending will blow me away.",

            "content": "Mawaru Penguindrum; also entitled 'I Have a Lot of Feelings'\r\nI won't lie. This was amazing. Absolutely beautiful. Stunning script, clean art, a unique plot line and music that wrenches at your gut in the most despairing moments of the series, whilst enhancing the humour and light-heartedness that this series needed as a preventative measure for hearts breaking and tears overflowing everywhere.\r\nWhere should I even start?\r\nThe story itself was...definitely unique. I heard the title of Penguindrum and passed it off as a simple family orientated fantasy adventure, but when I saw that it was categorised as 'psychological', my curiosity was piqued and I began to watchit. Boy, was I in for a journey. In typical Ikuhara-esque manner, the themes dealt with in this anime are at times questionable, offensive, immoral, philosophical; an all encompassing myriad of emotion and thought at the same time. I've actually had a friend I recommended this to, who refused to watch past the first episode as she found some of the themes unpalatable. Only a few directors are able to pull off such a jumble of themes as artfully as Ikuhara while retaining an appeal to a wider audience. Complicated, but watchable. I especially loved how all of the characters intertwined with each other, reminding the watcher of the underlying theme of 'fate'. Every character in this series is fated to meet in some way, to make an impact on another's life whether for better or for worse, and the sheer curiosity and interest behind the slow reveals and the twists in personalities are a joy to experience. Originally, I was going to drop the series as it started off so slowly. It was bizarre and it moved at a snail's pace, and the main characters did not seem to be going anywhere but in circles. It all changed around the halfway mark of the series, when the characters began to show their dark sides, their hidden personalities, their motives, the appearance of ghosts and the disappearance of logic and morals.  Of course, the pace is uneven every here and there, but the variance in almost pointless humour and fast paced drama is a welcome contrast; it keeps you hooked and on edge, wondering what will happen next. \\n\\n\r\nThis isn't a story about just familial love. This is a story of revenge, passion, the futility and cruelty of humankind, of fate and of salvation. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters portrayed all of this beautifully. One of the most masterfully written scripts in terms of character development, characters whom you initially expected to be stereotypes found in anime (the playboy, the 'motherly' character, the girl with the crush, the beauty, the teacher, the Innocent) are all turned on their heads when the series comes to its climax and tapers to an end. Characters whom you initially thought unimportant are really the most important of all, and they are all linked so intricately together in a web that Ikuhara has spun to pull the story together, coupled with flashbacks of their pasts which explain their motives and their philosophies, creates such rich personalities. None of these characters are shallow. For example, when I first encountered Ringo Oginome I found her irritating and obsessive for what seemed like a schoolgirl's mere crush, but with her past tragedies being revealed as the story went on, as well as her understanding of her self and of others developing, I grew attached to her;  I cried for her and I cried for her conflicting circumstances. The initial set up of all of these characters is for you to either hate them, then grow attached, or to love them and sympathise with them, then when the series hits its climax and their darker sides are revealed, it's hard to hate them, knowing what they've been through. Even the main villain, Sanetoshi, is charming and elegant, first shown as a miracle worker and slowly evolving into a darker entity, but even then I didn't hate him. Sure, I was angry at him, I was angry with what he had put our heroes through, but the initial charm still lingered and I couldn't bring myself to outright hate him (also because damn, smooth talking while attempting to break humanity? Let me have some of that).\\n\\n\r\nThe art as well. Oh, god the art. I've always been a fan of Lily Hoshino, so when I found she was doing the character designs I was immediately interested. The animation is smooth and fluid, with a clean style and bold colours. However, there are discrepancies within the animation at times, with one episode (the episode at the hospital where Natsume makes her debut) being horrendously animated in comparison to the rest of the series, but I can forgive this for the outstanding beauty that the rest of the series brings. It's not just the clean, pretty style that makes the animation stand out; its the symbolism. During the series, the backgrounds are often a plain colour, interspersed with small symbols such as penguin logos, apples or train signs. It's not until the end of the series when you recognise their significance that you fully appreciate the bizarre symbols. What you thought was artistic bloodshed, you realise to be a symbol of love and fate. What you thought was a strange, alien ritual, you realise to be a portrayal of sexual intimacy. You realise things, the second, the third, the fourth time around. You don't stop realising things even when you know the script off by heart. The art is so rich and intricate, that even small symbols and inconspicuous posters have a meaning to them That's part of the beauty that Mawaru Penguindrum has so carefully placed and has me rewatching to find all of these subtle nuances.\\n\\n\r\nBut really, what has me coming back to this series time and time again, to rewatch and analyse and have sudden epiphanies is the thematics that Ikuhara plays upon. The anime starts off with Shouma Takakura stating that he 'hates the word fate'. 'Okay,' you say to yourself. 'An anime about fate. Interesting. Goes along nicely with the family love theme.' \\n\\n\r\nIt's at the end of the series where you realise that you were so very wrong.\\n\\n\r\nSo very, very wrong.\\n\\n\r\nYou kind of wish that someone, a reviewer, a kind, hopefully non sadistic friend or a big caution sign had warned you of the emotional journey that you were about to embark on. \\n\\n\r\nYou see, this anime isn't just about fate. Okay, well maybe a large proportion of it is, but that's just the running theme. Fate is the cause; fate caused grief, passion, murder, revenge and sacrifice; in turn these caused each character's own unique motive. The futility that all of the characters feel in the face of their destinies is heart-rending, and their efforts to change their fates, and the fates of their loved ones is valiant and littered with tragedy. \\n\\n\r\nWhen I finished watching this series, I cried. There is a sort of melancholy beauty that accompanies a bittersweet ending and this was no different. Some would call it a happy ending, some would not, but in each case the emotion behind the climax and the finale of the series was so utterly raw that you cannot help but grieve and rejoice at the same time.\\n\\n\r\nBecause when you finish watching, you realise that this wasn't an anime about the futility of the human race in the face of their destinies. This was about the hope, the courage, the unwavering love for another human, or the love for the entirety of humankind to FACE their destinies head on and sacrifice their being for someone to have a better fate. \\n\\n\r\nThis was a story about salvation through sacrifice.\\n\\n\r\nYou finish watching, and you think about the themes and subplots. You think about YOUR fate. You think about the sacrifices you would make, the extremes that you would go to to protect what you love. That's what makes this such a though provoking series, because really, as hard as it may be to imagine, all of these characters are like us (but hopefully without the tragic backstory). They just want normal lives, normal families, normal relationships and an unconditional love (unlike Sanetoshi, who was probably there to hate everything). I cried during the series out of laughter, but I also cried watching the gradual loss of innocence and hope that each character suffers. I cried because I grieved at the end, but I also cried because I sympathised with our heroes' final decision and I cried because I was overwhelmed by the lengths that they would go to to protect what they loved. In this series, you realise; sacrifice is the ultimate act of love.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoy the music while you watch the series for the first time, because believe me, at the end of it, just one track will have you blubbering on the train during rush hour. The mood is set beautifully by each track, be it humorous, tense, sad or pensive, and enhances the emotion during these scenes. I can't listen to either 'Ash-Grey Wednesday' or 'I Love You, Sons of Destiny' without getting a lump in my throat anymore.\\n\\n\r\nIf you're wavering about this anime, don't be put off by the weirdness. Don't be put off by the somewhat bizarre relationships that each character has with each other, and don't be put off by the erratic pace and initial characterisation. It's a beautiful series, it really is. Art-wise, music-wise and story-wise, its a masterpiece in all fields. Watch a story unfold before your eyes and watch as secrets are revealed to you.\\n\\n\r\nMost of all, don't be surprised when you finish, face damp with tears, that you begin to wonder about humanity, fate and salvation.\\n\\n\r\nAnd I assure you, five months down the line, you'll watch it again for the fourth time and catch all of the symbols and hints that you missed the last three runs, and your newly gained knowledge won't soften the grief any more.\\n\\n\r\nI applaud you Ikuhara. I applaud everyone on the production team. It truly was a work of art. \\n\\n\r\nIt truly was...'fabulous max'.\\n\\n",

            "content": "STORY\nHonestly, I feel that Ikuhara had many good ideas in terms of the plot. However, the end result is a clusterfuck of stories and themes mashed together. On their own, each arc stands up quite well, and a lot of ideas are well executed too. I liked the Child Broiler idea for one, ignoring the fact that it was a tad overused. \nThe plot is extremely convoluted and confusing. Unlike other anime that explain their convoluted storylines like, say, Kyousougiga, Mawaru Penguindrum does not make any attempt to do so. The viewer is left wondering what the fuck is going on as plot development afterplot development happens without any explanation whatsoever. In the last 8 or so episodes in the series, everything just goes completely apeshit, with characters suddenly changing personalities and sudden \"twists\". The viewer is not given any time to think about the twist or what the plot development means. Instead, the show simply shoves the ED in his face and tells him to deal with it and watch the next episode.\\n\\n\nDon't even get me started on how pants-on-head retarded the ending was...\\n\\n\nPRODUCTION QUALITY (ART+SOUND)\\n\\n\nThe art was very well done. Unlike some others I have no problem with the cardboard cutout background characters since a blurry or improportionate man would distract me from the show even more. The environments were all very colourful and varied. The vibrant use of colours was a major plus point for me too. Animation is smooth enough, and there aren't any noticeable drops in quality.\\n\\n\nAs for sound, voice acting was great. Nothing out of the ordinary though, but that's perfectly fine. I greatly enjoyed the soundtrack, although I got a bit bored of them playing the same tracks in the second half of the anime. The sound direction was very good too, with the tracks playing a prominent role in many scenes to create a bigger impact.\\n\\n\nProduction quality was definitely up to standard. However...\\n\\n\nCHARACTER\\n\\n\nI would suppose the characters in the show are just decent. I didn't find any of the characters particularly likeable or interesting. They're kind of like background characters. Himari takes on a minor role of the damsel in distress. Kanba is your typical angsty teenage badass.\\n\\n\nThe only characters I liked were Shoma and Ringo. I feel that both had a significant amount of character development by the end of the series. They also have very good chemistry, and I enjoyed their scenes together.\\n\\n\nENJOYMENT\\n\\n\nNo, I did not enjoy it at all. Except Ringo x Shoma.\\n\\n\nOVERALL\\n\\n\n\"Warning\", Spoilers of the ending following this. I recommend you just read it and spoil yourself so you spare yourself the pain of watching this.\\n\\n\nAll in all, the show had some great ideas, but failed to execute them well. It would have been way better if the director didn't have such big visions for the show and fall short completely. Perhaps he should have used his ideas for different anime series. There is also a stunning lack of attention to detail, which is something that continuously broke immersion for me and annoyed me immensely. The ending was just shit too, why the fuck did Shoma and Kanba die and be revived? And why the fuck was Himari's penguin walking with Kanba and Shoma at the end(lack of attention to detail, see)? \\n\\n\nMawaru Penguindrum, like the Kyousougiga TV series and Kyoukai no Kanata,  is a prime example of why every anime needs a solid plot, not just good production quality to be good. \\n\\n\nDo yourself a favour and take this out of your backlog.",

            "content": "Mawaru Penguindrum. What can I possibly say about it that hasn't already been said? Pretentious. Confusing. Beautiful. Terrible. A Masterpiece. Overrated. Genius. You could say anything of these things and you would be correct. But, in my eyes, Mawaru Penguindrum is an anime unlike any I have ever seen. It pushes the boundaries of the medium in a way that hasn't been done since the End of Evangelion movie.\r\nStory(9/10)- Penguindrum's story is one wrapped in what seems to be endless layers of symbolism. One can easily be overwhelmed by the sheer vastness of it. Everything from a single line of dialogue to an unusual cameraangle is there for a reason. It will probably take many years for this show to be fully deciphered, it goes to show us that A LOT of effort was put into this story. The reason why I hesitate to give story a perfect score is because of how hard it is to fully comprehend. I must admit, I almost dropped the show in the first few episodes because I had no idea what was going on. Undoubtedly, most of you reading this review probably did the same thing. But, if you are willing to stay for the ride, I guarantee  that you will be thankful for doing so. \\n\\n\r\nI cannot simply talk about the story, without talking about the themes Penguindrum covers. It ranges from Rape, Nihilism, Existential Longing,  and isolation. But the biggest theme here would have to be, \"Fate.\" What is fate? Does fate truly exist? The show starts off with narrator saying he hates fate. These themes are tackled in an unconventional manner, using slap-stick comedy and symbolism. The mood generally sways between both drama and comedy. Ultimately, the ending itself, I found it to be cathartic yet bittersweet. A saddening, yet fitting end to such an audacious show.\\n\\n\r\nArt(9/10)- The art in this show is great to say the least. The presentation is bombastic and erratic. All scenes in this show are breathtakingly beautiful and will capture your attention. There is a meticulous level of detail in every scene. This is something that should be appreciated.\\n\\n\r\nSound(9/10)- The soundtrack is music to my ears, no pun intended. It is bold, unique and different. It varies from pop tracks, to melancholic soundscapes. You would be hard pressed to find a soundtrack better than this.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter(9/10)- Penguindrum's cast is unique........to say the least. You won't be able to easily understand characters until later in the show. Still, the cast and antagonists are very well written. Their intentions aren't so cut n dry that you can understand them immediately. You will sometimes have to rewatch certain scenes, in order to fully grasp certain characters EX: Sanetoshi and Momoka.\\n\\n\r\nMawaru Penguindrum is probably one of the most mentally straining anime I have ever had the pleasure to watch. This is not a show for everyone as I mentioned earlier. It is a must see for those anime watchers who love having their minds stimulated. After watching this show, other shows that have been released seem mediocre compared to it. My final verdict is, a 9/10.",

            "content": "Mawaru Penguindrum is a zany, wacky, twisted, messed up jumble of an anime that is so absolutely insane, yet it surprisingly turns out to be an interesting and compelling story in the end.\r\nPenguindrum is the brainchild of Kunihiko Ikuhara, who also conceived Revolutionary Girl Utena over a decade earlier. Penguindrum bears many similarities to Utena: the repetition, the odd humor, the heavy handed symbolism, and the silly yet loveable characters are all here. Fans of Utena will definitely feel right at home with Penguindrum.\r\nThe story goes a little bit like this: Two brothers, Shouma and Kanba Takakura, have a sweet little sister, Himari, who isunfortunately dying from a terminal illness. On a trip to the aquarium, Himari collapses and dies. But she is oddly revived by the penguin hat that Shouma had bought her minutes before. The penguin hat\u2019s miracle does not come without a price though. After having their sister\u2019s body temporarily hijacked by the Princess of the Crystal in a flashy over the top transformation sequence, the brothers are informed that they must find the mysterious Penguin drum in order for their sister to keep the life she was so graciously given back. \\n\\n\r\nBut that only scratches the surface. Soon, the brothers get involved with shady organizations, a stalker schoolgirl, the homeroom teacher she\u2019s stalking, his nutty celebrity girlfriend, a cold rich girl barring their path, magic mumbo jumbo, and a mysterious man who holds power over Himari\u2019s life.\\n\\n\r\nThe diverse cast of characters is what really shines about the show. Aside from Himari, who scarcely seems like more than a plot device, equal development and care is given to a number of characters in this anime. They\u2019re all a little nutty, but they\u2019re also all unique individuals with their own goals, personalities, and beliefs. It\u2019s also impressive to note how the anime ties all the characters together. Not since Monster have I seen such a large cast of characters who seem like they\u2019d normally have nothing to do with each other tied together so intricately.\\n\\n\r\nThe two brothers, Shouma and Kanba are polar opposites and serve as each other\u2019s foils. It\u2019s also interesting to note how this plays into their roles in the family. Everything about Shouma screams maternal figure: He\u2019s kind, caring, level headed, rational, and even takes care of the cooking and housework. Kanba can be seen as the more typical masculine father figure. He is smooth, articulate, hot headed, popular with the ladies, and also the sole breadwinner of the house. \\n\\n\r\nBoth love Himari dearly and want to save her, but they have drastically different methods of doing so that fit almost too perfectly with their personalities. It\u2019s almost scary seeing Kanba\u2019s apathy for the world and even his own body swell up as the story proceeds, blinded completely by his desire to save Himari. \\n\\n\r\nWe also have Ringo Oginome, a high school girl who is as obsessed with curry as she is with Keiju Tabuki. A big chunk of the first part of the anime is dedicated to her stalkerish obsession with Tabuki and her plan to win his heart, as told by a mysterious diary she holds. Her sworn enemy and rival for Tabuki\u2019s affection is a pretty actress named Yuri Tokikago. Unbeknownst to Ringo, this woman has a far more sinister side than her well groomed fa\u00e7ade lets on, as well as a hidden connection to the both Tabuki and Ringo\u2019s pasts. \\n\\n\r\nMasako Natsume is another character whose brother also has an unknown illness, but is being kept alive by another penguin hat. She seeks out the penguin drum as well, interfering with the brother\u2019s attempts to get it. All these characters are revealed to be connected to each other in some way, as well as to the main villain Sanetoshi and Ringo\u2019s deceased older sister Momoka. \\n\\n\r\nSurprisingly, three small penguins are what really steal the show. These little buggers are hilarious; doing the most insane things even while the main characters are having a serious conversation. Whether it\u2019s reading dirty magazines, putting panties over their head, trying on blond wigs, or spraying errant cockroaches, these hilarious little guys are always up to something. It\u2019s also interesting to note that the 3 penguins\u2019 actions, appearance, and mannerisms closely resemble the three Takakura siblings. The fourth penguin, belonging to Masako, is the same. Some may find them distracting as they act out in scenes that are supposed to be serious. And you\u2019d be right to assume that they are there just for the cute factor. But they add a bit of charm and humor to the story. It\u2019s hard to imagine the anime without them. \\n\\n\r\nNow the story itself can be a bit of a confusing mess until the very end when mostly everything is resolved and cleared up. It keeps you on your toes and guessing until the very end, slowly unveiling one twist after another without being too ridiculous. \\n\\n\r\nThe first part of the anime seems more like a wacky slice-of-life, while the second part heavily leans toward the metaphysical and supernatural. That of course means the second part of the anime can be quite difficult to grasp at times. And that right there is one big problem with the story: it can be incredibly pretentious at times. Similar to Utena, some of the symbolism is very clever, while some of it just seems like it was thrown in there just because, making some concepts and plot elements needlessly complicated and confusing. The dialogue can be a little too much as well, with its constant rambling about fate, fate, fate. Like the symbolism, sometimes it\u2019s clever, other times it just sounds pretentious. \\n\\n\r\nAs an anime heavy in symbolism, it\u2019s important for the visuals to be sufficiently up to snuff. And it definitely does not disappoint. The animation is high quality, colorful, flashy, and smooth. The soundtrack is phenomenal, containing a plethora of great tracks for any given situation. The character designs are all beautiful and unique. No two characters look anything alike. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, Penguindrum is an amazing anime that was clearly made with a lot of care and heart. It\u2019s got almost everything, flashy visuals, amazing characters, a silly yet enjoyable story, and a great soundtrack. It\u2019s understandable that some will be turned off by its confusing story and heavy symbolism at first, but sticking with the anime to the end is well worth it. Watching it again is well worth it; you\u2019ll see all kinds of things you may have missed the first time. \\n\\n\r\nThis crazy, mysterious, psychological rollercoaster is one hell of a ride, and once you get on you won\u2019t want to get off. \\n",

            "content": "**SPOILER FREE REVIEW**\r\n\u201cWhat is Mawaru Penguindrum?\u201c If ever there was a more loaded question in the realm of anime, I\u2019m not sure I\u2019ve heard of it, because this show is an absolute enigma. Adequately reviewing this show is a daunting task for reasons that will soon be clear, but let\u2019s give it a shot: First of all, what is this show? Well, it\u2019s a lot of things. A moving story about the importance of love. A detailed commentary on the way society treats children. A unique perspective on mental health issues. An insightful interpretation about the concepts of fate and destiny. Etcetera etcetera etcetera. Whilethe vast majority of anime are driven by their plot or by their characters, Penguindrum is instead driven by its themes, style, and the artistic messages that lurk in the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th layers of the show. It is extremely complex and jam-packed with more symbolism, motifs, and allusions than you can shake a stick at, but it\u2019s simultaneously intriguing and investing enough that you could miss all of them and still enjoy the show. For that reason, Penguindrum is on the remarkably short list of shows that manage to have vast and flawlessly executed themes while simultaneously managing to have an engaging story and fleshed out characters. It\u2019s one of my all time favorite shows and, as far as I\u2019m concerned, a masterpiece.\\n\\n\r\nSynopsis: Twins Kanba and Shouma Takakura lost their parents long ago, and now live alone with their younger sister Himari. They lead relatively normal lives until Himari is diagnosed with a terminal illness that could cause her to drop dead at any moment. Distraught, the twins attempt to make the best of the time they have left with their beloved sister, until she finally collapses during a family trip to the aquarium. Himari dies. However, when the souvenir penguin hat that Shouma bought for her finds its way onto her head, she miraculously comes back to life with her illness cured. The only condition to keep her alive? Find the Penguindrum.\\n\\n\r\nThe plot of Penguindrum has always been intriguing to me because, in theory, it should be a total disaster. You\u2019ve got this unbelievably absurd concept of a penguin hat that grants immortality, an evil mastermind who controls your destiny with the help of two of his rabbit sidekicks, and comedic relief penguins who serve no immediately apparent purpose, yet you\u2019re going to try to tell a heart-wrenching story of love and betrayal that delves deep into philosophy, ethics, and social commentary? I mean, does that sound for a second like it\u2019s going to even remotely work? In any other circumstance, it probably wouldn\u2019t have. Luckily, this anime was directed by Kunihiko Ikuhara, who is also known for Revolutionary Girl Utena and, more recently, Yuri Kuma Arashi. Ikuhara, if I may be so bias for a second, is a complete and total artistic genius. I\u2019ve said before that his style is not for everyone; the repetition of sequences, the abstract environments, the use of vibrant color dissonance, etc. It all serves to provide this show with a remarkable artistic flair that will dazzle you and ensure that there is never a dull moment.\\n\\n\r\nGetting back to the plot, the reason that Ikuhara is so widely praised is for his ability to convey information without words; to connect the events of the show to the real world and make the viewer question what the meaning of it all is. Of course, the storyline of Penguindrum can be taken at face value by all means. It is complete with exciting plot twists, intense moments, and general excitement. The thing is, there are LOTS of anime that can give you those things. However, there are virtually NO anime who can give you those things on top of the sheer depth and artistic passion that went towards conveying a refined, emotional message to the viewers. This serves to make the humble story of the Takakura family all the more memorable, as it can only be described as a rollercoaster of emotions. Penguindrum will make you feel every emotion that you have over its duration, and I think that is saying something.\\n\\n\r\nThe character cast of Penguindrum adheres to the writing technique known as \u201cThe Mystery Box\u201d. For those unaware, this is when the characters are presented to the audience, but the show has no intention of letting you get to know them at first. No real backstory is given; all you know about them is what you see. Then, slowly and steadily, you begin the learn more and more about them. Their pasts. Their motivations. And finally, their deepest darkest secrets. Every time you think you know everything there is to know about the large cast of Penguindrum, wham! Another twist! This is a remarkably impressive accomplishment because it is only through the viewers\u2019 sheer exasperation after their perceptions of the characters get turned on their heads again and again and again do they begin to realize just how much depth that all of them have. Note the emphasis on the word \u201call\u201d, because no character in Penguindrum is left behind. All of them, no matter how seemingly minor, are fleshed out and manage to feel real. The icing on the cake is that this anime manages to accomplish all of this without ever feeling contrived; these are not twists \u201cjust of the sake of twists\u201d. They are all thematically coherent and well thought out. For that reason, I can\u2019t see anything to complain about with this cast. They are likable, relatable, well written, dynamic, and they have depth. What more could you possibly want?\\n\\n\r\nDiscussing the presentation aspects of an Ikuhara anime is never easy simply because of how unique and simultaneously profound it manages to be. As I mentioned earlier, Ikuhara is a master of visual storytelling. He frequently conveys more information with animation and shot composition than he does with dialogue/monologue, and that\u2019s something you just don\u2019t see often. I won\u2019t even try to describe the myriad of techniques used in this anime, because I don\u2019t think I could do it well without writing a separate essay. Speaking purely in terms of aesthetic appeal, the art style of Peguindrum is extremely pretty. The colors are immensely bright and everything pops right off the screen. The animation itself is also very fluid, and even memorizing at times. In short, it\u2019s one of the most visually impressive anime I\u2019ve ever seen for reasons that are hard to describe without demonstrating specific examples. As for the sound design, I struggle to find legitimate complaints yet again. The OPs and EDs are both unique and worthy of listening to in your spare time. I can\u2019t tell you how long I had OP 1, \u201cNornir\u201d, on repeat when I first finished this show. What really makes the OST work is the directing; Penguindrum\u2019s mood and tone fluctuate a lot, and the soundtrack never fails to provide the proper accompaniment. Songs always end right when they need to and begin right when they need to. By the way, the voice acting is spot-on. There\u2019s not a single VA who didn\u2019t totally nail the character they are attached to. Penguindrum\u2019s story and themes may be its main talking point, but by no means whatsoever does the presentation lag behind; it is just as superb as the rest of the show.\\n\\n\r\nWhat more is there to say about Mawaru Penguindrum? Well, a lot actually. I could quite literally gush over this show all day; it has turned me into a hopeless Ikuhara fanboy. However, fanboying aside, I think this show is an absolute must watch. Not everyone is into the whole symbolism thing, and I get that, but it\u2019s an enjoyable show even without paying mind to the themes. For people who ARE into critical analysis, this is your dream come true. Penguindrum is a show that means a lot to me and has genuinely made me reassess several of my worldviews. The effort, passion, and sheer emotion poured into this anime is palpable, and rivaled only (in my opinion) by Neon Genesis Evangelion in terms of how well you can feel the creator\u2019s pain. It is one of my absolute favorites and it is one of the few anime that I can say without hesitation is indeed a masterpiece.",

            "content": "This is my first review on MAL and normally, I wouldn't be too interested in writing reviews, because honestly, I'm not very good at it, but in the case of Mawaru Penguindrum, it was inevitable.\r\nI felt like if I did not write what I'm feeling after watching this anime, then something inside my mind will definitely break...\r\nSo here I go.\r\nI found out about the famous ''mawaru penguindrum'', when I overheard two girls in my college talking about how mindblowingly amazing it is. Perhaps , it was then, that i made a mental note to maybe check it out.\r\nWhen I came home that day, Isearched it up: \\n\r\n\"Best anime ever\"\\n\r\n\"I can't believe something as good as this anime exists\"\\n\r\n\"Amazing\"\\n\r\n\"10/10\"\\n\\n\r\nI was super excited. I couldn't wait to watch it.\\n\r\nI waited until my exams were over and cleaned my room and brought lots of popcorn and turned off the lights and opened my laptop and put on the first episode. \\n\\n\r\n23 and a half minutes later, I was a little confused. \\n\\n\r\nOHH! this must be like those anime, you know...the ones that start out fairly weird but get super interesting a few episodes later. \\n\r\nI continued watching.\\n\\n\r\nExactly 144.5 minutes and 6 episodes later, I was very, very confused. \\n\r\nFrustrated, I googled: \"Is mawaru penguidrum really worth watching?\" \\n\\n\r\n\"ITS A MUST WATCH\"\\n\r\n\"You cant miss it\"\\n\r\n\"I strongly, strongly recommend it\"\\n\\n\r\nAre the answers I got. You see, I'm a simple woman. I value the opinions of my fellow anime fans. They have never let me down. 3 to 4 MAL reviews alone, guide me enough about the worth of an anime and 99 out of 100 times, I agree with majority, if not all, of the reviews.\\n\r\nBut this wasn't the case with Mawaru Penguindrum. \\n\\n\r\nI decided to watch it till the end. \\n\\n\r\n576.5 minutes and 24 episodes later, I sat there fuming, with a burning ache in my head. \\n\r\nIt felt like I had wasted a quarter of my life and I felt incredibly stupid for still not being able to find a single thing that was \"mindblowingly amazing\" (or even remotely interesting) about this anime that I had just finished watching. \\n\\n\r\nI still go to blogs and MAL reviews sometimes, to find some explanation for this anime...an explanation that I missed, yet I always thought I was that one person that always searched for a meaning in everything I watched or read, which is one reason I like anime, because I believe that it is a medium of entertainment that is capable of conveying deeper meanings to seemingly shallower things, because everything can be visually explained.\\n\\n\r\nAt some points, I saw a bit of potential in this anime. Some scenes were nicely portrayed, the BGM was fitting. It even had a bit of nice comedy. The character designs were not bad. It could have been a nice romantic comedy or a heart warming story about two brothers trying to save their ill sister. Even earned some points from a psychological aspect (the stalker business and child boilers and terrorist organizations)...but it took all of its nice potential and smashed it together into a wannabe deep complex drama that was really just meaningless. \\n\\n\r\nEverywhere I looked, they talked about some deep ''symbolism'', some ''hidden meanings\", a \"relation with art/history/religion/etc..\". \\n\r\nAt first it frustrated me and annoyed me, but now I just laugh. \\n\\n\r\nDespite the fact that it was a ridiculous anime, that poorly conveyed/did not convey at all whatever hidden meaning it was supposed to carry to an average viewer, and that it was only meant to confuse people, and that it tried WAYY TOO HARD to become a psychologically thrilling masterpiece and for that it even tried to steal ideas and symbolism used to in many pieces of literature (such as night on the galactic railroad), it FAILED MISERABLY. And people like me, who were disappointed to see the anime they had such high hopes for fail so badly, forcibly tried to put it on a pedestal. These are the same  people who gave excellent reviews and ratings to the most troll anime of 2016, \"Erased\" , that won everybody's hearts at the first episode but failed miserably by the last, but people couldn't deal with it so they refused to even acknowledge its failure...\\n\\n\r\nDespite all that, I have taken a strange liking to Mawaru Penguindrum. It is my wonderland. My crazy world.A haywire fantasy. Because whenever I search it up, or hear about it, its like reading or hearing about somethingremarkable, something that only exists, but explodes and sparkles and flashes and shimmers...but is invisible to me.\\n\\n\r\nBut I did learn that it is possible to attach a meaning to anything if you try hard enough. \\n\\n\r\nTLDR;\\n\r\nI do not recommend this anime to anyone. \\n\r\nIf you're really such a fan of deep symbolism and hidden meanings, then I suggest you invest yourself in anime that successfully delivers at least SOME of it when you watch it. So I'd say go watch ghost in the shell, or perhaps even Angel's egg (yes, even that does a wonderful job with symbolism) and there's plenty more. You'll love those. \\n\\n\r\nCheers.",

            "content": "Mawaru Penguindrum to me is a show that had lots of potential, but ultimately fell flat towards the end, due to a convoluted plot and wonky character development. Let me tell you why (I'll try to keep it as spoiler-free as possible):\r\nThe Story:\r\nThe show starts with our main characters in a state not that unusual in anime: orphaned teens living on their own, doing alright. The little sister is sickly, but is miraculously saved by a hat. While being possessed by the hat, she tells her two brothers that they must find the \"Penguindrum\", and that's our set-up. \r\nThe story follows our heroes as theytry their best to find this Penguindrum and with it, solve all their problems. The story is all over the place in the beginning, with some seemingly random events and flashbacks here and there. Towards the end it becomes too much. Too many themes and events are introduced to the viewers and it all felt quite silly in the end. \\n\\n\r\nThe Art:\\n\r\nNot much to say here, to be honest. The art is nice, as it usually is nowadays. Pretty generic character design as well.\\n\\n\r\nSound: \\n\r\nGreat voice actors and a good soundtrack makes this the best part of the series. Short of a 10, but at random times the music would not fit the scenes.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nOh man, the characters. Some of them are pretty generic, like the na\u00efve girl (Ringo) and genuinely good guy (Shoma). Most characters have some sort of twist though. The thing that bothers me sometimes with anime is that the characters have vastly different values and interests than me, and such is the case here. I simply can't put myself in their shoes and understand their decisions, because many of them are as if pulled from thin air to make the plot work. \\n\\n\r\nOne thing that especially baffled me is this: one character consistently is in the way or ruining the events and lives of the other characters, but nobody seems to mind. It is just accepted without much doubt and the bad events it causes are never mentioned.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nI gave it a pretty low score, but I would be lying if I said that I haven't enjoyed Mawaru Penguindrum. The sad part is though, that I spent more time being infuriated with some of the characters and some very odd plot turns. There was more confusion and sadness then pure enjoyment for me, which is a shame.\\n\\n\r\nI'll save the worst for last. \"Fate.\" The word is prominent in the series and everything is circling around it. Fate is story-writer lingo for \"this doesn't really make sense, but here's a word to make it better\" to me, and having a series revolve around the shallow premise of \"what ever happens, it's fate,\" is unacceptable to me, and it is the biggest reason I didn't enjoy most of my time with Mawaru Penguindrum. \\n\\n\r\nThe Verdict:\\n\r\nLike I said, i felt like Mawaru Penguindrum had a lot of potential. It unfortunately throws that away and the end result is not terrible, but not that good either. Ultimately there is more good than bad and I'll weigh it in at a 6/10.\\n\\n\r\nDespite the bad grade, I still think that this is an interesting series that might fit you well. If you consider yourself a believer in \"Fate\", this might be right up your alley. The series is quite quirky and fun at times and usually is quite light in atmosphere. I recommend you check it out if you find the plot interesting, and I hope you enjoy it more than I did.\\n\\n\r\nPost-review:\\n\r\nHi ya'll. It's been quite a while since I wrote a review, so I tried to keep it short and to the point. If you didn't like the interview, I'd love to know why. Hit me up with a PM or post a comment on my profile with any criticism. Also, if you'd like to know more about the series, I'll try my best to answer. Cheers.",

            "content": "The first time I saw this anime I was expecting some easy-going plot with magical stuff all about and whatsoever, as the animation, art and mascots made it seem like it was so. However, I was wrong, and both in a good and bad way.\r\nI'll give much credit where credit is due; I thought there was an interesting character development; I think Ringo's backstory was splendidly well done. She may seem annoying, creepy (what with every single thing she did and how far she went), but the reasons to how she behaves are acceptable (in the sense that one can be satisfied, and it answersquestions quite well). Nevertheless, there are way too many other characters with a lack of an intriguing backstory. Yes, they do have dramatic and drastic story, but they are bland and too similar to the \"fate is everything\" concept that is already attached to Ringo. They also behave in such an immature and unthoughtful way that it is so easy to get pissed off at characters, even if you have a bias. I did have a bias, don't get me wrong, but it was horrible to see that a character who seemed so interesting and mysterious get a lousy past with lousy raison d'\u00eatre's. Honestly, I find it anti-climatic.\\n\\n\r\nThe storyline is not flawless. It may seem so because it is complex, with many links between the various characters who seem so out of the blue. Yet, the complexity goes overboard. It's that feeling you get when you've too much of something that the situation becomes as if you didn't have enough of it. Think of a parabola, after you've reached the top, the effectiveness starts going back down. The links between the characters are random twists, in my opinion, that were added in as if just to make it more complex on purpose, and I personally think that was not really needed and it ruined the plot, if anything. The thing is, if you want good complex plot, you need good complex material. \\n\\n\r\nThe anime started off light-hearted even though it was a rather serious issue going around (Himari dying etc). It even started to go nowhere with Ringo's arc, and only came around at some later point. The comeback was interesting for a little while and then it fell into the chain of twists. I thought the addition of mascots was strange. Nothing against it, but it doesn't add to anything. I love the penguins, though. \\n\\n\r\nI disliked this series mainly because of personal reasons, I will admit that. I do tend to stay away from disturbing series with characters who've gone beyond perverse with no character development. Here I am getting character development, but it seems still too banal to me, save for Ringo's case. Yet, even for her case, she develops to a certain point, and stays at the same line for a while. \\n\r\nI also dislike that it is too focused on \"fate\" even though it is the main theme and is bound to be that way. I thought they were all too obsessed about it, and a variety of non-obsessed characters would have been a good idea.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, because of the somewhat uniqueness it has that I cannot deny, I'd say this anime would still pass as a fairly okay anime. \\n\\n",

            "content": "Firstly, let's get it out of the way. Mawaru Penguindrum is a show which is by no means an easy watch. It is not a simple show with a linear plotline, nor is it one that is willing to spoonfeed every single piece of information to its audience. Instead, it is a highly cryptic show that prides itself on its ability to pile mystery upon mystery onto the show, leave the audience thoroughly confused by blending reality and metaphorical imagery, and leave much of its message to personal interpretation. \r\nIf you are one who doesn't enjoy thinking too deeply into a show, it would bebest for you to avoid this one. Although there are many aspects which can still be enjoyed even if you choose not to look at the show beyond a superficial level, such as the excellently done humor and its slick sense of style, you would be missing out on the many small things that make this show special. It is filled with tons of literary devices, ranging from the constant usage of imagery and symbols to allusions to obscure works. It requires some work to fully get the show, and not taking the effort to do so will often leave you confused or even frustrated at your inability to grasp just what is going on.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, if you are one that finds fun in figuring out what each of these little things mean, Penguindrum is the perfect show for you - it is easily one of the richest shows that the medium has to offer, exploring a wide range of themes such as fate, family, love and revenge, packing plenty of content within its short run within 24 episodes. One of the interesting things about the show is that things are often not made fully clear - and how each person interprets it can be completely different. It truly is up to you to make your own view of the show and its messages, so I won't go too much into that, as each individual will experience the range of events differently.\\n\\n\r\nDespite having some of the cutest and adorable penguins in the show, it must be warned that this show is a very dark one. This is a show wherein the characters are very, very screwed up. A common thread around them is the theme of shitty parents - this show contains some of the most worthless and shittiest parents I have personally seen in most works. The development here is extremely well-done, managing to create a excellent balance of emotions within the viewer. We will often feel disgusted or creeped out at the many sick and demented actions the characters take, yet we will manage to understand why they might want to go to such lengths. It manages to paint them in a pitiable light whilst not downplaying the fact that yes, these people are messed up and are doing some horrible things. That aspect is without a doubt my favorite aspect of the show, managing to humanize horrible humans and make us care for them.\\n\\n\r\nThat is not to say that it isn't flawed. There are certain characters which may do a complete 180 and completely shift their personalities or motivations to fit the plot. Whilst some might argue that these instances are well foreshadowed and thus acceptable, it is in my opinion that some instances are poorly done. I would say that this doesn't happen too often within the show, but it does sometime feel that the show is creating a twist for the sake of creating one. Thankfully, as mentioned, this happens rather rarely, and the overall quality of the characterization is excellent.\\n\\n\r\nPlot wise, this is undoubtedly a very intriguing show. What it excels best at is creating that sense of mystery - you never know what the hell is going on, yet are given enough hints throughout the show, many of which come full circle at the end of the series. It can be said that this show demands a rewatch to fully understand all the little things packed into it, and even then, it can be very difficult to understand what truly is going on. Things are very often left unexplained, and several plot threads are left hanging. Whilst some might feel that this is a good thing as it leaves more to interpretation, I personally find it a little too much, as many things make very little sense, and I am sure that there are many gaping holes throughout the plot which are never fully resolved.\\n\\n\r\nThe production values on the show are excellent, and there is nothing to complain about. The art style is gorgeous, and it's clear that plenty of effort was put into the art and animation, making it one of the more beautiful shows of recent years. It also boasts an excellent soundtrack that is used excellently, often bolstering the effects of many scenes. There are close to zero complains regarding the technical aspects of the series.\\n\\n\r\nIn the end, how you would judge the show ultimately relies on how much effort you are willing to put in the show, and how far you can let little flaws slide. It is one which I enjoyed, but didn't manage to love as I felt that things were often a little too cryptic. Everyone's response to penguindrum will be very different, but what is undeniable is the fact that it is a truly unique and daring show, one which dares to challenge the mediocrity of the industry, and mostly succeeds in doing so, delivering an engaging and thought-provoking product.",

            "content": "I've seen many people compare this anime to a novel or another work of literary art. In a sense, they are correct. I found this anime to be very reminiscent of some of the books my english class had assigned in high school: well-written, full of symbolism and poetic imagery, but not engaging/captivating.\r\nStory - My biggest issue with this show is the story. The basic plot (which you can read in the above synopsis) seems simple enough. However, there are many side stories, background stories, and things that are hinted at that are never resolved, explored, nor explained. Many times an episode would end witha very interesting turn of events, only to have the next episode hand-wave it away and pretend that nothing had happened, in favor of focusing on the \"main story\".\\n\\n\r\nThe story in general felt unfocused, like several different vignettes were hastily strung together chronologically, and then some details were added after-the-fact to create some vague impression of continuity. \\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters - As far as characters go, none were very memorable; with the exception of the doctor who replied to everything with \"how overwhelming\". He was great. \\n\\n\r\nThe problem with this show is that you learn over the course of it that the character relationships between everyone are in fact very complicated, so complicated that it becomes difficult to keep track of each character's motivation and backstory. \\n\\n\r\nSound - \\n\r\nI enjoyed the soundtrack throughout the show. The opening themes are by far the most memorable parts of the show, and the second one is especially well-written. The original Japanese voice acting is standard quality Japanese voice acting. Moreover, I would not recommend the dub. Some of the performances do not do the characters justice, and feel awkward to hear. However, if you're really inclined on not reading subtitles, then the dub is acceptable and you shouldn't run into too much trouble.\\n\\n\r\nArt - The art is arguably the most interesting part of this show. There are many stylistic choices which make the scenes very interesting to watch from an outside perspective.  Additionally, artistic themes are present throughout the show, all hinting at some deeper meaning and adding to the atmosphere of the show.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - Throughout the series, I was never thoroughly interested nor invested in the story. Even in the final few episodes I found myself wanting to put the show on hold because I wasn't very concerned as to what would happen. However, this isn't to say I was bored the whole time. There were some very memorable scenes and I did enjoy both the symbolism and the philosophical dialogue that was scattered throughout the show.\\n\\n\r\nSummary - It's tough to summarize an anime like this. The writing and ideas had such potential, but the execution was lacking. The show is unique in that it is both not compelling and yet leaves something to be desired. Unless you really enjoy symbolism and don't mind it when plot lines go completely unaddressed, watching this will only disappoint you.",

            "content": "Mawaru Penguindrum is an anime unafraid to break conventional rules. Its story is lucrative and all over the place, and is hilarious yet profound. It has an extensive use of symbolism to convey its morals and message, similar to Kunihiko Ikuhara\u2019s other piece, Revolutionary Girl Utena. It has a nice set of characters each with their own quirks that make them interesting and diverse. The animation is well-done and the soundtrack is stunning. But most importantly, it has irresistibly adorable penguins that you just can\u2019t help but feel like hugging. Such qualities should make Penguindrum an outstanding anime. Unfortunately, various problems, such as its abuseof drama and its messy form of narrative, plague the anime and bring it down from what it could have been.\\n\\n\r\nImmediately in the first episode, we are faced with a serious issue: the world is not fair. The issues of the world are incredibly pressing and parallel very well to serious issues in the real world. Take, for example, the relatively recent shootings in Newtown, Connecticut. What did the children do to deserve such a tragic fate? Why did this happen to the poor innocent children? If God is omnipotent and infinitely generous, how could he let such a fate take place? There is no doubt that these questions went through the victim\u2019s parents heads after the incident. Shouma and Kanba Takakura are faced with the same questions when their little sister, Himari, a kind, sweet girl dies an untimely death from her terminal disease. The tragedy of fate is explored throughout Mawaru Penguindrum as the two brothers try desperately try to save Himari from her inevitable death written by destiny and by God.\\n\\n\r\nThough it may seem that this is a \u201cweighty\u201d anime, Penguindrum actually has many comedic and lighthearted moments, mostly in the first part of the anime. This bring us to an important point- The anime is, to many people, divided into two parts. The first half of the anime is something more familiar \u2013 it\u2019s like a crazy slice-of-life romcom almost. Many people drop it in the beginning, but it should be noted that Penguindrum is not what it initially seems like. The second half takes a more psychological take, and its use of symbolism drastically increases. It also becomes more supernatural and magic becomes ever more prevalent. The introduction of magic as well as other elements make the second part much more convoluted and messy, leaving viewers often wondering \u201cwhat is going on?\u201d Multiple events start happening at once and at the same time we have flashbacks throughout each episode, making episodes go all over the place.\\n\\n\r\nMany people say that Penguindrum\u2019s story is \u201cweird,\u201d which is a legitimate complaint. The anime starts with two boys, Shouma and Kanba, losing their sister to an inevitably fatal illness. However, a magical penguin hat reincarnates her but will only keep her alive if Shouma and Kanba find the \u201cpenguindrum,\u201d which we don\u2019t know the exact information about. The first person they meet is a highschool girl that stalks a teacher in hopes of having a romantic relationship with him and carries around a diary that tells the future, which is suspected to be the Penguindrum. Sound strange? Well, it only gets more radical from there. They later meet the teacher\u2019s famous, Yuri wife named yuri, a girl with a gun that shoots memory-wiping balls, and a pink haired, ghost doctor who uses magic to try and destroy the world. However, the different feel of Mawaru Penguindrum is also highly refreshing. It\u2019s safe to say that Mawaru Penguindrum is unique and is not very similar to any one anime, making it a nice break from run-of-the-mill series. Its daringly eccentric story creates a fun and new experience. Its production is also very well done, making the story all the more captivating. The brutality of fate, the yearning of someone\u2019s love, the pain of loneliness, among other things are explored through the anime.\\n\\n\r\nWhat made Penguindrum awesome for me was its astonishing use of symbolism throughout the anime. Many symbols were thought-provoking and cleverly done, a real treat to someone who ponders on them. Some carry with them strong messages and morals of the story, making symbols a large component of the anime. Hell, Penguindrum itself is one grand, magnificent symbol. However, not all symbols were so spectacular. Some of them were one dimensional and had little thought behind them. Many symbols are open to interpretation just like a poem, so you take your own meaning out of each one. There isn\u2019t a universal meaning for some symbols and you figure out your own, though some are flatly explained. Because of this subjective judgment for symbols, I\u2019ll refrain from saying which ones are good or not, and let you pick your own favorites.\\n\\n\r\nProbably one of the biggest problems I have with Penguindrum is its use of drama. A prime example of this is its use of death scenes. Death scenes are repeated over and over to a point they are meaningless and don\u2019t deliver nearly the same effect as the first time (like medicine, to those who have watched it already). *spoiler (though not a big one): Himari dies so many times throughout the anime, and always comes back after a little mourning. When she is finally dead for good, or as we think, we have the crying scenes, the \u201cfate is cruel\u201d monologue, and are left feeling awfully depressed when the episode ends. Then the next episode, she\u2019s alive again like nothing ever happened. A few episodes later, you\u2019ll forget it ever happened. Death is only used as a dramatic component for sadness, but has little real meaning. The triteness of death is just one of the numerous examples of abuse of drama. Another example is meaningless and even misleading suspense. For example, many episodes end or scenes are cut with the main character in the face of danger, leaving us with suspense and excitement. This suspense turns out to be meaningless as the danger actually never existed. The anime deceives the viewers making them feel excited and scared for what is about to happen, only to say that it was just kidding soon after.\\n\\n\r\nAnother major problem I have with Penguindrum is its use of magic, especially in the second half of the anime. For an anime trying to depict the brutality of reality, the unfairness of life, and the powerlessness against fate, it\u2019s not apt that the anime uses magic mumbo-jumbo. Now, the problem isn\u2019t the existence of magic in the anime, but rather its use- it is used as a solution to real problems. Fate is brutal and written in stone\u2026 unless you have a magic hat of course. Then you can solve all your solutions by just resetting fate. The implementation of magic puts a strain on Penguindrum\u2019s overall message, and makes the second part even messier.\\n\\n\r\nBut by far the greatest issue of Penguindrum is how crazy its narrative gets in the second half. Many things starts to happen at all once on top of frequent flashbacks to events in the past, leading to large confusion. The direction the anime takes is also very obscure and random at times. It attempts to do many things at once, and unfortunately does not succeed.\\n\\n\r\nPenguindrum has a nice, diverse set of characters that have their fair share of strengths and weaknesses. In the Takakura family, we have 3 of the main characters, Kanba, Shouma, and Himari. Their parents have been missing for a while, so the siblings actually take different family roles. Kanba is the masculine head of the family, he\u2019s cold and often resorting to dirty tactics to save Himari, who he dearly cares about. Shouma is the more maternal part of the family, he\u2019s kind and thoughtful, and even cleans and cooks. The two highly contrast each other, and this contrast is further apparent as the anime goes on as their differences go to the point that they part ways as they take their own path to save Himari. The relationship between all 3 family members of the family is beautifully developed and portrayed. The side characters are for the most part interesting and each develop throughout the series. It should also be noted that there are adorable blue penguins that are representations of these three characters.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, this part of Penguindrum is not all sunshine either. Though the characters do develop over time, the development is highly inconsistent and changes to suit the story. This is especially true in the side characters, whos motivations are enigmatic and always changing. Many characters are also forgotten about after their major part in the story, and end up having little impact on the outcome. A prime example of this is Ringo, one of the 4 main characters. The first part of the anime focuses on her quest, known as \u201cProject M,\u201d but soon after, she quickly forgotten. She appears again at many times after this, but by then is little more than a bystander and no longer plays such a significant role.  The backstories for the characters are also sadly all too similar, kind of like the universal \u201cdaddy problems\u201d in Neon Genesis Evangelion. They all are suffering similar situations (which, for the sake of no spoilers, will not be explained) and there isn\u2019t much variety.  And by the end of the anime, we still only know this much. Though similar and unknown backgrounds isn\u2019t a major problem, it still is somewhat disappointing.\\n\\n\r\nAnother fault of the characters is the lack of individual development. Though the relationships between the characters is strong, development on a person basis is weak and highly inconsistent. This is especially prominent in the side characters, but for the sake of brevity,let's just focus on the main characters. We have Kanba, the masculine head of the family. He develops little until the second half, where he takes a radical turn into evil and doing shady business. This transformation made little sense, and was merely to conveniently match with the plot. Shouma doesn't develop much if at all throughout the whole series.  Himari is also not a very strong character, as she is, in my opinion, little more than a plot device. She doesn\u2019t develop much throughout the anime, and though she does have things like regret from the past, nothing really comes out of it.One side character with the most flagrant development that I'd like to mention is Dr. Sanetoshi.  We know little about him except he supposedly died 10 years ago, his ghost lurks around and plans to destroy the world with magic. \\n\\n\r\nNow let\u2019s get to one of the brighter parts of the anime: its art. The animation is brilliantly colorful, and the image is clear and sharp. At times, especially later on, the art adds a more surreal effect fitting for the anime. Character designs are also very well done, and few characters look completely identical. The background characters are unmoving figures similar to those in bathroom signs. The soundtrack is also top-notch and beautiful, and there is a plethora of very well-done openings and endings, my favorite of which is \u201cDear Future.\u201dThe OST is just as spectacular, and fits into scenes seamlessly and perfectly.\\n\\n\r\n With the flaws in mind, Penguindrum's refreshing uniqueness alone does not label it as an outstanding anime. Criticism aside though, I enjoyed almost every minute of Penguindrum, and despite its flaws, it was very enjoyable. Yeah, Penguindrum was a crazy, convoluted, wild ride, but in the end it definitely worth the experience.",

            "content": "Overview:\r\nAs a longtime anime fan who has been watching anime since the 1990s, I divide anime into 3 categories of \"uniqueness\" , based on what I consider to be the composite average of all anime and how far a title is from that average core. First let us picture the most generic, average anime in existence to serve as the Sun of our Solar System. How about Naruto or Bleach? Either would be a good candidate as the most average an anime could possibly be. The first category are \"inner planets\" anime that are fairly close to the Sun.  These are your generic animelike battle shonen, ecchi harem, and slice of life. Next, you have the \"outer planets\" that are farther from the Sun, but not TOO far and still visible on a clear night like Jupiter and Saturn were for the ancient Greeks. These are the slightly unusual anime like Axis Powers Hetalia, Detroit Metal City, or Psycho Pass. Finally, you have the Trans-Neptunian Objects that lie on the very edge of the Solar System. These are the anime that are WAY far away from the average \"Sun\". Examples of these would be Kuchuu Buranko, Ergo Proxy, or Spice and Wolf. These don't HAVE to be surrealist, artistic anime as Spice and Wolf proves, but rather an anime that isn't like anything else and feels completely unique in the universe of anime. With a title like \"Penguindrum\", it shouldn't be a huge surprise that this is one of the Trans Neptunian anime. In other words, prepare for a bizarre and unique experience!\\n\\n\r\nStory: Spoiler Free! I promise!\\n\\n\r\nThe plot of Penguindrum is that 2 brothers named Kanba and Shoma are highly concerned about their critically ill little sister named Himari, who was recently given a prognosis of only having a few weeks left to live. The 2 brothers decide to take her to an aquarium and show her a good time, since they used to have fun at the aquarium as kids. Shoma even buys Himari an unusual looking penguin hat. Unfortunately, Himari tragically collapses and dies right there. Shoma and Kanba take her to the hospital, but are told that it is too late. However, the penguin hat suddenly comes to life and resurrects Himari! It even seems to have cured her illness. However, the spirit residing in the magical penguin hat demands a favor from Shoma and Kanba in exchange for saving their sister. They must find a special artifact known as the \"penguindrum\" and bring it to the spirit of the hat, or their little sister will die! The hat tells the brothers that the first person they need to investigate is an unusual girl named Ringo, who is obsessed with fate and has a massive crush on the brothers' teacher. As the story progresses, you learn more and more hidden background and history about the various characters and the revelations are revealed bit by bit. This eventually makes Penguindrum a rather addicting and tense anime. However, the first part of the series is actually a little slow and some viewer's may not be used to starting on such a snail's pace. I don't want to spoil anything, but there are many plot twists and you will probably not see a lot of them coming! The only warning I will give is that this series does have some sad parts, but it is more bittersweet in its tone rather than ever becoming a full blown tragedy.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\\n\r\nOne of the most immediately likeable characters is the sickly little sister Himari. She is eternally optimistic and just oozes with kindness and caring. The 2 brothers Shoma and Kanba are quickly shown to be polar opposites, which is reflected by their red vs. blue hair colors. This is a reference to a Japanese cultural trope called \"red oni, blue oni\". Kanba is ladies man who easily just accepts things, even if a situation becomes completely absurd. If a giant demon penguin were to appear out of nowhere, he would simply accept that this is now happening and not even be shocked or disturbed. Kanba is also a moral utilitarian, meaning that he believes that the ends and the ultimate goal always justifies the means. Shoma is much more introverted, easily shaken up, and possesses a more traditional morality. Ringo is extremely obsessive, creepy, and at first seems to perfectly fit the \"yandare\" archetype. However, there is more to her character than the typical yandare, as you would expect from an acclaimed series like Penguindrum. There are actually quite a few more characters I could talk about, but I don't want this review to drag on forever. Instead I will just say that Penguindrum has an excellent cast of characters that you will slowly get to know better and better as the series goes on.\\n\\n\r\nThemes and symbols:\\n\\n\r\nPenguindrum is a philosophical anime that focuses largely on the topics of fate, free will, existentialism, the paradox of theodicy, and filial love. Penguindrum does a rather nice job presenting these themes and never feels like it is trying to be deeper than it actually is. It is not needlessly confusing, doesn't have throwaway allusions and symbolism that have no reason to be there, and basically feels comfortable with itself. Many anime TRY to be deep, but not all anime are able to execute their goals with the same precision. Penguindrum is top tier in this regard. You will immediately notice the extremely bright color palette that was chosen for the art in this series. This is because color actually plays an important role in the symbolism of the series. The most prominently featured color as virtually every critic before me has already mentioned is the color red. Seriously, only Suspiria can compete with Penguindrum in obsession with showing red everywhere! The reason for this is likely due to the \"red string of fate\" used throughout East Asian mythology and legends. Fate is an extremely important theme of Penguindrum. The red is also often interpreted as representing the fruit of original sin, which in Western art is often portrayed as an apple, even though the Bible itself makes no mention of apples. The fruit of original sin also makes an appearance in this series, so that is of course a distinct possibility. I don't want to talk too much more about the symbolism, because I fear I will spoil something if I go too far in depth. Just be aware that there IS plenty there to find, so be on the look out and pay attention, even during the seemingly boring parts!\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\\n\r\nHave you ever read a Haruki Murakami novel? Super Frog Saves Tokyo perhaps? This question is asked in Penguindrum, likely as a reference to the influence that Murakami's writing had on Penguindrum's writing. Murakami always seamlessly combines really weird stories, dark situations, quirky comedy, dense symbolism, and existential philosophy into a highly memorable package. I had never seen anything else that reminded me of his writing until I saw Penguindrum! I'm not saying Penguindrum is on par with the master himself of course and is HIGHLY unlikely to win the Nobel Prize for Literature, like Murakami almost inevitably will in the next couple years. However, Penguindrum is a great little series and is well worth a watch. The only strikes against it are some pacing issues, especially in the beginning of the series, a soundtrack that I personally wasn't crazy about, and an art style that you may or may not like. I will end though by saying that Penguindrum is well worthy of your time and I highly recommend it! I give it a very solid and well deserved 8/10.",

            "content": "Mawaru Penguindrum is not a show for everybody, but for those who are able to appreciate what this show has to offer, it is truly a treat.\r\nThis series, first and foremost, focuses on the messages that it wants to convey, and then weaves the plot around it. The show approaches things quite differently than most animes, and leaves us with a thematically tight, but quite confusing show. The premise is basically two brothers trying to save their younger sister from a terminal illness. She dies, but a mysterious penguinhat revives her and commands them to obtain the penguindrum if they truly wish to save her.Mysterious penguins are also dropped onto their doorway. The first half of the series presents itself as a comedic slice of life with some supernatural elements, however the second half shifts in tone and mood completely. Basically, if you become too comfortable with how the story progresses in the first half, you're in for a rude awakening. \\n\\n\r\nMuch of this show often makes makes references to fate, and potentially defying it, but  much deeper themes and messages comes to light as the series progresses. As stated earlier, this show can be quite confusing, as a lot of elements that are presented in this show become surreal. The fine line between abstraction and reality become blurred. Many plot twists are thrown at its viewers, and certain plot points remain ambiguous, leaving the audience to make their own connections. This show is highly symbolic, so it can be either highly compelling, or extremely frustrating. For those who are able to make the connections, and understand the symbolism in this show, it can feel very rewarding.\\n\\n\r\nMusic is fantastic. Some of the tracks are god-tier, while some are forgettable. What I noticed about this show is that certain tracks are only used once or twice throughout the entire series, showing how diverse the music can truly be in this show. Many many variations of the same tune are used as well. It's also worth noting that a lot of the songs that are in the show are actually redone version of songs that belong to an old Japanese rock band called ARB.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation in this show is gorgeous. The colors and characters are vibrant, and the the movement is fluid. It has wonderfully drawn background artwork, and presents very \\n\r\ninteresting visual ideas all together. Much of visual ideas are reminiscent of fairy tales. This show also has an excellent sense of composition and lighting. Repetition is utilized quite a bit in this show, so expect some stock footage. However, there are very noticeable drops in production value for certain episodes. Despite that, this is probably Brain Base's most beautifully animated series to date.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters have a very cute design, sporting a sort of romantic comedy style. At first, it is difficult to become emotionally invested for a majority of the main cast though. The interest of the how the plot unfolds seems to outweigh what actually happens to the characters. Certain characters may even seem to be downright unlikeable. Fortunately, by the end of the show, you will most certainly grow to care for most of, if not all of, the main cast. The voice actors and actresses do an excellent job as well. Himari's voice actress might need some getting used to though.\\n\\n\r\nWhat purpose do the penguins pose? \\n\r\nThey are reflections of the characters inner selves. They do not really become plot relevant after the second episode.\\n\\n\r\nThis show is truly a breath of fresh air. While I would not call this the perfect show, what this show offers is so rewarding that I'm able to look beyond that. Ambiguity in a show does not bother me so much when it's done right, and this is definitely the sort of show worth re-watching. Despite the somewhat contrived plot and occasional frustration this show can bring, the ride while watching this show was a extremely exciting one.",

            "content": "Blue servant penguins!  And they will kill your cockroaches for you!  Penguin queen hat that will possess your precious little sister!  Power up into the subway!  This is all for the sake of survival!  \r\nWell, this anime doesn't make much sense either.  In a bipolar fashion, in fluctuates between tender or intense drama, and crackup comedy or impossibly bizarre situations.  A shoujo aesthetic and intensely droolerific colors make it a pretty treat to look at.  Loveable and hateable characters start off as cliches, but seem to round out into something more.\r\nThere seems little point in providing asummary, since everything is so off the wall.  But it starts off with the tragic [cliche situation] of three adolescent orphaned siblings.  The two older (and very bishounen) brothers do all they can to support themselves and their little sister who has a dreadful terminal illness.  Wanting her to enjoy every last moment of her brief life, they take her to the zoo.  But, that was a little too much excitement, and she drops dead.  Boo hoo.\\n\\n\r\nBUT, fortunately, there was a hat they bought from the gift shop, and it magically re-animates her!  It is some....unknown creature, and it will keep sis alive, but in return the boys must complete certain missions that it asks them to do.  First job: find the penguin drum!\\n\\n\\n\r\nWhy would you enjoy watching this?\\n\\n\r\nBECAUSE IT'S PRETTY TO LOOK AT!!!  \\n\r\n(If you're tired of pastels and flat colors or want some cute bishounen to rest the eyes, look no further!)\\n\\n\r\nBECAUSE THERE'S NOT ENOUGH SHOUJOS OUT THERE ALREADY!!!  \\n\r\n(There's always like a 15-to-1 ratio of shounen/seinen to shoujo/josei every season.  Well, maybe this isn't shoujo...but I wouldn't call it a shounen.)\\n\\n\r\nBECAUSE THE DRAMA IS GREAT!!!\\n\r\n(Aww, c'mon, you'll love at least one of these characters!  And you'll surely empathize with all.)\\n\\n\r\nBECAUSE IT'S SO DARN HILARIOUS!!!\\n\r\n(If this doesn't make you laugh at least a little, then you are jaded to all humor.)\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe three blue servant penguins that are sent to the siblings don't speak, but are constantly on the move, either being helpful or getting into trouble.  They provide a running comedy routine going on in the background.  The boys work forward to find the penguin drum...though they have no clue what it looks like.  That, and try to support their little family of three in their colorful little shack.  The sister keeps getting possessed and gives fresh orders to the boys; or, a kick in the pants.  \\n\\n\r\nBefore I give a blanket approval to it, I'll say there is a little crudeness, perhaps to draw male viewers.  One of the antics of the penguins is to peep up girls' skirts and such.  However, it's far less than the ecchi that you see in the average shounen anime.  (Some may be put off at what seems like a little, erm, incest, at the end of episode 1.  But it doesn't seem to resurface, so don't drop it right away because of that!)\\n\\n\r\nIt's hard to say much more, since there are only a few episodes out so far.  \\n\\n\r\nPerhaps to screw in the final nails, I'll compare it to one other anime it reminded me of: Star Driver.  (Not that I particularly endorse Star Driver, though.)  If you've seen it, you know that it's about all these people very intently working toward this goal that we never really understand the purpose of, but it's very important to them.  Similarly, in Penguindrum we don't really understand the importance or significance of the missions the boys (and others) are working towards.  SD also tried to draw in both male and female viewers with eye candy and fanservice for both sexes.  While this is not as extreme, there is definitely an attempt to cater to both.  They also share very intense coloring, nice animation, and long \"magical transformations.\"  But Penguindrum ups SD with more intense drama and comedy.\\n\\n\r\nThis has become one of the most talked-about animes of the season, and with good reason.  I can imagine giving it a higher rating if it keeps up the interest.",

            "content": "There are only a few more episodes left, so let's get down to business. There are a number of times that I've wanted to drop this anime, but as I kept watching it gets more interesting, provided that you look deeper as to what is shown, so how do I rate this, here's how:\r\nStory: Good 7. (*v*) kyu!\r\nThere's no way for me to best describe it's story if I don't use an oxymoron, which I describe as \"confusingly entertaining.\" Sure, the synopsis states that it is about the 3 siblings who's sister died and suddenly was miraculously revived because of some random penguin hatwhich is placed on her head and it doesn't end there, she becomes somebody else who acts like a some primadonna princess who orders the brothers to go look for a so-called \"Penguin Drum.\" Now, how confusing is that? But, what makes the story entertaining is not about the characters, rather it is the mystery and the psychological genre that revolves around the story.\\n\\n\r\nArt: Good 7. (*v*) kyu!\\n\\n\r\nRidicules as it may seem, I think an additional \"ART\" genre should be added, this is the only anime were I gave a 7 for it's art. The way it looks is that the art of this anime adds to the psycho-logic.\\n\\n\r\nSound: Good 7. (*v*) kyu!  \\n\\n\r\nOk, if you're talking about the opening and closing themes, I just like them, especially the \"Survival Strategy\"  Himari's theme part.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Good 7. (*v*) kyu!\\n\\n\r\nIt is fairly obvious that  the main characters are the main attractions of this anime, however, there are other characters whom despite of just being regulated as support roles did provide a profound influence to this anime's overall make up like Masako Natsuma, Tokikago Yuri, Momoko Oginome,Sanetoshi Watase, Mario Natsume and Sahei Natsume. As of now, it is established that Kanba is actually Masako's brother, that Himari is not related to either Kanba or Shouma and it is possible that Shouma could be Himari's penguin drum, as for Kanba it maybe also possible that he could be Masako's solution to help their other brother Mario to be himself and not be their hated grandfather Sahei. FYI there are a few more episodes to go ( I may have said that already).\\n\\n\r\nAs for the penguins.........they're more like the comic relief or you could say that they are the comedy genre of this anime.  \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment and overall: Good 7. (*v*) kyu!\\n\\n\r\nFirst of all, I don't have any plans to go through the manga the moment this anime ends, co'z one confusingly entertaining thing is enough for me. Ok, so for one to enjoy this anime, one must look beyond as what is shown ( I think I've said that already), this is definitely not for someone with a shallow perception, I think what makes it interesting is that author's use of metaphors that revolves around the mystery and psychological genre side of this anime, that keeps one from making any conclusions until the last episode is shown, however it maybe possible that the last episode could lead us hanging.... I hope not.\\n\\n\r\nPS: I know that this (*v*) doesn't look like a penguin , but hey! It's the closes that I come up with, since the BBCode is disabled and besides there's no rule that you can't put it to add art to my review. Kyu!  \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Okay. The first thing to say about this anime: It's strange. It's definitely the strangest anime I ever watched - and that means something when you talk about anime. But it's great in its own way. \r\nI don't know if I really understood everything, because I think it was somewhat confusing and I watched it over a long period of time, so maybe that's also a reason why I was so confused by this anime. When I started it, I thought it would be a light-hearted show you can watch to relax but that's wrong. I watched it with complete wrong expectations and I wassometimes unsure if I should take serious what was happening there or not. The mood in this anime is not dark, but the producers definitely have black humor.\\n\\n\r\nI'll start with the story:\\n\\n\r\nThe story develops rather slow-paced, but that's okay. The idea is something new and I liked it. The story-development was great. I was surprised very often and it was very exciting. There was romance involved and the relationships between the characters developped in a good way, too. But the story was very, very confusing. I still don't really know why that all happened in the first place and where all these strange powers came from. Especially Momoka's power - why did she have it in the first place? The story was difficult to understand for me, but I somehow managed in the end, I hope...I really liked the order they showed the things in. You didn't understand everything 'till the end and with every flashback, you learned more and then there were these aha moments where you just thought: \"Oh that's how it ist!! Finally! I understood something!!\"  That was very well-made. I have to say that in the beginning I didn't really care why all of that happened and stuff, I mean, I wanted to relax..but to be honest, when I watched the second half of the anime, I had very much fun trying to think about it. The good thing is - you can more or less decide if you want to think about it or not. You can enjoy this anime without thinking, too, probably. The question is if you understand everything..\\n\r\nThey show different opinions of fate through the characters, and simply through the way the characters develop, the view you get of fate changes. It is difficult to describe, for me at least...\\n\r\nThe good thing is that you really can't tell what will happen next. The ending was unexpected for me and I'm still not really shure it I understood what happened to them in the end. I don't want to spoiler you, so I won't say any more about this, but it was confusing. Still, I am very satisfied with the end.\\n\\n\r\nThe Art:\\n\\n\r\nThe art is special. It is very beautiful, I think. The characters have good designs - I especially like Himaris design. What I think what makes the art special, is that the faces all look different. The characters have all individual faces - that is something I realized at the end. What is cool, too, are the backgrounds. They are really well designed and the colours are beautiful.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\\n\r\nThe sound really suited the anime. Sometimes I thought \"Oh my god, PLEASE read the mood more and stop playing this ridiculous sound in those serious moments!\" but it emphasized the black humor of the anime. The mood in the anime was everything but dark, though what happened there was everything but happy, I think. The sound really did its job - it suited the anime though it sometimes didn't suit the mood you'd expect in the situation. But, let's say it was special - like everything about this anime.\\n\\n\r\nThe Characters:\\n\\n\r\nThe characters were great. They were somewhat streange, to be honest, but really interesting. What I have to say is, that nearly everyone had a really strange way of loving someone. If you look at Ringo, Masako and Yuri - I mean, what the heck?! They were really strange when it came to love. Okay, as for this matter, they all changed at some point of the story and were all given more dephts in the progress of the anime. I especially liked Ringo. In the beginning, she just seems like a crazy girl, madly in love with Tabuki, who spends her live stalking him. But knowing her circumstances, I started liking her. She thinks different from others and I like her way of seeing things. Also I like how she changes in the progress of the anime. As for Masako and Yuri - they just pissed me off until their pasts were explained. Then I started liking both somehow. I thought they were just what they seemed to be - those extremely annoying......you know what I mean, right? If you watch the anime or have watched it, you will understand. Shouma and Kanba seemed somewhat like stereotypes in the beginning, but even they were really cool characters and in the end I liked both of them. Though I have to say that I liked Kanba definitely more. In the end, Kanba was just cool....*^* He was much more mature than Shouma and he really cared for Himari. okay, they both did that but he was really desperate to rescue her and I liked how he did everything so whole-hearted. And I like his way of wanting to do everything on his own, it seemed reasonable. And then Tabuki. Hm. He was somehow not too interesting. But he did his job and was suited for his role, so it was fine.\\n\r\nSo, altogether the characters really were interesting and everyone had a certain depth. There really was no character I didn't like in the end.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\\n\r\nThat is difficult to say. I really like the anime now, but I didn't really get into it. I watched it over a long period of time, like I already mentioned above. But that doesn't mean that the anime wasn't good. This anime is art. Really. And what makes this anime really special isn't the story, the art, the sound or the characters, it is its humor. Definitely. I mean, the story, art, sound and characters are special anyway. But that isn't what makes this anime art. It is the way it makes hints and sends messages to the people watching the anime wich aren't actually said out load. Those messages can be found in the things the three cute penguins do in the background, in the names of the characters right up to the coulors of the rooms or diverse other hidden things. And that all is emphasized with the music, for example. That is the way they show their black humor. You often don't know if you should take the situation serious or not and if the jokes are meant as jokes or are simply meant as cruel as they actually are. But that is really special about this anime and I partly loved and party disliked it. Sometimes I just couldn't laugh, but often I just thought those people were genious.\\n\\n\\n\r\nMy conclusion;\\n\\n\r\nI recommend this anime to every fan of black humor. People who want to think a little bit may like this anime, too. But I think it is also okay for people who just search an anime to relax If you don't get yourself into the black humor and don't try to find those hints, you can also enjoy this anime as a normal, partly funny, partly serious anime, I suppose. At least it definitely is a special anime. Really worth watching it!!",

It's definitely not what I was expecting (having viewed just the beginning theme before watching it, without reading the summary or anything). There were quite a few WTF moments for sure...\r\nI've never viewed any other anime like this before. That may be going a bit overboard, but I don't think so based off of the first episode alone. It starts off sad and had me in tears, but by the second half you start to wonder if it's another magical girl anime. But if that's not enough, they throw in ...incest?! Definitely a twist...that's for sure. Thenthere are the three random penguins and yet the whole episode revolves around fate. It's a weird show for sure, but I think I'll follow through and keep watching it, just because it's so different from anything else I've seen before. Also, the art style reminds me a bit of Bakemonogatari. If you're looking for something different, weird, or a strange combination of genres then I think you've found it.",

            "content": "Can children live a fate separate from their parents? Or must they inherit the will of the past generation?\r\nPenguindrum is another show from Kunihiko Ikuhara, the director of Sailor Moon S and Revolutionary Girl Utena. If you\u2019re familiar with Ikuhara, you probably know his directing style is incredibly theatrical, expressive, and abstract. However, there\u2019s enough in Penguindrum that makes it hold something new for both Ikuhara fans and new watchers. \r\nOne thing should be clear: Ikuhara shows can be very daunting for many anime fans to watch. This is mostly because his shows are dripping in symbolic imagery that is meant to provoke an emotionalresponse from the viewer. And that might not work out for everyone. He also loves developing his characters through repetition, something that might become tiring for some viewers. If you are looking to watch something where you can just turn off your brain, Penguindrum is not the show for you. \\n\\n\r\nPenguindrum is a show about two brothers: Shouma and Kanba Takamura, who are determined to save their little sister, Himari\u2019s, life. One day, Himari dies and is brought back to life by a mysterious being inhabiting a penguin hat. In return for their sister\u2019s life, the being demands the brothers to \u201cfind the Penguindrum\u201d. The premise already sounds ridiculous, but it\u2019s surprisingly executed very well, as the plot ties in well with the show\u2019s central theme of \u201cfate\u201d, or familial obligation. The show has an almost laser-like focus on its theme of family, as each of the characters feel bound by their obligation to their family members. And each of their struggles is about if they can somehow escape their \u201cfate\u201d and shape their own identities. \\n\\n\r\nThe show\u2019s story develops at a break-neck pace, as each episode ends with a new development. For this reason, I think the show is better experienced  marathoning it in large chunks, rather than watching it one episode a week. In this way, Penguindrum feels more structured like a novel, as opposed to Utena\u2019s duelist of the week format. This makes sense, as Penguindrum draws from a pool of literary influences: Haruka Murakami\u2019s novels and Night on the Galactic Railroad, a short story by Kenji Miyazawa. Speaking of influences, the show is heavily inspired by the cultural impact of two important events in Japan\u2019s recent history: the Sarin gas attack and the recession of the Lost Decade. It\u2019s hard to go into how the show addresses these events without going into spoilers, but the gist is it examines how people cling onto authoritative institutions in times of despair, loss of identity, and the weakening of Japan\u2019s traditional family structure. Penguindrum is essentially Ikuhara\u2019s attempt at creating a story dealing with the ongoing social realities of Japan. While I think the show can still be enjoyed without understanding this context, knowing the show\u2019s influences can help in understanding its underlying message about the importance of love. \\n\\n\r\nPenguindrum\u2019s directing and animation is fantastic for the most part, leading to really good-looking visuals. While the character designs are shoujoesque, Ikuhara steps away from using fairy tale-like iconography in favor of urbanistic imagery. A lot of the show\u2019s symbols fits in well with show\u2019s theme of \u201cfate\u201d: the red line of the train\u2019s destinations representing the thread of fate, an arrowed ring representing the circle of fate, a swinging pendulum that would cut through the thread of fate at random angles, etc. Even the three penguins that accompany the main characters tie in well with the characters\u2019 struggle to find their own identities. A penguin is a bird, yet it cannot fly and walks on land. Ikuhara tones down his theatrical directing style for Penguindrum, opting for a more melodramatic, yet still expressive, approach. Of course, that doesn\u2019t mean the show isn\u2019t a visual overload, but the theatrics are kept to the minimum for the most part. Unfortunately, some of the other episodes not directed by Ikuhara suffer from middling direction, specifically most of the episodes in the middle. There are noteworthy episodes directed by talented directors however, such as Nobuyuki Takeuchi (SHAFT regular), Shigeyasu Yamauchi (director of Casshern Sins), Shingo Kaneko (frequent collaborator with Ikuhara), and Akemi Hayashi and Shouko Nakamura (both are new Ikuhara disciples).\\n\\n\r\nTo add further to the topic of Ikuhara\u2019s directing, Ikuhara was also the sound director for Penguindrum, just like with Utena. He masterfully uses the songs provided by Yukari Hashimoto, the show\u2019s composer, in juxtaposition with the emotional context of each scene. Hashimoto\u2019s moody, yet extremely powerful, orchestral pieces fit in well with the show\u2019s melodramatic tone. Even the songs that are incredibly light-hearted in tone like \u201cRock Over Japan\u201d and the silly musical numbers in the early episodes, help add some emotional levity in scenes that would otherwise be overwhelming. \\n\\n\r\nAlthough I talked about the characters a fair bit in this review, I think they\u2019re actually the weakest part of the show. A lot of people have complained about Penguindrum\u2019s ending and called it a massive flaw to an otherwise good show, but I thought the ending was just fine and wrapped the message of the importance of loving other people perfectly. The characters are the most divisive element in Penguindrum, and I can honestly see why. The main characters\u2019 development occurs in contextless train rides and conversations, making it hard to fully invest in them. For a show that puts a strong emphasis on its human element, that is a pretty damning flaw to have. Even the side characters don\u2019t fare much better, as some of them either fall emotionally flat by the end or just didn\u2019t get as much focus as they should have. The only side character to have a well fleshed-out character arc is Ringo, and while I liked her a lot, I\u2019ll fully admit some might find her actions annoying and/or creepy. Penguindrum\u2019s main problem is that it has trouble balancing its plot-centric episodes with its character-focus ones, which is the biggest flaw that keeps it from being a masterpiece. \\n\\n\r\nWith that out of the way however, I think what is simultaneously one of Penguindrum\u2019s biggest strengths, is the simple fact it\u2019s the only Ikuhara show with male protagonists. The director\u2019s male characters are often very ridiculous in nature and can sometimes feel more like walking abstractions, rather than actual characters. In Penguindrum, the male protagonists are simply trying to save their little sister and preserve their family against all odds. Sure, it could have been executed way better, but it is this aspect that I find makes Penguindrum stand on its own against Ikuhara\u2019s other works. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, I enjoyed Penguindrum. The show\u2019s themes resonated with me very strongly and really touched me on a personal level. Although I have mentioned the show\u2019s influences, knowing the show\u2019s cultural context isn\u2019t necessary to enjoy watching the show. It is incredibly straightforward in its presentation of the theme of \u201cfate\u201d/familial obligation that understanding its cultural context isn\u2019t really mandatory. People have called Penguindrum a fun rollercoaster ride, and while I don\u2019t necessarily disagree with this assessment, I think that description undersells the show\u2019s strengths. Of course, it is by no means perfect; the pacing could have been handled better and several characters could have been fleshed out a lot more. But it presents a heart-warming story about a family of three teenagers trying to defy their \u201cfate\u201d. Calling it a ride and nothing more, ignores the ever-present human element within Penguindrum. As with any Ikuhara show, it\u2019s easy to get overwhelmed by the visual imagery thrown at you, but once you get over that initial turmoil, you\u2019ll find a show with a lot of heart in its emotional story and direction.",

Mawaru Penguindrum had so much potential, however unlike many anime shows it actually delivered... But the issue I had with this, is that it also added SO MANY unnecessary plot twists and issues that simply were not needed. It made the story hard to follow and i was finding myself questioning what the main plot of the story was, which for me wasn't pleasant to watch at certain scenes. At times it seemed likethe creators were just trying to fill in time with random scenes that had no relevance to the story. \\n\\n\r\nWhich is why i have no idea why i loved this show as much as I did. There was so much wrong with it, and yet so many amazing parts. I think it was just heart warming to watch. I tried so much to look past all the little things because i truly did want this show to be everything i hoped it would, but for me it was more of a love/hate relationship.\\n\\n\r\nThere is not a lot to say about the artwork and sound, other than it was great. Both tied in very well with the mood and scenes which was pleasant to watch.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters was the strongest element in Mawaru Penguindrum i felt. Plenty of background information was given, plenty of emotions, plenty of twists, plenty of meltdowns. What's not to like!\\n\r\nBut seriously, Characters were good. \\n\\n\r\nSo, this is one of those shows that you either Love, Hate, or like me you wont have a clue what is going on inside your head and will probably change your opinion on it about 50 times. But it is easily worth the watch.",

            "content": "It's hard to say what my expectations were when I ventured to watch Mawaru Penguindrum. I suppose I expected a mix of mystery and comedy, at least that's what I initially thought looking at its cover images. Well penguins too, of course. Well never judge anime by its cover, right? Not that I didn't get comedy or mystery or penguins, it's just that Mawaru Penguindrum is much much more than that. In the end, it's very goal is to prove that nothing is what it appears to be on the surface.\r\nArt. It has definitely solid art and animation quality. The character design is nothing fancy,but perhaps this is very point : to showcase what's behind those common faces you'd see in daily life. There are cute \"survival strategy\" sequences which are very well executed in terms of creativity and style. You won't see super flashy effects in this anime, but then again, it's not an action to be packed with fx. Instead it focuses on adding surrealistic touch to the environments. There's also quite a creative approach to depicting some supporting characters and general crowd.\\n\\n\r\nSound. I can't say I fell in love with any OP or ED here, but they did fit the feel and style of the anime. The soundtrack itself is quite enjoyable actually; at very least it's not annoying and keeps around that feel of mystery and surrealism.\\n\\n\r\nPlot. I must say that it's probably one of the most creative concepts I've seen in a while. It's weird, it's unrealistic and yet at the same time it's incredibly gripping. Long story short, two young men (two brothers) are faced with a task of finding a mysterious Penguindrum in order to save their terminally ill younger sister. Seems like an ordinary tale? So I thought as well in the beginning. \\n\r\nTruth to be told, the first couple of episodes may seem to be too dragged out with slow pacing and numerous \"survival strategy\" moments (the musical parts of which I shamelessly skipped). I was raging at the whole Penguindrum deal. I mean wtf, we don't even know what it is. And we don't need to actually; it's a macguffin.  Anyway, afterwards the story pace picks up being lavished with fair share of comedy and suspense. One of the most wonderful features of this anime is that it's genuinely funny when it wants to be funny, and genuinely creepy when it wants to be creepy. As the story goes, you will face more and more surrealism and suspense, and believe me, at the end of each ep you will be sitting at the edge of your seat.\\n\\n\r\nNow some feel repelled by amount of surreal plotlines to the point of losing track of what is what in the story, which is probably also true. It's not the kind of story where everything is on the surface and you may want to watch it again in order to grasp it. Another drawback is that some of the questions about characters and events pretty much stay unanswered to the very end, and this may seem like a major flaw. For me it didn't affect the enjoyment I've got from the series; I almost felt like I didn't need those answers at all.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters are a lovely bunch. Like I mentioned before, nobody is what she or he seems like to be on the surface. The happy family of brothers and sister, your average school girl, a kind and gentle school teacher, a brilliant actress...Everyone has a skeleton in a closet; not precisely a dark secret but a secret nonetheless. Some characters wonderfully combine comedy relief with creepiness which is what makes it fun to watch. In the end, everybody undergoes a change, big or little. Oh did I mention penguins? Because these are adorable too and watching them is like watching a comedy inside a comedy.\\n\\n\r\nOverall I definitely watching with my breath held. It was hilarious and nerve-racking and very touching indeed. The comedy followed the recurring theme of treating people like trash and that followed some magic-surreal scene. In the end of the day, I didn't mind the puzzling events in the beginning, the penguins and macguffins and the way this anime ended. If you mind all those things, then it's not for you.\\n\\n",

            "content": "If I had to describe Mawaru Penguindrum in one word besides \"SUPER DUPER AWESOMENESS TOPPED WITH EPICNESS\" (Yes, I noticed) it would be unique. From the studio that animated Durarara and the creator of revolutionary girl Utena and Sailor Moon, the O'Magnificent and cracked out Ikuhara Kunihiko, comes Mawaru Penguindrum. \r\nMeaning Around the Penguindrum, Mawaru Penguindrum is a story about two brothers, saving their terminally ill sister. She dies, to be revived by a mysterious hat from an aquarium souvenir shop, and demands some thing called a PenguinDrum, in return, which the brothers desperately sought after, with the help of totally whacked out penguins. \r\nTheart and colorfulness of it is simply beautiful, something close to Puella Magi's art, and on occasions have a Bakemonogatari feeling to it. The character's expressions are simply HILARIOUS, and the penguins are adorable. The use of the universal symbol, which looks exactly like the ones you find on public potty's door, which they use for pedestrians, is creative and feels like it fits in the anime, focusing more on the main characters. It does feel like the animators were lazy, but since this anime's characters move around by trains, it fits. I will speculate abit here, but unlike cars, whose the passenger's destination is determined solely on themselves, the train's destinations are not. They take you to a general place, and there on, you're on your on. For the majority of your... journey, the trains decide that, and you don't get much choice. It is like \"fate determines what happens to you ultimately, but the little things along the way are mostly your choice. The episodes, are not like \"In the next episode\", but they say the \"next station\". There are also occasions where the characters look like paper cut outs (Pretty well cut outs), which are just hilarious. Also, the brothers are pretty hot in my opinion. (Aaahhhh the bishies!) \\n\\n\r\nThe music isn't spectacular or anything, but it suits the mood. It builds on to the mood it tries to portray, and there isn't music playing in every single scene, which is a good balance. The OP, Nornir, is pretty good, but it ain't Supercell or anything. Like most people, when I watch anime, I don't go looking at the music. Of course if the music is just crap, then it gives an impression that the studio has either, decided to focus on another part of the anime, or that they have a tight budget. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters are believable. They are not perfect characters, and have flaws like everybody in the world. The brothers are polar opposites, despite being twins, and have their quirks and downfalls, and, did I mention that they are cute? (Hehe...) The best characters in this anime, if they count as characters, have got to be without a doubt, the penguins. The trio of moronic and adorable penguins that never fail to make me laugh. They are designed to match their owners in personality, only much more exaggerated, and scenes with the penguins are somethings among others that I look forward to every week. \\n\\n\r\nAnimes like this just makes me cry with joy. Some thing that is cliche, and hasn't been done before, but Mawaru PenguinDrum is something that will always be unique, and what ever was Ikuhara was on when he made this must've been some good stuff.",

But it's some perspective for those who haven't quite decided to spend their time on Mawaru.\r\nSo after reading all the positive reviews for Mawaru Penguindrum I decided to just crunch through the first 8 episodes and get into it (thinking it would explode with entertainment once I got far enough in). It never did, not even during the last two episodes. There was never a point where I was utterly entertained, nor was there a point when I was utterly bored. It's a limbo anime for me..\r\nNow I understand that some people lovethis anime and consider it amazing and whatnot, but truthfully it seems like this series is just a simply mixing of: withholding information from the audience; and marching forward with the plot. Personally, I always felt like I was about to find out something cool or meaningful, and then I'd find myself saying \"..that was it?\". (SERIOUSLY, a lot)\\n\\n\r\nThe character relationship are the only thing that kept me watching this anime. I wanted to see the brothers save their (extremely lovable) sister afterall. I was mildly confused towards the end though..\\n\\n\r\nHOWEVER, the music in Mawaru P. is awesome and fun. They did a really good job at making me look forward to their... \"transformation sequence\". It added the feel of \"otherworldly forces\" playing a hand in their fates that much more potent. \\n\\n\r\n-There you go. That's my brief brief brief opinion on M.P.

            "content": "Mawaru Penguindrum is ....huh?\r\n I'm glad that I watched it, it was certainly entertaining, but I am not sure I liked it.\r\nWho should watch it:\r\n*People who like Kunihiko Ikuhara.\r\n*People who like trippy and beautiful anime.\r\n*People who like to engage their mind while watching anime.\r\n*People who like penguins. :P\r\nWho shouldn't watch it:\r\n*People who don't like thinking \"WTF???\" throughout the entirety of an anime. (Yes, even and especially the ending)\r\n*People who are easily creeped out. Stalking is a major theme of the anime, with incest and rape sprinkled in.\r\n*People who are looking for a lovable cast of characters...likeable characters are few and far between.\r\nArt/Animation- 10\r\nI love howMawaru Penguindrum looks, it is beautiful. This anime isn't related to Shoujo Kakumei Utena at all (other than sharing the same director) but I found a couple of characters physically reminded me of two characters from that show. (Masako reminded me of Juri and Shoma reminded me of Miki) As with Utena, there were lots of very strange and interesting visuals as well. Replacing the \"shadow girls\" of Utena was the idol group Double H who ran in little advertisements on the subway the characters took everywhere. I also enjoyed the crazy \"transformation scene\" (for lack of a better description) and how the background characters were drawn (as bathroom sign figures!). The openings and endings were all beautiful to look at and visually interesting, definitely unskippable in my opinion.\\n\\n\r\nMusic- 9\\n\r\nNot all of the songs are original songs, about half are covers from a band called ARB, but they all fit very well (I was surprised to learn that just now, heh). This makes sense now that I know this, since one of the lyrics in \"Rock over Japan\" is \"I'm just a rock and roll man, we're just a rock and roll band.\" despite the fact a group of 3 girls is singing. XD I am a huge fan of original songs so, I'm a fan of the first opening and ending songs in particular. (Unfortunately, I don't like the full versions of the openings as much as the tv sizes...they go on for far too long and have filler in weird places. o.O) Both the animation and the songs for the opening and closing fit the tone of the show very well. My absolute favorite song is \"Gray Wednesday\" (or Haiiro Suiyoubi). It is a very pretty and sad song, and is used quite a bit throughout the series (as it should be). I also enjoyed \"Rock Over Japan\" as it played during the aforementioned visually interesting \"transformation scene.\" XD I'm definitely getting the soundtrack!\\n\\n\r\nStory- 8\\n\r\nObviously I can't say too much about the story without spoiling it, but it is definitely an interesting one. If you like surrealism, mysteries, drama, and general weirdness, you can't go wrong with this show. I, personally, could not make much sense of this show, though. I was confused throughout the entire thing and I didn't take much away from the show, unlike Utena, which is my favorite anime of all time. So, maybe I unfairly judged it based on that, but there isn't much I can do about that....whereas Utena is full of symbolism and ways to interpret it, this show is just....what? WHAT ARE YOU TRYING TO SAY KUNI-CHAN??? I honestly have no idea. Which wouldn't be so bad EXCEPT....\\n\\n\r\nCharacters- 3\\n\r\nThe characters. Oh, god, the characters. I found exactly ONE character likeable in this show. Well, not counting the penguins, they were pretty awesome. XD The characters, save for maybe one or two, are completely unrelatable because they are just so fucked up. We've got stalkers, a kidnapper, terrorists, incestuous people, and even a rapist! Sounds like people you can root for, right? I mean, compared to those other groups I just listed, incest doesn't sound so bad, right? When you can say something like that, there is definitely something wrong. And, I'm not saying incest can't be compelling, it can be (I am a fan of the \"Flowers in the Attic\" series of books by V.C. Andrews for god's sake. o.O) but....no. Here it is not.\\n\\n\r\nOverall- 7\\n\r\nOverall, I found this show to be \"good\" as far as the score on here goes. I really wanted to like it more but I can only like a show so much for its visuals and music....it needs to have coherent substance (it does have substance, but coherent it is not...) and likeable characters. I cannot stress that last part enough. If your characters are not likeable, why the hell should I care about your story? I know that sounds kind of harsh, but I love you Kuni-chan! I expected so much more from you! D: I am disappoint.\\n\\n\r\nRecommendations-\\n\r\n*Watch this if you like Shoujo Kakumei Utena / love Kunihiko Ikuhara like I do.\\n\r\n*If you haven't watched Utena, GO WATCH IT NOW! It is far superior in all aspects to this (well, except visuals...but it is from 1997, give it a break! I still love the art, anyway.)",

            "content": "Story - A mix of tragedy , comedy , Super natural , brotherhood , unrequited love , symbolic incest (maybe) and add penguins and you get Mawaru penguindrum.  Each episode makes me want more I was so eager to watch the latest episode that I didn't even care about the quality of the video.  The story so far revolves around two brothers following orders from a person that some people call\" Princess of the crystal\" who possesses their sister's body to obtain the \"penguindrum\".  The reward for this task is their sister's survival thus the\"'Princess of the crystal\" calls them to initiatethe \"Survival strategy\" everyday and each day the come closer and closer to finding out what the \"peguin drum\" is.\\n\r\nVery unique that is executed in a very entertaining way.\\n\\n\r\nArt - Charecter design is gorgeous pretty boys and pretty girls.  The background art is full of detail and vibrant colors.\\n\\n\r\nSound - Love the Op , Love the transformation song \"Rock over japan\" which was originally a old school rock song  but they gave it more of a pop feel , and the ED is wonderful \"Dear future\" .\\n\\n\r\nCharacters -\\n\\n\r\nKanba - Very rare to have a main protagonist who is nearly flawless.  He is a playboy who has learned various skills from his ex's from hacking to breaking into houses he knows it all.  He can read situations well and knows how to handle women using his handsomeness and swagger.  The last part of ep 1 showed that he might have a incest side. (Which might be a side affect of Princess of the Crystal taking out what looked to be his heart on their first encounter.)\\n\\n\r\nShouma - Girly looking and easily surprised.  He is more of your typical protagonist yet he still has some good qualities.  He is kinda the opposite to his brother in many ways.  I can see him playing the straight man in future situations.\\n\\n\r\nHimari - Her voice is HHHNNNNGGGGG!! She is so cute I want to take her home.  Meanwhile her Princess of the crystal mode is more of a dominating personality and can be seen as more sexy (Ok that's just me :P)  I LOVE HER\\n\\n\r\nRingo - At first I thought she would be your typical blushing love interest for one of the boys I WAS WRONG.  This girl is full of surprises and can only be described as a Yandere stalker crazy chick.  She will be entertaining to watch\\n\\n\r\nShouma/Kanba's friend - So far faceless character who seems to like molesting shouma as seen in ep 1 and 2 he is a playboy like Kanba.\\n\\n\r\nTabuki sensei - Shoujo male teacher nuff said.\\n\\n\r\nPenguin #1 - Kanba's penguin and like Kanba he is a bit of a pervert but is also more strict.\\n\\n\r\nPenguin #2 - Shouma's penguin who is a bit on the dumb side but funny non the less\\n\\n\r\nPenguin #3 - Himari's female penguin attendant who mimics her.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - Lets just say I watched episodes 1 and 2 at least 10 times waiting for ep 3.\\n\\n\r\nOverall - best anime of 2011 summer easily if it stays on the path its on.",

I have never been in a mental hospital.  I have always done well in school, overall those around me consider me as a \u201cpretty smart guy\u201d.  With all that in mind can someone explain to me two things; one what the hell did I just watch and two why is this anime ranked so high.  \r\n    This anime is confusing as helland it makes no sense.  For every question answered at least three more are raised.  It\u2019s going to be a difficult task but I will try to keep my review spoiler free.  Forget about all the so called facts you read in the synopsis.  Just about every \u201ctruth\u201d is impugn.  My biggest issue with this anime is that it fails to establish definite laws of physics and logic and not in the good Dragonball Z way but the maybe I have to be high or crazy to have some semblance of what\u2019s happening.\\n\\n\r\n    The characters are overly complicated. Every time you learn more of their past it leaves more questions than answers.  The producers fail to make the characters sympathetic.  There is no logic in this world it is utter chaos, there is no telling what is possible or what was even real.  It started off very decent and I wanted ever so to love this anime.  However, with each episode it gets more confusing to the point that it stops being entertaining and your left to wonder why in the world would anyone ever write this, let alone watch it.  It felt as if a bunch of writers wrote a bunch of stories and decided to merge all of them regardless if it made sense or not.  Throughout the whole anime you can see that the producers are trying to convey a message but they failed.  This anime is certainly unique, but I feel that most people are confused just because something is unique does not make it any good.\\n",

            "content": "This is my first time writing a review, so lets make it as fabulous max as it can be.\r\nLets start with the story. At first, I thought it would be a comedy/magical girl/search for the mysterious thing sort of anime. At first, I thought it would be utterly boring from the synopsis. Who wants to watch slice of life like the original synopsis I read made it sound like? I usually don't.\r\nThen, I thought it would be a comedy/romance where Ringo realized how much she came to love Shouma over the course of the series. I am not much of a person for romance either,to be honest, but the comedy kept me coming back.\\n\\n\r\nTo get to the point, its like a gigantic maze where you constantly think that THIS time you are going the right way and not getting utterly lost.\\n\r\nI gave up on trying to figure it out around two thirds of the way through and just went along with it, but when you finally find the exit its like.. that was it?\\n\\n\r\nNo, it was nothing like what I expected. Nothing at all. In the first half, it had the great comedy that kept me watching through what I thought it may be and direction that during the painful wait of the week I re-watched all of the episodes currently out.\\n\\n\r\nThis later turned out to be a good thing since it let me remember a bit better how I went into this maze, because with all the twist and turns this show took, you would have to of had looked at some complicated chart of ideas and plot lines that show up beforehand to get a slightly tighter grasp than others the first time around watching. It is one of those shows that's like a box jam-packed with things that you can't even see hardly any past the first layer until you sort through it bit by bit, going back to it every now and then to give it another look to see what is in there. Sometimes coming upon things that creates an \"Oh, so that's where it's been!\" sort of moment.\\n\\n\r\nOne thing besides the comedy that kept me loving it was the art, but sadly I can not give it a ten like I wish to, because some episodes the animation and such..changed style  terribly which bothered me a lot. Really, I didn't find the animation change bad, per say, but rather too different from the norm of the show to not be jarring. Prepare yourselves if you are marching in for the animation alone at first. Then there's the sound, which I also like... but it kinda got repetitive to be honest which in my opinion, detracted from how pretty it sounded.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, it is defenenantly one of those roller coaster rides that go all over and kinda wan't to make you barf, yet leave you wanting to ride it again. In other words, I highly recommend watching this series over and over again over the course of  a long period of time.\\n\\n",

            "content": "If someone were to ask me to describe Mawaru Penguindrum in 1 word, I would have to say \"Let me use 5.\"\r\nStunning. Trippy. Symbolic. Heart-rending. Art.\r\nMawaru Penguindrum is one of the closest examples you will ever get to pure art in this industry, it's comparable to things like Evangelion and Serial Experiments Lain in that regard. It doesn't stick to the norm, nor is it a hipster for doing so, it's the perfect definition of something so different done so, so right.\r\n(There will be a tl;dr summary at the end of the review, but it would be appreciated if you read the whole thing.) \r\n(Authorsnotes: This review ended up waaaaaay longer than first intended, so the tl;dr will be as well.)\\n\r\n[LIGHT SPOILERS AHEAD, READER DISCRETION IS ADVISED]\\n\\n\r\nMawaru uses the concept of \"fate\" and \"destiny\" a lot throughout the series, with questions like \"If our lives are already laid out and pre-planned, why do we even exist?\". Some characters believe that this is true, that their fated encounters are those laid out by a higher being to make them or others happy in life, that everything happens for a reason. Other characters believe that nothing is planned, that everything is lead by their own hands and theirs alone, you yourself make your own destiny, and you are the only one that can save those close to you.\\n\\n\r\nIt's a very deep philosophical issue that a lot of people take very seriously, which is why it's easy to relate to these characters, they have ideologies and ambitions that are simply human. They don't have the usual tropes that you would associate them with from just looking at the cover, which is an amazing feat for any anime author to accomplish.\\n\\n\r\nWhile Mawaru does have an overarching plot that tries to keep everything in line, Mawaru is more of a character study than anything else. Every character does what they do because of a certain reason, whether that be something as simple as finding amusement in the madness, or something more sinister.\\n\\n\r\nThe ambitions and motives of the characters are all pivoted and interconnected to an incident that happened 16 years prior to where it takes place. A horrible massacre where thousands of people died, with one of them being a young girl that shall not be named, because spoilers.\\n\\n\r\nThe pivoting angle of which you see most of the story is through the Takakura siblings, and their misfortune to come. Their sister, Himari, is physically weak and has been hospital ridden for months if not years. One day her doctors think she is okay to be able to go outside and go to an aquarium with her brothers, Shouma and Kanba for a few hours. However, Himari walks away from her brothers, presumably chasing something she saw earlier, and is found in a critical state in the main garden and dies shortly after.\\n\\n\r\nAlready, just ten minutes in and Mawaru is already pulling heartstrings. Her brothers are decimated by this development and they are mourning her by her bedside. As they are about to notify their uncle of what happened, Himari sits up in her bead, her eyes a glowing pink, wearing the penguin hat Shouma had bought her at the souvenir shop, and yells \"SURVIVAL STRATEGIES!!!\" (SEIZON SENRYAKU!!!) at the top of her lungs. \\n\\n\r\nThe show does this extremely catchy and trippy kind of transformation sequence with the Himari standing atop a platform inside of a toy mech-bear wearing a ridiculously big dress. Himari then explains to the brothers, in her voice but someone else's words, that she will extend the duration of the girl's life if they can find something called the \"Penguindrum\" and sends them on their mission. Astonishingly, Himari is alive, and the brothers set off to find whatever this \"Penguindrum\" is.\\n\\n\r\nAt that point, I had no idea what the hell was going on. One minute it was a heart-rending death, and then it was a colorful transformation sequence, I didn't make sense.\\n\\n\r\nThis is what I mean by when I say that Mawaru doesn't play by the rules, it never acknowledged they exist in the first place.\\n\\n\r\nOne of the main things that make this show what it is is the almost abstract visuals that it portrays. It has what you would call \"Smart Symbolism\" it uses intelligent symbolism that's not convoluted and is relatively easy to follow, like for example, people on the street are faceless, unimportant, just the masses you traverse to commute to your destination. They're designed like the stick figures on the men and women's bathroom stalls, the point being that there is no difference between the masses. \\n\\n\r\nWhen people think of symbolism in anime, they almost always think of the extremely religion inspired, convoluted symbolism in Evangelion, or the subtle religious symbolism in things like Serial Experiments Lain or Madoka Magica. \\n\\n\r\nTo go into all of the intricate symbolisms of Mawaru would take me hours to do so and almost spoil the entire series for you, so I won't go into that.\\n\\n\r\nOne thing has to be said however, the ending of Mawaru absolutely destroyed me emotionally, for reasons I won't go into because of SUPER DUPER SPOILERS. The way it was carried out reminded me of another anime that did something similar, with the same effect on my heart. \\n\\n\r\nThe last time I was destroyed that hard was when I completed the Muv Luv visual novel series, those who have read it know exactly what I'm talking about.\\n\\n\r\nAnother thing that Mawaru succeeds at is it's soundtrack, it's absolutely marvelous. There are these certain that just absolutely make any scene stand out, it all fits the mood perfectly and is done extremely well. In particular, it's two opening songs are absolutely amazing and are among my favorites, neither of which you will be able to find on Youtube, because F@#!$!@#@! A@%!@$ LICKING COPYRIGHT!!!!!\\n\\n\r\n[We Are Having Technical Issues, Please Standby!]\\n\r\n*Elevator music*, *John Bon Jovi - Dead or Alive*, *Soothing Jazz*\\n\\n\r\n...Ahem...\\n\\n\r\nSo with that, there isn't much else I can say about Mawaru other than what I have said already and that which I cannot say because of spoilers.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, Mawaru Penguindrum is an absolutely phenomenal must-watch for anyone looking for something different from the norm that has exceeded all expectations and has landed itself on my top five list of all time.\\n\\n\r\n[tl;dr]\\n\r\nMawaru is different and unique without getting too convoluted and pretentious as others that have tried the same thing have done in the past, and surely will in the future. \\n\\n\r\nIt's symbolic and abstract to the point where it's almost more art than it is anime. Its characters are mysterious and unique, they all have motives that, without their knowledge at first, are all interconnected in one way or another. With an amazing soundtrack and an almost abstract visual style, it perpetuates itself as something different from the rest.",

            "content": "Ikuhara's remake of Night on the Milky Way Train is good, but not perfect. The reviews that state Penguindrum is an 'epic', is 'outstanding' and 'beautiful' are not quite correct. Penguindrum is a good anime, this is not wrong, but it is difficult to view the show objectively from this standpoint. Penguindrum has above all immense flaws. It is important to view it as a surrealist piece, post-modern and most certainly not concrete.\r\nOver the course of the story, very little is actually answered. Questions are posed without reason, and are very rarely given closure. While many of these questions are open-ended and their lack ofclosure fails to \"matter\", the audience is left with an apathy which feels hollow. My experience watching the show was less in the show itself, and more trying to figure out what was going on on my own. While this in itself is good, it's not due to a mastery of writing or plot on Ikuhara's part but rather a lack of coherent planning that went into the narrative.\\n\\n\r\nThe Animation is on large poor past episode 11, with 11 and 19 being peaks of off-model animation on-tier with Studio DEEN's poor work. While episode 9 is gorgeous and so are 20-24, the consistency in the art and animation is extremely low and as a result there is a schism in the way the story is presented.\\n\\n\r\nThat all being said, Penguindrum was a fun journey and I would recommend it. The faults are almost purely technical, and despite having no real closure nor a consistent plot, Ikuhara managed to rewrite Night on the Milky Way train well enough to make it enjoyable.\\n\\n\r\nI'm not sure, however, if it will stand up to a marathon-run, as the very inconsistent nature of the show benefited from the week-long wait.",

            "content": "Let me talk about birds of paradise. Male birds of paradise are gifted with astonishing feathers. The feathers would be considered impractical if they weren\u2019t vital for winning a mate. Of course, male birds of paradise can\u2019t win over those picky females with feathers alone. No, they have to dance, uniquely and often awkwardly, and the female will judge. And the males get turned down. A lot.\r\nDo you see what I\u2019m saying? Mawaru Penguindrum is more like a bird of paradise than a penguin. Is it a dazzling, befuddling spectacle? Certainly. Will it woo you? That depends. This isn\u2019t a show for everyone.\r\nMawaru Penguindrum isabout a trio of siblings: Kanba, Shoma, and their sister Himari. Himari is a sickly girl, and in the first episode, she succumbs to her mortal illness. But then, a crass, penguin-shaped hat restores her life, and tells the brothers it will do so permanently... provided they find the elusive \u201cPenguindrum.\u201d\\n\\n\r\nIf that sounds weird, it gets weirder. The wild-goose chase for the Penguindrum leads the brothers onto the paths of actresses, bird watchers, bunnies, and terrorists. The story shifts from a darkly comedic mystery to a grueling character study to a heartbreaking drama, with these elements only loosely tied in the finale. It\u2019s not easily processed on the first go.\\n\\n\r\nIf that sounds like pacing problems, well, it\u2019s a bit more complex than that. If Penguindrum was a conventional anime, then yeah, you could flat-out call it pacing problems. But Penguindrum, thankfully, isn\u2019t trying to be a conventional anime. If anything, it plays out more like a magical realist novel, specifically a Haruki Murakami one.\\n\\n\r\nTo those who aren\u2019t acquainted with Murakami, he\u2019s a contemporary Japanese author who specializes in magical realism. In his novels, grounded characters wander through bizarre events as if they\u2019re just everyday life. The characters start with a goal, but they meander and meander before they finally achieve it, in the most unexpected way, at the very end. But that meandering in the middle isn\u2019t filler. It\u2019s reflective of the story\u2019s theme, and it\u2019s meant to flesh out multi-dimensional characters. And social commentary brims on every word.\\n\\n\r\nPenguindrum isn\u2019t shy about the Murakami influence. The show references the author many times, from the direct mention of Murakami\u2019s short-story \u201cSuper Frog Saves Tokyo\u201d to addressing the more prevalent themes in Murakami's works, such as terrorism.  And, as a magical realist novel, Penguindrum isn\u2019t bad. It never reaches, say, Murakami\u2019s depth (kind of hard to when you have penguins propelled by their farts), but like a good novel, it\u2019s planned and symbolic. There\u2019s thought put into every detail--from the repetition of certain images to the meaning behind characters\u2019 names. It\u2019s funny, too.\\n\\n\r\nAnd at its heart, much like a Murakami novel, Penguindrum is social commentary. What is the meaning of fate? Why are innocent people subject to the cruel whims of society? What is the meaning of family and true love? Why do we compartmentalize those two concepts into different boxes, instead of allowing them to overlap? And then of course, there\u2019s the concept of morality. What is right in the world? Is terrorism justified? Is cursing those close to them justified? These aren\u2019t easy topics to address in any medium, let alone anime, and Penguindrum does a solid job.\\n\\n\r\nThe problem? Penguindrum isn\u2019t a book. It\u2019s an anime, and there are different expectations for it. For one, it\u2019s not packaged in one-go, and for another, people rarely watch anime for social commentary, especially not at the cost of character and plot development. That\u2019s not to say Penguindrum doesn\u2019t take advantage of its medium. The visuals are beautiful and imaginative; the music is addictive and well-employed. Sure, some episodes take budget cuts (as expected of a twenty-four episode series), but this is one of the best-and-unique-looking shows this year. \\n\\n\r\nBut story-wise, this show is immensely frustrating. You can\u2019t watch this show for sheer entertainment, or characters you\u2019ll love whole-heartedly, or a plot where every twist will be explained. Ikuhara stresses shocking plot twists over character development and logic, and he repeats these plot twists until they lose their shock value. Slick literary tricks are often more confusing than symbolic, and no, it\u2019s not cool to blast away important plot points as red herrings. The middle wanders like it\u2019s going nowhere, and the second half is nothing like the first half. Penguindrum knows what it wants to do, but it doesn\u2019t want you to know for sure, even at the very end.\\n\\n\r\nSo, yes, the show will even annoy the fans it engrosses the most. Even so, Penguindrum is an applaudable effort. Look, how many anime try to be a novel instead of an anime? How many anime bring up mature, taboo subjects, and address them in an absurd-but-relevant way? How many anime fuse realistic human drama with hilarious penguin gags? Penguindrum isn\u2019t a show for everyone. But is it a show worth trying? Yes. Who knows? You might just fall in love.",

            "content": "Mawaru Penguindrum is a roller-coaster of a show. I recently rewatched Mawaru Penguindrum, so I've decided to update my review. \r\nStory: The story starts off as a slow, almost slice-of-life drama. Characters (and their weird quirks) are introduced and start interacting with each other. Some comedy hijinks ensue, and help to flesh out the characters a bit. After a handful of episodes, the series starts dropping hints and foreshadows the dark twists and turns the series will take.\r\nIt's a mood whiplash to say the least. What was once a charming story about cute kids and cute penguins delves into more serious and heavy themes: death,sacrifice, fate, rape, to name a few. Watching the mysteries unravel is absolutely gripping, and once the cliffhanger endings start you will not want to stop.\\n\\n\r\nArt: The backgrounds and main characters are very colorful. The art style in the show is beautiful, and lends a very fanciful feel to the bizarre story. The animations are smooth, and there is minimal reused/stock footage.\\n\\n\r\nThe decision to make the background characters generic gray \"bathroom\" shapes is funny. It offers a stark contrast to the colorful world the story takes place in. It also helps because you know you don't have to pay attention to those background characters.\\n\\n\r\nSound: The music is one of the best parts of the show. The openings, endings and OST are gorgeous. With no unifying theme for the score, the music ranges from jazz, to pop, to blues, to almost western. The mix of music complements the show perfectly.\\n\\n\r\nThis is one show where I strongly suggest you watch the original Japanese dub. The English dub is simply atrocious. Not the fault of the actors themselves, but rather the casting choices. A 17 year old boy sounds like he's 35, and an authoritative, demanding princess sounds bored and monotone. The casting is fraught with poor choices, and the English dub suffers for it.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: Over the course of the series, the development of the 3 siblings, and the many other side characters are handled very well. Many of the side characters get episodes dedicated to them, and it is rewarding to watch. The well-developed side characters really help the 3 siblings drive the story forward. The siblings' development is slow and gradual, and by the end of the series it's easy to see how the circumstances they found themselves in had affected them (both good and bad). Their family history is also explored, and adds a lot to the understanding of their actions.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: A beautiful-looking, gorgeous-sounding, mind-screwing show that should be enjoyed by more people. \\n\\n\r\nTL;DR 5 words/phrases to describe Mawaru Penguindrum:\\n\\n\r\nadorable penguins, strong sibling bond, mindf**k, great characters, cool music\\n\\n\r\nPersonal: I loved Penguindrum, but absolutely hated Utena. I hated the characters, the art, the music, the story and the constant stock footage. I almost didn't watch Penguindrum. I urge people who may feel the same way as me to give Penguindrum a chance. It far surpasses Utena in my opinion.",

            "content": "\"Destiny, if everything is predetermined then your gods must be incredibly unfair and cruel.\"\r\nEvery event in our lives leads down a different track, each path laid out before us or so we would believe. Each decision you make can ultimately decide your final destination, but those around you can drastically change where you end up.\r\nMawaru Penguindrum is a bit of a novelty, it leaves many clueless and frustrated while others find it pure inspiration. Being what it is though, I found it enjoyable but extremely difficult to follow along with.\r\nOf course there are cons and pros to everything so lets start out with what wasall good.\\n\\n\r\nSome people call the plot genius and unique, I found it to be very unique myself. Basically almost everyone in our cast is out to find this penguindrum for a means to their own ends, saving a life or bringing back another. The main characters we will call: 1, 2, and 3 simply reflecting their alter ego penguin sidekicks, mainly 2 brothers and their sister. These three self proclaimed siblings live in a small shack going about their daily lives until death strikes the sister. Along comes a magical penguin hat, a catchy theme song, and a bossy entity. This entity tells the boys they must obtain the penguindrum or suffer the death of their sister. Off to a fair start already, plenty of drama and some moments of action. Feels almost like a broadway play, it watches like one too. Some funny moments were thrown in as well like the random western scene, totally going off the map but its still funny. Sadly like some others I know of, due to its confusing plot I was tempted to drop it early. Thankfully I didn't drop it.\\n\\n\r\nLets dive deeper into the characters. To me I felt that the characters backgrounds were touched upon a little too much. A majority of the flashbacks gave some insight on who a person was, but the flashbacks took up a good portion of screentime, could have left out some of that. The toughguy brothers, our pretty older couple, and the red head with her \"Crush them\" catch phrase. Their persons were not rushed though which I was thankful for, each bit of detail came out gradaully so you didn't have to overload all in one go. You learned who belonged to who and about a mysterious child broiler that bonded so many of our cast at a young age. Another star, Momaka, has a pretty good amount of attention given though already dead. Her dairy was orginally thought to be the penguindrum because of its supernatural powers. To take and to give anything one person desires. Oh, lets not forget the penguins in the background, they were pretty funny at times if you stopped to watch them.\\n\\n\r\nNow what orginally caught me was a part of the art and the musical scores. These being the theme songs and the awkward shojo animation style.\\n\\n\r\nYou always knew that song was coming when the hat would signal \"Survival Strategy\". A fairly catchy tune and great animation to go with it, not that a song ever goes good with any video though. The opening theme songs are enjoyable, I do prefer the second one though. I have a hard time following the ending themes because there are many of them but many people pass end themes nowadays so its out of mind. But to be perfectly honest the art style being shojo will turn some of your viewers away, a big percentage of anime fanbase are males. I have a hard time with all the bubbly and sparkle moments that are bombshelled on random scenes, and look at those eyes. Its still pleasent to watch though not being a blown out of proportion shounen genre.\\n\\n\r\nI was forced to pull my hair out from utter confusion during some episodes. On top of it all I had to rewatch a thing or two just to understand it.\\n\\n\r\nKeeping the audiece thrilled and keeping them guessing was both  a strong and weak point. The plot was really difficult to follow, some things explained later, some exposed later. The whole penguindrum thing drove me crazy from the start. The insane amount of scene transitions and flashbacks got to me after a while, and they did annoy. A typical good plot starts out slow, rises up, blows up in yours face then slows to a stop. Im not sure if this was broken up into arcs or what but it felt like a rocky mountain trail, easy in some places hard in others. You need to hook strong or lose viewers, this did a bit of hooking and casting. Yes, it was hard to follow with bits of information being placed randomy about its story. The ending felt a little rushed and too many pieces were brought into light near climax. One other annoying thing to point out was the lack of background characters. In some busy scenes all that was shown were silly little stick figures. This was severly distracting and made me feel like I was watching something they decided to cut budget on.\\n\\n\r\nTo be perfectly honest though, I did enjoy this up to the end, I could definitly use a rewatch simply just to understand the story. If you want something unique that takes risks give Mawaru Penguindrum a go.",

            "content": "Mawaru Penguindrum (Penguindrum) was strange, and I don\u2019t mean that in a bad way. I mean strange as in different. Everything from its art to the way it tells it\u2019 story isn\u2019t something that you would typically see in an anime. It also uses a lot of symbolism. So much so that there are entire articles (Spoilers) analyzing different uses and interpretations of the themes and symbols that Penguindrum uses. This series definitely stands out from a lot of anime that I\u2019ve watched, but does its uniqueness end up helping or hurting it in the long run?\r\nStory:\r\nMawaru Penguindrum\u2019s story revolves around fate. When a sickgirl named Himari passes away, she is revived by an otherworldly being who tasks her brothers, Kanba and Shouma, to find an mysterious object called the Penguin Drum in exchange for her temporary revival. The story follows the three siblings, as well as other people the meet and encounter along the way, in their search for the Penguin Drum. As I pointed out earlier, the story is filled with symbolism, and that\u2019s the first real issue I have with it.\\n\\n\r\nThe story isn\u2019t told in a traditional way. It just throws you right into the middle of it with no background information, and then slowly reveals itself to you throw flashbacks. This method works pretty well, and does end up explaining most of the things that happen in the story, but with the story being told this way I wasn\u2019t really paying attention to any of the symbols that the series was trying to use. I was more focused on paying attention to what was going on in the story. What was going to happen next? How is plot point A connected to plot point B? How does he, she, or it fit into the story? These are the things that I was thinking about when watching this series, and I really wasn\u2019t even thinking about, or looking for, a lot of the symbolism that other people have said they found when watching this series. There are also plenty of symbols used in the story that you wouldn\u2019t understand unless you have some knowledge of Japanese history and literature. If you don\u2019t then a lot of the symbols that are used won\u2019t mean anything to you. But there are some more obvious uses of symbolism that you\u2019ll pick up on when watching, and some that you\u2019ll understand once someone points them out to you. Symbolism aside, I still was able to enjoy and, for the most part, understand the main narrative.\\n\\n\r\nAs mentioned earlier, the story is told through a series of flashbacks that gradually give you more information about the story and the characters in it. I found this method of story telling interesting, and it really forced me to pay attention to everything that was going on so that I wouldn\u2019t miss anything. In the beginning, while there is an underlying seriousness, the tone is a lot more lighthearted and comedic than the second part of the series. The first part of the series was used to introduce and establish the characters in the series, but there is a lot about the story and characters that you won\u2019t find out until the end of the series. Another issue I have with the story is that there are some moments when the tone of the series is a little off.\\n\\n\r\nThere are also moments where the actions of the penguins in the series, who often are used only for comedic relief, clash with the overall tone the show is trying to portray. I really enjoyed the penguin\u2019s antics throughout the series, but there were definitely times where their actions weren\u2019t really appropriate for the scene that they were in. Even though I did still find myself laughing at some of their actions anyway. My only other issue with the story is that there are several things that just aren\u2019t explained. You just have to accept them, and try to come up with reasons for how or why certain things happen in the story.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation:\\n\\n\r\nI really enjoyed the animation this series. It uses a lot bright and vibrant colors, that really make the characters and backgrounds stand out. Speaking of which, the characters and backgrounds are really well done. The characters are well defined, and, at times, can have crazy and outlandish clothes on and they\u2019re still animated really well. The backgrounds are really well done, and are what really add a lot of the vibrant colors into the series. The background scenery is incredibly varied, and helps to keep the show interesting when the characters are traveling to different locations. Mawaru Pengruindrum also purposely uses bland block character designs for a lot of the nonessential characters in this series. Besides being one of the series\u2019 more obvious uses of symbolism, it focuses your attention to the main characters in the series, and works really well with the otherwise vibrant animation by providing a little contrast.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\\n\r\nThe sound in Mawaru Penguindrum is fantastic. It boasts a vast and varied soundtrack that fits really well with any tone or situation that it\u2019s used in. Whether the characters are happy, sad, angry, scared, or anxious the music helps to emphasize what the characters feeling. Not only does it fit the moments that it is used in really well, but the songs themselves are really enjoyable to listen to. The soundtrack also features two amazing openings and a lot of good endings.\\n\\n\r\nThe two openings used in the series are incredibly catchy, and really fit the overall tone of the series. Everything from the tone of the songs to the lyrics match the series perfectly, and are extremely enjoyable to listen to. The endings are all good, but they aren\u2019t anywhere near as good as the openings. There also are just way to many of them. The series features ten endings, and even though they aren\u2019t bad at all, I never really got into any of the endings they used except the first one, which also happened to be the one that was used the most. Overall, the sound is amazing, and I will definitely be listening to some of the songs for a while.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\\n\r\nMawaru Penguindrum stars four main characters, the Takakura siblings, Himari, Kanba, and Shouma, and strange girl named Ringo Oginome. Just like the story of this series, you are given information about the characters at a very slow pace throughout the series. But, when all is said and done, you\u2019re left with some really well developed and likable characters. Even if the characters are doing something that you don\u2019t really agree with, you can empathize with them because you know, or will know, why they\u2019re doing what they\u2019re doing. There are several reoccurring supporting characters in this series, and for the most part, they are also given a good amount of backstory and development throughout the series.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\\n\r\nI really enjoyed watching Mawaru Penguindrum. It\u2019s untypical method of storytelling, and likable characters, combined with great sound and animation made this an entertaining show to watch. The story was good, and kept me interested for most of the series. But I have to confess that my interest did waiver a little during the middle of the series, but it did pick right back up near the end. And now that I\u2019m more aware of the symbolism being used, I\u2019m looking forward to re-watching the series in the future to try and catch what I missed the first time around.\\n\\n\r\nVerdict & Breakdown:\\n\\n\r\nStory: 4.1/5\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: 4.2/5\\n\\n\r\nSound: 4.6/5\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 4/5\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 4/5\\n\\n\r\nVerdict: 4.2/5\\n\\n\r\nWhile I think this is a very good series, it\u2019s definitely not for everyone. But, if you can tolerate a show that is more of a \u201cSlow Burner\u201d than I definitely recommend that you watch Mawaru Pengindrum.",

            "content": "Mawaru Penguindrum is a story about family. It is about three teenagers--Shouma, Kanba and Himari--and the lengths they are willing to go for each other. Everything else is a spoiler. A few hints to stir the pot: stalkers, trains, abusive parenting, and one of the most catastrophic events in recent Japanese history. Frequent allusions are made to the work of Haruki Murakami, as well as to Kenji Miyazawa's classic novel Night on the Galactic Railroad. In short, it's Kunihiko Ikuhara's first work since Revolutionary Girl Utena (arguably the best anime of all time) and probably the single best anime series of 2012.\r\nIt's also a lotof fun! The three main characters all have penguin counterparts who are constantly goofing around, even as the story explores heavy topics like rape and incest. The soundtrack is fantastic, bouncing back and forth between stirring symphonies, oddly seductive jazz and idol-girl remixes of songs by Japanese rock band ARB. Meanwhile, Ikuhara's trademark theatrical aesthetic is in full swing. He floods the screen with visual details and elements in ways that might remind the viewer of SHAFT, except while the latter is often guilty of flooding the screen with superfluous detritus, just about every piece of imagery in Penguindrum is a small piece of the greater puzzle.\\n\\n\r\nIt can frequently be irritating. Many of the early episodes are devoted to Ringo, a high school girl who is polarizing at best and straight-out aggravating at worst. Some episodes appear completely pointless until their true purpose is revealed later in the series. Others walk the line between darkness and outright shock-value, sometimes unsuccessfully. The director is not above killing off a character, only to bring them back in the same episode.\\n\\n\r\nWhat makes this especially difficult to deal with is that Penguindrum, like Utena, is a show that is devoted to confounding your expectations. Not only is every character in the show more than they appear to be, but the actual plot itself takes twists and turns that appear completely superfluous until the greater picture comes into view. Keeping track of every motif and theme and detail requires an almost obsessive level of attention, along with the ability to deal with things on a metaphorical level. Not everyone is willing to give that much to a television show, much less an anime.\\n\\n\r\nBut the great thing about Mawaru Penguindrum is that the more you put into it, the more it gives back. Let it wash over you and it's an outrageous and frequently confusing spectacle. Look a bit closer and everything changes. Look a bit closer and everything changes again. Mawaru Penguindrum is a battlecry, directed not just at the flagging anime industry but at society itself. Granted, Ikuhara retreads a lot of the same ground as he did in Utena; but he does so with enough style and substance that the show's myriad of imperfections appear to be totally irrelevant.\\n\\n\r\nWhen asked to classify the show, Kunihiko Ikuhara stated that Mawaru Penguindrum was a member of the \"penguin mystery\" genre. It is both the show's blessing and curse that it may be the only anime ever made, and perhaps will be ever made, to occupy that genre. Mawaru Penguindrum is frustrating, obsessively self-referential, deliberately polarizing and almost certainly inferior to Utena. But there is nothing else in the medium remotely like it. What you make of it is up to you.",

            "content": "A BRIEF LOOK INTO ABSTRACT STRUCTURE IN PENGUINDRUM AND SOME GUIDELINES ON HOW TO WRITE THE NEXT 2DEEP4U WORK OF ART\r\n1.\r\nI don\u2019t think there\u2019s really much required reading for Mawaru Penguindrum \u2013 but Murakami\u2019s Underground is probably the main one. And it\u2019s less for the first portion with all the citizenry interviews, and more for the latter portion on the cult member\u2019s interviews.\r\nI can\u2019t ever know what goes on in Ikuhara\u2019s mind, but the immediate story that stood out to me was the one about the young female initiate into Aum Shinrikyo. I have a secret feeling that this was probably one of the primaryinspirations that went into the show.\\n\\n\r\nThis young initiate joined simply to learn a bit more on meditation. She wasn\u2019t one of those indoctrinated into Asahara\u2019s harem, or one of those involved in the chemical and biological weapon processing. Most of the time she just focused on her meditation skills and helped around with the lives of others in their Satyam. From the interview, she\u2019s a bit of a kook (believing in astral projection and that she was a man before reincarnating) \u2013 but otherwise harmless.\\n\\n\r\nSo when she found out that the entire place she was in was actually a psychotic cult, she was extremely surprised.\\n\\n\r\nAnyway, after the Sarin Gas Attacks, she and 10 other cult members decided to use the cooking skills they learnt from their life in Aum Shinrikyo to start an honest bakery. Of course, once word got around that that was going on, the police started to hound them and people started to avoid them.\\n\\n\r\n\u201cThe police still hang around outside our store. If people are about to go in, they stop them and check their ID, then warn them that the shop is run by Aum. I suppose they have to make a show of actually doing something. Sometimes the police ask for bread and we give them some. When they ask for more we tell them to pay for it.\\n\\n\r\n\u201cSometimes we take cakes we\u2019ve baked to people in the neighborhood and chat. They say things like, \u201cWe were afraid you people were up to no good, but it seems like you really are baking bread and cookies.\u201d The media\u2019s influence at work.\u201d\\n\\n\r\nEither way, that seems like the blueprint for the primary set-up of the Takakura family.\\n\\n\r\n2.\\n\\n\r\nOne of the notable things about Underground is the fact that Murakami seems to have a greater voice in the latter half of the book. In the first half he\u2019s just going through the recounts of various citizens who had their lives suddenly disrupted by the Sarin attacks. In the second half he starts to ask more questions, challenging beliefs, as if he\u2019s actually intellectually engaged. \\n\\n\r\nIt probably helps that some of the cult members seems to have the same intellectual interests as Murakami. They\u2019ll talk about how they were more or less lost in life and had to go through soul-searching and pouring through existential philosophy and all that \u2013 eventually taking the Raskolnikov path and deciding that society was too fucked up already. They chose asceticism. Murakami then makes the statement about the cult stemming from the darkness of Japan itself, rather than being its own intrinsic force of evil \u2013 which later became the main thematic crux of Penguindrum.\\n\\n\r\n3.\\n\\n\r\nThe critique \u201cit tries too many things from too many genres and fails\u201d makes a false presumption. It presumes that a work in question has decided to actively engage with a so-and-so genre thoroughly. So it presumes that the goals of the work in question had to do with sustaining the standard of the genre in question.\\n\\n\r\nAn example where the critique is valid (in view of success): \u201cSteins;Gate has a lengthy stretch that is definitively Slice of Life, and a lengthy stretch that is definitively Thriller Action. It has sustained the standards of both genres, and thus it can count as a show that successfully integrates both genres.\u201d\\n\\n\r\nYet, for a show that merely co-opts elements but never sets itself up as a hoping to live up to those standards, but has a completely different standard altogether to aim for \u2013 the criticism fails. It makes about as much sense as saying that Italo Calvino\u2019s \u201cIf On A Winter\u2019s Night A Traveler\u2026\u201d failed as a whole because it was unable to finish the various genres that existed within the framework of the book.\\n\\n\r\nSame applies for the criticism \u201cfails to comment thoroughly on social issues it brings up\u201d. Which was, incidentally, one of the attacks made against the famous and popular Annie Hall by Woody Allen. Critics lambasted the movie for failing to deal with the issue of Annie\u2019s drug abuse \u2013 despite the fact that it was a great romcom and commentary on relationship issues in general.\\n\\n\r\nMawaru Penguindrum is a series that seems to do a lot of things in a lot of genre, but, really, it aims only at one primary thing. It co-opts all those parts together to primarily answer a single existential theme \u2013 Fate and our effect on others.\\n\\n\r\n4.\\n\\n\r\nOf course, the thing about existential themes is that they\u2019re abstracted enough to unfold in a variety of ways. This is because existential themes erupt from life due to a simple problem. The fact that we\u2019re bound to a physical plane but we \u2018feel\u2019 something reaching outwards towards higher stuff. Some of us choose to ground these things through Mythologizing. Others choose to formalize it in the form of things like Logic or Mathematics. Some others choose to dissolve the issue by attributing it to something within the physical plane itself (scientific reductionism). And, of course, many people choose to be apathetic towards holding a stance on it.\\n\\n\r\nWords that exist within this realm are words like Fate, Destiny, Spirit, Soul, Mind, Object, Concept, Tao, Meaning, Redemption etc\u2026 actually the word \u2018Existential\u2019 itself exists in this realm. I only used it because it\u2019s the word that everyone uses when they want to refer to these things. The other word that people usually use is \u20182deep4u\u2019.\\n\\n\r\nAnd Penguindrum is primarily concerned with things at this level. It uses a social issue (Aum Shinrikyo) as a base to create the setting, then does whatever it takes to build up until it manages to come up with a structure reaching out to that. Furthermore, due to Ikuhara\u2019s general interest in fairy tales and general mythologies, the structure is a Mythologic one.\\n\\n\r\n4.\\n\\n\r\nI will now tell you the secret of how to create 2deep4u works.\\n\\n\r\nThe answer is to find a basic mythological structure, distill it into primary symbols, and then replace those symbols with random things like ice-cream and roses. Then proceed to build your plot around that new mythological structure.\\n\\n\r\nUsing an old example from Plato\u2019s Symposium: At first human beings were two bodies joined into one. Then Zeus became angry and used his thunderbolts to split them apart. Thus both parts are now running all over the world searching for each other, which is the key to love.\\n\\n\r\nIf I were Ikuhara, I would first distill each part of the myth to a primary movement. Union \u2013 Separation \u2013 Seeking. The abstract undertone of this myth is the idea of \u2018Connection\u2019, that strange fact that we can innately feel such a deep bond with something that exists outside of us, yet also the paradox that we can never really co-opt fully what goes on in their mind. The Symposium myth changes this fact into a Curse From God. (Eva, for that matter, changes this fact into an alien invasion)\\n\\n\r\nMy Improvised Ikuhara plot goes like this: In a rose covered school with shojo-esque graphics, Heroine A is a member of the Tennis Club. Then a new teacher, Heroine B, arrives and takes over the club and sets up a new school tennis tournament with the final goal to reach \u201cThe Serve Of Reunion\u201d. Heroine A falls into an inexplicable Yuri fervor for Heroine B and strives to achieve \u201cThe Serve of Reunion\u201d Each match that Heroine A plays is with a club member that symbolically illustrates the theme of \u2018Connection\u2019 through a psychologically and very artistically rendered backstory that they shout at the Heroine while playing their games. While this is going on, a conspiracy plot is unfolding that reveals that both heroines actually met beforehand in the \u201cGreenhouse of the Eternal Bliss\u201d where one of them gave the other a mystical red-colored tennis ball that was stolen from a world Tennis championship member Villain A. It then turns out that Villain A (who is drawn like a Bishounen) is also the principal of the school, in an abusive relationship with Heroine B, and also the cause Heroine A to lose her memories with the \u201cWorld-Breaker\u201d tennis racket. Eventually this culminates into a weird battle that takes place in the \u201cGreenhouse of the Eternal Bliss\u201d, which now happens to be cursed and overrun with Villain A\u2019s evil sunflowers, where Heroine A has to uses the red tennis-ball to shatter the greenhouse with \u201cThe Serve of Reunion\u201d. Afterwards both heroines ruminate over the fact that the greenhouse is no more, but the world is a huge place to live in.\\n\\n\r\n5.\\n\\n\r\nThe thing about the above improvised plot is that it\u2019s based on a simple and well-established myth. Ikuhara usually combines multiple things at once to form his mythological base.\\n\\n\r\nI\u2019m sure the primary mythological structure of Mawaru Penguindrum has already been elucidated by countless blog posts up there. To me, it seems to be a mix between The Book Of Job (a bet between two divine entities over the suffering of a single human soul, and a rumination on the meaning of suffering in general) and Prometheus Stealing Fire (a tale of going against a divine power for the sake of human development, and receiving punishment).\\n\\n\r\nThis entire thing is explained elliptically in a fairy-tale that occurs in the middle of the series of course.\\n\\n\r\nIkuhara\u2019s variant on the Prometheus tale is to link it up with the idea of terrorism by painting it as Promethean children who have to bear the weight of their parent\u2019s stolen fire. And, more or less, every character has to deal with this sort of backstory, interlocking into one another.\\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s made even more complex when you have multiple mythological levels and domains. Divine Entities -> Societal Forces -> Organizations -> Individuals.\\n\\n\r\nYet, Ikuhara actually structured the reveal of these forces to unfold in quite a well-arranged manner. It begins as a battle between Individuals, and then Organizations are brought into the picture. Then in episode 10 the Divine element is hinted at, before coming into strong play a lot later. All this unfolds among a dizzying spectacle of general surreal imagery and visually exciting scenes drawing (but not being tied down by) all sorts of genres.\\n\\n\r\n6.\\n\\n\r\nI\u2019m always on the lookout for possible abstract structures to create strange fiction. If you\u2019re ever trying to be the next Murakami or Ikuhara, the fastest method is to just pick up some philosophy book and start thinking about how you can replace every abstract term like \u2018categorical imperative\u2019 or \u2018Dasein\u2019 or \u2018Labour Theory of Value\u2019 or \u2018language games\u2019 with a random symbolic plot element (\u201cThe Penguindrum\u201d, \u201cThe Diary\u201d, \u201cThe End Of The World\u201d, giraffes, candy-canes, Christmas Trees, blueberries, toilets) and create your own post-modern mythological structure. Then tack on the rest of your characters to react against or elucidate that mythological structure.\\n\\n\r\n(I think changing abstract structures into action packed magic-lingo heavy action scenes is something that Kinoko Nasu has been making an entire career out of)\\n\\n\r\nThen there\u2019s basing it on already existent mythologies of course, like the Bhagavad-Gita, Taoist Koans, Chinese & Indian & Japanese & Greek & Egyptian & Norse Mythologies, Gnosticism (a fan favorite), Faust, Peer Gynt, Lovecraftian mythology.\\n\\n\r\nWriters who have already chunked a good deal of the stuff into their own works would be Hesse, Borges, Kafka, or analyzers like Freud, Carl Jung, Joseph Campbell, Ligotti (True Detective used Conspiracy Against The Human Race) or Julius Evola. Alice in Wonderland and Kenji Miyazawa are also fan-favorites. If you want to be obscure, steal from Carl Sandburg\u2019s Rootabaga Stories. Maybe some concepts from Akutagawa \u2013 who also loved appropriating stories from varied myths.\\n\\n\r\nAlternatively, some poets have already done half of the work for you \u2013 such as Wallace Stevens in his major long philosophical poems: \u201cNotes On A Supreme Fiction\u201d, \u201cEsthetique Du Mal\u201d, \u201cThe Owl In the Sarcophagus\u201d, \u201cSunday Morning\u201d etc\u2026\\n\\n\r\nYou can probably find good choices to steal from in Romanticist Poets, Plath, T.S Eliot (Four Quartets), John Donne (both Poems and Sermons), Rilke, Holderlin, Edgar Allen Poe, and the Fitzgerald Rubaiyat.\\n\\n\r\nOne of the reasons why Nietzsche has influenced so much out there is because he\u2019s also done half the work for you in Thus Spake Zarathustra. Also he has about 5 or so sparring ideologies inside him, so there\u2019s plenty of material to work with. Kierkegaard wrote in an idiosyncratic style where he took on several different writing styles for characters embodying completely different ideas, so he may work too. I\u2019m sure someone can come up with something from his \u201cThe Immediate Erotic Stages or the Musical Erotic\u201d since it splits up nicely into three different parts each based on a Mozart Opera\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of Music, you can even steal structures from Symphonies. Mahler Symphony 1, for example, has programmatic notes for each movement based on a poetic concept.\\n\\n\r\n7.\\n\\n\r\nYet, even with an abstract structure, the trick is to create enough of a sense of disbelief to allow the higher stuff to flow in. That\u2019s where the actual art part comes in.\\n\\n\r\nWell, if you don\u2019t have the animation skills of Ikuhara or the writing style of Hesse \u2013 it\u2019s probably not going to help much. If you\u2019re cheap, follow what the Wuxia genre set up and turn it all into humongous battles of people screaming poetry, sword moves, death and magic at each other.\\n",

            "content": "Before I start let me just say this isn't my first review on Mawaru Penguindrum. I'm actually remaking my first review of it since....I felt it didn't do the show much justice. At least, not as much as it should have. Because really, I think this is an anime that gets better and better everytime I  re-watch it. I believe that it's truly a work of art. And I'm gonna explain why in much more detail this time.\r\nStory: The Takakura Siblings, Sh\u014dma, Kanba and Himari live together in a doll-house like home. When they hear that Himari doesn't have much time to live, thetwo brothers decide to take her to the aquarium where Shoma gets her something that will change their lives forever. Suddenly, Himari collapses and dies as they take her to the hospital. Just when they think all hope is lost, the penguin hat actually revives Himari letting her live again. The catch though? The Penguin Spirit wants the two brothers to search for something called \"The Penguin Drum\", in order to make her resurrection permanent. Their first clue of finding it is to follow a girl named Ringo Oginome who holds a diary that can predict the future. From their the three siblings go through a quest of fate, destiny, and hidden agendas in order to save Himari.\\n\\n\r\nNow after hearing the premise your first thought would be that it sounds.......weird. And, yeah. It IS weird. I haven't even brought up the little Penguin servants that each Takakura receives through some package. But what really makes this show shine is despite all the weirdness it has, there's still has a lot of realism to it. Like you can identify or at least understand what all the characters have to go through over the course of the show, learning their back stories and their motives. And their told through countless flashbacks for each episode which could use some getting use to at first. But you quickly don't mind cause with each flashback, you learn something new about that character and understand them a lot more. That and this series is full to the brim of symbolism. Whether it be real life, Biblical, or even Taoism, it's executed in a smart and subtle way. Plus, it really has that message saying \"You will always go through hard times, whether you like it or not.\" Or how the series would call it \"Punishment\". Happier times won't always come when you want them too, and when they do, they usually don't come the way you wanted them too at first. But the best you can do is come to terms with it, in order to be happy. Though if theirs one flaw I could point out with the story is that it can get confusing at times. Not that they're any plot holes (or at least none I could find) but it's filled to the brim with so much symbolism, and juggles a lot of subplots together, that I can see this getting confusing for some people. Believe me, it was like that for me at first. And that especially goes to the ending with while I still found it fantastic, it does take a second viewing to fully understand it. Provided you enjoyed it the first time. But aside from that, this is a magnificent piece of writing.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: Astonishing visuals. The studio Brain's Base, they need to do more shows. Each episode always has something beautiful to look at. Whether it be the backgrounds, the subway scenes, flashbacks, or each time the siblings have a \"Survival Tactic\". This is similar to the famous stairway scene from it's sister show, Revolutionary Girl Utena. But you quickly won't mind cause it's beautifully animated and has a great song to go along with it. And then they're the character designs, which has your typical anime style, but it never feels too generic and has it's own identity to it. The Utena influence really does shine here.\\n\\n\r\nSound: One of the best soundtracks I've ever heard. I sometimes think I'm listening to classical music. Of the two opening themes, the second has to be my favorite. It's both soothing and exciting to listen too and it gives you an idea of what the shows like. But the same can be said with the first one as well. The ending song is also good which would sometimes has some unique rendition. As for the second half of the show, it would usually have a random song by the fictitious band Triple H. Which complements the show very well.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Aside from the story, this is what defines Penguindrum. This is one of the most well written and developed character casts I've ever seen. The Takakura Siblings have to be my favorite anime trio of all time, with Shoma being my favorite of them. Mainly cause I can see a lot of myself in him. There's also Himari, who's just so lovable and you do want her to end up okay at the end. Kanba also has a lot to like in him. At first glance he's a ladies man but you learn that he's serious and determine to find what will keep his sister alive. You really get the sense that these are true loving siblings to each other. But they're just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to the other characters. I'm being bold when I say this, but Ringo Oginome has perhaps the best character development I've ever seen. At first glance, she's very disturbed and can be very grating (Even if you get an idea why she is the way she is) but she slowly becomes someone you'll truly care for. There's also the little penguin assistants, who are kinda like the Minions from Despicable Me. In which they're usually seen in the background doing their own thing and acting goofy, but have their moments when they contribute to the plot. Their are other characters like Masako Natsume, Keiju Tabuki, and Yuri Tokikago who at first are just characters that the main ones would some times have to deal with, but when their back stories are revealed, they can be just as memorable and endearing as the main cast.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: This show can get really though-provoking when it wants to be. With all it's symbolism and constant catchphrases, each episode will have you guessing and make you want to see what happens next. Making you feel various emotions, have you look at life in a different way, and leave you with a little burst of life you may have never felt before.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: In my opinion, Mawaru Penguindrum is truly one of a kind. Where most anime series would share a lot of similar story elements and character archetypes with each other, there is only one Penguindrum. It's story is fantastic, it's character development is some of the best you'll see, and it's something that will really make your mind think. If you're a fan of Revolutionary Girl Utena, then this is truly for you. And if you're able to see it how Kunihiko Ikuhara views it, you'll be left with a beautiful masterpiece.",

            "content": "This series is my introduction to the inspired mind of director Kunihiko Ikuhara who is well known for creating the popular fan favourite Revolutionary Girl Utena (1997)\r\nI admittedly am yet to see Utena so apart from the mostly glowingly positive reviews for this series I had no expectations or reservations of what to expect\r\nNow that all is said and done, after finishing Penguindrum I am left asking myself is this a show where style and intention surpasses execution or is this series something that was intentionally created to get you thinking more about its various themes / subtexts long after it\u2019s completion\r\nor does it actuallyaccomplish ALL of these things exceptionally well\\n\\n\r\n Hmm\u2026..\\n\\n\r\nPlot\\n\\n\r\nTakakura Kanba and his twin brother Shouma live together with their younger sister Himari in a small, multi-colour painted house. However, their parents are missing and Himari has been sick for many years and is close to death\u2019s door. Kanba and Shouma resolve to make Himari\u2019s last days happy and live a playful day to day life. \\n\\n\r\nOne day while on a trip to a nearby aquarium Himari collapses and is rushed to hospital, where soon after she sadly passes away. However, in a strange twist of fate, a penguin-like hat purchased from the aquarium\u2019s souvenir shop magically brings Himari back to life. But this hat is anything but charitable. The penguin hat has now given their beloved sister\u2019s body a new host that gives the brothers a virtually perplexing and impossible task in exchange for keeping their sister alive.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation\\n\\n\r\nWhoa\u2026.Brains Base, the animation studio responsible for such visual delights as Madoka Magica & Durarara have once again produced yet another gorgeous looking anime series.\\n\\n\r\nLots of words come to mind for this show in terms of animation, to name just a few. Colourful, Vibrant, dynamic, playful, surreal, fresh\u2026the list goes on\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is undoubtedly the strongest part of this series for me. There is just so much going on and so many different styles blended so well together for different reasons it\u2019s just really captivating to see something done so well and look so clean and fresh.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter designs are nice, with an overall more slender look to them opposed to other shows. \\n\\n\r\nOpening and ending themes are great, particularly the ending themes which look like gorgeous paintings fused with fluid animation.\\n\\n\r\nBackgrounds and surroundings use different styles which make the anime rather playful, for example sometimes things can look exceptionally well detailed and colourful while at other times things can look intentionally cartoony and fun with background characters drawn as simple outlines or shapes.\\n\\n\r\nThere is also a very notable magical girl transformation sequence throughout this series which is fun, colourful, playful and even has some cool CG elements to it\\n\\n\r\nI find the animation on a whole to be refreshingly beautiful and dynamic, making this series particularly memorable for me in that respect. \\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\\n\r\nOverall I found the sound to be very good, in particular the background themes which set the tone really well in the given situation. OP & ED themes are very good and are beautifully sung. The voice acting in Jap sounded fine \u2013 at the time of this writing there is an English dub available which I am yet to hear but I look forward to and I\u2019d say everything else regarding sound is adequate / fine.\\n\\n\r\nStory\\n\\n\r\nEhh, this is where I problems arise for me.\\n\\n\r\nIn its entirety I think the story is good and there are good ideas here I just have a problem with the actual execution of it. \\n\\n\r\nI understand that the direction of this series may have been to give more food for thought about certain topics / themes but for me this series went about this in a way which just made the overall enjoyment for me difficult.\\n\\n\r\nThe series starts off with the brothers mission to find the penguindrum, then the story seems to shift for almost half of the core series to another related character and her weird crush on a teacher and then finally for the last half we slowly get revelations told in continuous (and at times extremely annoying) exposition which in particular, totally derailed the flow of the story for me.\\n\\n\r\nThe ideals and thought provoking plots in here are actually very good but for me the execution was just too erratic and purposefully unorganized to make this show an anime that \u201cgoes against the grain\u201d in all aspects\\n\\n\r\nIf you want to be different from the countless vanilla animes out there nowadays I\u2019m cool with it but sometimes simplicity in storytelling makes things that much easier to enjoy BUT in saying that I know there are people who enjoy a more complicated (if not convoluted lol) way of storytelling and to this animes credit I don\u2019t feel like it was pretentious or fake about anything. I just think it does things in a way you are either going to appreciate / study or ultimately get a bit frustrated with\\n\\n\r\nSo, in a nutshell I\u2019d say I enjoyed the core story itself but would have preferred a more simplified execution of storytelling, there was just too much exposition littered throughout the series filling in the majority of the core plot which for me is not on\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters\\n\\n\r\nOn the whole I found this series to have a very likeable and believable cast of characters. However yet again the implementation of the story brings up some inconstancies with them\\n\\n\r\nNotably for me, the character development for a lot of the characters are erratic to non-existent, based on the fact that as the series progresses you find out (through later revelations) that from the very beginning most characters were not being their true selves which means in the blink of an eye (particularly in the last quarter of the series) characters personalities just change abruptly and you just have to accept it based on the new story revelations hence no actual character development just characters showing their \u201ctrue face\u201d so to speak. This is not a completely negative criticism to be honest just a different way to portray characters in a story which I have mixed feelings about\\n\\n\r\nSaying that though, the cast of characters are very likeable and I actually found them to be realistic in their motivations and reasoning\u2019s.\\n\\n\r\nThere is alot of playful banter and honest emotions conveyed through the characters which I have to praise, but again it\u2019s hard to say the characters actually developed throughout the show \u2013 its better if I just say I enjoyed watching the characters interactions and observing how they dealt with the issues / plots that went on throughout the series run which was handled well enough.\\n\\n\r\nYeah so, suffice to say this show does things differently with its characters so admittedly its harder for me to identify clear negatives / positives about them but for what it\u2019s worth they are all portrayed very well and convincingly enough so I can\u2019t say anything was done badly at all there\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment\\n\\n\r\nOverall I\u2019d say I enjoyed it okay. I do kinda wish the story was implemented a bit more linearly to make the overall story experience more fluid but to be honest all the aesthetics made up for a lot of my frustration with the execution and kept me watching through to the end which was decent enough \\n\\n\r\nValue\\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s wasn\u2019t exactly a masterpiece for me but it is a pretty decent anime with a lot to like. Regarding all the subtext and things most people love about this show\u2026.well for me I need a clear story to draw me into those elements more. Call me a lazy simpleton if you wish but I wasn\u2019t really blown away by all the noticeable subtext this show had to offer, like with any anime I mostly just want a great story with all the bells and whistles attached and I could identify this anime certainly had all the ingredients. It just wasn\u2019t prepared in the way I would have preferred for me to give it a much higher rating, which is a shame\\n\\n\r\nI\u2019d say check it out if you want see something beautiful with an interesting story done differently from the countless other meh anime series out there\\n\\n\r\nPlanet Tyro Rating: High Watchable\\n\\n\r\nVisual Version: http://bit.ly/YJL5ZB\\n\\n\r\nplanettyro.com",

            "content": "The first thing that jumps out about Mawaru Penguindrum is its animation.  With its unusual flashbacks, cutscene sequences, and Ringo Production Cutscenes (easily one of the cutest/oddest/funniest approaches I have seen), Penguindrum brings something fresh to the table, the most innovative animation scheme since Bakemonogatari.  The plot is quite...unique, to say the best.  A combination of mild shounen, mild shoujo, a big dose of cute in the enigmatic Penguins, and an *initially* novel transformation theme (that I skip nowadays.  The Apollo 11 spouting out two kidrobot bears gets old reaaaaal fast), the storyline of Mawaru Penguindrum continues to keep me onmy toes, particularly because it releases its plot points only reluctantly.  The appearance of what appears to be a new subplot with Double-H further deepens my interest, especially when the two Double-H girls have been almost omnipresent in the plot (which, for some reason, takes place largely in largely empty subways, a prevalent theme seen in the animation scheme).  The characterization thus far has been incredibly extensive, especially concerning Ringo, the 30% cute, 50% disturbing, 20% pitiable but 100% intriguing character who seems to possess the enigmatic Penguindrum.  The dynamic between the pragmatic but womanizing Kanba and the soft-spoken and idealistic Shoma has not yet been explored, but if its anything like Ringo`s backstory, I`m hooked.  I have not a clue where this plot is going, but I`m content with being dragged along by the penguins (which provide a welcome relief to the talking, sassy penguins that for some reason have plagued G-rated movies since Madagascar.)  Mawaru Penguindrum, like the Penguindrum itself, remains enigmatic--but Im content with unraveling the mystery just a little more once every week.",

            "content": "Don't be deceived by the first few episodes. \r\nI initially started watching Mawaru Penguindrum when it was released but lost interest after the first three episodes, as it seemed too childish and colorful for my tastes. I decided to put it on hold and move on to another anime since I didn't think I would enjoy watching it, however, four years later I  have proved myself wrong.\r\nI'm going on with my own form of a review - one only needing two criteria for \"grading.\" \r\n#1 - Story (10/10) (story + characters)\r\nThe story was awesome. I wouldn't have completed this series in two days ifit was bad, but honestly, at the end of the show I was kind of confused - irritated even. I mean, normally one would expect most things to be cleared up and explained by the final episode, though in this case the viewers were given clues to come to their own conclusion. Most shows that come out now are predictable, I mean, I have seen so much anime that I can usually guess what will happen (this is why I start watching something and put it on hold once I realize I'm getting bored)... so having to think so intently about something was actually quite refreshing to me. In the beginning we have this happy family eating dinner together, simply enjoying their lives. When Himari\u2019s illness is discovered Shouma and Kanba work to get through it, but unfortunately it\u2019s more than an illness: it\u2019s the inevitable fate that their \u201cfamily\u201d has been \u201ccursed\u201d with. The characters dictate the story, and this story is about destiny, so keep that in mind while watching, because everything happens in this show for a reason. \\n\\n\r\nArt (10/10) (art + sound)\\n\\n\r\nLooks are most certainly deceiving in regards to MPD. From a glance all you can capture is a perfect family living in a cute colorful house, however, that is a misconception that has fooled many viewers. Behind the wall of colors lies history and the cold, hard truth \u2013 just like the world we live in today. The artwork fits the anime perfectly - the character design, the bright colors, animations, music, expressions, voices \u2013 all of it. If it was done any differently the message behind it wouldn't be the same.\\n\\n\r\nOverall (including enjoyment): (10/10)\\n\\n\\n\r\nThis was certainly one of the most unique and emotionally moving stories in an anime series I have seen in a long time. The fact that the authors and artists put so much thought into this makes it so special to watch. To be honest, I don't think I have actually watched another series with so much meaning/depth, and I have watched many many many different anime series. The proof is in my own history. I have had an account on MAL for almost five years now, and during this entire time of holding an account not once have I written a review. Sure, I've given shows good ratings, I've been moved to tears, but none have touched me like this. If you are thinking about watching this show, or have watched it and didn't like it, please watch the whole thing and do some research. This anime is full of symbols that connects the past to the future \u2013 to TODAY. To how you and I feel right about our lives right now \u2013 to the whole reason why we are watching anime/started watching it in the first place:\\n\\n\r\n\u201cThis world is made of countless boxes. People bend and stuff their bodies into their own boxes. And stay there for the rest of their lives. And inside the box, they eventually forget: What they looked like. What they loved; who they loved. That\u2019s why I\u2019m getting out of my box.\u201d\\n",

            "content": "Directed by Kunihiko Ikuhara, the same mind responsible for the surreal and complex symbolism portrayed in 90s anime Revolutionary Girl Utena, Mawaru Penguindrum is just as surreal and complicated in its exploration of the issues faced by the Takakura siblings as Kanba and Shouma try to find the means necessary to save the life of their younger sister Himari as she is living on borrowed time from a strange entity known as the Princess of the Crystal. As one should expect from Penguindrum if they've seen Utena, not all is what it seems on the surface with the many characters and elements we come toencounter throughout the series. Characters that seem hostile or friendly have ulterior motives for their actions and their personal beliefs may or may not be as just as one would think. Not to mention that while the series does start off seemingly light-hearted as we see the family life of the Takakuras in earlier episodes while tailing the obsessive stalker with a crush Ringo, there are hints to a darker side yet to come and this darker side comes full force by the time the second half of the show comes about as we learn of the true motivations and realities behind the show's characters and elements, a good amount of which proved to be quite shocking to this reviewer yet made sense considering the good amount of foreshadowing the series provided in earlier episodes to prove that something else was up.\\n\\n\r\nPenguindrum is quite psychological and symbolic in its developments focused around its exploration of existentialism, or fate to the characters in the series. The series explores the mental states of its characters as we learn more about their backgrounds and developments as they are connected to other characters and elements. It also makes use of surrealism and philosophical elements in its exploration of a number of touchy social issues connected to the backgrounds of its characters such as child abuse, abandonment, cult activity, social status and sexuality; as well as examining character beliefs regarding existentialism from their tragic pasts. The show's more mystic elements such as the diary carried around by Ringo and the strange penguin companions that accompany each of the Takakura siblings, outside of their relevant roles at adding aspects to Penguindrum's plot, also help at exploring aspects to the characters beyond their outward appearance as this is a series that definitely shows everything on the surface is not as it seems.\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of presentation, the visuals to Penguindrum are used to full effect in the series to contribute to its surreal and symbolic elements with its plot and characters. The extraordinary places that characters enter such as the world of the Princess of the Crystal and Train of Fate help create otherworldly elements to the series much like the Rose Duels and the Gates to Revolution did in Utena that serve to enhance the surreal feel that this series gives off. The show also has a penchant for using seemingly irrelevant objects and details like apples, subway route signs and penguins prominently which play a much bigger symbolic role than one would assume. It has a lively presentation with bright, vivid colors and a great amount of visual detail used in its settings and characters. For the show's soundtrack, it has a fairly diverse soundtracks as many episodes in the series come with their own ED songs. The OP and ED musical choices are J-Pop (with some occasional use as insert tracks), yet the moods are either fairly upbeat or slow-paced to reflect on the events that took place within an episode that they fit well at every point they were used.\\n\\n\r\nWith its complex symbolism and characterization, Mawaru Penguindrum isn't my personal favorite anime of 2011 for nothing. There hasn't been a TV anime title this elaborate in the execution of its plot/ character development and symbolism that I've seen of anime titles made in recent years. It reminds me of titles like Serial Experiments Lain and Utena that aren't afraid to make you to think about what messages they are trying to convey to their audience and keep you wondering what will become of the characters as they come to know more about the world they are diving into. Whether you like deep-thinking titles or any title with a well-thought out plot and characters, you should definitely give Mawaru Penguindrum a shot.",

            "content": "Mawaru Penguindrum is not a bad anime. It is one of those intellectual anime (like Death Note and Shinsekai yori) that you really need to use your brain when watching unlike some shows where you can sit back, turn off your brain, and enjoy the violence or ecchi scenes. I honestly do not think that I was smart enough to comprehend Mawaru Penguindrum, especially in the second half of the anime. I am not writing this review to bash this show nor am I trying to praise it for being amazing. I am simply trying to tell people who are considering this show what youshould be aware of and the kind of mindset you need to have before watching this show. Mawaru Penguindrum uses a lot of surreal animation through strange, psychological settings and many flashbacks (though the flashbacks are very well marked so you will not have a problem differentiating between the past and present).\\n\\n\r\nTo start here are my rankings for each section which I will elaborate on further in this review:\\n\r\nStory: 7\\n\r\nArt: 5\\n\r\nSound: 6\\n\r\nCharacters: 8\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 6\\n\r\nOverall: 6\\n\\n\r\nFirst, the story of Mawaru Penguindrum begins with two boys who are trying to save their sister from her impending death, but in the first episode, she dies only to be brought back to life soon afterwards. The boys don\u2019t understand it at first, but they soon discover a supernatural being is keeping her alive. Along with gaining three penguin companions, the boys learn from the supernatural being that takes over their sister\u2019s mind every so often whenever needed, that they need to find an item called the Penguindrum in order to save their sister from dying once again even though they have absolutely no idea what this Penguindrum looks like (it\u2019s not a drum by the way). The boys search around for a while using the penguins, and eventually track down a girl who they think may have some connection to the object. I\u2019ll stop here with the story, but I\u2019ll just mention that story really changes around the midway point of the series (much like Brains Base\u2019s other anime Durarara!! does). I preferred the first half of this series, because as I mentioned earlier with not being able to understand this show very well, the first half is much less surreal and easier to follow than the second half. Strangely enough though, I thought the best part of the series was actually around episodes 11-14 where everything started to change.\\n\\n\r\nThe art of Mawaru Penguindrum is very colorful in some scenes. It uses a lot of moving background designs especially the moving electronic signs in the subways. Another similarity to Durarara!! is that this show has very \u201clazy\u201d extra characters (the people in the background who don\u2019t do anything except be there since this does take place in Tokyo) except in this case they are even \u201clazier \u201c and just look like a colorless version of the AIM guy. The art is not all bad though. The designs of the main characters are great, and often the color is quite interesting like how the main character\u2019s house is an wide array of colors on both the inside and outside.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound is nothing special, but it\u2019s not horrible. I just don\u2019t remember very much of it. I never skipped the opening songs, but neither of them really impressed me either. The use of sound combined with a sign like they have in subways to tell you when a train is arriving and departing was very nice to have though when the show switched to a flashback.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters were my favorite part of this show. While some of the minor characters were not so great, the main characters (Shouma, Kanba, and Ringo). Shouma and Kanba are brothers who are living by themselves in a small home with their sister Himari and are trying to get the Penguindrum in order to save her. Kanba is a playboy (though more in the past than during the events of the show) who is the leader of their family. Shouma is much less outgoing than his brother. Ringo is a girl who the two boys think has the Penguindrum after using the penguins to spy on her, but they also find out other things about her. Ringo is my favorite character in this show, but I\u2019m trying not to give away too much information about her. The characters all have secrets that they keep hidden from the audience and each other, so I can\u2019t really explain much more. The one thing that did annoy to in this show was actually the penguins. They are only really useful for the first three episodes or so and after that the main characters hardly ever act like they even see them and the penguins simply become distracting comic relief characters who mirror the emotions and actions of the main characters that they are following around. This might not be bad, but when you\u2019re trying to read the subtitles while also watching a penguin get attacked by an octopus, it can be very distracting though it was occasionally funny.\\n\\n\r\nI would not recommend Mawaru Penguindrum to people unless they really like psychological anime that make you think about what you watched and consider what the message it is trying to get across really means. But, on the other hand, just because you enjoy psychological anime does not necessarily mean you will like this show. I really enjoy psychological anime, but I just did not understand this anime.",

            "content": "Do you like meta anime? This might be for you! Wait, but do you also like anime that isn't some sort of amalgam of random, not exactly interrelated themes and motifs, some for obvious shock value and others that are supposed to be maybe introspective or a commentary on society? Then you might want to rethink Mawaru Penguindrum. Or at least put it off until you REALLY have nothing else to watch. And even then, think about it one more time.\r\nI primarily watched because the same director that did Revolutionary Girl Utena , Ikuhara Kunihiko, wrote and directed Penguindrum. I loved RGU, so I hadvery high expectations for this anime, but not a single one of them were met. \\n\\n\r\nOk, so Penguindrum initially focuses on Himari's waning life span and her two brother's mission to help her stay alive. If you watched RGU, then you will see a lot of similarities between the two shows, beginning with the magical girl-esque transformation accompanied by some catchy ass music that transfers you from the already metaphor drenched reality the story takes place in to an even more meta dimension where some really weird shit ends up happening. However, while this is the main focus of the story for about 16 episodes, once episode 17 hits the story takes a hard left and it's almost like half of the plot points in the first 16 episodes have little bearing upon how the show closes up. I'm thinking its to mimic one of the themes of the show--transferring to a different fate/destiny--but while you think Himari is the focal point of the plot, she's actually not? It changes so many times between episodes 17 to 24 that you unknowingly end up on a rollercoaster of crazy metaphor and symbolism that you're just begging to end. \\n\\n\r\nTo further comment on the pacing of the story, after watching RGU, I patiently waited and waited and waited for all the pieces of the puzzle to fall together nicely. They did in a sense, but it wasn't smooth nor as masterful as a lot of these reviews and the overall rating would make you think it would be. For a 24 ep anime, you have to wait SO LONG to understand what the fuck is even going on. RGU was similar, but that was what, 34 ep total? So 17 ep of confusion of that was at least only half way through.  \\n\\n\r\nAs for the themes covered, some were done well and others felt out of place/unnecessary. You have one message thats centered around family: feeling accepted, feeling loved, being abused by parents, being fucked up by parents, abandonment. Those tied into the overall message of the story. But then theres also the recurring theme of being abandoned by society...being unchosen vs being chosen. Grooming yourself to fit into a mold. I didn't quite get how this tied into family and cult membership (I told you there's a lot going on. I'll mention the cult later). We also have recurring sexual abuse that is omnipresent in the story...literally one female character is raped by another female character but IT IS NEVER REALLY MENTIONED AGAIN. LIKE WHAT. So obviously, your next thought is, it's probably a metaphor. Which is was, but why even have that part? It didn't do anything for the story. It was just weird and kind of uncomfortable to watch because the character is literally drugged and raped and you witness the whole thing (no nudity though). There are probably other themes I'm missing but so much happened I can't remember it all and I literally finished watching 20 minutes ago. Oh, I just remembered death is mentioned a lot. It was tied in well in the beginning (first 16 episodes) but then.....I don't even know.\\n\\n\r\nGoing back to my mention of cult membership...yea. That's a huge part of the story. Feeling overwhelmed? Me too. Ikuhara is clearly referencing the 1995 subway gas attack (the reason why there are literally no public trash cans in Tokyo. Trust me on this, I was there in June and it was impossible to find a trash can) which was executed by a Japanese cult group. However, the reason for having this cult group in the show wasn't entirely clear to me. Yes, they want to change society, yes they want to create a new world, but the reasoning was never clear to me. Shou mentioned the Child Dump (lord I cannot remember the name of it for the life of me right now) and his father was just like \"oh yea thats where the unchosen children go. sucks right? we have to change it.\" but again this is after episode 16 where shit is spiraling out of control and your face will look like the ?? ?? meme with the black dude looking hella confused. \\n\\n\r\nIN ADDITION to all of this, there's a diary. For so many episodes, everyone and their momma is trying to get this diary. It has the secret to finding the penguindrum. What is that? I couldn't even tell you exactly. I have an idea but that would probably be a spoiler if I say it. Then suddenly, the diary's importance diminishes A LOT but then it comes back within the last episode but then it's not needed anymore !!!! It held the key to solving everything apparently but when it came time for one of the characters to save the day, they didn't even need the diary to do it! LOL WHAT.\\n\\n\r\nOh my gosh, how could I forget the most important theme? Fate/destiny. Do you know how many times it was mentioned per episode? Probably 20. This is a huge theme that is reinforced through a lot of symbolism. This somehow ties it (albeit messily) with apples. The story of Adam and Eve is alluded to several times but then randomly towards the end they also quickly reference the greek myth of the Three Golden Apples. \\n\\n\r\nOk, there's just too much to comment on. I couldn't do it in one review. I feel like my train of thought is so messy, but honestly this show was messy and it would be nearly impossible to neatly comment on everything I want to in this review. So basically, watch at your own risk. This is meta level 9000, greater than NGE, greater than RGU, greater than Murakami books. You will be confused for almost 70% of the time you spend watching and you will end the anime feeling extraordinarily confused about what the fuck you just watched.",

            "content": "First off, if you watch this anime be prepared to be confused to hell, also be prepared to love penguins. \r\nStory: 8/10 - The story is good, but it also is a mind game. The sub plots make you wonder what the actual plot is. Also as it began to wrap up I kept telling myself \"Okay now it'll all make sense.\" - as in one big OMG moment. However, it did not do that. It was very slowly progressed and you only got one piece of a puzzle at a time. You might like that, you might not - personally not my thing. \r\nLastly,there are some questions at the end that were randomly brought up in the last 3 episodes that were never answered. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 9/10 - I love this style of art. The penguin animations were flawless. They mimicked the people they follow well. And for some reason the background people being just like little stick figures is an act of genius to me. Laziness, yes - but genius. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 9/10 - The OST for this was amazing. Just purely amazing. When you reach the last few episodes it carries a lot of emotion in it to where it can bring you to tears.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 8/10 - Again, like the story, it was hard to tell what characters were needed and which were not. They all have some contribution to the story, but sometimes its hard to tell how big an influence to the story they have.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment/Overall: 8/10 - It is a masterpiece undoubtedly. But some of the parts were just not my thing. I do love how they mixed in comedy in some serious situations. Its like despicable me meets steins gate. I do recommend this to anyone who has time to dedicate and watch it, you will be confused - but not disappointed.   \\n",

            "content": "INTRO:    Mawaru is a Very interesting show. I saw nothing critically wrong with it, besides some pacing issues. Yet,  as a warning this show is not for everyone. I recommend it if you love, I MEAN love shows like Stiens Gate, Madoka Magica, or Lain.  Otherwise this show is gonna seem off. Its full of hidden symbolize and is harder to understand than Madoka or Steins Gate. This is because in the end they dont show you how everything came together. You need to think back.They dont explain it for you. Thus your really need to pay attention or theending wont make any sense. Yet, if you do pay attention, and you like things that make you think. Mawaru Penguindrum will be sure to impress.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 9/10: Pacing plagues these shows for some reason. Because they make you ponder. Thus they sometimes leave your bored. Yet, Mawaru Penguindrum overall is excellent in the story category. With so many twists and turns its hard to keep track of whats going on. Yet, in the end everything comes together, and nothing was what it seemed.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9/10: amazing in its own right. odd art style like Madoka or Lian, but suffers from repeating images and scenes.(probably didnt have much more money idk)\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9/10 Every song sounds like a fresh winter breeze. The op's are great, the ed's just as good too. But, ost's are a true shinning point. They are amazing. Yet, also the weak spot, as it repeats a few really amazing songs  over and over.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 9/10 Probably its strongest point. No spoilers, but  let me say that none of the main characters are how they seem or who they seem. Yet, some supporting people were not dynamic. an thus a 9/10.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10 (opinions vary on taste. This is my personal enjoyment)\\n\r\nIts is an amazing show if you give your undivided attention. It is hard to understand, and rightly so. Remember it will not explain the end unlike steins gate or Madoka. You the watcher need to decode this show to see what truly happened. I  enjoyed trying to figure out what went on, and when it all clicked in the end for me i felt truly inspired. Thus MAwaru Penguindrum gets a...\\n\r\n-9/10\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "This review may sound a little harsh, and for that I apologize. Mawaru Penguindrum IS an enjoyable anime, but in no way is it a masterpiece. I didn't hate it, but I didn't come out of it feeling like I absolutely needed it in my life.\r\nThe story is a little cloudy. Basically, the youngest of three siblings, Himari, is sick with some sort of terminal disease. She is brought back to life routinely by a penguin hat. The story kind of takes off in different directions around a few different characters. I know that there is a plot somewhere in this anime, but I personallyhad issues keeping up with the direction of the plot because it was always flashing back to past events. Also, if you watch the first ten or so episodes, it is easy to question, \"what is going on?\" One thing the show is consistent on is the central theme of fate. But other than that, I felt there was no continuous plot, or at least I was too dumb to find it.\\n\\n\r\nThe art style is very well done. There are a lot of vibrant colors and the animation is very crisp, most times at least. Himari's transformation sequence is very pleasant to look at as it is just a cornucopia of shapes and colors. Very random, but nice on the eyes. Himari's Princess of the Crystal design is tremendous. It is downright beautiful and it was one part of the show I always looked forward to. Her design is also very symbolic when you discover Himari's early childhood. However, while it has vibrant colors--such as the paneling on their shack and the transformation sequence--the anime also has some dark moments, but they fit. Where the anime fails in the art department is Himari's default design. Her attire is very dated and frumpy. She is so adorable, yet her attire is just gaudy. It doesn't fit her character. I also was not a big fan of the entire series basically taking place on a subway and the excessive train imagery. I just didn't get it.\\n\\n\r\nThere are two elements of sound I focus on: soundtrack and voice acting.\\n\r\n=> I would define the soundtrack as borderline good/great. The song that plays during the transformation sequence, \"Rock Over Japan,\" is a cover of an old-school J-Rock song. However, it has been arranged in a way that it is very upbeat and happy. In my opinion, it is flawlessly done and I enjoy it more than the original version. It is a guilty pleasure song of mine on my iPod. Seriously, check it out. The rest of the soundtrack has a very serious and somber tone to it. The openings are very \"Lounge Singer\"-esque and calming. The inset themes are various arrangements of the same theme (same melody but in vocals, piano, trumpet, etc). While it is apropos for the show, it tends to get a little trite and annoying (and easily gets stuck in your head!)\\n\r\n=>The voice acting is really well done. Aside from a few voice actors who have done previously well known works (Tabuki and Shouma specifically), the cast is basically all new. Himari's voice actress, in particular, was great. I personally felt she MADE Himari's character. Sanetoshi's voice was very, let's say different, than what you'd expect. His character design is...pretty...and his voice is very deep. It worked great. I'd say it was \"electrifying.\"\\n\\n\r\nThe characters were all over the place and I really did not find a character I really enjoyed or related to besides Himari. Shouma was the nice guy, Kanba was the rebel, and Himari was the adorable little girl. The supporting characters were just, strange. I really did not care for Kanba at all. He was brash and downright evil looking. By the end of the series I felt he was Giovanni from Pokemon (not in terms of evil, he just looked like him to me). Shouma really wasn't much better. He was a wuss, and while I can see why fangirls would find him adorable, he really bothered me. The one character I really enjoyed was Himari and the Princess of the Crystal, but after a while the Princess of the Crystal disappears from the show altogether, which is upsetting. The penguins were great comic relief.\\n\\n\r\nI would say that through the beginning episodes I really enjoyed it. It bordered on ridiculousness and seriousness. It was hilarious and really fun to watch. However, once I got past episode 17 or so, I really felt it a chore to finish it. The show just went in a strange direction. Mawaru Penguindrum is by no means a \"trainwreck\" (hehe train imagery), but it really didn't catch my attention. \\n\\n\r\nBy no means should you just take my word for it. Perhaps you are able to find more in the show that I did. I would recommend giving it a watch because the show is enjoyable. I would just caution you that it is a complex story and it is easy to get lost. At least it was for me.\\n\\n\r\nSEIZON SENRYAKU!!!",

            "content": "Mawaru Penguindrum: a can of carbonated plot that's been continually shaken for 23 episodes and then--\r\nYes. It's a mess, a very tasty, sticky mess that was a hella fun to make. But enough with the figurative stuff and let me get to the point. ^^\r\nPenguindrum is a drama, a mystery, and a psychological drive-through. Even in its first, few playful episodes, there's always that lingering, ominous feeling that truly good mysteries give their unsuspecting audience. Imagine Durarara but with fewer characters and a generally happier atmosphere. It is in this casual, almost silly plot that darker things brew while the anime subtly points them out.Symbolism and motifs are prominent; if you're anybody like me--and I'm no expert--you'll be furrowing your brows and trying desperately to formulate theories as to what's going on. In retrospect, the pacing of all of this is slow at first but by the end comes, the anime will be an edge-of-the-seat experience.\\n\\n\r\nTo complement the plot, and to differentiate it from most other animes, is the colorful art. If you haven't seen the anime yet, just go ahead, watch it, and describe it yourself. At times, it's cheerful, over-the-top, and almost silly, at other times, it's ordinary and slow, and at other times, it can get downright depressing. To say that the story and art are separate is to analyze the piece too narrowly. The art changes with the occasion, the character, and the purpose. It's a psychological thing, and even somewhat like a literary tool, if we compare this to a book.\\n\\n\r\nThere's a lot of internal conflict going in my head but I think I can say that the characters are whole and fulfilling, albeit a bit sloppy. The most important characters are entirely fleshed out and side characters are surprisingly meaningful or relevant to the story. A knit-pick is that side character histories are somewhat forced onto watchers in almost random flashbacks. The anime's style supports the very abrupt, explicit presentation of them but still...\\n\\n\r\nAdmittedly, in all of its glory, Mawaru Penguindrum is a bit ... out there. Maybe it's just me, my values, and my major premises, but the anime--in its art, plot, and characters--is too complex and deliberate. Watch an episode of any other anime and enjoy it as it is. To appreciate Penguindrum, you have to watch the entire series, stare, jaw-open, at the ending, and try to comprehend. In its depth, it teeters precariously towards pretentiousness. While it's something of a strong point of the anime, I can also imagine many casual watchers dropping this for the same reason.\\n\\n\\n\r\nI'm quite a holistic graders so let me end by reiterating the most important aspect of the anime: the story and presentation.\\n\\n\r\nMawaru Penguindrum = can of soda = not fun if you don't shake = not tasty if you don't go through to the end and open it. A sign of warning: the anime requires patience and thought. It is, though, better than writing a rhetorical analysis, and on another plus, just as meaningful.",

            "content": "\"A picture is worth a hundred words\". I remember this particular phrase been told to me when I was very young, I understood its meaning almost inmediatly but being the kind of naive person that I was, I inmediatly asked myself \"will a hundred words contrived into a single thing make sense?\".\r\nTaking a look a Penguindrum from a simplistic point of view will innevitably leave someone unsatisfied, this is not the sort of story that provide simple entertainment within its genre like being just another \"slice of life Comedy/Drama\" and I do respect that, but it becomes so detached from any conventional means to engagethe viewer in its story of characters, that it becomes some sort of incredibly confusing and bloated metaphorical hell that its merits and enjoyment lie in studying it rather than simply experiencing it.\\n\\n\r\nAnd it becomes a huge detrament.\\n\\n\r\nThe story begins quite simply, two brothers, Kamba and Shouma, have a little sister, Himari that tragically is infected with a terminal disease that gives her one more month of life in the best circumstances, after that dreaded time finally arrives a mysterious entity residing in a rather garish hat revives the lovely Himari and promises to extent her life to the brothers at the expense that they bring the \"penguindrum\", a plot device which, like many others important pieces of the plot, are entirely open to interpretation but are too obscure to draw a conclusion in anything (disappointingly, it isn't a drum shaped like a penguin or a penguin that plays a drum).\\n\\n\r\nOur heroes aren't entirely alone, since our so generous entity has also brought to them three penguins to aid them in their search, these birds turn out to be completely useless except for providing comic relief by doing some absurd tasks, but just like I explained before, they become part of the large mass of plot element that come from nowhere, serve no purpose, and then vanish to nowhere. I suppose this all part of the \"symbolism\" that hides those \"hidden deep meanings\" that provide the true meat of the story. I couldn't give a complete counter argument to that without sounding like the obtuse single tracked minded fellow that I am, but at least I'd like someone try to explain me the symbolic deep meaning of an animated penguin that constantly sprays a infinite amount of bugspray to cockroaches with a completely straight face.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the art an animation. They are one of the strongest aspects of Penguindrum, and it shows how well it works with cleverly placed imagery and colors that serve the symbolism, characters are also well ilustrated and I like the detail that the color of their hair reflects that of their personality. however the art looses a lot of luster during the second half where the symbolic imagery takes over the entire scenery making it more simplistic looking and bizarre at the same time, and it becomes worse with the constant reuse of certain animations. I thought that it was a norm that studios saved their budget for their best animations at the end, but I guess just like Evangelion you can have an easy escapade switching actual cuality with pretentious mumbo jumbo.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound doesn't have much to talk about, the cast brings their A game with the characters and both openings are really good and fit the setting but that's about it, the background soundtrack is incredibly repetitive to the point that the brain just automatically ignores it.\\n\\n\r\nTo get back to the plot, by the end it leaves many important things just hanging by the end giving the excuse that it's \"open to interpretation\" and that you should \"stop waiting to have everything explained to you and figure it out for yourself\". Now I respect a show that treats you like you have some intelligence and doesn't hand everything in a silver platter, but you can only go so far, leaving entire plot points and characters motivations hanging there without any material at all to figure them out, you could just assume that it all was an entire fever dream and it could be just as valid as any theory. Hidding ceartain elements of the plot and leave small hints for the viewer to figure it out is clever, introducing a bunch of plot elements without any intention to at least leave a hint of their purpose is not clever, it's a cheap Cop-Out.\\n\\n\r\nIt's a shame because Penguindrum's main characters are really well developed under the curse of the story, characters are an important part of the overall experience but they don't provide enough to redeem all issues.\\n\\n\r\nPenguindrum is not an anime made for entertainment value or indeed to engage you in a good drama, it's just literature material, an object to disect and study, but it just leaves you unsatisfied. If you're just the kind of person that wants to engage into a story then it's better to just look anywhere else and leave this to the elite of connoisseurs to appreciate what this offers them and just leave us of inferior intelect to appreciate the more \"shallow\" material, I have no problem if at least I've come out as a retard that got some enjoyment.\\n\\n\r\nI do not like shows that treat me like an idiot, but I hate more the kind of pretentious shows that take the advantageous position of leaving you in the dark and pretend you to examine every minuscule detail just to get some context out of something it can't even explain to you nor give you any sort of enjoyment out of it.\\n\\n\r\nI prefer just to stay stupid and watch Gurren Lagann again.",

            "content": "Mawaru Penguindrum is on the borderline between brilliance and pretension, filled with metaphors and symbolism that sometimes have meaning, but most times are as stupid as the anime\u2019s penguin sidekicks.\r\nHow overwhelming.\r\nIndeed, Dr. Sanetoshi\u2019s sardonic catchphrase is perhaps the most appropriate reaction to any episode of Penguindrum - and most of all its finale. There\u2019s a lot going on, and frankly it\u2019s a wonder that the writers managed to keep any of it coherent. Because while yes, Penguindrum is ostensibly about the Takakura brothers\u2019 quest to obtain the titular object, the anime quickly falls off the deep end as it tries to become some sort ofart-house experience.\\n\\n\r\nThe story, put simply, is a mess. The search for the mysterious Penguindrum is completely lost in a milieu of character origin stories that breed new plot threads, most of which are outright abandoned by the final episode. The show revels too greatly in having twists and turns that layer ever-increasing complexity to the story, without much regard to whether any of it makes sense. Its love of \u201cdestiny\u201d is the likely culprit: a theme devoid of any real meaning except as justification for making things weird and nonsensical. In the beginning, one character in particular won\u2019t shut up about \u201cdestiny,\u201d and it becomes clear that this person doesn\u2019t really know what the word means. Which is fine, that can and does work with that individual\u2019s character, but the verbal contagion spreads until the entire cast is using the word at every available moment to do some philosophizing.\\n\\n\r\nPenguindrum also suffers from significant tonal inconsistency. The three penguin companions that join the Takakura family are undoubtedly the principal cause, injecting gag humor into almost every serious plot moment. They serve no purpose other than to completely shatter any engagement with the story; it\u2019s as if someone were to start making fart noises in the middle of a theatrical performance. There are also a number of intense scenes\u2014at least two of which involve rape\u2014that are immediately followed by awkward humor. It gives the distinct feeling that these scenes only exist for shock value, especially since they go wholly unaddressed thereafter by anyone else.\\n\\n\r\nInconsistency also plagues Penguindrum\u2019s characters, with motivations, allegiances, and even personalities wildly changing as the anime moves into its second half. For the most part, the cast is at least memorable, but their development is sadly limited to the zany backstories that get \u201cdestiny-ed\u201d into absurdity. The Takakura trio is no exception: Shouma\u2019s naivete becomes increasingly annoying in the face of the supernatural, Kanba\u2019s care for Himari takes on incestous undertones as the story goes off the rails, and Himari\u2019s benign possessor ends up having more depth than Himari herself (the poor Takakura sister relegated to little more than \u201csick girl\u201d).\\n\\n\r\nAnd with regard to Himari\u2019s other form, there\u2019s also a strange transformation sequence that takes place in most if not all episodes. It reeks of filler. It is also obvious upon the second viewing that the only thing that is different in subsequent iterations is the dialogue. The animations, the bland \u201cWelcome to Rock\u2019n Roll Night!\u201d musical intro, and the predictable \u201cShouma-is-confused-and-about-to-be-sent-down-a-trapdoor-by-a-penguin\u201d gag, are all the same each and every time. It changes once for the ending, but that\u2019s it. The Penguin Queen, or whatever the thing taking over Himari is called, gets a number of fan service shots during this sequence, as if to tell the audience to not pay too much attention to her vague musings. The fumbling for her name in this review is not a joke; this character that possesses Himari receives no name nor explanation by the last episode, which is beyond puzzling given her importance to the story.\\n\\n\r\nWith these grievances stated, it would still be inaccurate to cast Penguindrum as a bad anime. It\u2019s certainly too wacky for its own good, but there\u2019s still something magnetic about its mysterious world. Even if flawed, there is an undeniable beauty to its storytelling madness. Beautiful as well is the art and animation, with its vibrant colors and striking character designs. The soundtrack is also a stand-out: the second OP is fantastic, and is easily worth listening to and watching each episode. The ambient music also fits the (intended) mood of the show very nicely. Additionally, Dr. Sanetoshi perhaps deserves particular mention as a mesmerizing character, and he definitely steals the show in the second half.\\n\\n\r\nThough decent enough to remain entertaining, Penguindrum as a complete package has its problems fully exposed. Unfortunately, that wasn\u2019t something that had to be if the writers had better editors. But perhaps this was destiny.",

It's one of the prettiest shows I've ever watched, for starters, and it's incredible that they make every single detail SIGNIFICANT to the plot somehow. The storyline is rife with symbolism and mystery, and while it does have some jarring/confounding moments in the development (Ikuni......), it is presented so masterfully that you have to keep on watching.\r\nAlso, it has really, really great sound editing. All the music tracks are heartrending, and all the voice actors are really great.\r\nThe characters seem to be a little polarizing, inthat some people really hate some of them, while others love all of them. I definitely belong to the latter category. I feel like the characters (which are all stunningly designed) are all loveable despite how fucked up they are, and the way the show approaches their interactions with each other is golden. I look forward to seeing the characters develop and seeing their backstories revealed every week. However, Penguindrum really is more of a plot-driven show, and some of the characters behave in ways that are a little unsavory and uncomfortable to watch--until it is explained by later episodes, that is.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, though it can get pretty heavy and philosophical, Mawaru Penguindrum keeps it pleasant to watch with its pleasing visuals and cute penguins. Every plot twist will keep you aching for the next episode. It's getting close to the finish, and I feel like even if the ending falls flat on its face (as it is typical for a lot of anime to do), I will still have immensely enjoyed the ride. It is the first show I've watched in a long time that really stretches the anime medium and turns it into artful storytelling.",

            "content": "Mawaru Penguindrum really is one of those anime that you sit on one side of a fence for, if you don\u2019t like it you just don\u2019t really like it, and if you like it you REALLY love it.\r\nThe Short Version:\r\n(+)COLORS!\r\n(+)Took a single episode to reel me in.\r\n(+)I like the art style.\r\n(-)Characters take a bit to kick into gear.\r\n(-)The story gets a bit confusing after a while.\r\nStory (6/10): The story is a bit complicated. I swear that\u2019s the first time I\u2019ve said that one of my reviews. It starts with easily one of the fastest first episodes ever, I shit you not the episodefinished and I thought it was just that little intermission in the middle of most episodes. But it does slow down a little bit after that first episode, right after it throws in a stalker, a love triangle, and a mysterious red-headed person running around with a fully modified combat slingshot. Anime.\\n\\n\r\nOne of the things I heard about this anime before going in was that there\u2019s a fuck ton of symbolism in this thing. Me being the guy who doesn\u2019t really look below the surface with anime, and just being a little bit dumb some times, I couldn\u2019t for the life of me find any major symbolism in the show, apart from the rather in your face, \u201cDo you want to challenge fate? TOO FUCKING BAD.\u201d That and one of the themes later on is about acceptance or childhood abandonment\u2026.Glad to see them extra years of English haven\u2019t gone to waste.\\n\\n\r\nTo touch on the ending. If you have a heart you\u2019re probably going to cry. Just know that before going in.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters (7/10): The characters aren\u2019t all that special at the moment, I like them sure, but none of them have that reason to make me really like them. Granted I got attached enough that in the first episode I almost cried when a particular thing happened with the main trio.\\n\\n\r\nShouma Takakura: The quieter of the brothers and the one doing most of the field work.\\n\\n\r\nKanba Takakura: The louder brother and the one keeping the house together through\u2026 not so legal means?\\n\\n\r\nHimari Takakura: The plot device of the story and \u201cSURIVIVAL STRATEGY!\u201d\\n\\n\r\nRingo Oginome: A stalker and more or less gets roped into the story, which ends up convenient for her.\\n\\n\r\nOne thing about the characters is that they take about 8 episodes to start showing signs of change, \u201cBut you just need to wait for it to get good.\u201d That\u2019s what they said with Final Fantasy 7 and I stopped that after half an hour so if you don\u2019t like really slow dynamic change with the characters, might not like the character\u2019s that much.\\n\\n\r\nArt & Sound (7/10) & (7/10): The art of the show is really unique in my opinion, it renders anything out of focus or unimportant in a pedestrian sign type of drawing is the only way I can describe it. The art of the characters and environments are pretty good though, minus some choppy parts here and there. The colour pallet for the show is really. Freaking. Broad. You look at the main trio\u2019s house and tell me if you don\u2019t see a particular colour somewhere there. One thing I do want to point out in this show, count how fucking many penguin symbols you see, there is too goddamn many.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound for the show is, in a word, catchyasfuck. The OP is one of the rare examples where I didn\u2019t skip it at the start of every episode, instead I actually wanted to listen/watch it, every single time. The OST for the most part is standard but there's a few tracks that really bring home a creepy vibe, a lot of low and slow piano and strings, and, \u201cWelcome to Rock n\u2019 Roll Night. Welcome to Rock n\u2019 Roll Fight.\u201d Best song of the entire fucking show. Also the voice acting is pretty good for everyone I suppose.\\n\\n\r\nWhat do you think of this anime?\\n\\n\r\nI liked it a bit, not enough to buy it, but enough for me to be invested in the characters a bit.\\n\\n\r\nWould you recommend this anime?\\n\\n\r\nYeah why the fuck not. You\u2019ll probably enjoy it more than me.\\n\\n\r\nGoodbye my brethren, see you in the next one.",

I had no knowledge on the concept or that this was supposed to be an anime interpreted and thought through. I love shows and movies that make you think and put the puzzle pieces together and watching the second time was extremely more enjoyable than the first time. So even if you do not like it the first time, PLEASE try and rewatch itanother time around after reading some other's interpretations and making some of your own. \\n\\n\r\nAlthough there are still so SO many questions I have unanswered, this is something I can think about and rack my brain for long periods of time. It's very rewarding when you begin to piece everything together and you begin to understand something that you didn't before.\\n\\n\r\nThe message of the story is really what makes this anime deserving of the word \"Masterpiece.\" It is so powerful and applicable to anyone anywhere and in any situation and can be applied all throughout time and for decades to come. It shows you how each individual matters and is of value. It talks about reality and how you can't ignore it but you can still live happily, even if you make mistakes and sometimes choose the wrong path. It is extremely beautiful and so many lessons and ideas can be pulled from it that you won't learn in school academically and aren't presented in most modern day television and movies. \\n\\n\r\nEDIT** I changed my character rating from 9 to 10 because I now I understand many many things that I didn't when I first wrote this review. \\n\\n\r\nPlease give this a try and then when you are done, take a little and then retry because the second time around makes it worth it.",

            "content": "** SPOILER FREE REVIEW**\r\nOverview :\r\nWhile watching Mawaru Penguindrum, I was stricken by the feeling that this was one of these animes that try to accomplish too many things at once. The art is beautiful, the animation is decent and the story could have been very interesting.\r\nBut they tried so hard, that the story crumbled. The characters make no sense as human beings, I feel no humanity coming from them. And the story which is told in a random order feels wrong, we are kept in the dark on purpose. There are so many questions left unanswered that by the end of the anime, after tryingso hard to make sense of it all, I felt truly disappointed.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOn to the specifics :\\n\\n\\n\r\nStory : 6/10\\n\\n\r\nThe story is touching, it tells us about how meddling with fate is wrong, how our bonds to one another are important. But at the same time, there are a lot of unexplained things that are brought on board.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is full of flashbacks that are trying to give us light on those unexplained things, but this is not nearly enough, and the fact that all the events are brought at random through flashbacks makes it even harder to understand.\\n\\n\r\nI feel like too many things have been decided to the the plot's convenience, rather than to the story's understandability.\\n\\n\r\nThe end was however rather interesting and it may deserve your attention.\\n\\n\r\nSo yeah, I feel like it was a good idea at first, and that someone really tried to think this through, but they couldn't manage it properly.\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt : 10/10\\n\\n\r\nRather outstanding, full of colors and details. There are some things such as the broken glass concept and why is himari always naked at the end of the visions that I don't quite understand, but all in all, it was rather pleasant to my eyes.\\n\\n\r\nThe penguins were rather fun to watch and I guess their main purpose was to distract us from the psychological pressure of the story (or maybe they were there so we wouldn't pay too much attention to the plot because it was broken, but that couldn't fool me).\\n\\n\\n\r\nAnimation : 8/10\\n\\n\r\nPretty good. There are moments like the Seizon Senryaku with its little jingle that are noticable in terms of outstanding animation. So overall, it is better than what I'd expect from my everyday anime.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound 6/10\\n\\n\r\nNot much to say about it.\\n\r\nI didn't really enjoy the openings or the endings, even though they are correct.\\n\r\nAnd sometimes I felt like the type of background music was out of touch with the atmosphere, but that wasn't really that important.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 2/10\\n\\n\r\nThat's really what took its toll on my overall appreciation.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters make no sense. Their bonds to one another change non stop from friendship to hatred, or from love to disinterest, and so on. This is not natural ! You can not consider your family of yesterday as your enemies of today, it is not human.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters truly lack humanity, I cannot understand them properly if their train of thought doesn't reach me in an understandable way. I just felt pushed around by their ways of evolving and interracting with one another.\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 5/10\\n\\n\r\nI tried so hard to understand the story and the characters that I lost myself on the way... How can I enjoy something that doesn't make sense to me ? My eyes were very pleased by the images, yet my brain felt confused all the way through the end.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall 6/10\\n\\n\r\nThis could have been a masterpiece if it hadn't been so overcomplicated / illogical. I wish someone would take it, brush it carefuly with the comb of passion and make all those imperfection go away, because I truly feel like this could have been one hell of a ride.",

            "content": "Mawarau Penguindrum can easily be argued one of the better animes of its time. Though the story itself addresses a topic that is not entirely new (are we bound by fate's chains, or can we create our own path of destiny?) , it is told in a beautiful & different way using rich symbolism & metaphors. This anime is not for the dimwitted however or scattered brained. It will require ones attention to catch the meaning of the symbolism & metaphors used.\r\nThe animation is executed exquisitely with its rich & bright color, clean bold lines, and overall pleasing visual aesthetic which its director & co-writerKunihiko Ikuhara has become known for.  This mixed in with the symbolism used not only causes the viewer to deeply think of the message it's conveying, but also facilitates the enjoyment of watching. Even if one does not entirely pick up on the meaning of all the symbolism used its pleasing to watch in itself. \\n\\n\r\nVast character development right out the door brings the viewer in quite quickly with no time to spare in the 24 episodes; not much unlike Neon Genesis or Clannad. With its impeccable story telling the viewer immediately creates an emotional bond through the trials and tribulations that these characters must endure in hopes of creating a path for themselves that may not come to be. Its completely relatable in every sense to the actual human struggle. \\n\\n\r\nWith its masterfully depicted story telling, symbolism, animation and overall meaning I feel this is a must watch for any anime enthusiast. I haven't enjoyed an anime this much since Evangelion Neon Genesis and it immediately became one of my all time favorites. I highly suggest for anyone to watch this, but especially for those who enjoy finding deeper meaning in things & the connection found through human strife.",

I can't repress full of surprises.\\n\r\nThe fruit of the future. It reminds me of my favorite anime lyrics. The word matches this show exactly.\\n\r\nOtherwise, unique and precise settings. I like Destiny Diary as same as Ringo. But I felt many episodes concerning it. A bit verbose.\\n\r\nHowever, I don't care it as soon as I know about truth. Sound like a contradiction. I expressed such words when I knew each scenes.\\n\r\nOP and ED songs of both cour are very nice. I bought Nornir, and I listened to this song. And I thought. Oh, I see.\\n\r\nI listened to this song before I watch this show. IMO, It is better of reverse.\\n\\n\r\nThere is a little shortcoming. Kanba Takakura's voice didn't fit character. \\n\r\nBecause of Kanba's japanese voice actor didn't play other characters except a certain role at that time.\\n\r\nWell, It can't be helped. Later on, he grew up as person, voice actor, and rapper. It's gladsome for me.\\n\\n\r\nConclusion. If I watched Shoujo Kakumei Utena (Director's previous show), I'll enjoy this show more.\\n\r\nThat's how much this show was mysterious, interesting, and weird feeling.\\n\r\nIn any event, I loved this show so much. This show is stunning as Psychological thriller, too.\\n\r\nI bought Blu-ray Complete Collection because I'm fascinated by handsome guys and beauty women. I don't regret at all. It's actually rad experience.\\n\\n\r\nSo, Let's start survival Strategy.",

            "content": "Ikuhara, love him or hate him is what anime fans want. Nobody wants creators who don't have a particularly unique aesthetic. Nor do they want creators who make anime in a pessimistic, corporate, market-driven manner. Ikuhara is one of the few animators who is continually striving to make art and all of the works I have seen of his so far drives home this fact. Stuft to the brim with symbolism, themes, and more symbolism; I tried to make a joke there but it is important to note that everything Ikuhara makes has a ton of symbolism and leans pretty heavily into the surreal.\r\nPenguindrum, asa work - I won't lie is pretty messy. That's the best way I can describe it. Some anime with enough analysis reveal themselves to be mediocre, unfocused or even cynical messes. Penguindrum has legitimate excuses on both sides for people who love it or hate it and whichever side you fall on is going to be determined by two metrics. Your opinions about the director and how \"woke\" or not woke, you are. \\n\\n\r\nKunihiko Ikuhara is a living legend in every sense of the word.  He directed the most successful magical girl anime in Sailor Moon and his next directorial outing Revolutionary Girl Utena is a pretty important work in the entire anime pantheon in its own right. He also has a pretty well documented personal/professional relationship with Hideaki Anno. I bring that last point up because if there is anything that has been absolutely screamed at me while watching this is Ikuhara's respect for Anno and Evangelion therein. Every big directorial project that Ikuhara undergoes is ambitious and desires to be these big genre/medium defining works of art, and similar to Anno his all-consuming passion for the visual medium and how willing he is to experiment has to be respected. \\n\\n\r\nFinally, after a page and a half of my own personal musings and background. What is penguindrum actually about? What does it excel or not excel in? The central plot point, in the beginning, is actually beautifully constructed and layed out. Himari, Kanba, and Shoma are living in relative familial bliss, albeit the fact that Himari is terminally ill and dies. Being revived by a \"penguin hat\"? Kanba and Shoma are then instructed to do one thing - \"obtain the penguindrum\". From here the story zig-zags, spins, and twirls its way throughout the plot introducing characters, expanding, and developing the main characters, and delving into traumatic backstories. \\n\\n\r\nThemes of fate/destiny, family, parenting, and Japanese societal critiques are all brought up and if I wanted to unpack all of these various things this review would become a dissertation. Thus, I will leave that task to the several people who have already talked about this series exhaustively. What I will attempt to do is analyze the various effects of said themes and plots.\\n\\n\r\nSymbolism is not used sparingly. Nearly episode is packed to the brim with scenes that need to be decoded and could not and should not be taken literally. I don't particularly have a strong opinion either way about this executionally. It is different, fresh, and definitively carved out a little niche for Ikuhara. There are some people out there that really get into this, and think it makes Ikuhara's storytelling more smart as a result. Which I firmly reject, because it does a huge disservice to a lot of other anime that are genuinely \"smart\", but strive to be more digestible. A few concepts in Penguindrum are handled similarly to Haruhi's the endless eight, where it is a neat concept and tries to take an otherwise straightforward show and plunge it into the experimental, but ultimately are not executed well.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter motivations are bad, sometimes boring, plots points serve to be predictable and a bit dry as well, and the symbolism and visual metaphors are often heavy-handed in points where the series could have been better served by toning it down. Penguindrum as a series is entertaining but feels like Ikuhara is overly concerned with his aesthetic that it loses track of the story it tries to tell or at the very least tonally snaps back to the central gist of what this story is trying to convey emotionally and narratively. That central observation is what holds me back from saying Penguindrum is a great show. Utena also suffered from this unfocused nature at points but was able to maintain focus for long enough stretches at a time that most viewers probably will not even be aware that the show has drastic tonal shifts. With Penguindrum that is very apparent and the script needed to be re-worked, and re-worked several times over.\\n\\n\r\nThe peaks of this series serve to be engaging, thought-provoking, well directed and even breathtaking. However, the 24 episodes of the runtime that this series had were seriously mismanaged. In 24 episodes of this series, some side characters are almost left out entirely from the series. Although I personally didn't feel this way there was an episodic reviewer for this series that said he didn't understand the emotional familial connection the Takakura's had for each other. I firmly disagreed, but the fact that I understand where he was coming from illustrates everything wrong with this series in my opinion. You have these grandiose great themes/messages and conflicts that eventually get resolved, but they have been so severely underdeveloped that they lose impact upon their resolution.\\n\\n\r\nTatami Galaxy is a highly experimental anime that succeeds where this show falls short insofar as it is firmly rooted in something. In some concrete experience. Albeit very trodded ground about the over expectation of youth, and the folly of a hyper-intellectual discontent with society. Tatami Galaxy still works. A perfect example of the experimental blending with a tried and true narrative. Similarly, Utena, is grounded in an exploration of gender roles(among other things) which give this series some grounding that Penguindrum needed more of.\\n\\n\r\nNow after railing this series for several paragraphs, I have to make it clear that this is a good show(if you couldn't tell from the score). Its quality is undeniable. It is one of the few anime that I feel is ambitious and aspiring to contain plenty of depth and moving parts that will make a rewatch quite enjoyable. \\n\\n",

It has slice of life kind of feel, mystery, thrill, excellent development, dense themes too.\r\nThe characters are so lovable and enjoyable. They aren't the kind of characters where they stick to high ideals and stick to that pointlessly and sometimes irritatingly so.

Two brothers trying their best to save their sister is not new but fairly fresh in anime series. Its usually a guy trying to save a friend or some concept which is usually glorified. But the feelings for family members is far more authentic and obvious, therefore it doesn't need to be glorified so how does the anime survive without glorifying anything? you'll have to see for yourself to find out.\\n\r\nThe beginning is light and has jovial atmosphere and is very enjoyable and later develops into a thick plot and thicker concept introduced gracefully.

            "content": "After seeing the completion of the story he wanted to tell with Revolutionary Girl Utena, director Kunihiko Ikuhara took a bit of a break from helming anime. And by 'bit of a break,' I mean over a decade. Having only just recently watched Utena from front to back myself, there was no extended wait for me to see what Ikuhara would come up with next, but I imagine Utena fans everywhere had a bit of a nerve-wracking decade. \r\nPenguindrum is the story of two brothers and their terminally ill sister who is being kept miraculously alive by a very special hat, which may or maynot be an alien life form. This hat occasionally possesses her and treats us to a spectacularly goofy and over-the-top magical girl transformation sequence which has to be seen to be believed. As with Utena, Ikuhara isn't interested in a straight magical-girl story though--here expectations are subverted in that the girl doesn't really do much, other than humiliate the two brothers, cuss rather inventively, and force others to do her bidding for her. To that end, she has recruited for the two brothers (and the girl, when she is in her considerably sweeter and cuter non-possessed state) three magical penguin-esque creatures who understand perfectly the commands of the person they're bound to. These penguins cannot be seen or interacted with by other people, which makes them the perfect scouts, and even better spies. Their goal is to assist the brothers in locating a mysterious object known as, you guessed it, the 'penguindrum,' which the special hat needs for some vague reason or another. (Don't worry, it's made clearer in later episodes.) If the brothers do not locate the penguindrum, the hat implies that it will simply allow their sister to die and then move on to a new host.\\n\\n\r\nIn some ways Penguindrum improves upon Ikuhara's previous work in that it's considerably more compact and better paced. There's not a lot of filler here, and while there is usually repeated animation every episode (the transformation sequence), it doesn't rise to nearly the offensive heights that the repeated animation in Utena did. In Utena you either had to just roll with the stock footage and learn to amuse yourself with it, or become good friends with your fast-forward button. Here it's not a problem. (Plus, there's no way anyone could possibly get tired of the transformation sequence here, especially with the English dub: 'Survivaaaaaaaal Tactiiiiiic! Iiiiiimmaaagggiiiinnnnaattiiooon!' It's awesome, take my word for it. Alas, the transformation sequence aside, the Japanese dub is far superior.)\\n\\n\r\nIn other ways, it's a step back from Utena. None of the characters are as compelling as some of Utena's got to be, with the possible exception of Ringo, and only then because she might be even more of a fan-base breaker than Anthy was. Unfortunately, many of the early episodes focus on Ringo with a weird intensity--weird because it's a bit strange that an initially fun-loving show like this appears to want to spend so much time with such a creepy girl. Ringo does have a knack for getting herself into funny situations, it's true, but she is the creepy stalker to end all creepy stalkers, and spending extended periods of time with her in the early proceedings isn't a lot of fun, though once her character developments kicks in she becomes a lot more tolerable.\\n\\n\r\nAs with Utena, a lot of the lasting appeal and intrigue here is thanks to the mind-bending ending, the artistic direction, and the unexpected developments and themes that crop up. The ending I won't talk at all about for fear of spoiling something, but I can quickly touch on the art and the thematic developments. Art-wise this is a pretty fantastic looking show--it displays some Western influence (though nothing to the same extent as some of Gainax's crazier efforts) and may be a bit too clean looking for some, but this was obviously an expensive anime to make, and from the looks of things, it was money well spent. Some viewers are going to take issue with certain stylistic choices (the severe focus on signage imagery and icons), but the reason for these choices becomes very apparent as the show wades into darker territories.\\n\\n\r\nAnd speaking of darker territories, Penguindrum, like Utena before it, is not afraid to challenge its viewers in ways that they may not expect, given its aesthetic and target audience. Yes, there are cute girls and cute boys and cute animals and tropes and stereotypes and girly squee moments galore, but there's also domestic terrorism, themes of parental neglect, attempted rape, statutory rape, abuse, incest (incest seems to be a favorite theme of Ikuhara's), and terminal illness. And the series has some surprisingly poignant things to say about how society ignores individuality in favor of promoting standardization--there's an institution here whose policy towards shaping children for integration into society rivals the horror of the meat-grinder from Pink Floyd's The Wall.\\n\\n\r\nLike Utena, Penguindrum has its fair share of flaws, some of which are going to be too much for certain people to put up with. (Understandably so--I find that even Neon Genesis Evangelion and Serial Experiments Lain with all their flaws are easier to 'accept' than Utena or Pengindrum.) But, also like Utena, if you let those flaws just roll off you there's a lot going on here to be appreciated. I think the thing I like best about Japanese animation is how unrestrained it feels compared to its Western counterparts. Japanese animators are not afraid to use every tool at their disposal to drive home their point, even if it means totally abandoning logic, the story, or the characters to do so. Frequently this can be frustrating, but it also allows for confrontational, challenging moments that you rarely find outside of post-modern and surrealistic literature. Just as Thomas Pynchon had to turn to writing about a sentient, immortal light-bulb in Gravity's Rainbow to drive home some important points about conspiracy theory and paranoia (and don't even get me started on the works of Haruki Murakami), Penguindrum has to turn to awkward and cute penguin imagery to make its points about, well, whatever. ^^ Recommended.",

            "content": "General Review + English Dub Review (Sentai):\r\nSeries Premise:\r\nPeople often talk of fate and what their future holds; that one theme is the basis much of Mawaru Penguindrum\u2019s complex story linking a colorful cast of characters together in ways.  The anime revolves around three main siblings Shouma, Kanba, and Himari and how their fates are linked to a mysterious item called the \u201cPenguindrum\u201d.  After visiting the aquarium, Himari suddenly falls ill and passes away.  As Shouma and Kanba turn to leave, Himari suddenly wakes up, seemingly possessed by a penguin hat bought at the aquarium.  The hat then commands the two brothersto search for a this Penguindrum if they want her to keep their sister Himari alive.  The series progresses as the two search for this mysterious item who they believe is in possession of a girl named Ringo who is stalking their teacher Tabuki for her own reasons dictate by \u201cher fate.\u201d  Similarly other characters are introduced over the course of the series including Yuri, Tabuki\u2019s fiance who\u2019s linked to Tabuki and Ringo in unexpected ways, Masako, a mysterious young woman set on hunting down and crushing Kanba, and finally a man named Sanetoshi who seemingly bends and alters the spaces of reality.  These characters all have their own conceptions of fate and what they are destined to do as their paths intertwine, all in pursuit of this mysterious item called the Penguindrum.\\n\\n\\n\r\nGeneral Thoughts:\\n\r\nMy initial thoughts after watching the first couple of episodes of Mawaru Penguindrum was \u201cthis show is completely random, what is going on?!\u201d  The execution of the first third to half of the anime was very comedic and had a sort of slice-of-life / school-feel to it with sprinkles of fantasy mixed in whenever the \u201cHat\u201d possessed Himari and spoke of the Penguindrum.  While these episodes were funny on paper, I wasn\u2019t completely sold on them and felt very detached.  In hindsight I believe a good portion of that was due to the dub work (which I will mention below), but even while watching the original subs, I felt bored by it.  The first sequence focuses heavily on the two brothers following, or should I say, stalking Ringo in an attempt to take the Penguindrum from her (without knowing what this item actually is).  While their grand plans and goof were funny and Ringo is an absolutely cray cray girl without giving away any spoilers, the humor got a bit stale for me as it stretched over several episodes.  I was not very invested in the show at this point and considered dropping it.\\n\\n\\n\r\nHowever after hitting the halfway point, the anime has a very distinctive shift in tone and overall feel.  From the halfway mark, I appreciated how the show focused on dwelling on to each character\u2019s back stories and beliefs of fate.  At about episode 20 the plot really starts going and I found the last sequence of episodes very engaging.  Trying not to give away any spoilers, but I thought the change in a particular character was unexpected but well executed and the show did a nice job at tying up the loose ends and explaining much of the utter randomness in the first half of the series.  I did feel like I missed some of the conclusion as some of the extended metaphors were quite\u2026 extended and complicated but nether less it was quite interesting regardless.\\n\\n\r\nPersonally I wish that Penguindrum had a slightly different pacing to it as I was very unsatisfied with the first 2/3 of the series, but enjoyed the last section.  In particular I thought the early episodes focusing on Ringo and her stalking of Tabuki were stretched too long across too many episodes and did not do much to set up the transition later on in the series.  I also thought that the first half was so random that when the show started adding in the various characters\u2019 back stories and pursuits, they felt like they came out of left field.  While interesting, I constantly kept thinking \u201coh that\u2019s cool but where in the world did that come from???\u201d  I felt like the characters\u2019 actions in the first half didn\u2019t really do a sufficient job at conveying their hidden agendas.  Overall I liked the anime but didn\u2019t quite love it as the first 2/3 of the anime were very trying for me to finish and get through.  If the pacing was a bit more balanced and a mix of styles rather than the distinctive funny section then serious section, I would\u2019ve appreciated the show more.\\n\\n\\n\r\nDub Presentation:\\n\r\nAs I mentioned above, in hindsight a good part of my distate for the show was most likely due to Sentai\u2019s dub work.  While I have heard worse, compared to today\u2019s typical dub quality, this one is bad.  For me there were numerous problems with this dub that added up to a pretty unpleasant experience, forcing me to switch to subs which doesn\u2019t happen very often these days.  While I felt several key characters were miscast, there were still so many moments where the actors gave odd, unnatural inflections, had wooden acting, or were too over the top.  I have heard some of these actors do great work in the past, but I believe the fault for this dub is on the director Steven Foster.  As of late I\u2019ve been concerned whenever he\u2019s announced as a director, especially after his work on Clannad\u2019s dub.  But back to Penguindrum, there were so many awkward lines that I felt could\u2019ve easily been fixed with an additional read or a slightly different approach.  In particular Blake Sheperd as Souma and  Illich Guardiola as Kanba suffer the worse from this problem.\\n\\n\r\nGoing through particular characters, Kanba in particular felt like a miscast for me as Illich sounded far too old and gruff in my opinion.  While both Blake Sheperd and Monical Rial sounded older than their original Japanese counterparts, he still came off as being too mature to believably be their sibling.  In addition to his tone, his natural accent was very heavy in places for a dub which I blame the director for as I haven\u2019t really noticed his accent in his past works elsewhere.  Blake Sheperd as Souma is a bit different and older than the original (which works for me after taking an ep to adjust to it), but certain phrases like his pouting lines come off very awkwardly and his overall delivery is hindered by these wooden lines every now and then.  Monica Rial as Himari sounds alright, but when she is possessed by the hat, her acting falls very flat.  Considering how ridiculous the Penguin lady is, her acting feels very underwhelming and has a monotonic quality that\u2019s quite inappropriate.  Emily Neeves surprised me as Ringo and was my personal favorite in the first half in terms of acting, however the overall comedy paled in comparison to the original, imo partly due to the script lacking that quicky punch this anime needed and slightly held back acting.  Shelley Calene-Black as Yuri also came off oddly.  I thought she did a great job at making Yuri sound hammy when needed, but the character has more depth especially in the latter half of the series and her performance came off as if the director was having her mock the role, sounding very over-the-top diva in places.  In addition to the acting, the script also felt too directly translated which lost some of the humor in the beginning and the impact and emotional punch in the last couple of episodes.  Small things like Shouma calling Kanba \u201cwhat are you doing brother?\u201d sound very unnatural in day to day dialogue; simple phrases that could easily be altered for a more fluid delivery.\\n\\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s noteworthy to mention that the ADR Director changes halfway through, though it\u2019s uncertain why.  I did go back to listen to the dub in the second half of the series out of curiosity and noticed the change did improve the overall quality, though it\u2019s still far from a strong performance.  In general across the board all the actors did a much better job in their respective serious moments compared to their humorous comedic places (some of the Prince/Princess moments lost all comedic value) though the wooden acting still lingers in places.  While I felt like half the cast were not necessarily the best choices for their roles, ultimately the acting (imo due to the directing) caused the dub to flounder compared to the original audio track.\\n\\n\r\nIt is important to note that the insert songs are not dubbed and the Penguins (which originally were voiced by their respective owners in the sub) have had their audio replaced with generic penguin noises which loses a great deal of their personality.\\n\\n\\n\r\nRecap:\\n\r\nWhile I know many people loved this anime, I admit it wasn\u2019t quite my cup of tea.  I loved the last couple of episodes and while it helped to save the series for me, the first parts were trying for me to keep watching.  The dub\u2026 is just not very good.  I honestly wanted to like it but it is just not up to scratch and does not do the original material any justice.  Though I\u2019m a huge dub-supporter and try to watch everything in English, this one should generally be avoided.  Seeing the sheer number of anime Sentai has licensed just this past season alone, I hope they pick up their game soon.",

            "content": "Destiny is something that cannot changed by anyone, everybody has it own destiny, either is good or bad.\r\nIt tells the story about two siblings that losing their daughter. They told to find what called \"penguindrum\" in order to save her. But not everyone can be saved, there is always many things hindered their way. At the start, you might be confused by the meaning of destiny is. What's the relation of it and why the word destiny repeated a lot of time? Well, it was the story about. How people to reach and change destiny that has destined to them.\r\nMawaru Penguindrum has a slow developmenton plot, but it will grows on you. You will able to get the feeling of dark mysterious fantasy-like that it brings. The story might be confusing at first, but then it began to revealed one by one throughout the story. And beware of plot twist, because everything will just so far of what you expected.\\n\\n\r\nOnce more that the story is unusual for an anime. It just weird. How can you make the story about destiny and you focuses on that? That is what makes Mawaru Penguindrum is so special. The story are original and what makes it really good that they can show it perfectly, how destiny affected you, your sibling, your friend and even you parents. And then, everything just turn around to the meaning of destiny itself.\\n\\n\r\nThere also a lot of flashbacks in this anime. But it really crucial, since the flashbacks will tell about their past, origins and what happen so the story of anime in present are act that way. And with no exception of what destiny described in this anime is.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter is one of my liking in here. They just absolutely mindfucking twist. Everyone that you think are just supporting or not much influence on the story will blow your mind, and the fact, they're all have influence to the story. And also, not everyone is good. Everybody has it own dark side and Mawaru Penguindrum successfully to show the dark side of their characters. But at first, you might told that every characters just show as you saw it first or I mean your first impression, but then it will turn to be not. Some characters maybe have a typical behavior as other anime when a hero is going to save someone and it shows in what I said a good way, when this anime show it in a strange but beautiful way.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is good, but not flawless. The color seems not very smooth and also the character design are somewhat not really good. Just like typical character that drew without much effects or editing. The girls are not shown to be really cute, moe or heroic face sort of that, they just typical, typical human figure. So, the design are not really special. But those penguins are really cute.\\n\\n\r\nThe BGM is also good, it matched with the scenes. The OP are somewhat strange. Usually, you find the OP is powerful and give you pump. But not for this. \\n\\n\r\nIt's good to watch honestly, even with those dark mystery it brings. There still a lot of comedy you will find and some of them are really funny. Just like a great refresher when you watched a weighted anime.\\n\\n\r\nThis show obviously not for everyone, especially who don't like heavy, weighted story. You will not able to understand much about the story and what actually happen in there. But, if you're a fan of weighted story anime just said suzumiya haruhi or monogatari series. This show is good for you.",

One is not a master piece; but a piece of thought provoking writing that is dealt ironically... (and that may down the score!)\r\nTruly, Penguindrum was notorious for its theme of \u201cDestiny\u201d with this diary that dictates to take its words into action to become someone. It starts quite ridiculous, but you eventually notice that the ridiculous was ridiculed, and becomes more, more than just quirky teenage fun with uninteresting incest fetish; but a work that mentally challenges viewers. What is fate? What is our purpose on living? Is it destiny that I'man Anime Critic? Am I a puppet of God? The show got more serious as the plot progressed and it concludes as a satisfactory finale.\\n\\n\r\nHowever! Be prepared at how these themes and metaphors are presented, the symbolism of this show is strange or even unique at your case, but 7/10 of the symbolism resides in a deeper train of thought in order to really grasp it. Like who the hell is Momoka? Was she a presentation of a perfect being? Is she a metaphor of the Earth\u2019s Saviour? Stuff like that is up to interpretation with opinion, but I must Repeat: one, be prepared to think deep beeps of symbolism, two, be prepared to be patient because it gets better the more you watch it, and three: be prepared to watch an anime that is probably like nothing you have ever seen before. (not in an amazing way) \\n\\n\r\nSorry about this, but I still don't understand with What the Hell is with the Penguins?!\\n\\n\r\nYet additively the characters feel fairly flat on some cases, like Shoma boy scout, or how Ringo has a weird explanation on when she became so obsessed with that Diary, but each character does present a theme for you to think about. In Kanba's case, there is absolutely nothing to live for besides his sister, and because of the unfortunate events that followed at the latter of the show, you see his resent for the world which can make you think about the purpose of your own life and what motivates you to being the person you are in new perspective.\\n\\n\r\nWinter 2015 is ahead, and now its been four years until a successor for this show and now it has bears all of a sudden? Well I'm so very, very, very flipping hyped. Lets hope its an \u201cactual\u201d successor or I would end up watching Lesbies doing Lesbie things doing their Lesbie bestiality. \\n\\n\r\nSCORES:\\n\r\nCHARACTERS: 7.5/10\\n\r\nSTORY: 7.5/10\\n\r\nANIAMTION: 7.5/10\\n\r\nSOUND: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nFINALE: 7.5/10",

At first the story seems like a quiet story about two brothers worrying about they\u2019re sickly younger sister Himari but this all changes when Himari is brought back to life by a mysterious penguin hat that claims that she will keeptheir sister alive if the twins find something called the \u2018Penguin Drum\u2019.

You soon learn that even their family may not be what it really seems.\\n\\n\r\nThis series is SERIOUSLY WACK. And I like it! I thought the concepts expressed through the series were extremely interesting to think about. Also the characters were all very unique and their you really got hooked on trying to discover the past. There were also a number of very catchy catch phrases that made the series very addictive. I also loved the comedy used within the series, also the artworks were unique and enjoyable. But what I loved the most was the complexity of the relationships between each of the characters. It starts off as a small circle but then you realise that there is a lot more depth with in the story and as the series progresses you begin to wonder how the people who made this series could think up such concepts and continue to surprise their viewers episode after episode.\\n\\n\r\nYou think the plot will head in one direction but then in the next episode it takes you some where completely unexpected. I believe this series has the most unique concept and over all a very artistic as a whole.\\n\\n\r\nIs a must watch.\\n\\n\r\n10/10\\n\\n\r\nSURVIVAL STRATERGY!!!!!",

            "content": "Overall, I'm giving this anime a 9 but to be honest, I have no idea how I would rate this anime. This anime was, well an experience. A massive rollercoaster of an anime. Before watching this, I had assumed it would be a little bit sad, a bit funny and really cute. It IS sad, it IS funny, and it IS cute, but more than those, it was appalling and dramatic and disturbing and confusing. For a while, the anime was a big mess. It starts off for a while quite light and bit annoying and comedic, and then it goes suddenly dark and disturbing,and then confusing and then appalling and then sad and yes it was a massive mess and I really didn't like how it was for a while.\\n\\n\r\nThat being said, I think the most satisfying part about this anime was how it unraveled the massive mess it made, and by the end of it, I really liked the anime as a whole. It gave me numerous genres and feelings throughout it all, but by the end I was finally satisfied with the whole thing- similar to when your earphones get all tangled into a massive mess and once you finally get it all unraveled you end up quite happy simply because you finally sorted it out, a feeling you wouldn't have had without the big mess in the first place. And in case anyone is confused by my review, the basic message is that it was a good anime due to way it sorted out its own story.\\n\\n\r\nThe art was really cute, the soundtrack was interesting, and I'm not quite sure whether I enjoyed the anime or not, but I am certainly glad that I watched it.\\n\\n\r\nThe only thing I still never really got into were the characters, which can be a big turn off for a lot of people. It's not that the characters were bad or easy-to-hate, they just weren't characters I personally enjoyed or liked, except for Shouma. Though the interesting thing about the characters is that there is a TONNE of character development in this anime, though for half of the characters that wasn't a good thing- for some characters I started off disliking them, then hating them and then really liking them, where with some other characters I went from liking them to really disliking them or even getting to the point where I just couldn't understand them.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, if you want a memorable anime that makes you think a lot, and question your own opinion about characters or themes or storylines and you are seeking something complex, I would definitely recommend this anime. I would not recommend if you are looking only for a light story to watch, as I had originally thought this anime would be. Its a good anime, but I could easily understand how some people would love it, and how others could hate it.",

            "content": "Mawaru Penguindrum is a very distinct anime to me. Amidst the various slice of life anime, this definitely was very, very unique. I haven't watched Revolutionary Girl Utena before and am not fully introduced to the skills Penguindrum's creator Ikihara is known for. However, I am definitely glad that I watch this series for it was worth it.\r\n\"Fate\" is a word that is spoken a lot of times during the course of the series and it is fair to say that the themes and symbolisms that were presented were very much centered around that very word. You have these various and colorful characters that startedout seemingly as cardboard cutouts in a normal slice of life anime but transcended into characters with weight and dimension throughout the second half of the series. The series started out as a very quirky anime that seem to have a premise of it being a comedy. However, this will all spiral into a very dark second half which put a lot of emphasis into the very dynamics of the characters with each other and what constitutes their own beings. \\n\\n\r\nI actually liked that it questions the mode of living or what we see as \"normal\" in our own society. This goes to the concept of the \"Child Broiler\", a place in which children become invisible. In the series it was introduced as somewhat a place, but looking into it further I see it more as a concept. A place in which society knows do exist, but let it happen anyway. It boggles me what could this place exactly be, knowing that it revolves around the aspect of fate (or lack thereof). However, I know that it emphasizes on the ignorance of society. Other aspects of this would include a deconstruction of what constitutes a family really, a part of which I really love. The series serves as a paradox to break and fortify the very definition of \"family\". Another thing that I love about this show is that it is never scared to show sensitive matter to fully flesh out the characters (stalking, repressed sexuality, inner revenge, etc)\\n\\n\r\nAs I've said before characters, with weight and dimension comprise this anime. They are namely; Kanba, Shouma, Himari, Ringo and other minor characters which include Tabuki, Yuri and the very cute penguins. Each one of them is wonderfully written but for most part they may at first appear as unoriginal. One could only truly appreciate them when the series was finished.\\n\\n\r\nThe standout episode to me was episode 20 . I wouldn't spoil on what happens in that episode but it was memorable and emotional. It was similar to episode 11 of Madoka that in merely one episode, there is a huge amount of character development.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, although the characters are amazing and the sound was not bad, I still find the story sometimes to be actually too fast-paced and the symbolisms were just too many that one could potentially get lost on what the actual theme of the story is. Some parts were also very unnecessary (although some are funny), because the end was very, very different from what it originally was upon the first impression.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, it is a 9 to me because it was really, really unique. Amidst the mechas, romance and slice-of-life animes that surface in the anime-sphere this one truly stands out and becomes very, very memorable.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "When I first watched Mawaru Penguindrum I was turned off almost immediately. From the shoujo-esque art style and flamboyant transformation sequences to the cute little penguin mascots, it presented itself as something entirely different to my normal interests. However, with some persuasion, I continued to watch and by the fifth episode I was hooked. So let me tell you from personal experience, this show is not quite what it seems.\r\nThe plot centres on twins Kanba and Shouma and their little sister Himari, who suddenly collapses and dies during a family visit to the aquarium. Himari is resurrected, however, by a mysterious entity residing in asouvenir from the aquarium (a penguin hat). In order to keep Himari alive, the entity demands the twins find and bring her the titular Penguindrum, and so begins our adventure.\\n\\n\r\nThe joy of watching Penguindrum comes from the unpredictability of its plot and character motivations thus it would do a great disservice to spoil any more of the plot. Suffice it to say that none of the characters are who they initially appear to be and the twists and turns of the plot are genuinely interesting and unexpected.\\n\\n\r\nWhat makes Penguindrum special is the way that it uses the medium of animation to its fullest potential to tell the story. Unbounded by the restraints of other media, the animation and direction of this show produces some captivating set pieces and involving character moments that really pull you into the world created here. To clarify, I don\u2019t mean that the animation is Akira level of quality (even though the animation is solid overall), I mean that the animation is used creatively.\\n\\n\r\nFor example, the 3 penguin mascots, who correspond to the 3 protagonists of the story, interact with one another coincidentally with their counterparts usually resulting in a bit of slapstick humour. As well as providing comic relief in some of the darker moments, the interactions between the mascots serve to illustrate the mood and intention of the characters that may not be immediately obvious from the dialogue. This is just one example of how the show uses visual cues to communicate the more subtle information, such as the tone of a scene, to the viewer in a non-obtrusive way. Metaphor and symbolism are used here in spades, but the magic of these elements is that you don\u2019t have to be aware of them for them to have an effect on you and it\u2019s never rammed down your throat to give the impression that the series is \u2018deep\u2019.\\n\\n\r\nIn the same vein, there are many locations in the series that blur the lines between the literal and the metaphorical. For example, is there really a \u2018Child Broiler\u2019 where unwanted children are sent, or is this metaphor for the emotional state of the characters who are sent there? It\u2019s intentionally left vague, and there are a number of occasions when the series will ask you to believe the characters are literally in fantastical and unbelievable locations which should be considered metaphorical. It makes for beautiful visuals and conveys the themes of the plot creatively, but if you\u2019re a stickler for realism or continuity it might wear on you. If you\u2019ve seen any of the Monogatari series that should give you an idea of what you\u2019re in for.\\n\\n\r\nThe fantastical elements of the story didn\u2019t bother me, primarily because of the strong characters developed in this series. It\u2019s refreshing to watch a series where each of the characters is essential to the plot and each one goes through a proper character arc. The events of the plot feel weighty and important because they actually affect the personality of each character and, as the plot slowly reveals itself to the viewer, it becomes apparent that none of the characters fulfil the roles you expect them to. Additionally, the series takes time to develop the necessary context for the eventual shifts in character motivations to make sense. In other words, the show is paced so that the character development feels natural and keeps you engaged in the series. You understand, without it being explained to you, what the characters are doing, why they are doing it and how they feel about it, and this makes it easy to become invested.\\n\\n\r\nAnother standout feature of the series is the music, particularly the ending music. Later on in the series the ending music and credits will change to reflect the tone of the episode as it ends. This probably sounds pretty minor but it ensures that events of each episode stay with you for a while after the episode is over and it invests you in continuing on with the series. The score of the series itself never stood out to me, but wasn\u2019t intrusive (except for the transformation sequences). The quality of the sound design and voice acting was solid and never felt intrusive or out of place. All the recorded sounds and effects naturally fitted with the visuals, bringing a sense of reality to the series and, while never being so good as to warrant special attention, worked hard in the background to provide a believable aural experience.  \\n\\n\r\nAs far as criticism goes, I feel as though any issues one might have with the show would be a result of personal taste, rather than an issue with the quality of the production, story, characters etc. I, for one, enjoyed the majority of the characters and how they contributed to the story but never really fell in love with any of them in particular. Also, because the direction of the plot is meant to be a mystery, the first few episodes dragged on because they lacked a sense of momentum to pull me through. I was also a little disappointed in the ending, but I cannot go into detail for the sake of spoilers. Basically, I found that the final reveal of some of the major character motivations right at the end did not live up to the standard set by the rest of the show, and while still good, was not as good as I was expecting. This is a very personal gripe though, and individual results will vary.\\n\\n\r\nOn the whole, Penguindrum is a show that has a goal and achieves it well, with a stylish presentation and quality production in almost every aspect. It\u2019s not what you would call an instant classic, but if you\u2019re looking for an anime that aims higher than the generic and actually gets there, you shouldn\u2019t miss this series.",

            "content": "Life, Death, Fate, Destiny, and Penguin Drum? Mawaru is one of those anime that has a interesting premise and emotional setting but is ruined by it's own insecurity. First thing you'll notice about Mawaru Penguindrim is the art design which is beautifully saturated in vigorous colors noticed from episode one and stays consistent throughout. Characters morph different facial expressions which changes up the consistency for the viewer.\r\n(Read the synopsis for a summary)\r\nAs for the story, the first episodes of the anime caught my attention but quickly went on a decline, especially when following Ringo's story line and even more so when certain scenes when theart turned into 2D and borders came up (you'll know what i mean when you see it). But the second half of the anime began to really pick up and backstories for certain characters were revealed putting in some needed plot elements.\\n\\n\r\nAhhh the characters we have the tough guy older brother, whimpy younger brother, innocent younger sister, possessed penguin hat, overly attached girlfriend, and a couple extras characters i can't talk about without spoiling it. There's a great importance on the role of family and is shown every episode signifying the relations of our 3 main characters and there interactions with one another; actually is quite touching at some points. But nothing too memorable in the end. \\n\\n\r\nThis is were the anime really falls apart. The themes are about big and serious topics like fate and death, but the anime never takes itself seriously .... like ever. Anytime a serious scene comes up, it shows these invisible penguins f***ing around killing bugs or eating a lot. LIKE SOMEONE WILL BE DYING AND THIS WILL HAPPEN. It's really hard to take these moments for granted at times and dramatically takes away the tension which the show is in need of.\\n\\n\r\nA very big positive is there's a decent amount of symbolism in the show and even takes some biblical symbolic ideals and stories. The cool thing is some of the message are very easy to recognize, while others are discreetly slipped in there. Noticing these connections gave me slight joy in finding them and gave me more of an appreciation of the conveying message.\\n\\n\r\nThe ending without spoiling anything was meh and of course overlays an occurring theme presented throughout the show. Overall the anime is not horrible by any means but is cringe worthy at some moments and very boring in others, but makes up for it in art design, interesting back stories, and strong themes.

I didn't even remember Penguindrum showing up on it. So when I saw the episode on a list for new shows I checked and there it was... a pretty boring picture of the penguin logo. \r\nI went into the series without any expectations. I have not seen Utena, so I had no idea what to expect. The first episode is going on, it's good, enjoyable and then... all of a sudden... out of nowhere... SURVIVAL STRATEGY. As Isat there dumbfounded at the proceeding scene I knew at that moment I stumbled upon something special. \\n\\n\r\nThe anime itself is full of twists. However, at the core the story is about two brother (Kamba and Shouma) who get contracted to find something called the Penguindrum by a penguin hat who is possessing, and giving the power of life to their recently deceased (now alive) sister, Himari. But, the anime turns out to be much more complex as more and more people are after what the brothers want. As the story goes on the characters learn more about those around them, and themselves.\\n\\n\r\nIt's psychological, the anime will make you think, sometimes about the themes the anime is putting out and other times it just messes up your mind. Don't assume you know anything about what's really going on, you'll be surprised. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter development is done in a great deal through flash backs, which sometimes take up a majority of an episode. Character past is extremely important in this series and the reveal of each characters backstory is placed in a perfect spot to make the viewer gasp in amazement. Instantly your perception of a character or a situation can drastically change.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters themselves are varied and enjoyable. Personally I really like Ringo, she's kinda creepy (ok very creepy) at the start, but she just becomes that girl you root for. There's a pink haired guy who is \"Fabulous Max\". As you learn more about each character you understand more about the situation and the entirety of the show. \\n\\n\r\nThe art work is very impressive. I'm not sure if I'm alone on this, but I'm wondering if they were budget stricken since they do pull a few obvious money saving tracks like reuse of animation, NPC characters just an outline, like an entire episode done with paper drawings (the Kare Kano adaptation did the same thing... but that was under even more problems). Even so, I have no complaints about anything. The animation is all crisp and really have a type of artistic flair you don't see in a lot of animes. If you enjoyed Bakemonogatari's art style you'll enjoy Penguindrums. \\n\\n\r\nThe OPs are generally very similar to each other. I'd say the feel of them really fit into how the show feels. However, the real champion of the music is Rock Over Japan...the song that plays during the Survival Strategy segment. It simply glues you to the screen.\\n\\n\r\nIn the end Mawaru Penguindrum delivers on every level you could have asked, and then some. Listen, you low-lives who will never amount to anything, watch Mawaru Penguindrum. \\n\\n\r\nNow, let us initiate the Survival Strategy.",

            "content": "Story: The story started simply enough--just some brothers wanting to save a damsel. But more plot elements were added...Which was fine at first, then it became a nuisance. Why? \r\npenguindrum is very \"psychological;\" the setting is amorphous, or rather mentally malleable. So anything the series threw out, you are forced to chew...some parts succeeded--adding depth, and a second layer, while others failed--moving from point to random point, and connecting them only at the conclusion.\r\nSo the series ends, and the pieces are tied together :D... but not flawlessly. Despite everything else, the solution is very well designed.\r\nArt: Typical. Nothing too extraordinary in character design, landscape oranimation. Props for the storyboarding, though.\\n\\n\r\nSound: Above average in all departments\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: Oh lord. Penguindrum's main fault is character development. The only character to undergo any change before the final few episodes is Ringo. And they did a good job; I just wished they played off their success, focusing on her more.\\n\\n\r\nThe others? Meh, static for too long. And when change did appear, it was outrageous...\\n\\n\r\nThese developments ultimately dragged the plot down. I just didn't care much for the characters.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment? I did enjoy it as a casual viewer;but there was nothing tugging at me to watch it everyday. \\n\\n\r\noverall: 6/10",

Well, even if the story is great some of the things will just happen even before they explain what's happening at the moment, actually, this can be both good or bad but sometimes it may get you upset(it didn't happened tp me but you never know)\\n\\n\r\nArt(10/10)\\n\\n\r\nBefore i start talking about how gorgeous the anime art i think I think I should aware you that i may be a little either too exigent or it's opposite when we are talking about the art of a anime.\\n\r\nThe art of Penguimdrum is extremely metaphoric(did i write ot right) and suits perfectly the mysterious atmosphere of the anime, sometimes it may remember you from shaft art style but even it is one of the most original art that i've ever saw in a anime.\\n\r\nThe colour pallet is very colorful but the colors are not so vivid, is this bad? Since it suits the art style and the anime style i think  it is something good.\\n\\n\r\nSound(10/10)\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack really is great and pretty variable, there are sad music that will make you cry(even if i haven't  XD ) and happy animated music that will cheer you.\\n\r\nWhen you end the anime you should search for the ost, you'll probably enjoy hearing it again.\\n\r\nThe sound effects and voice acting are good like in most of the anime you probably already saw, nothing great, nothing bad. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter(8/10)\\n\r\nThere are three main characters in the beginning: Shoma, Kanba and Himari, they both have different personalities and appearances, and for each of them we have one penguin, and not so far we are presented to Ringo.\\n\r\nFirst of all I have to talk about the penguins, they are funny and are always providing support to the comic scenes of the anime, they are the main reason of why this is so funny.\\n\r\nThe cast of the anime is not so big but even if the story of the characters is told I just couldn't care about some of they.\\n\r\nAll of the characters are very different, some of they are all so charismatic but some just don't matter(even if they have a important role)\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment(9/10)\\n\\n\r\nAs I said the anime may be a little bit slow at the beginning but if you have enough patience it will become relly good, and plus the art and amazing soundtrack will have sure of you don't getting bored.\\n\\n\r\nOverall(9/10)\\n\\n\r\nMawaru Penguimdrum is a anime for people who like thinking and complicated stories, if you are used to psychological seinen and already love them you should jump in Penguimdrum right now, if you think hard stories are stupid go seek something else.\\n\\n\r\nSorry for my bad english, i'm still learning.",

            "content": "I don't want to like this anime. I don't hate it. I just refuse to admit to liking it. But, i enjoy this the same way i enjoy hipster films like Me, You and Everyone We Know. It's like watching hilariously bad performance art at a gallery filled with hipsters. I've been there, and Penguindrum is the animated version of that exact experience.\r\nDirected by Kunihiko Ikuhara who directed that fantastic mindfuck called Revolutionary Girl Utena. He went on to made this series because he's jealous that his bro Yuji Enokido got his own ego trip of an anime like Star Driver. So he's basically tryingto make something that doesn't suck (yet fabulous!). And the result is Penguindrum.\\n\\n\r\nThe story about Penguindrum is a tale about terrorist anchor babies told with incest. Yup, it's about that, i think. It's about this family of siblings whose parents are Penguin terror cultists who blew up Tokyo ala London in Modern Warfare 3. One of the siblings, Himari is dying and to save her, the other two siblings Kanba and Shouma must save Himari with a \"Penguindrum\" according to Himari when she's wearing a Penguin hat with Utena backgrounds. And the hint of a Penguindrum lies in the notebook of Ringo, a yandere girl who's in love with Tabuki, Shouma's teacher and an Akira Ishida character married to an opera singer. At the same time, Shouma and Kanba are being challenged by a woman named Masako who's also aiming for the Penguindrum because of her ailing brother.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is pretty confusing at first, but when you describe it gets easier to comprehend. It's like having watched a bad cult movie or theatre play thinking \"Wow that was pretty stupid\" and moments later you thought about it and you started thinking 'Wow that actually made sense\". Penguindrum is that. And it fulfils the \"Bad Hipster Performance Art Experience\" by trying to make this look deep. It's basically called deep by certain guys on /a/ and that reminds me of all the hipsters calling a story about a woman who paints babies and putting candy bars into her friend's ass as a \"deep and insightful story about modern society\". Seriously, the story is weak yet people praise it because it's made by Ikuhara. And i understand because Ikuhara spent his time in America after Utena hanging out at bars and clubs like it's Greenwich Village or something, and at the same time the paranoia about terrorism he witnessed after 9/11 makes an influence for him to put in Penguindrum. But if he wanted to make an anime about \"terrorist anchor babies\", he should just make an anime about terrorist anchor babies, not terrorist anchor babies with incest (which became twisted a the series goes on).\\n\\n\r\nThe art is okay. I expected something amazing because it's from the guy who turned chicks into cars, but yet it's nothing to be fazed about. I actually expected KyoAni levels of amazing animation and visuals yet that didn't happen. Hell, since it's Brain Base i also expected some cool art like in Baccano!, and no that doesn't happen either. To describe the art would be \"minimalism meets fabulous European pre-contemporary art\". I'm a sucker for minimalism, but i'm not a fan of the latter which is why i dropped Star Driver. And they should not draw people in backgrounds as stick people. I know this series is limited in budget but, come on spending an extra buck or two in trying to other draw other people does not hurt.\\n\\n\r\nThe music is great. I love the ED by Coaltar of the Deepers. I also love the use of music by Dvorak and the background music for this is noticeable. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters are also the best parts of this story. I love Himari. She's cute as hell and shes the poster girl for this series, whereas Shouma and Kanba are also great characters on their own. The seiyuus who voice them are the rookie seiyuus beisdes Shouma's whereas other characters are really great with the likes of Tabuki who's the perfect definition of an Akira Ishida character. Yui Horie as Masako is kind of my personal favourite because she's used to voicing characters like Ayu from Kanon, but her voice in this is deep yet sexy. Mamiko Noto as Yuri Tokikago is also great, because she does a crazy psycho lesbian perfectly.\\n\\n\r\nOverall Penguindrum is an anime that i will not admit to liking it. Like i've said, it's Bad Hipster Performance Art: the Anime. It's pretentious and weird for the sake of weird yet it's fabulous and amazing with its characters and music. If you're a hardcore Utena or Ikuhara fan, go watch this. If you love mindfuck anime, go watch it as well. But don't tell me that the story is deep because i'll punch you in the face you fucking hipster.",

            "content": "Mawaru Penguindrum is a series that I don't think will be leaving my mind any time soon. It's already been a few months since I finished the series, but yet it still lingers in my mind. As I begin to question that, I find myself wanting more and more to write my thoughts on the series. And finally here I am writing a review for MAL. I am positive that this won't be my only review on this anime, and I'll explain why that is later on.\r\nBefore I get into why I gave the series a 5/10, I'm going to list what I actually likedabout the series. With Penguindrum, when I liked something, I REALLY liked it. First and foremost the art style. It's fantastic. The animation is gorgeous and all of the character designs are great. Penguindrum really makes a name for itself and comes into its own with its unorthodox style. Ask anyone, and they'll tell you that Penguindrum makes quite a use of symbolism. Sometimes meaningful other times just for show. Both examples can be done good or bad, and right now I'll just say that there was a lot of stuff I actually did like. And although it shouldn't have to be said, the penguins are cute. The music is fantastic. Each track is memorable and fits the story flawlessly, and can change the mood in an instant. The first OP and ED are amazing and are easily in my top 10 of all time. The second OP is good too, and so are the wide arrange of EDs for the second half, but neither quite reach the height of the first OP and ED.\\n\\n\r\nWhile I initially disliked most of the male cast excluding Sanetoshi and loved the female cast, I've grown to like more of the male cast as time has passed. The females still take the place as my favorite characters as they develop quite nicely and all have interesting stories. Himari loves life and tries to find the good in all the bad that surrounds her and her brothers. At first, Ringo can be seen as some sort of lusting lunatic, but once it's revealed why she does what she does, it's easy to understand and grow to love her. Masako can be seen as cold and distant and only out for herself, but like with Ringo, we are proven wrong as time goes on and introduced to a deeper, likable character. The Princess of the Crystal is funny and also very intriguing, but the more I think about who she is, where she came from, or what her whole objective was, I find myself not liking her as much since these things are never really answered. Yuri is also interesting, although not on the same level as the other girls.  Shouma was a character that I had no attachment whatsoever to even after the series had ended, and only now am I starting to warm up to him. He can come off as a generic good boy from time to time and he never intrigued me. Kanba is the more interesting brother, but I feel he can sometimes suffer from being the generic big brother too. To a lesser extent than Shouma. I'll get into why I disliked them more later on. Sanetoshi is great and has an otherworldly presence to himself when he's on screen. For good reason I might add. Tabuki is one of the better male characters as he has a darker past and is most of the time paired with Yuri.\\n\\n\r\nNow I'll get into the meat of the review and really show why I don't think it was as great as it could have been. As I stated before Penguindrum is packed with symbolism up to the brim. Sometimes this aids in helping Penguindrum take on a unique form that really sets it apart from the rest, and other times it becomes its biggest failure. \\n\\n\r\nSPOILERS\\n\\n\r\n Right off the bat, two big moments that don't do anything for me are the child broiler and the box metaphor with Shouma and Kanba. Usually with symbolism your given a nudge on what it might mean, but with these two we aren't given anything of the sorts. With the child broiler I have two options. I either accept that the world of Penguindrum has a facility where unwanted children go to die and this just sits well with the world and nobody ever brings it up ever, or it was symbolism for an unwanted child feeling completely destroyed inside. The second wouldn't be a problem for me to accept, but Penguindrum takes itself so seriously that it's hard to look at it that way. Which leads me to the box story. Basically Shouma and Kanda are in each in boxes across from each other just out of reach. Inside these boxes, they are starving. Until one day Kanba finds an apple. He decides to share half of the apple with Shouma and they share the fruit of fate. It is at this moment that they become brothers. Again I'd have no problem accepting that this is some sort of symbolism, but Penguindrum doesn't give me anything to go off of. Some other questions I have are who exactly is the Princess of the Crystal? There are other questions here and there that I had an issue with, but these two are the main ones that really soured my enjoyment.\\n\\n\r\nSPOILERS OVER\\n\\n\r\nAdmittedly, I may have forgotten some things that had been answered, so correct me if I'm wrong on anything. But that leads into why I think Penguindrum is a series worth watching. 5/10 may look like a bad score, but I know and sense that Penguindrum has a lot to offer. It's a dense anime that deserves to be seen. It's why I want to rewatch it again so soon because maybe the second time I'll have a new found understanding of the series. I'd like to enjoy every anime I watch, and I did at least half enjoy Penguindrum. It'd be wonderful to enjoy it as a whole. It still lingers in my mind to this day and I don't feel I can truly comment on the series until I have rewatched, but these are my first viewing thoughts. I enjoy picking things apart and shows that get me thinking, so in theory, Penguindrum should be perfect for me. Rarely does an anime ever challenge me like this, and I've got to give it to Penguindrum; this damn anime sure got me thinking and scratching my head. So I'm going to dive back into eventually, and I suggest whoever is reading this review to dive in too. Penguindrum can be loved or hated, but at either level it is at least an enjoyable experience.",

            "content": "Initial impressions: Visually, the colors are impressive and the geometric style of _Utena_ has been toned way down. It's clearly an Ikuhara work, with some pretty obvious copying/allusions/similarities. Ikuhara hasn't lost his troll sensibilities, killing off and then reviving the sick-imouto. The plot initially makes no sense (heck, it doesn't make any sense 3 episodes in, as we try to make sense of stalker girl as much as we approve of her), but again, that's Ikuhara for you. I was very interested to see how it goes - MP looks like it's making no concessions to beginners, with in the first few minutes a prettychallenging allusion to _Midnight on the Galaxy Railway_ - and I was glad to see Jury-senpai back from _Utena_, but 6 episodes in, I began to worry and started to get a little antsy. Even _Steins;gate_ had clearly started the main arc by this point!\\n\\n\r\nIt wound up taking until episode 09 to finally bring in the heavy symbolism and surrealism, with a nod to the _Utena_ Black Rose arc's elevators, and the _Rose of Versailles_ allusions in 07 and 08 couldn't be more blatant, but then we still had no real idea what on earth was going on, despite the flashbacks.\\n\\n\r\nI was ultimately left with mixed feelings; I seem to have understood more than most watchers (eg. many missed the Kenji reference in the first episode but not the last, though you can't understand the last without reference to the first), but I'm still not hugely impressed. It was good, yes, and an interesting take on Aum Shinrikyo and other themes, but I was hoping to be electrified by Ikuhara's return to serious anime after so many years!\\n\\n\r\nLessons I have learned from watching _Mawaru Penguindrum_: it's morally OK for there to be no repercussions when you try to rape someone and then cause a near-fatal accident - as long as you're a woman.",

            "content": "Director Ikuhara returns after a long decade plus hiatus since working on Utena. Utena being a show steeped in symbolism and theatrics, and a show with notorious pacing issues as a little backstory there. Studio Brain\u2019s Base (Baccano, Natsume\u2019s Book of Friends) is a solid studio known for crisp colors and animation work is a good sign to work on Penguindrum. The question posed now as an anime fan is, will Ikuhara improve upon his formula developed during Utena, and will the pacing improve?\r\nBreaking down the story of Mawaru Penguindrum like Utena takes time. Over the course of the anime, there will be sequences ofplot twists and turns in an erratic sense of feel and in a non-linear fashion. This can make it difficult to fully grasp, yet as the show continues on, the pieces do come together for the most part. Although, unlike Utena, Penguindrum\u2019s story fixes all the pacing and storytelling elements that made Utena feel like a slog and too much rinse and repeat. Yet, much like Utena, Penguindrum\u2019s theatrical showcase and a constant barrage of symbolism and themes have no shortage to draw from the well. This, at times, is overbearing or even pointless. Luckily, it does not hurt the messages being sent nor the story unfolding.\\n\\n\r\nWith clear messages being sent to the viewer through the characters and events tackle many issues from rape to death. Interaction between the three family members and what each issue presented means to them is explored well. Focusing on a small cast of characters gives much more time to learn about them in particular and how they feel about the subject matter in regards to the plot unfolding.\\n\\n\r\nMusic, art, presentation are all top notch and entertaining to say the least. Saying otherwise would be plucking at straws. Not to say that Penguindrum is not an over bearing anime to watch, but it is surely a more difficult anime for a casual fan to get into. Even more seasoned anime fans could easily find the anime too energetic and over the top that could take away from everything else the show does so well.\\n\\n\r\nThe amount of creativity and originality in Mawaru Penguindrum is remarkable. Anything a viewer had a problem with in Ikuhara\u2019s previous work Utena should find almost everything improved upon in this one. With a bat crazy topsy-turvy ending sequence of events, Penguindrum\u2019s wild ride is something we all as anime fans should crave to have more of. \\n",

            "content": "Let's be honest. Even if you sugar coat shit, it will still remain shit. Even if they tell you how gorgeous it looks, how deep it is, well in the deep is still shit. \r\nThat's exactly what Mawaru Penguindrum is. \r\nI arrived here from being suggested by a top list of \"mature\" anime, and between all the \"Ergo Proxy\", \"Psycho-Pass\" and \"Ghost In The Shell\", Maway picked up my attention, because of the look, the synopsis, and most of all, because it was the only one I hadn't seen yet. So I prepared myself for a nice trip on a colourful yet deep journey. ExceptI found myself watching a painful trainwreck into, well, nothing. \\n\\n\r\nI'll try to keep it short.\\n\\n\r\nStarting with the story. There are surely interesting starting points, or better, most of the \"arcs\" start well, just to end with a big \"puff\", leaving nothing behind but questions. in this crescendo of absolutely nothing, you finally reach the climax of the last episodes, still wondering how did we get there, why did that happen, how the...\"PUFF\"\\n\r\nAbout the notable \"symbolism\", the \"deepness\" and what not... Apples and soulmates\". Just sayin'\\n\\n\r\nAbout the art... Surely it's colourful, animations absolutely interesting to see. When you see one, I mean. The more you go on with Mawaru, the more you'll just see still frames, or worse, the same animation repeated again and again. Don't know if that's because of production costs or whatnot, actually, I don't care, I loved Monogatari, in the end. But there was something solid, there, at least. \\n\r\nLoved the cardboard people, tho.\\n\\n\r\nNothing much to complain about the sound. Everything kinda fit...\\n\r\nand then you have Himari's voice. Should I write about her extremely cute pitch or the magnificence of her acting? \"PUFF\"\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are actually quite good. The 4 main characters have nicely defined personalities, all 81 of them. It's just important to remember that this is an anime, and in order to be part of the cast, is essential for the applicants to be the most idiotic, insecure and, let me say it, retard as possible. Lesson number one, always repeat what your dialogue partner said, but with an interrogative shift. \\n\\n\r\nI would say that I feel like I lost a lot of time watching Mawaru Penguindrum, time that I could have spent better, like knitting a brand new chainmail for my pet iguana or vehemently stabbing my pinkie with a straw. \\n\r\nI'm actually still trying to understand just why I didn't drop it.\\n\r\nWill come back as soon as I get it. \\n",

            "content": "Fate can often be a cruel word. To ascribe someone's life as being merely the flow of fate, takes away from that which a person has done on their own. It takes away from their achievements. In a similar vein, it 'okays' the shit they've gone through as having some purpose; rather than condemning those who cause horrendous shit in the first place.\r\nFate can often be a kind word. To ascribe someone's life as following the flow of fate, can give purpose to someone who doesn't know where to go next. It can fuel further achievements. In a similar vein it gives hope to someoneas they go through tough times; as everything happy and everything sad happens for a reason. Nothing is wasted.\\n\\n\r\nMawaru Penguindrum is a 2011 anime that explores this dualism; created by Brain's Base (Baccano, Natsume Yuujinchou, Tonari no Kaibutsu-kun...)  and directed by the creative genius that is Kunihiko Ikuhara (Sailor Moon, Revolutionary Girl Utena...). Penguindrum is a psychological, and philosophical drama that asks us about the costs of fighting fate. Even if to fight fate is the right thing to do.\\n\\n\r\nThe Takamura twins, Kanba and Shou, live happily in a quaint colourful house with their little sister Himari. At least they wish to. Himari is terminally ill, though stable enough to live at home and enjoy her remaining time with her brothers. Whilst doting on her in an exceptional display of adoration, she collapses at her favourite aquarium. Dying tragically, but at least happily. However an odd hat that she was bought at the aquarium brings her back to life with a call of \"Survival tactics.\". \\n\\n\r\nFrom there on, the plot follows this family as the twins scramble to find the elusive 'Penguindrum' to ensure the continued survival of Himari. Both twins have different lengths they will go to to reach this goal; from focussing on this mystical hats demands, to making deals with the mob. Everyone in this show will do horrific things. Everyone in this show will do amazing things. The consequences of both actions may seem unfair. Life is not fair. Your efforts are rewarded, or not rewarded, without a care for what sacrifices you may have made. It is a struggle to deal with this, and it is this struggle that plagues the Takamura household and those they come into contact with.\\n\\n\r\nDeceptively colourful is a good way to describe this show's aesthetic. Adorable mascot characters are juxtaposed with themes of terrorism, sexual assault, and child abuse. Some of these themes may have a risk of being highly problematic, however I feel the show treated it's characters quite well; in that nothing was used badly or just for gags. The varying sexualities, genders and social standings of the characters, whilst not being the focus, were relatively well portrayed. That isn't to say you won't ever be hurt by this show. No no no, this show is painfully sadistic. Thriving on and relying on the punishments it allocates to the cast. You will feel for and care about these characters. You will love them and they will be hurt. Life isn't something you can cheat, and Penguindrum is certainly a commentary on real life. You may not realise it at first. You may find some characters to be extreme. That noone can be like that. But they'll grow on you. The cast are awfully realistic in their extremes, noone acts inhuman. By the end of the show it wouldn't be surprising for you to be in a puddle of tears over these fictional characters in this penguinny anime.\\n\\n\r\nIkuhara is not a director who tells you everything you need to know in dialogue. He uses symbolism and metaphors almost to an extreme. To follow everything the show has to say you will need to actively watch it. Even then you probably won't pick up on everything, I certainly haven't. Despite this, the earlier episodes can be extremely fun and watchable without too much effort. These enjoyable comedy moments also continue throughout, though the further in you get the more they contrast with what else is on screen. Penguins that mirror the central trio provide this. Their actions mirror their 'owners'. So whilst what they may be doing could be considered comedic, they also express underlying meanings to what the scene is about. In a similar vein certain scenes are portrayed as humorous fantasies. However what they show may be more than what initially meets the eye.\\n\\n\r\nSymbolism is a central tenant of Ikuhara's directing. From every unimportant character being a warning sign figure, to the large number of motifs throughout; Penguindrum oozes style. Unified colour schemes enhance and often give extra meaning to what a scene could be. Is this elevator ride one of joy? Terror? Or is it stained by long lost memories? All of this is conveyed through music, colour as well as through empty space. A thoroughly cohesive experience is Penguindrum, from style to substance everything builds together to create a feeling that is unique and special. Both openings are representative of this, as they give an insight into everything show is. As well as being rewatchable once you know what various symbolisms really mean.\\n\\n\r\nLooking and sounding good are two things that Penguindrum undeniably has. Any of a large number of vocal tracks add to any episode's ending, either through contrast or exaggeration. These also tie into the very themes of the show, as they are sang by the character group Triple H. Whilst these EDs are not animated for the most part, the variety and feel of them make up for this. Insert tracks from this group are also commonplace in the series, mainly during a repeatedly shown and toyed with scene. Through use of formulaic animation and rearranges of the same riff, the show manages to feel very lifelike and wholesome. This cohesion that the style of the show oozes, is matched in how the show sounds.The OST has a huge variety of tracks. From the piano focussed and more fairy tale like, to more rocky guitar pieces, film noir style pieces, and even pieces that wouldn't sound out of place in a mech show. The main unifying riffs are used appropriately and enhanced with beautiful vocal choirs. Even theatre-esque tracks and classical music make appearances appropriately. Maintaining such a cohesive show whilst having such variety is nothing short of amazing.\\n\\n\r\nAmazing is something I wouldn't hesitate to call Penguindrum. Whilst a bigger world is not present, the depth and breadth of all characters make up for this. The depth and breadth of the ideas that are explored in the show make up for this. The sheer beauty and care that is Penguindrum makes up for this. Not many shows attempt what is attempted here. Not many shows can. There are alot of different shows you can watch, Crunchyroll and Netflix certainly help with that. Yet if you're looking for something special, a show that you can watch countless times. A show that does things differently, that will leave you feeling empty inside when finished. Penguindrum will certainly satisfy, and despite not being on streaming services, is well worth any and all money you can put into it.",

            "content": "Minor Spoilers Review\r\nWarning: If you're expecting some mystery in this anime then I would suggest you to immediately drop the idea.\r\nStory: 5/10\r\n\"The fake is of far greater value. In its deliberate attempt to be real, it's more real than the real thing.\"-Kaiki Deishu\r\nThis is not a mystery anime, instead it looks like a fantasy anime.\r\nIf I were to compare this anime to a piece of art, it would be some popular painting like the Mona lisa. Looking at it in the surface, many people are praising it and it is good to look at that the visuals are jaw dropping. But upon closer inspection, youwill see that the painting has too many impurities, it is imperfect, far from the original. Well in short, it is fake trying very hard to become real and deceive some people. After watching it, I feel like this anime is trying so hard to call itself a work of art when in reality it is not. \\n\\n\r\nGood points:\\n\r\nDon't get me wrong. The start of this series is very good. There were symbolism used, and some of them are pretty clever. The flashbacks are timed well and the character backstories are good. Dark themes are used. I also liked how the series ended(not the epilogue). Pretty much the synopsis is the crux of the first episode, we have the 3 characters kanba, shouma and himari. Himari is terminally ill so she won't live very long. So after some little timeskip, she died, her death is somehow temporarily reversed by the penguin hat that she had asked for. It's a provisional resurrection, however, and it comes at a price, to keep Himari alive they need to find the mysterious Penguin Drum and so the 2 brothers go onto a journey to find this penguindrum. So far the story is ok, there were some introduction of new characters here and there, and there were some small twists at the start. But!\\n\\n\r\nBad points:\\n\r\nAfter a couple of episodes, the story completely went 180 degrees. Simply put, the plot hole of this anime is even bigger than your house. The story is very inconsistent and illogical. There were a lot of plot devices used in this show that were just used to complement the situation. Normally, I won't bat an eye on those things, but on this anime it was too much and it really irritated me. Like for example, what the hell is with those memory-erasing ping pong balls. After those were introduced, I simply facepalmed myself and try to tell myself to ignore it. Another thing is that, in the middle of the story, I really felt that I rode an up and down roller coaster only to find that the roller coaster is only 3 meters high. Some of the scenes are also overdramatized(I guess this is shoujo drama) that I was laughing very hard or facepalming myself. The shifting of tone is also really fast that I was thinking if this show is mocking is viewers. There was this one episode that showed a flashback of someones grandfather, the tone shifted from serious to funny vise-versa very fast and not only that. After some lots of shifting, the grandfather died in a stupidly way like WTF? Oh I almost forgot! The numerous symbolism used in this show! To be honest, if you asked me, there are two types of symbolism, first is the one that contributes a lot to the development of the story and the second one is the one that even if we find out what it is, the viewer doesn't even care because it contributes very little to the story. For me, most of it sadly falls for the second one, I just didn't care even if I find out something about it. I wasn't like, \"OH LOOK AT EPISODE _ THERE WAS A SYMBOLISM USED TO SHOW BLAH BLAH BLAH, WOW BEST ANIME EVER\". Instead, I was like, \"Oh ok, meh\". Lastly, there was only slight to none foreshadowing used to hint what was going to happen next. Characters magically appearing in the scene was commonly used. There was this one character shown in the early episodes with less than 5 minutes total screen time and this same character magically appeared in the later episodes and guess what? HE PERFORMED SOME WTF PLOT TWISTS.\\n\\n\r\nIn a mystery anime, the plot is its foundation. If the plot fails, then everything fails and that is what happened in this anime.\\n\\n\r\nArt and Sound: 9/10 and 8/10 respectively\\n\\n\r\nThe saving grace of this anime is the art. I watched the BD release and I was amazed at the animation. Backgrounds are totally good. Some scenes reminded me that I was watching some shaft animation. Some scenes were recycled. The Character designs look shoujo-ish to me but for me, its not a problem.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound is also good. I'm not really a fan of the OP and ED. Overall, good but not outstanding.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 3/10\\n\\n\r\nOh god, this is terrible. Most characters shown in this anime are again inconsistent. Their motives are very inconsistent. They tend to flip 180 degrees in one episode and flip 180 again in the same episode. I will not be surprised if Ikuhara Kunihiko reveals that these characters have Dissociative identity disorder. But the biggest problem of all is that, IN 22 LONG EPISODES, these characters didn't seem to grow at all. There were a few exceptions like kanba which I will mention later. BUT IN 22 LONG EPISODES, these characters seemed to wail like a baby saying that this is the curse of fate. Granted they are given backstories which are sad but for 22 episodes, hey aren't they overdoing it? Watching these characters reminded me of Suou Amane of Grisaia no Kajitsu(the Visual Novel). However, in that novel, amane changed while these characters did not(or at least did not for at least 22 episodes). What irritates me more is that, there was an inconsistent use of emotion of the characters in the face of adversity/tragedies. Remember Himari? Yeah she's only a plot device. Ok anyway, *Warning minor spoiler* well yeah, she died multiple times in the course of the show *end of spoiler*. What happened in these characters was that, they cried, YES! THEY CRIED EVERYTIME IT HAPPENED LIKE IT WAS THE FIRST TIME which seemed really unusual. Shows like Steins;Gate, Madoka Magica perfectly portrayed these characters changing in repeated tragedies while this anime failed HORRIBLY. The only thing they did right was Kanba, good thing he at least changed throughout the show. There were also characters that also changed but it really didn't matter or it was too late.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 5/10\\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed the first part at least, but the second part ruined it. It was a struggle to finish this entire series. This show reminded me of Chaos;Head which also started good only to fail later. I was also Irritated in the epilogue because too many problems were never solved, the character back stories were mostly never resolved like there was not a proper conclusion of the series. In the end for me, this anime is like a wasted potential.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 5/10\\n\\n\r\nI started watching this show because many called it a work of art/masterpiece. I looked into countless reviews and the majority said that it was good. Sadly for me, the minority who said that this show is bad is true. Throwing random crap is what really ruined the show. Best anime of 2011? Really? This anime is lightyears away from Steins;Gate, Madoka Magica, Fate/Zero which shook the audience while it is still airing in the same year. \\n\\n\\n\r\nRecommendation: Do not watch. But I guess if you turn your brain off and just accept what the author is throwing in the plot, only then you might enjoy this series.\\n\\n\r\nRecommended Related Anime: Shinsekai Yori\\n\r\nIf you have already watched this and (miraculously)liked it then I would suggest this. Both shows have Dark themes attached to them and this anime is good.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOk then, Before you press the unhelpful button, I would like to say that there were 0 penguins that were harmed in the making of this show.\\n\\n",

It made me laugh a lot, but sometimes I had to press pause button and think for a while... Characters are great! With each episode I started to falling in love with them more and more. The main plot is superb, I felt that everything is planned well and action is spreaded very nicely. Music is enjoyable, first opening was the best for me. Art is nice too.\r\nOverally, Ienjoyed this anime very much, and I would recommend this show to everyone who's not scared of thinking while watching, coz in my opinion, Mawaru Penguindrum is kind of deep animation. \\n\r\nBTW. Penguins are the best !\\n",

Watching this series your in for good ride of many themes. Nothing in this series is predictable and it will lie to you and hid it's meaning, leaving you big epic finish for end. I don't want tell you much about anything really. It not fair to your enjoyment. So here are for numbers out of 1 though 10, flow of plot 9, over all major themes 9, character development 9, characters9, story 10, music 8, animation 8, and story message 10. You should watch series to end, I could not stop crying and even more so feeling surprise by as the story goes along. Not many series out there can surprise me as developed. But this one was refreshing in that aspect completely. Give it try, I'm sure it will be nothing like what your current expression of it is.",

Makes you think \ud83e\udd14\ud83e\udd14 Speaking of pet peeves, I really fucking hate how they sexualized himari all season long and then hint at incestuous bullshit but later take a full 180. Also the plot points introduced mid way that amount to nothing really get on my nerves. Seems like they just made it up as they went with it. Overall I'd say it's pretty decent. There are themes of abandonment, loneliness, punishment for other people's sins, fate, fate, fate and fate. Why the fuck didn't they just call it Fate Penguindrum? Though it's refreshing to see their take on fate. Rather than it beinga concrete pre-written and unchangeable sentence it's shown as a concrete pre-written unchangeable sentence that can be changed by uttering a single phrase. The no u of mawaru penguindrum. Anyways, good show. I'd give it 8 ringos out of 10 how do you like them apples. Though don't mind me the show's subtle, intriguing, slow paced for the first half, weird, heavy handed in terms of symbolism so maybe not that subtle and good. Makes you go through a wide range of emotions like taking you for a spin with your funny bone. That's enough for today, huzzah!",

            "content": "\"I hate the word fate. Birth, encounters, partings, success and failure, fortune and misfortune in life. If everything is already set in stone by fate, then why are we even born?\" \r\nThe first word that comes in to mind then I think of \"Mawaru Penguindrum\" is - TRIPPY. This is what an acid trip most be like. To say the least, this isnt your average anime. But that necessairly doesnt make it bad, just different. From what I have read about it, its a two camp type of anime - either you love it or hate it. But I find myself in the middle, ididnt loved it or hated it. I found \"Mawaru Penguindrum\" unique and enjoyable with its type of story telling. If you have a problem with jumpy storys and deep layered conversations - then I can tell you right now, this isnt for you. \\n\\n\r\nStory: 7/10\\n\r\nI think \"Mawaru penguindrum\" brings up many deeper subjects. Does fate exists, and if it does are we complitley bound to it? And if we can change it, there always a price to pay. What is really a real family? Is it blood ties or is it the feelings you have towards the people close around you? Or both? The story of \"Mawaru Penguindrum\" often make you ask yourself alot of questions. It forces you to think, and if you manage to see the deeper layers in the trippy visuals, it actually has alot to say. You may also ask your self less existential questions like; \"what the hell is this penguindrum?\", \"why is it penguins every where?\" and \"are those really brother and sister, that was wierd?\". The story often doing time jumps, and sometimes its hard to make out if what you just watch was an hallucination of one of the characters or a deeper message. But I can say that I never was bored  watching this, thats for shore. Even do many loose ends are tied together in the end, you might feel a bit spaced out in end anyway - but thats whats making this anime so unique.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8/10\\n\r\nIts very colorful and often quite abstract. But it suites the story perfectly. The overall impression I had was a trippy effect. Which suites the show and its characters well, which both balances on the edge of incanity. The animation wasnt something outstanding, but definitly for filled it purpose.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 7/10\\n\r\nI think the music and backgrund sound were very suitable for the show. Mayby not my personal taste in music, but never the less suitable. It highlighted the trippy moments and the mental state of the characters. I watched the dubbed and it was fine except from the very fact that one vocie actor did almost every female side characters voices. It was a bit annoying, because she sounded the same for all. Havent watched the subbed, but mayby you have more luck there.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 7/10\\n\r\nThe characters was overall enjoyable and intresting - no wall pappers here! They were all many times a bit on the line of mental sanity as well, but that is one of the main factors that made this show memorable to me. \\n\\n\r\nWe have the cute and adorable little sister (Himari), the protective womanazing big brother (Kanba), the kindhearted caretaking big brother (Shoma) and the crazy stalker girl with a difficult past (Ringo) in the center. The interaction between them could many times be funny, understanable, sweet and sometimes a bit wierd. Many of the side characters as Taboki, Yuri and Sanetoshi (want his hair by the way) was also quite unique and not what they seemed at first glance. You get backgrounds on all of them, but that may not always help to understand the plot, but it explains the mental state of the character. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 7/10\\n\r\nAs mentioned before, I was never bored watching this. I enjoyed it alot in the meens of its uniqueness and trippy atmosphere. I liked the fact that I had to think twice to fully understand a scene, and that I sometimes didnt. It was shorley a colorful ride that left me with many emotions provocted. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7/10\\n\r\nThis is surley not for everyone, but I quite enjoyed it. If you want your brain and sanity tested, this is absolutly for you. I think if you watch this show more then one time, you can discover more an more layers in it.",

It is not like all those weird fighting anime's where all you have to remember is the character's names. On the last episode I was left legit sobbing because I feel like I have a \"bond\" with them. You know how they say Momoka changed the way Yuri and Tabuki sees the world? The show made me see the world differently. I saw beauty in little things and realized the part about the \"Child Broiler\" sort-of happens every day. If you are a parent reading this and want tosee if you should let your child watch this. Please let them watch it. I understand that it has a dark theme and there is some nudity but, I first watched when I was in 4TH GRADE. Yup even back then I understood it and saw the world differently. This show was a big part of who I am today. I can not honestly tell you though why it is not popular like Dragon Ball Z or things like that. It has such a good everything. This anime has taught me much and \"Let's share the fruit of fate.\"",

            "content": "At the core of Penguindrum is a single philosophical question: what is fate?\r\nAnd branching from that is another inquiry: how can we change our fates?\r\nThis easily could have become preachy and overbearing, but Penguindrum handles it with a delicate grace. It's story becomes universal and relatable on an emotional level that I personally didn't expect.\r\nIt definitely helps that there are layers of symbolism being used to help tell it's story, such as using an apple as \u201cthe fruit of fate.\u201d Those who are given the apple are allowed to live, while those who are denied the fruit are destined to die. There is also theidea of \u201cboxes\u201d being presented later on, a metaphor for people being confined in their own negativity and insecurity.\\n\r\nBecause of this massive amount of complex ideas, the entire story can be somewhat up to interpretation, especially concerning the meaning of the Penguindrum itself. I won't go in depth here, as it is a vast topic and there is a lot of speculation around it.\\n\r\nHowever, Penguindrum does not just handle it's themes well. It's events can be extremely heartbreaking and dark, but it never comes across as \u201cedgy\u201d or being dark just for the sake of being dark. With every tragedy there is hope, even if the characters don't seem to realize it until the end. These things shape the story rather than just being obligatory events to make us empathize with the characters, a shallow move that other anime tend to use way too often.\\n\r\nThe characters themselves are given a lot of development, and each member of the cast has intriguing pasts and motivations. Nobody does anything without reason, including the villains, if we can even consider any of these characters as villains. Penguindrum does such a good job of fleshing out each member of it's cast that it's hard not to empathize with each one, no matter how nefarious they may seem at first glance, with the exception of one particular pink-haired man.\\n\r\nAll of these components benefit from gorgeous animation, a vivid color palette and fascinatingly unusual imagery, as well as the great character designs from mangaka Lily Hoshino.\\n\r\nOverall, Penguindrum is one of the most well-rounded and creative anime I have yet to see, and has quickly become one of my personal favorites. I recommend it to anyone who is willing to pay attention and think about what they\u2019re watching.",

But, since the first time, I have rewatched it.\r\nI have to say the second time I watched it, the story did move kind of slowly for me. It's not an anime that I thought, \"I wish I could skip this episode\" or \"I wish this episode would move faster\", though. It wasn't the slowest anime I've ever seen. \r\nHowever, as almost everybody says, it does really pick up around episode 20.  This anime is kind of eerie, if you ask me. I guess that's what you'd expectfrom a psychological anime.\\n\\n\r\nI gave the story a 7, probably more of a 7.5, only because it can be hard to follow until the end. You'll be thinking, \"Wait, what?\" at the end of every episode, honestly. But it's so worth it towards the later episodes, when absolutely everything is tied together and everything makes sense.\\n\\n\r\nI gave the art and the sound high scores as well because I believe they're stunning. Sure, it's not number one on my anime art list, but I think it's amazing. Mawaru Penguindrum honestly is my favorite anime soundtrack ever. The openings, the endings, and everything in between, especially. Honestly, I've tried so many times to find all of the music from this anime and can't, but it's definitely my favorite.\\n\\n\r\nFor character development, I gave a six because I feel like the characters don't all develop as much as they should. Ringo is the only one that I feel got the development she deserved, hers was actually really great. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, I absolutely love this series and it will always hold a special place in my heart, since it was my first anime.\\n\\n",

I haven't seen a plot this creative in a long time. It has everything: comedy, romance, drama, mystery, etc. But in trying to be so many things, it fails to be much of anything. This sounds negative, but it works for this anime. \r\nThere are things that take away from the story, though. The plot twists, for one. The writers go overboard with plot twists in order to make the story unpredictable, but this just makes the anime disjointed and confusing. Speaking ofdisjointed, there are way too many flashbacks. So much is revealed through the past rather than the present that it feels like the story isn't progressing quickly enough. I won't even get into how many plot holes there are. Something this series does well, though, is that there aren't any filler episodes. \\n\\n\r\nArt\\n\r\nFantastic art, very Utena. There are lots of memorable sequences in this anime, partly due to the amazing animation. Good character designs. The penguins are adorable! I don't even care that they're pointless.\\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\r\nFor me, this was the anime's strongest point. The voice actors were all superb, minus one who was overacting a little. The music is just magical. I didn't notice any super out of place background music.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter\\n\r\nHonestly, some of the characters made me want to tear my hair out due to their weirdness or stupid decisions. The siblings started out likable but became annoying at certain times, especially the brothers. On the flip side, characters that weren't necessarily likable in the beginning were really awesome later. None of them are very logical, though, that's for sure. \\n\r\nSave some useless side characters and Shouma, everyone had some degree of character development. Their motivations were revealed, and while we may not agree with them, we do see their point of view. But I wish the show knew that not all interesting characters need a tragic backstory. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment\\n\r\nI had my problems with this series but still enjoyed it, especially how it touches on very taboo subjects. Each episode went by very quickly. It really made me think about fate (a word I am now sick of after hearing a million times in this anime). People who are into existential questions and abstract ideas will really like this series. Those who aren't may like it anyway for the visuals and drama. \\n\r\nThis anime is really deep, maybe too deep for the average viewer. Midway through the series, I had a few dozen questions. By the end, half of them were answered. If that sounds like something you'd like, I highly recommend this anime.\\n",

When I got at about the 5th episode, I was starting to get bored. Telling to myself \"When will this anime finally finish! I want to get through it as fast as possible!\". However, after you get past some boring episodes, at about episode 15, the series gets even more and more interesting. NowI just can't wait to watch the next episodes. I only keep thinking to myself that they should show us some real preview for the next episodes, like clips instead of a dialogue at the end.\\n\\n\r\nAlso, I have never watched an anime like Mawaru Penguindrum before. I mean, when we are supposed to see spitting blood, instead we see these red penguin signs flying. It has penguins EVERYWHERE (the signs and the 4 penguins that represent their character). \\n\r\nThe animation is great, the characters are great and the story is awesome. Although, I really don't understand some things. I think that magic plays a role in this story somehow?? Maybe???\\n\\n\r\nAt the beginning of the series they mention the Penguindrum, which is STILL not revealed in episode 22. Actually, this was one of the reasons I kept on watching this show. Right at the beginning they set up this mystery to get people to watch more of the anime.",

            "content": "So Mawaru Penguindrum in a nutshell is an emotional story about a family of two brothers and their younger sister who dies of terminal cancer. However, she is brought back to life by the penguin hat that they bought earlier and the penguin hat demands that the two brother find this 'Penguindrum', in order to keep their sister alive. \r\nAnd that was probably the best way I could sum it up. The story itself is a mix of dark emotions and very light hearted emotions. Once you watch episode 1, you will understand what I mean by a mix of dark and light hearted emotions.\r\nAnywaysmoving on to the really weird way I assess anime:\\n\\n\r\nStory & Setting (1/2):\\n\\n\r\nThe story is set in modern day Japan, so the amount of context that the viewers have to absorb is nearly none at all. The first episode really does well in setting up the characters and what is happening. \\n\\n\r\nThe story itself is quite linear and straightforward, taking the two brothers and the audience to meet new people who have some sort of connection to the mysterious 'Penguindrum'. However some aspects of the story may not appeal to some viewers such as invisible penguins suddenly appearing and such. I felt that the ending was a bit of a let down but I still thoroughly enjoyed the anime. \\n\\n\r\nArt & Animation (2/2):\\n\\n\r\nThis aspect is probably the most distinctive and unique aspect of the anime. The way that destiny can be visualized as some sort of a train journey with different destinations and the ability to transfer fates and destinations is quite creative. You'll see a lot of connections between the setting/story and the explored idea of changing/transferring fate.\\n\\n\r\nArt-wise, this anime is very colorful. The Survival Strategy Meeting sequences always makes me smile because it's just something weird which contrasts to the very dark feel of the anime. \\n\\n\r\nAnother detail I appreciate is the fact that only the main characters get detail to their appearances. Every other background person is drawn as a figure. So it pulls all the attention to the main characters, which I also find creative. \\n\\n\r\nAnimation-wise this anime is done very well. There isn't much I can complain or compliment about it because it really isn't an action anime with flying battleships or mechas.\\n\\n\r\nSound [Voice Acting, OP + ED, BGM] (2/2):\\n\\n\r\nThe voice acting in this anime was done alright. I don't have any major issues with this area. There are a lot of monologues about fate and that may get a little repetitive though. But it's not too bad.\\n\\n\r\nBoth OPs to me were alright. I didn't hate them but I didn't love them either. And I don't pay much attention to the EDs.\\n\\n\r\nBackground music I think was alright too. Not much to comment about it. It didn't hinder my overall experience from watching the anime. However the one background music I will always remember from this anime is the Survival Strategy Meeting sequence music. Dear lord that sequence is catchy. \\n\\n\r\nCharacterization (2/2):\\n\\n\r\nSome of the characters might seem weird to you but in the end it's all warm and fuzzy with really sad heartbreaking moments. There are also a lot of characters which may confuse you as to what they're trying to achieve but the anime wraps it all up nicely towards the end. \\n\\n\r\nGenerally I don't really have a problem with the characters in the anime. Not that I can remember.\\n\\n\r\nOverall Enjoyment (1/2):\\n\\n\r\nI thoroughly enjoyed this anime, especially the contrasting themes and how they intertwine towards the end. There were a lot of heartbreaking moments and silly moments but I still feel like the ending really let me down. Though that could be a personal opinion though. \\n\\n\r\nThe take-home point of this anime is that there are a lot of emotions conveyed in it and that you might find this anime to be different to what you were expecting. \\n\\n\r\n8/10, though in my heart it will sit as a 9 or a 10.",

            "content": "SEIZON SENRYAKUUUUUUUU!!!!!!\r\nI started watching this show expecting to laugh. I got what I expected.\r\nAnd so so so so so so so so so so much more.\r\nThis show was one of the most unexpectedly deep anime series that I have come across. It seemed so childish at first, with the adorable AF penguins and the seemingly low budget art style, but in reality, all of that was an artistic expression of what the show is really about.\r\nThis show is the embodiment of philosophy. It delves extremely deep into the topics of fate, family, revenge, and so much more. At first, you wouldn't believe it. I mean,there are derpy penguins doing derpy things! A girl with the shiniest of foreheads! Silly skits and character interactions! But later you realize that even the smallest and silliest of things was really a symbol of something bigger. Nothing in this show, big or small, serious or silly, was placed without reason.\\n\\n\r\nI find this series to be an artistic masterpiece. The story is well written, well executed, and a blast to follow. The art is extremely artistic and fresh, with a Monogatari-esque feel. The characters have so much personality, as even the most innocent looking of characters has a dark side that you must respect. The themes are expressed masterfully, and the story will leave you wanting more each episode.\\n\\n\r\nPros:\\n\r\n- Deep stuff man, so deep I can't even so you anymore.\\n\r\n- Adorable penguins. Penguin 2 is 10/10.\\n\r\n- An interesting story that will keep you thinking.\\n\r\n- Himari in dominatrix form is cool :D\\n\r\n- Art style is super artsy, and the symbolism and metaphors expressed are so creative.\\n\r\n- Comedy is amazing, especially the damn penguins. Best comedic relief characters ever.\\n\r\n- One of the best endings in Anime, imo.\\n\r\n- More plot twists than an Alpine Butterfly Bend.\\n\r\nCons:\\n\r\n- Some points in the story serve an unclear purpose, although they still do contribute to the story in some way.\\n\r\n- There are rapey moments .-. At least it ain't SAO xD\\n\r\n- The penguins, as amazing and hilarious as they are, don't do much of anything else. In fact, as the Shouma and Kanba say, they are basically useless.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 10\\n\r\nIf I could describe the story in one word, it would be dank. But I can't describe it in one word, because this story is so damn interesting. The premise was super cool and intriguing, which really hooked me in early on. The overall plot and the mystery behind it made it really enjoyable to follow, and all the subplots that happened tied in with the main story really well. The damn plot twists will make you HOLY CRAP, and I also loved how this story used flashbacks as a way to give light to the story. The dramatic moments were well written, and the comedic moments were fantastic. The comedic moments don't mess up the dramatic moments, even though a lot of the comedic penguin moments happen during the dramatic moments in the background, which is pretty rare in comedic dramas.\\n\\n\r\nAnd of course, we gotta mention the symbolism! This show is packed up the ass with metaphors. Little details within the story and art are put there for a reason, and it's like an Easter egg hunt looking for all of them. Some of the most important symbolism used is:\\n\\n\r\nThe subway line! The train ride of destiny goes one way, stops at each stop no matter what! But does that mean fate is as predictable as a subway line? No, for it is up to the rider to decide which stop they want to get on or off!\\n\\n\r\nPenguins! Penguins don't really fit in to the rest of the animal world. They are birds, but can't fly. They can only swim, but can't breathe underwater. They live in only one area of the world. They don't even look like birds! Penguins symbolize those who feel like they have no place to go, and that they different from everyone else.\\n\\n\r\nApples! The apple of Adam and Eve, or the apple of fate! Life and death are fickle things, and you don't really think that much about them unless you are talking about your own life and death. It takes a lot of courage and trust to share your apple of fate with someone.\\n\\n\r\nThese examples only scratch the surface of all the symbolism within this show, and there are even some extremely subtle ones, like the number 95. If you wanna know more about the symbolism in Mawaru Penguindrum, there are a lot of theories and stuff on the Internet! \\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt: 10\\n\r\nThe art was bizarre and spectacular. The character look amazing, and the symbolism that was expressed throughout this series was artistically well executed. The penguins also had a really cute and different design, as there are accurate depictions of animals in this show as well. This show definitely gave me a Monogatari vibe.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9\\n\r\nThe OPs are super catchy and unique. The OST is also very artistic and Monogatari-esque, but it also incorporates a lot of catchy songs. WELCOME TO ROCK AND ROLL NIGHT! However, the voice acting wasn't very strong in this show. While the voice actors/actresses did well in conveying the mood of the situation of their characters, I just didn't really like the tone of the characters that much, especially Kanba.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10\\n\r\nThe characters aren't super special or anything, but their backstories and their development were really impactful to me. Their different ideals on fate and how the world works, and how they all have their dark and twisted personalities really made them stand out from other shows. Also, Himari in dominatrix form is my spirit animal. What a savage.\\n\r\nOh yeah, and the penguins. Probably the best comedic relief characters ever made. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10\\n\r\nAnother series that I am super glad to have bumped into. Definitely one of the most unique and enjoyable shows to watch.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 10\\n\r\nIf you want a show with amazing writing in both comedy and drama, as well as very thought out symbolism and philosophical themes, this show will satisfy you in all of those regards.\\n\\n\r\nTL;DR: What do you call a happy penguin? A pen-grin. Don't shoot me.",

            "content": "Now, you can read the other reviews written by reviewers who have actually contemplated this anime as a whole for at least more than 10 minutes and they will give you a much better review on how Mawaru will make you feel. I'm using this review to tell you how I felt. \r\nI'm hesitant on writing this review because, like Utena, I feel like my review won't be worthy of such an astounding anime. I just finished this anime minutes ago and I really don't feel like this review will be sufficient enough, but I feel the need to write it now. \r\nWhen I wasrecommended this anime I was told that the director is the same from Revolutionary Girl Utena (another amazing anime that I love) and that this anime was its \"spiritual sequel\" (I still really don't fully understand what that means) and that the anime deals with a lot of heavy topics like incest and terrorism. All of these were true. \\n\\n\r\nMawaru Penguindrum is a well written anime full of symbolism. The first half may catch many of you off guard like it did with me. I assumed this anime was going to be a short ride into a \"quirky\" anime character's life like with most animes and end on a note that was supposed to be deep or fulfilling somehow, but I was so so so so so wrong. Mawaru takes slight turns into darkness here and there in the first half, but it really changes in the second half. It's like a whole new anime and all the silliness we didn't really understand initially is woven together. Not a single part of the 24 episodes is wasted. \\n\\n\r\nI never hated any of the characters in the end. Even during the anime I didn't hate them. Mawaru really takes time to let you get to know characters and gives you a chance to like them. They aren't just some crazy evil antagonist, they're a person. They aren't some ridiculously inspiring protagonist, they're a person. They're all people that are fighting for what they love and what they believe in; as simple and familiar as that might sound that gets easily forgotten, especially for the antagonists in stories. \\n\\n\r\nLong story short, Mawaru Penguindrum is not what it seems. It's so much more and it makes you remember it and think about it long after. The characters are easy to like and the art and animation is obviously great. You will enjoy it. You will find it outstanding. Please watch this anime at least before you die. \\n\\n\r\nAlso as a recommendation anime that you probably already saw coming: Revolutionary Girl Utena. The two go together well and have similar themes. As one of the people who told me to watch Mawaru said, Mawaru Penguindrum is Utena's \"spiritual sequel\". \\n",

Instead im write what i like and what things should get better .\\n\\n\r\n(+-) As i said before, this is not your main source of entertain with all every day normal things. This is basically a Tragedy anime, but things just so warm in here and all kind of crazy & supernatural things are good and worth the time to know all the revelation of the well-built story. Dont expect to get a normal things on this anime. Its kinda too long for make this to 2 cour series, but it fit and filled with content, so it worth and not boring at all, we not watch something same every episode.\\n\r\n(+) Great concept about Fate / Destiny. Things are so deep and meaningful throughout the story. It really change me as a person after i noticing the meaning of all that messy thing.\\n\r\n(+-) The complex of the story and character that at some point i just cant following it or denying somethings that really surprisingly so different than before.\\n\r\n(-) The overall settings of the anime is kinda weird or uncommon, not only the supernatural things, buy how peoples are the world itself.\\n\r\n(+-) In my opinion, some artstyle or visialization of the scene and settings and confusing and unclear (i can say like plot hole) where the reality and imaginary cannot be differentiated.\\n\r\n(+) Visual quality and overall Sound are decent, its good but im not like all of that.\\n\r\n(+) Great and surprising moral value that none of other work might have\\n\r\n1. Some of Children arround the world are not lucky than the others. Some of them must bear with their parents past.\\n\r\n2. So, how you gonna accepting your fate? we all dont know how life gonna turns, bad things must happen and life keep goes on. But we must know what target in our life and things you want to protect, do it without hesitation.\\n\r\nGood things always follow the person that keep their promise.",

            "content": "At first I thought this anime was going to be a bust. When I first read the synapsis and then later watched the almost magical girl like traformation/references I almost dropped it there. Luckily I forced myself through the first few episodes and got to see what made this show worth watching. \r\n1st- This show has a decent balance of tragedy and comedic relief. Even though there is some parts were you can only help but feel pity for the characters somehow they manage to keep you from falling over the edge into pure tears with well places comedy.\r\n2nd-The characters themselves weren't perfect but wellwritten even the background ones. Although I find a few minor flaws specifically the utter lack of self preservation that some of these guys display. Don't get me wrong, self sacrifice is respectable.  Howevver I feel as if the characters could have expressed a fear of their own death without diverting to much from the plot. Especially himari who seemed oblvious to reality until the very end.\\n\\n\r\n3-This show has a unique bit of mindf*ck*ry. It prides itself on having more twists then a pretzal. While when out in the open these twists aren't hard to understand. However with a bit of forshadowing, even when you think you know what's going on, you are left with the feeling of how the heck did I miss that. \\n\r\n4-The music was well composed, and a decent match to the series. It did it's job in setting the mood while also making you question everything. Which seems to be what it was intended for.\\n\r\n5-One thing I would like to mention is despite all the weirdness this show brings to the table in the form of supernatural penguins(Never thought I would say those two words in the same sentence) this show takes a more mature stance. Don't expect budding romance, that is not the focus of the show. While relationships between characters are apparent these remain primarily platonicish relationships with a bit of a romantic undertone. The characters will rarily act on it in a way that doesn't add to the plot. If you are looking for a heart warming prince meets princess romance you will not find that here. There is not a single stereotype in here. The mc's are not dense, there is no tsundere, while characters can express behaviors akin to that the feeling's for the most part are completely out in the open.",

It is the kind of outstanding piece of art that will make you change your way of thinking.\r\nEverything in this anime is about symbolism. Fore sure, all your questions won't get an answer, and that's what will make you think about this anime still after finishing it. The tone in the anime drastically changes and gets really serious compared to the beginning, that's why it's really worth watching to the end. The artwork makes it avery original anime, the animation and the sound are really well done and perfectly fit it. The plot is that well elaborated, that you won't even try to guess what will be happening next.\\n\r\nBut the most important to me are the characters. I've never seen an anime with that much character development, and for each of them. I just had the impression that there were 9 main characters. Even after, you still don't know much about their past though.\\n\r\nAs said before, this is all about symbolism, and this anime is a masterpiece in the way it's perfectly done and convincing to give its message. I am really bad at writing, but I hope you got that this anime is something that will make you feel and think a lot. Just watch it yourself to see what I mean !\\n",

So I was really looking forward to watch this serie and I really hoped for a deep story (like Steins Gate). To be honest I was quite dissapointed. The ammount of penguins was actually quite annoying. Everything was related to a penguin (like the artist has an obsession for it. A subtle hint of penguins was already enough)\r\nTherefore the story was really diffucult to follow. The creators used a lot of metaphors, I don't think many watchers understood them all. But when you look through those metaphors, the storyis actually really good. The artwork is also really good. It's just that the artwork and story don't match with eachother. The story is really mature, and the artwork is quite childish.

            "content": "Fate can bring a about the happiest of lives, yet it can also bring about a life of misery, crime, and suffering. The idea of even slightly altering a fate must come with punishment, and throughout the anime the viewer will see the cycle of \"fate\". \r\nA family of three consisting of two twin brothers, and a little sister are united in one home. Fate however, dictates different paths for each individual; none appealing to either individual. The act of changing fate comes with a reward and a punishment. The family will go through extreme measures to pursue their \"goal\", and not all their goalsare the same. There are many flashbacks, which the viewer can piece together to further understand the situation. I won't go into further detail to avoid any spoilers. Yet keep in mind, the anime does speed up after 10-ish episodes, so do not feel that the pace will be \"super slow and boring\". \\n\\n\r\nI would recommend watching the entire anime before rating it, or condemning it \"bad\". I had no intention of calling this a good anime, until I actually was near the end and realized what all the flashbacks where implying.The typical \"annoying\" characters get less annoying after things get serious, and the plot twists are very difficult to predict. \\n\\n\\n\r\nStory 9/10: The story is heart warming, interesting and the plot is rapidly in motion towards the middle of the anime. When watching this anime it's important to remember the 1/3 of the anime is getting you to warm up to the characters and understand their personalities and present situation. As the anime reaches the mid point, it starts to rapidly reveal each character's secrets.\\n\\n\r\nArt 8/10: The art's decent, nothing surprising, but definitely not \"bad\". \\n\\n\r\nSound 10/10: Really great OP/ED songs that directly relate to the anime. The music is great.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 9/10: The characters are basically the entire anime. There are plenty of characters and the viewer will have the chance to understand almost all of them, and see from their POV. At first I was really annoyed with a specific character, yet at the end of the anime I actually liked the character because the characters are constantly evolving. Their ideals change, and so do they themselves.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 10/10: The anime really made me think throughout each episode, it was a puzzle I had to put together and it was a fun puzzle.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 9/10: I'll admit the anime was very entertaining to me. I liked the characters, but mostly I liked the whole entire scheme of the story (which I poorly explained to avoid spoilers). \\n\\n\\n\\n",

It's one of the few anime that actually tackle problems in our society, and explores what societal problems cause incidents like the Tokyo Sarin Gas Terrorist Attack to happen. Directed by Revolutionary Girl Utena's Ikuhara, it's symbolism heavy. I feel like it was dropped by many oversea's viewers because a lot of information that Japanese people already knew to understand the show were not already known by overseas viewers prior to watching the show. My advice is, research a bit on the Tokyo Sarin Gas Attack and Night on the Galactic Railroad prior to watching the show. \r\nWhat made lovethis show so much? That's easy. It's simply beautiful. The characters, the emotions, the music, the art, the story - this show really makes you think about life and fate. Each character has an emotional story to tell you that can't help but make you tear up a little. Perhaps you can personally relate to a character or two. The conclusion to the story was great in my opinion; it doesn't give a very straightforward explanation of what happened but rather leaves it to the viewer's own interpretation of the story. I suggest reading some blogs on the meaning behind the show after watching it. This show just has so much love. Trust me, when you find out the real meaning of the \"Penguindrum\", the whole show will become double the feels and meaning. Mawaru Penguindrum is a story about Love, Fate, and Destiny. Go watch it. And plus, the penguins are adorable.",

The plot twists are rapid and unexpected, and will blow your mind. \r\nSecond, the characters are delightful. Himari Takakura, the younger sister of Kanba and Shouma Takakura, is my favorite character out of the whole series. The characters have nicely-developed personalities and back stories, and every single character has an importance in the show.\r\nThe show isalso very colorful as well. The art style and coloring of the characters , buildings, and backgrounds are bright and vibrant to match a good mood, and dark and mysterious to match a lower mood. \\n\\n\r\nLastly, the penguins.

            "content": "In 1996 the anime \u201cRevolutionary Girl Utena\u201d was released to much praise from critics and fans alike. So naturally the director, Kunihiko Ikuhara, would go straight to work on his next big project, right? Well, you\u2019d be wrong. After the movie version of Utena, which was released in 1999, Ikuhara went on to do\u2026 nothing. Okay, he may of done some storyboards here and there but he wouldn\u2019t go back to the directing chair till 2011. Which is the anime i\u2019ll be reviewing today; Mawaru Penguindrum. And what a better way to start off this series of reviews than a show that perfectly describes whatI love about anime. It\u2019s weird, surreal, bombastic, plays with your emotions like a harp, but most importantly, it\u2019s fabulous max\\n\\n\nI've described Ikuhara\u2019s works as \u201cwhat would happen if David Lynch made an anime\u201d and it\u2019s no different in Penguindrum. It\u2019s equal parts silly, dramatic and disturbing. Add to that layers of symbolism, foreshadowing and theatrics and you got a story you don\u2019t see too often. But don\u2019t think Penguindrum is pretentious. It may be full flair but there\u2019s depth hidden beneath the pizzazz. Each of our main characters get full development and as the story progresses more and more is revealed about everyone. By the end of the series each character is completely different from how they were in the beginning. It\u2019s also a story that delves into multiple topics such as fate, family, responsibility, love, abuse, finding purpose and more. What\u2019s impressive though is despite the abundance of numerous themes, every single one had enough time to develop and make an impact on the viewer. This is just one example of the impeccable pacing. While the first few episodes seem to go by slow, each episode revs up bit by bit until you get to the second half where a game changing event would constantly occur. This is a master class in storytelling.\\n\\n\nBut while the characters and story will probably be the main topic of discussion after the show is over, that isn\u2019t why most people watch the show in the first place. For a show with such a bombastic and theatrical style to it\u2019s story, it\u2019s the presentation that helps Penguindrum takes it over the top. The animation (done by the studio Brains Base) is for the most part standard for current anime (though there is one episode in the middle where everyone looks off model), but where the visuals shine is it\u2019s use of colors. From Takakura\u2019s multi-colored house, to the adorable penguins goofing off in the background and especially the princess of the crystal\u2019s hangout, make no mistake, despite having a rather dark plot, Penguindrum is a feast for the eyes. The style of Penguindrum more the makes small instances where it\u2019s obvious Brains Base was cutting corners or reusing animation. But presentations isn\u2019t just about the visuals, but also the audio. And while for the most part the music does it\u2019s job to set the tone it would difficult for me to name one song on the soundtrack, except of course one. A song called \u201cRock Over Japan\u201d that plays whenever there\u2019s a certain \u201csurvival tactic\u201d. Be forewarned, it will get stuck in your head. Whether that\u2019s a good or bad thing is up to you. Remember, there is a reason why this show is \u201cfabulous max\u201d.\\n\\n\nAs much as I have gushed about Penguindrum, make no mistake, it\u2019s not for everyone. The slow beginning may turn people off. And the constant use of metaphors and symbolism may make the show hard to watch for some. Hell i\u2019d be lying if I said I knew everything Penguindrum was trying to tell. If you\u2019re looking for an anime to just sit back and relax, you may want to look else where. This is a show that requires your full attention. But if you want to take a surreal, but strangely down to earth trip to one of the most ambitious anime in recent years, then you\u2019re fated to watch Mawaru Penguindrum.",

            "content": "Warning: spoilers ahead\r\nIt seems to be a common theme among the anime I\u2019m am finishing and reviewing that they are very entertaining, but unravel once you turn on your brain. Mawaru Penguindrum is similar to Angel Beats and Charlotte in this way. However, unlike Angel Beats or Charlotte, this series catches itself unraveling and begins to work to fix itself back up. For a series that took on such a hugely ambitious and complex plot, I\u2019d say it did a pretty good job holding itself together.\r\nPlot: 7.5/10\r\nLet me start out by saying that I adore this series. I love the concepts, I love the complexrelationship, the betrayal, the plot twists (this anime has a lot of those). This anime had the potential to be a 10/10, but somewhere along the way it got off track. The final episode managed to partially redeem it, with it managing to patch up ALMOST all of the plot holes it had created for itself. Actually, the biggest problem with this show is the same problem I had with Angel Beats. The plot lacks focus. However, the problem manifests itself differently in this anime. In Angel Beats, the plot deviated to side stories that had nothing to do with the main story. In this, the main story is hard to identify. There are lots of side stories, but they all seem to tie into the main story. They serve as character development. However, it felt like the writers were just making this up as they were going and then managed to tie all their scattered ideas together into a cohesive(ish) plot in the last episode. The beginning of the show and the end of the show, if you watch them all back to back, actually have very little in common. The story evolves and takes on its own life, which is entertaining, but in exchange, it loses its direction. We start off with a relatively simple plot concept: find the penguindrum and save Himari. However, as the plot goes on more and more things keep getting added. All of them have some relation to the story, but didn\u2019t need to take up so much time. I am not exaggerating when I said that every single episode has at least one flashback. If I had to put a term to what I think of this is that it\u2019s a character-driven plot rather than a story-driven plot. That is to say, the story changes with the characters rather than the other way around.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 9/10\\n\r\nThe characters in this anime get some of the most development I\u2019ve ever seen in an anime. About half of the time in this anime is dedicated to flashbacks or explanations of the past. Everybody is broken in some way, and there seems to be no such thing as a parent who actually cares about their child. Every character acts according to their own beliefs, which sometimes means teaming up with others and then at other times betraying those you teamed up with. There are waaay to many characters for me to talk about all of them. One that I\u2019ve been wanting to talk about ever since the second half of the plot started was Kanba. His story felt like a combination of Homura and Sayaka. He will do anything and everything in his power to save his beloved Himari who actually isn\u2019t his sister (plot twist!). However, doing this sets him on the path to destruction that he only finds his way off of in the last 10 minutes of episode 24. He\u2019s convinced that everything he\u2019s doing is for the best, slowly losing sense of what is right and wrong in his desperation to save Himari. His story is the most heartbreaking. I\u2019m trying to think of any characters I can rag on, and the only one I can think of is that guy with pink hair. He was kind of two-dimensional. We kind of knew his motives stuff, but he had no history, no story that really mattered. Granted, I\u2019m not even sure he was anything more than a metaphor to begin with. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 10/10\\n\r\nThe character designs were interesting and unique. The artist has a very distinct way of drawing faces that I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever seen before. Also those rectangular eye-shines. When I first stumbled upon this anime I thought it was done by studio SHAFT since it has similarities to their distinctive style. However, upon looking at the Wikipedia page and seeing that it was not done by them, I began to notice the small differences. This anime certainly took inspiration from SHAFT\u2019s signature style. I liked how there were always things going on during long stretches of dialogue. The penguins were always doing something in the background, colors were changing, etc. I was never once bored during a long dialogue scene. I also love when there\u2019s things to notice in the background, but maybe that\u2019s just me.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9/10\\n\r\nThe music in this actually gave me a strong Requiem for a Phantom vibe, especially in the second half of the series. It fit the scenes well and was very dramatic when it needed to be. The music was not used constantly, but rather saved for times when it was either necessary or would enhance the drama/other mood of the scene. This sparing use of music just made it all the more noticeable when it DID play. Every time music played I was tempted to go to youtube and see if I could find it, although interest in what happened next in the plot stopped me. It\u2019s just one of those soundtracks you can put on and listen to all day. \\n\\n\r\nAs much as I would love to put this anime up on a pedestal and give it a 10/10, I feel like that would be unfair to some of the other things I\u2019ve given lower scores to. This is a great anime, but it has flaws. For one thing it\u2019s confusing as all fuck. You have no idea what the hell is going on unless you devote your attention to actively figuring it out. Once you do, there\u2019s a great story hidden underneath all the confusing metaphors. Not to say that symbolism and metaphors are bad, but this anime has so much of that that it can get overwhelming at times. I still don\u2019t understand some of it, like in the last episode, what was up with those two floating cages that the brothers were in? I tried and tried to think about what that could be representing, but gave up. This is not the kind of anime you can put on and expect to just understand everything. So when it comes to passive entertainment, your should avoid this. \\n",

            "content": "Kitsune\u2019s review time #1: Mawaru Penguindrum / \u8f2a\u308b\u30d4\u30f3\u30b0\u30c9\u30e9\u30e0 (\u25e1\u203f\u25e1\u273f)\r\n\u203aThe story:\r\n Mawaru Penguindrum\u2019s plot was quite ingenious, original, clever. It was good to see something different for once, Himari, one of the main character, is maintained alive thanks to a penguin-like hat that embodies a spirit which orders Shouma & Kanba Takakura to find what is called the PenguinDrum. In exchange their sister\u2019s life would be spared. The story is very surprising as the producers made several episodes in order to get the viewers used to the Takakura family and then break everything down by revealing the Truth. The viewers are raised in illusions which makesthe continuation of the anime all the more interesting and surprising, which is a good point. We never get tired of it and it makes us want to know more, the suspense is well-maintained.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\n\u203aQuick analysis:\\n\\n\r\nFurthermore the references made in the anime are quite interesting, with a strong religious connotation:\\n\\n\r\n\u00b7 The apple. The fruit of desire, of the Garden of Eden. The apple is the fruit which bounds everyone together in the anime, the fruit of Destiny. (Which is a substitute for the red string asian belief.) There\u2019s also the \u201cMary had three little lambs\u201d legend. (Reference to the \u201cMary had a little lamb\u201d poem.), Mary, lambs, yes, religious connotations there, plus the mention of a goddess in the tales told by Shouma. Religion is mainly based on hope, and that\u2019s why the anime is strongly linked to hope. Everything revolves around hope. There\u2019s also the idea of resurrection, Himari dies but then she\u2019s revived and taken back to life, as if by miracle. Miracle, resurrection, yes I\u2019m alluding to the Christ. And if you watched the last episode it will make even more sense to you. (Also, this is only an interpretation, I PERFECTLY KNOW IT WAY, WAAAAY TOO FARFETCHED and you may have different povs, I\u2019m an atheist, it\u2019s just my strong literary reflexes taking over. OKAY.)\\n\\n\r\n\u00b7 Secondly, the color red plays a large role. Red. The most ambiguous color, the loveliest and yet the deadliest. Color of passion and love, of life. But it is also the color of blood and death as everybody knows. In the anime there are both. Death and love. Bad and good omens. The Death of Himari, Momoka\u2026 (and more later on), the passion of Masako, of Oginome\u2026 The color red is present through the apple, the roses petals when Masako appears, the balls/bullet or whatever she shots are red, the vanishment of memories is symbolized by red. The Penguindrum itself is red, representing life. The bed curtains of Himari are red, too, as to predict her death. When the anime begins, she sleeps, as if waiting for her prince (cf. Sleeping beauty) but it also points to her death. Sleep has a strong connotation in the world of literature and art.\\n\\n\r\n\u00b7 The different point of views on Fate are rather interesting, it reminded me a lot of Tsubasa Reservoir Chronicle and XXX/Holic by CLAMP in which Fate is the main protagonist, if I can say that. Of course we can link it up with the religion part, Fate is the result of a transcending force, deity. That philosophy side about whether yes or not Fate exist was interesting too. Are you the master of your Fate? And if not, is it worth living? It raises many questions that nobody can really answer. \\n\\n\\n\\n\r\n\u00b7 The penguins: Penguins represent\u2026 Okay, no, I\u2019m kidding. I don\u2019t know why the hell penguins have been chosen. They\u2019re just mascots, I think. At least thanks to this anime I\u2019ve learnt to love penguins. But some parts were really poetics. \\n\\n\r\n\u00b7 Momoka\u2019s diary: It\u2019s what everyone is fighting for and what would enable one to master Fate. It was supposed to be the Penguindrum and that\u2019s why it had a high value during all the anime, beacause of its power and what it represents too: Momoka. It\u2019s a kind of grimoire which with Momoka could save Tabuki and Yuri. It transfers Fate but implies sacrifices. It\u2019s the key, the way to the Penguindrum, containing the secret spell. But then it will be destroyed by fire, showing the rise of Evil in the anime. \\n\\n\r\n\u00b7 Art is present a lot during the anime. Art & destruction, including self-destruction. Art is mainly represented by Yuri and Tabuki. Yuri is an actress, a singer, she\u2019s an artist. When she was little her father was a sculptor, he was mad, neurotic (as a lot of artist, actually.) so Yuri is strongly linked to art. Tabuki too, he plays piano, he likes music. But art destroys people, it\u2019s creation and destruction. Tabuki broke his fingers on purpose, in order to get more attention from his mother but it led to nothing, as in the anime he\u2019s a bird in a golden cage. Yuri\u2019s father, obsessed with beauty, destroyed Yuri\u2019s mother who he considered as \u201cugly\u201d and he destroyed his daughter, mentally and physically. Yuri is a bit mentally disturbed too, love-seeking since Momoka\u2019s death. \\n\\n\r\n\u203aTone of the anime:\\n\\n\r\nIt was special, really. A tragi-comedy. Right from the beginning we can see it will be a tragedy: Fate. Fate is the meaning itself of the tragedy genre, always. And then, there\u2019s the death of Himari, her life hangs by a thread and everything can get worse at any moment. Ghosts of the past are also present Kanba\u2019s parents, Sanetoshi\u2026 It\u2019s a time travel, ghosts of past involved in Fate transfers. Past - Present - Future. All the main elements are there. Though there\u2019s a tragic side there\u2019s also a humorous side, to make the anime more attractive, in a way. The three penguins represent their owner in a humorous way, sometimes even though the situation was dramatic the penguins put some fun into it. Personally I didn\u2019t like it that much, I like dramatic situations and putting humor during those situations ruined everything for me. But, well, that\u2019s my opinion, maybe people liked it. Apart from the penguin there were other funny situations, innuendos and all, which I liked. Those love-crushes/stalker situations were funny. \\n\\n\r\n\u203aOriginality of the anime:\\n\\n\r\nWhat makes it original and pretty interesting is that the author and the producers played with the Time by involving flashbacks to distort time a bit. That\u2019s the first point, but what made it really interesting are the different dimensions. (Once again cf. TRC and XXX/Holic.) Himari\u2019s dimension (\u201cSeizon senryaku!\u201d was very catchy. ), Sanetoshi\u2019s secret library, the place where \u201cuseless children\u201d are trashed and the dark train where everything ends. The train goes forward and never stops as Fate. A lot of scenes take place, indeed, in the Japanese underground. It was really original.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\n\u203aArt style & references:\\n\\n\r\nArt style was okay, sometimes I didn\u2019t really like how the eyes were drawn but, well, it wasn\u2019t bad but not exactly the type of art I prefer. But it was still good, sometimes, in some episode characters were better drawn. (SOMETIMES IT WAS JUST TOO HORRIBLE AND IT MADE ME LAUGH.) Sometimes Riyoko Ikeda\u2019s style was used, as in a lot of manga, that woman is quite a reference herself! /laughs \\n\\n\r\n Once I also heard that how the Triple-H are drown in the ending is a reminder of Alphonse Mucha\u2019s style, which I think is true. (Especially for the hair and all.)\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\n\u203aCharacters:\\n\\n\r\nThe characters themselves are quite standard. Pupils, a teacher, an actress\u2026 No special mannerism or such. But, there are catch-phrases such as \u201cI must crush him soon.\u201d or \u201cIsn\u2019t it electrifying?\u201d (OR \u201cWATCH OUT, MISTER PRESIDENT!\u201d) and of course \u201cFabulous max\u201d and it was great to add things like this, it made it very attractive. They\u2019re not the most original characters but they\u2019re likable anyway. Not much to say. \\n\\n\r\n\u203aMusic & Original soundtrack:\\n\\n\r\nI\u2019m not going to lie, when I downloaded the OST I was a bit disappointed. I mean, some compositions are really good, brilliant and all (Especially those including chants.) but\u2026 I don\u2019t like a major part of the soundtrack. There are a lot of composition including whistling, inspired by Western movies, it reminds me a bit of Ennio Morricone. (Except he was a genius. Ha.) Anyway, those are pleasant to listen too but too many of Hashimoto\u2019s compositions are too common, she\u2019s been inspired a lot, by the music in the James bond movies for example. \u201csexy ga kita!\u201d is almost like \u201cconcert for one voice\u201d when I heard it in the anime I even thought it was the same music. So yeah, she had been inspired a lot and we\u2019re not really discovering things, it\u2019s not innovator enough. I\u2019m not saying her music is shit but I didn\u2019t like it that much in the whole. (Far from Yuki Kajiura or Yasuharu Takanashi in my opinion.) Then, about the OP/ED\u2026 HELL. THEY WERE DAMN GREAT. At least it had two awesome OPs [1][2] and, damn, almost every ED had a different song, first time I see that, great idea. (gray wednesday and nyunyu thing oh nomnomnomnom. (\u00b4\u03b5\uff40 )\u2661 )\\n\\n\r\n\u203aMy rate:\\n\\n\r\nPlot/Story: \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\\n\\n\r\nDrawing style: \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606\u2606\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606\\n\\n\r\nSoundtrack: \u2605\u2605\u2606\u2606\u2606\\n\\n\r\n\u203aAll in all:\\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s a must-see, because the story is incredibly beautiful, and some soundtrack of the OST are really great when they\u2019re listened while watching the anime, it\u2019s really worth it. Even though I\u2019m a bit harsh with the soundtrack and the character Mawaru Penguindrum is a really good anime.",

At first none of the characters realise that it is that important until it is constantly highlighted to them within the episodes.

However, it spirals from then on to the climax(therewill be so many mysteries) and ending which is absolutely unpredictable and so strange you will be shocked at your initial impression of it. The plot is indeed kooky but as a literary work it is well written - there are so many memorable quotes. \\n\\n\r\nThe art is distinctive in its' good use of POV and just great arty shots. The sounds are important to emphasis various reoccurring symbols and the music in the anime sticks, so it is pretty good, I guess. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters are not your standard run-of-the-mill characters. Be prepared. They are full of what Japanese people term complexes. And who doesn't love flawed flawed characters?\\n\\n\r\nThis anime, however, is not the sort to sit down and enjoy.

            "content": "Ah. Mawaru Penguindrum. When I first saw this I ignored it because the preview was not interesting enough for me. What won me over is curiosity seeing as how it's given high ratings on a lot of sites I've visited. Still, when I started with the first episode I was hesitant... I remember telling myself how 'cute' this anime is and I didn't like animes that appeal to cuteness. I watch anime because of the story and I'm scared this might end up something like K-ON! (Don't get me wrong, K-On! might be cute but its refreshing and I still loved it.) But I waswrong. Mawaru is beautiful.\\n\\n\r\nI could've given the story a 10 instead of 9 but there were some minor points--faint details almost irrelevant but is still part of the story--that was left unexplained. It's almost unnoticeable but to some who could notice would notice it. For me this lost its chance for a 10 because a good story should be able to answer all the \"why's\" of the viewer that must be contained in the story. Nevertheless, it did not affect how good the story is. It was sooo good that it covered up for that.\\n\\n\r\nSo. The story starts with a confusing plot. I almost end up putting it on-hold but it kept me watching because it obviously is holding back some important details that it cannot show yet at the beginning thus don't stop until you get to the middle. The 'cute' start of the anime got weirdness mixed in as the story progressed but it already starts to dig deep. You start to think--and think seriously about what's happened and would be happening. What's so good about this is that the transition was so smooth. I did even forget that I called this anime cute because it plunged to an unexpected seriousness that got me really thinking. The unfolding of the lacking details at the beginning came out ever so smoothly, it was wonderfully executed.\\n\\n\r\nThe art was really cute as I've said. It's really anime like with those big eyes and all. There were a lot flashy moments but that is what made Mawaru so distinct. It's not Mawaru Penguindrum without it. For me it was well carried out with the story.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound could've also been a 10 but I gave it a nine. The flashy moments made it more flashy because of the sound effects but it supplemented greatly to the emotion it wanted to draw out; however, I didn't like that they repeatedly played ROCK OVER JAPAN at almost every episode whenever Himari starts being her other self. The time it took could've been allotted to more significant details. I liked the song, but it wasn't really worth putting it at most episodes.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter development's great. Ringo at first was freaky but wait and you'll see later that she's actually a little flower. Every character has their own way of drawing the viewers to them. They own a certain personality that you would not wish weren't there. They're perfect as they are, more so that each of them has an in-depth story of who they really are that can make you understand them deeply. And I felt like they were not trying to appeal with the audience but merely showing off their side of the story.\\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed it so much. And that is because it has its own, just like how a singer should own their song, this one owned its story. It's complicated plot made it a good exercise for my brain, but more than that its story made it worthy to be part of literature. I felt emotions that should be felt when watching or reading that should be felt when we're talking literature.\\n\\n\r\nIf after watching it, you got bored. I suggest you watch it again, you might've missed something. To make this series more worthwhile, see past whatever you see irritating. Sometimes it could be so girly, but the story I tell you is not your typical.",

            "content": "Mawaru Penguindrum is a gorgeous series with endearing characters that seems to lose its way a little over two thirds through its story.\r\nPraise first, this series is simply beautiful, many shows have quality animation but this one has style. It wonderfully combines graphic design elements and fantastic use of color to create stunning compositions and scenery. Similar to Bakemonogatari if you need an example. The characters are excellent and all present different and wonderful interactions. The balance of the three main characters was great to see, with Himari balancing out the hot headed Kanba and the loving Shouma.\r\nThe story arc with Ringo and Shouma wasalso just amazing with the climax out on the fire escape being genuinely one of the most dramatic and involving scenes you will see in the era of moe and vapid girls and weak boys. That being said I was completely disappointed when they just sort of dropped it and then things just started to get out of control.\\n\\n\r\nThe story just felt like it lost its direction, the earlier suspension of disbelief that came with a world of memory erasing ping pong balls and just the way the scenery warped in changed just gets washed away with a number of additions that were just confusing and didn't really serve a purpose. The series began to create places simply to serve as allegory or metaphor, the Child Broiler being the prime example. What was the purpose of that place? Why was it there? How did it fit in with the world or plot? None of that was answered and it felt like it was trying to be deep and philosophical without any of the necessary plot or character development or motivation. And as many other reviewers have pointed out, the ending is bittersweet but it feels like they wanted to put in a happy ending.\\n\\n\r\nI'd definitely recommend this series to someone, it's a great example of how style and story and combine to create an interesting stylistic series. But with the caveat that it starts to grasp at straws and tries to be more than it laid the ground work for.\\n\\n\r\nAlso the magical girl-esque transformation scene that happened almost every episode felt rather pointless and started to get frustrating. It seemed out of place in the not really magical girl world that they set up.",

            "content": "Non spoiler review\r\nI started watching this show expecting an abstract psychological ride and in the end it did deliver that, one could even add wild to abstract psychological. The story is very interesting, however you need to watch with an open mind and very carefully to get to understand the symbolism. Probably in the end you will understand most about the characters personalities and their motives, but the symbolism will leave you wandering. \r\nSymbolism is pretty heavy in this show, refers to Japanese culture and literature and also to Greek literature so it is going to be hard to grasp. This is my main issuewith this show, it does require a certain literary culture to grasp from the beginning so it\u2019s not for everyone. Worry not though, there are plenty websites offering good analysis on the symbolism. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters are nicely developed throughout the show, you will not understand everything about them in the beginning, it does require to watch the whole show to find all about them, most of your questions will be answered in the end. The characters are interesting and have tragic stories dating back to childhood, stories which are nicely portrayed (through symbolism or not).  In fact if I want to recommend this movie especially to parents that have a small child or are thinking to conceive one, they might learn how to be a better parent, why love is very important to a small child, how fragile they are and how their parents play such a big role in their development as adults. This is one of the parts that I liked a lot about the show. \\n\\n\r\nThe second one was the philosophical discussion about fate, red strings of fate that connects people and how these shape our lives. In the end you will be left wondering if certain things you\u2019ve done throughout your life are related to fate and what would have happened if you had chosen a different path when presented with the possibility (in fact you chose one particular path because it was fate who pushed you in the certain direction).  \\n\r\nSound is pretty great in some scenes, I really enjoyed it, animation quality is good, sometimes you have static images, sometimes the character designs are not consistent throughout the series but the symbolism frames are very well done and detailed (you actually need to scroll back or pause to take a good look to understand).\\n\\n\r\nSo why did I rate this as an 8 since I liked the show? Because of the heavy symbolism and the big pack of literature that you need to have read to understand this show. Also there are a lot of metaphors in the show, I never liked metaphors even in classic literature that I studied in high school because it\u2019s open to interpretation, one person can see X, the other can see Y and both are plausible. It\u2019s interesting when you see it in anime though. \\n",

            "content": "This story is filled with symbolism, from the start until the end. \r\nAmongst the many symbols, the two key symbols that caught my attention the most were the apple and the train. The anime makes many references to Kenji Miyazawa's \"Gingatetsudou no Yoru\", or \"Night on the Galactic Railroad\" in English. I've only watched the anime version, but I highly recommend anyone who may find this anime to be of quality to look into \"Night on the Galactic Railroad\", either the film or the book. \r\nThe apple is a constant symbol that is continually discussed throughout the entire anime. In episode one, two young boysdebate what the meaning of \"the apple\" is, which is the first reference to the Galactic Railroad. One boy explains that the apple is the universe itself, and that it connects this world and the other world. This dialogue comes up in the last episode at the very end, and there the two boys are actually resembling younger Kanba and Shouma. The director artfully reconnects you back to the start with that simple dialogue, which I think is a whole theme of the story with the flashbacks. \\n\\n\r\nThe subway-train has multiple symbols. The one that connects to the Galactic Railroad is, well, in the name itself. The other meaning behind the story of Mawaru Penguindrum is the subway sarin incident that occurred 16 years ago from when this anime was produced, in Tokyo. The majority of Mawaru Penguindrum takes place on the Marunouchi-line, which is the subway line that the sarin incident happened. \\n\\n\r\nI focused on two symbols that stood out to me, but I'm sure there are many more that I'm not even aware of, from just watching it through once. Mawaru Penguindrum is definitely the type of story that makes you want to go back and re-watch scenes to get a better understanding, because of all the flashbacks that jumps randomly, and the small details. But if it were just because of the story-line, I probably won't be so drawn to watch this over again. It's the anime as a whole- the art, the music, the characters, and most importantly, the intension behind the creators, all those components combined, that makes this anime so wonderful. And I haven't even begun to mention the emotional side of the anime. \\n",
