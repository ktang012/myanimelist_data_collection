            "content": "I had to write a review for Punch Line because the current score (7.11 as of 6/25/15) is far underrating this surprise favorite. \r\nPunch Line is a show that many people dropped within the first few episodes and honestly, I don't blame them. It harbors an absolutely ridiculous premise and while the first episode is action-packed, the next four episodes focused more on (admittedly) lackluster comedy. However, those that stuck around to episode five got on a train ride with no stops. \r\nThe art and sound production were one of the main draws to the show for me and for many others that initially pickedup the show. It has unique character designs, bursting with personality. The soundtrack isn't extremely memorable, but it always did a good job at setting the mood and drawing me into the story. The voice actors all portrayed their characters amazingly well.\\n\\n\r\nBut more importantly, let's get to the story. Punch Line's premise, again, is ridiculous. What's amazing about Punch Line is that it manages to make its premise MAKE SENSE. From episode 5 onwards, almost every weird and ridiculous thing in the show is explained in a way that makes logical sense within the confines of this universe. There are a few plot threads left open at the end of the series, some of which I really wanted a conclusion to, but for the most part, everything that we see in episode one comes together by the final episode.\\n\\n\r\nThat is the single biggest reason to watch Punch Line, in my opinion. Watch the first episode and observe the wacky premise and wonder to yourself, \"How the hell does this make any sense?\" Then watch the rest of the show and be impressed at how it comes together. Punch Line, although its first half is rather weak, comes together in the second half to become an absolute must-watch for any anime fan.",

            "content": "Have you ever been at a modern art exhibit and felt like the artist just threw paint at the canvas? Many around you proclaim that it's \"original,\" \" bold,\" or \"expressive,\" while they point at the rectangle of incomprehensible shapes and sloppy paint. While they might see something praiseworthy, from where you're standing, it looks like a kindergarten arts and crafts project, where the kids ate a little too much Elmer's paste.\r\nPunch Line gives me that feeling, but instead of paint being thrown randomly at a canvas, we have themes and concepts instead. It felt like the creators just threw a bunch of ideas intoa hat after one too many drinks and began selecting random slips of paper from it to form the finished product. A string of loose thoughts, unsupported themes and underutilized concepts that somehow made it past the rough draft stage of some drunken editor's desk, where it was prematurely approved to become a final script. It's a tumultuous mess that tried to contain as many elements as possible and ended up imploding as a result. \\n\\n\r\nOrganized chaos isn't impossible to obtain, there has been countless of shows that have proven itself in accomplishing that. As long as the 'chaos' is guided by some kind of subtext or uniformity in each aspect's inclusion, it should turn out fine. However, if there's little in the way of connective tissue to hold the madness together, it doesn't take long before onlookers notice the shortcomings. With elements that do little to nothing to mesh together, it's hard to feel like there's any semblance of being behind Punch Line's existence. It's a project that confuses quirkiness with creative merit. There's no coherency between any of the show's plethora of flavoring, just a bunch of \"whys\" that are never properly explained. Why cinnamon? Why a bear for a pet? Why super saiyan? Why ghost cats? Why super sentai? Why panties? Why do panty-shots cause the world to explode outside of an obvious innuendo? Why body swaps? Why paradoxical time-travel? Why witchcraft? Why moe robot girl? Why anything? All these needless aspects that the show continuously tosses in felt like it was only there to distract from what little plot it was working with. A dribble of ideas thrown together, hoping a few would stick. And for the occasional instances where the show attempted to answer some of it, thematically it was as conclusive as the writers saying \"just because.\" Punch Line brings up more questions than it answers, a trend that finds itself bleeding over into the main story-line.\\n\\n\r\nFor the most part, the show tries to tell a straightforward story about our protagonist, Yuuta Iridatsu, who has to travel through time to stop the impending destruction of Earth by ways of a meteorite strike. While it seems simple enough, it's the inclusion of the aforementioned elements that makes a fairly ordinary tale into a muddled mess. With plot twists and reveals that do absolutely nothing for the show's overall story or the characters involved, these tacked on tidbits ended up being questionable content instead of tasteful flavoring. Flavoring isn't bad by itself, but it needs to be used in moderation, or at least add something to the overall dish. A little dressing on a salad will enhance the taste, but adding too much would just make it into a repulsive swampy soup. Punch Line became that swampy soup, by effectively drowning out its content with too many unwarranted aspects.\\n\\n\r\nMany of the plot points introduced during the show's run-time ended up not mattering in the long run since it was all negated by the \"save the world\" storyline that was introduced later on. The pointless elements discussed did nothing but further the issue, by taking time away from the narrative to travel down several detours that had no conclusion. It felt like a bait-and-switch from an over-the-top comedy/parody of super sentai, to an angst filled character drama along the lines of The Butterfly Effect. This was made even more jarring from the show's constant tonal shifts. Serious moments were often followed up by comedic gags, that not only downplayed the situation but also negated any tension that was supposed to arise from it. It destroyed any substantial weight behind incidents before it had time to sink in. There are times where serious moments that endangered the characters' lives were built up, only to be resolved by a flash of a girl's panties. It's not funny and it certainly isn't dramatic. The show's constant tonal shifts just kept on butting heads with each other. It made any conflict the show was trying to sell to feel pointless since it was easily washed away by the next scenario. When there's no consequence for life-threatening events, it's hard to get invested in a show's outcome.\\n\\n\r\nBut perhaps the biggest misstep of Punch Line was its use of time-travel. Time-travel is something that needs proper measure taken in order to stay relevantly coherent but the time-travel in Punch Line was beyond contrived and paradoxical. Every half-assed attempt to make sense of it only backfired. Since the theory of time-travel is riddled with paradoxes, to begin with, it's hard to put all the blame on the show. There are always loopholes whenever it is used in stories but there are some things that any iteration of time-travel tends to follow. Cardinal rules if you will. May that be the \"butterfly effect\" commonly found with linear travel or the \"grandfather\" paradox that's commonly shared with most iterations. Punch Line doesn't follow any of them, which causes it to make little sense when viewed as a whole. The closest thing to the type of time-travel Punch Line used would be parallel world jumping similar to what's used in TV shows like Sliders. But here's the problem, the protagonist already exist in this universe and even interacts with the other version of 'himself'. This should cause a rift in time or an anomaly to form but that never happens... and why you may ask? Well \"just because\", since it's something the writers seem to have no explanation for as usual. This lack of common sense was perfectly summed up with what I can only describe as the writer's not so subtle explanation via expository dialogue during the show's final moments. Our protagonist tries to explain and tie up the Gundam size plot holes by addressing the audience through the conversation 'he' had with the rest of the side characters. This laughable attempt to bring everything full-circle only shined a light on how improperly put together it was. All the explanation did was bring up more questions that would never get resolved. \\n\\n\r\nIf the show had anything going for it, it'll be the art and animation. It was vibrant and energetic. Similar to 2015 Winter season's Rolling Girls, it looked like a child's imagination brought to life. If you weren't watching this with any set standards it would be passable as visual entertainment. Being brought together by the relatively new studio MAPPA, Punch Line is yet another example of their visual prowess. The character designs were all very pleasant and felt well incorporated with the show's art choices. While they weren't all unique, it did have a trademark look about it that help to differentiate itself from other titles.\\n\r\nWhile it was well presented, for the most part, there were still times where the animation was stilted and stiff. This was more evident towards the middle portion of the show and the earlier slice-of-life episodes. The inconsistency from episode to episode can't be overlooked and hindered it from being better. But thankfully it made up for it by the 3/4 mark where the episodes maintained proper form and MAPPA strutted their stuff.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack for Punch Line is your typical J-pop/rock musical selection, with the added bonus of a few keyboard synthesizers and electronic instruments tossed in for good measure. This gave the music a vibe similar to the Euro House music scene, which worked in unison with the visual flare presented throughout the show. While nice for what it was, most of it wasn't used to its fullest potential and could have been incorporated better. Some standout tracks included \"Concentration\", \"Crisis\" and \"MUHI.\" It's nothing new and undoubtedly the kind of OST you would have heard many times over, but still did the job nonetheless. The opening theme \"PUNCH LINE!\" by Shokotan \u2665 Denpa Gumi was a very catchy idol-heavy musical number. Like the OST, it worked well with the show's visual presentation. Again, nothing new but still a nice toe-tapping ear-worm. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, the presentation of Punch Line was good and helped to make the nonsensical script more bearable than it would have been without it.\\n\\n\r\nNow, what little appraisal I could offer Punch Line presentation-wise, the same can't be done when addressing the character lineup. With no memorable characteristics or features to speak of, each character was given a basic archetypal role and simple personality quirk to substitute for actual personality. They're no better than the cast of children shows like The Care Bears or Teletubbies, where it seems like their color palette and character design directly corresponded to their simplistic portrayal. They're more like caricatures than actual people.\\n\r\nYuuta Iridatsu being our protagonist was the only one that was somewhat easy to relate to. Notice I said \"somewhat,\" as there was not much done to flesh out 'his' character. 'He' would most likely be remembered for a plot twist that I dear not spoil here than for 'him' as a person. \\n\r\nAlso, the ghost cat was probably the show's way of flipping the bird to the audience. For the entire run-time, he was presented as a guide for our protagonist that seemed to have an ulterior motive. There was no direct focus on the cat's actions but it always felt like it was meddling in the shadows. But it just turned out that the cat was just an expository mouthpiece for giving the audience painfully obvious info dumps, as well as serving as a plot-device for whenever the show(writers) needed to move the story along.\\n\r\nThe antagonists for the series was also a let down since, like the rest of the cast, they had no proper characterization or personality to speak of. They were simply bad because the show demanded it and again was another pointless plot twist that didn't matter in the end. \\n\\n\r\nAlso, expect A LOT of troll character \"death flag\" scenes. \\n\\n\r\nAs a whole, the cast was a disappointment and forgettable almost immediately after completion. And while the show had some memorable moments, as a whole, it was a title that left me with more of a headache than anything satisfying. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 5/10\\n\\n\r\nWith an inviting 1st episode, I thought I was getting ready to watch a fun super sentai journey with batshit insane presentation and over-the-top altercations but what I got instead was a show that quickly lost steam,  a comedic gag that lost its novelty and a plot that went up its own ass. Visually, it was fine but the tonal shifts and misuse of concepts brought my enjoyment down.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 4/10\\n\\n\r\nThe presentation ultimately saved this anime from being completely unwatchable. Where it could have worked as a satirical outlook on fanservice and super sentai flicks, it ended up going a more serious route, while not having the appropriate tone or pedigree of writing needed to back it up. It was an ambitious undertaking that fell short of the mark and squandered its chances of being better by trying to do too much at once. An idea was there but unfortunately, it was poorly realized.",

            "content": "**SPOILER FREE REVIEW**\r\nPunchline is a fascinating and ambitious, but ultimately failed experiment by Studio MAPPA to tell unique, non-chronological, wacky, plot-twist filled story much in the same vain as Haruhi Suzumiya. What went wrong? To make a long story short: incompetent writing. This anime introduces a plethora of confusing and poorly explained plot devices that turn out to be completely pointless, totally nonsensical, and/or dead ends, making the show a ridiculous comedy at best and an incomprehensible mess at worse. But let\u2019s talk about that:\r\nSynopsis: Whenever out protagonist, Yuuta Iradatsu, sees a girl\u2019s underwear, the world explodes. How? I don\u2019t know. Why? Not important apparently.Does this ever become a necessary plot point? No. Just roll with it. Anyway, Yuuta\u2019s soul has become separated from his body, and his goal is to save the world, his friends, and himself by observing a particular series of events over and over again in spirit-form, with each iteration ending in a time reset.\\n\\n\r\nExplaining exactly why a show doesn\u2019t make any sense is not an easy thing to do to somebody who hasn\u2019t seen it, especially without spoilers, but I\u2019ll do my best. If I had to sum up the reason Punchline\u2019s plot is absolutely awful in a single sentence, it would be this: Everything is pulled out of their ass. There is NO logical consistency or flow to the events of the show. Things that have no good explanations behind them just appear out of nowhere at random intervals as if the viewer is supposed to understand what is going on when nothing is being explained. I guess they were hoping that people would overlook the lack of explanation in favor of the fun factor, but that did not end up being the case because it\u2019s TOO vague and TOO \u201cout-there\u201d. Most anime fans are willing to overlook minor or even major discrepancies if the rest of the show makes sense, but very few were willing to tolerate the sheer amount of incompetence that Punchline vomited onto our screens. If ever there was an example of throwing shit to the wall to see what sticks, this anime is now the quintessential case. To reiterate once more, since I can\u2019t stress it enough, this show makes NO sense, and the very limited amount of mindless fun that it occasionally provides is not nearly enough to compensate for that.\\n\\n\r\nPerhaps the main reason Puchline fails to connect with the audience is because its characters are so flat and one-dimensional. Any semblance of a backstory or motivations that a character receives are always the barest of barebones, not to mention that they don\u2019t even make sense more often than not (have you spotted a pattern?). In fact, every time this show attempts to answer a question about one of its characters, it just raises three more. The show really banks on the fact that the viewers get attached to these basic archetypes and feel the chemistry/friendship that they have with each other, but they simply never give us a reason to. I didn\u2019t care about these characters because I had no idea who any of them were, and that includes the protagonist, who is on screen over 90% of the time. That\u2019s a major, MAJOR issue. Oh, and the pointless plot devices that have no reason to exist that I mentioned earlier? The characters have a ton of those. All I can guess is that they are an attempt to make the show seem more \u201ccrazy\u201d and \u201cfun\u201d, when really they just serve to make it even more incomprehensible. I don\u2019t remember any of their names; that\u2019s how truly unmemorable and uninteresting they are. Oh, and I\u2019m still pretty confused about who the villain was supposed to be and what his motivations were. This show is just one big giant clusterfuck of disorientation.\\n\\n\r\nBeing animated by Studio MAPPA, Punchline is not totally without its strong points. The art, art direction, cinematography, and animation in general are easily the highlights of the show. Actions scenes are made more fun with unique and experimental angles as well as over-the top choreography that can be pretty entertaining at times. MAPPA continues distinguish themselves with their stellar visuals. As for the use of sound, it\u2019s pretty standard. The OP and ED themes are catchy, but I\u2019ll forget them in a month. The OST is also pretty run of the mill and sound design was pretty hit or miss for me. To sum it up, Punchline has above average animation and average sound.\\n\\n\r\nIf you\u2019re looking for an over-the-top, mindless-fun sort of show, Punchline tries too hard to have a plot. If you are looking for a complex, Suzumiya-eque, intertwining story, Punchline is too confusing and nonsensical. As a result, this anime gets caught somewhere in the middle to these two target audiences, satisfies neither of them, and fails to establish any positive identity of its own. All things considered though, I must applaud the attempt at creating an original, multifaceted show. I truly hate the fact that I have to bash this anime because I really wanted to like it, but writing was simply too awful to tolerate. I do not recommend Punchline to anyone.",

            "content": "I have lusted after a good ecchi for years. My friends at MAPPA and Uchikoshi, the author of the Zero Escape video games series collaborated together to bring us just that. Like it's spiritual predecessor Kill la Kill, which virtually allowed the market for shows like this to be created once again, it is ecchi parody. The whole concept of the show is ecchi, the gag of reflexively destroying the world when chancing on panties immediately feels too obtuse. Why the hell would anyone ever watch something so blatantly dumb? Probably because if the narrative wasn't daringly original it would have been definitively the worstshow to be made in quite some time. \\n\\n\r\nWith that said, the ecchi portions of the show are absurdly flashy and basically so in-your-face jokes that there is no ecchi at all. Punch Line is not an arousing show. It was not created with the purpose of being arousing. It was a slice-of-life mystery from episode one. It's a riotous comedy that inverts all sorts of terribleness from the known-to-all loved-by-none (or degenerate) genre of ecchi. It has everything; a zany premise, harem situation, super powers, nose bleeds, the promise of sex jokes, robots, time travel, ninjas, mascot characters, archetypal cast, forgettable lead, low-budget setting, and the list goes on. We are given the direct dose of horrible ecchi setting, but Punch Line just wants to shake you up a little bit. What if the ecchi setting was used for something other than... vapid and lustful entertainment?\\n\\n\r\nWe are dealt a handful of hilariously offbeat slice-of-life episodes and then as audience, MAPPA knocks in the head a few times. Were you paying attention? If you haven't seen Punch Line yet, look out - There's no men in the main cast.\\n\\n\r\nThe music arrangement in Punch Line is standard issue for the most part. It's electronic and it's ambient and retains some of the doujin and sugar coated feel that the opening brings. The opening theme is really an anthem though, a real stupid, a real catchy, and really bizarre anthem. An ecchi show is all about the assets. It does everything to get your attention. Yet where ecchi shows usually begin to shy away from sexualizing after a certain point, resigning that the audience either gets it or won't watch, they throw together a sloppily and hastily made opening and ending theme. Punch Line does the opposite. Since the show itself is barely about seeing panties or having perverted moments linger, the opening does that in a 90 seconds full salvo. The ending is the opposite, an innocent and childlike fantasy. This ending theme is often at odds with the shows rather dark themes of imminent destruction and isolation.\\n\\n\r\nAnd that's actually what Punch Line is about. It's about a group of people with actually very little in common, living in the suburbs of Japan, in small rooms all right next door to each other. What do a bullied hikkikimori, annoying land-owner, a drunk floozy, and an ordinary school girl all have in common? Is it possible to live in such proximity to people and have no connection with them? The story of Punch Line is absurd and starts and ends promising, quite literally, the destruction of the world. And we get the destruction of the world. A couple times actually. But what Punch Line is a good flex of narrative muscle, bringing together originally stereotypical characters into a community that gives them just a little more innovation than the rest of the industry can do right now. Ecchi is a whole genre built on absurdism - how far can the label be pushed until the audience doesn't want to watch anymore and how far can the program go before the government axes production clean off the air for indecency. It is a totally unconventional place to actually enjoy a cast of characters, but Punch Line does it. Punch Line ends up being a believable story of unlikely friendships. \\n\\n\r\nThis completely absurd show with no boundaries and just an handful of troupes that the scriptwriter wanted to toy with actually manages to make you care. That is Punch Lines charm.\\n\\n\r\nWhen you get down and dirty with Punch Line you end up with a more riveting and somehow believable conclusion than the finale of Steins;Gate. The finesse it takes to bring such a lurid and stupid premise and breathe life into a genre devoid of any human dignity makes for a grand display, one you can't believe. I have to seriously congratulate Punch Line for managing to show that Kill la Kill wasn't just a one and done thing. It takes a lot of lace to tie together a show this buoyant.",

            "content": "(This has been adapted from my blog/reddit thread. Spoilers ahead!)\r\nCarl Sagan, a famous physicist, once said, \u201cExtinction is the rule. Survival is the exception.\u201d Whether we are conscious of it or not, our lives are filled with numerous instances of us simply trying to survive. Having a healthy diet keeps our body working well whereas wearing a seatbelt in a car provides immeasurable safety. Even something as simple as looking both ways when crossing the street could potentially save our life. We do these things \u2013 increasing our chances to live \u2013 because we do not want to die. Sounds rudimentary, but there is nota whole lot more to it than that; we all want to experience a \u201csupremely happy future.\u201d Punch Line is apocalyptic aversion incarnate, that\u2019s random in nature but not quite memorable.\\n\\n\r\nSTORY\\n\\n\r\nPunch Line starts with a bang, not a punch. After the super hero \u201cStrange Juice\u201d prevents a bus hijacking, young Yuuta Iridatsu has his body taken over by another soul, forcing him to find a special book capable of getting him his body back. But as the tale unfolds, strange events and mysteries come to the forefront.\\n\\n\r\nWhen a dice is tossed or a coin is flipped, the outcome of either scenario is random.

This is Punch Line\u2019s approach during the first half of the anime. Everything involved is absolutely random with no sense, direction, reason, or otherwise rationality placed behind it. There are talking, perverted, ghost cats, invisibility cloaks in the shape of squids, and power-ups provided through panty peeking; cinnamon makes poltergeists stronger, bears that have been genetically modified to further an organization\u2019s plans, and a giant robot that shoots fireworks; and there is even a weird, therapeutic dance that involves putting on a pigeon-head mask.\\n\\n\r\nThe randomness is silly and initially seems to have zero purpose, and to an extent that is correct. Punch Line intentionally leans on the wacky and ridiculous to keep the narrative shrouded in the mystery it boasts. It doesn\u2019t want the audience to understand what in the world is going on because part of the fun is trying to put the pieces together while dealing with the zaniness, and the randomness aids in that endeavor. Think of it like the dice or the coin \u2013 the randomness encountered is impossible to predict but there is a set amount of \u201canswers\u201d regardless of the probability involved. Besides keeping everything hidden plot-wise, the randomness is at least used for one thing: comedy. Looking at the first half compared to the second half it is clear that the random bits are meant to bring laughter to those watching. This type of comedy is often received well due to the uniqueness it brings and its quick-paced nature, both of which appear here.\\n\\n\r\nIn the second half of the anime, randomness gives way to coherency and the comedy is replaced by dramatic elements. What once was unknown becomes common knowledge through the show\u2019s gradual connection of the dots. That robot that shoots fireworks is used by Ito because of her amazing video game skills; the invisibility cloak shaped like a squid is worn to stealthily defeat some bad guys; and the pigeon-head dance finds use when summoning spirits. All the while the show\u2019s smaller plot mysteries are revealed due to the shift in perspective; instead of Yuuta missing specific days or not being able to see certain scenarios, he takes on a more active role in the festivities. Now, not all of the randomness is used to the anime\u2019s advantage \u2013 Muhi, the regenerating bear, is apparently incredibly important but is hardly utilized and Chiranosuke, the talking ghost cat, is little more than a guide post \u2013 but it manages to cover the majority of its bases.\\n\\n\r\nAlso of importance is the time-travel aspect which rests comfortably among the rest of Punch Line\u2019s randomness. Something paramount in any time-travel tale is making absolutely sure that there are no plot holes to speak of. It\u2019s a lot easier having them in narratives that use time-travel because of the paradoxical and cyclical nature of them. For Punch Line, it\u2019s not a vital part to the anime, but it is there nonetheless. To that end, it successfully avoids any massive errors in its timeline near the end through Yuuta\u2019s final actions, making everything as logical as possible.\\n\\n\r\nBeyond the randomness, mystery, and time-travel, there are a few problems that the narrative as a whole maintains. Thematically speaking, there isn\u2019t much; the idea of fighting for the future and the need for friendship is barely explored and essentially lost among the random moments. The actual plot with \u201cW\u201d and the \u201cQmay Group\u201d is handled poorly since the audience never really sees or learns much about them besides what is said in passing. But worst of all is the timing of the plot twist and the execution of it. Having to wait so long, and thereby needing to sit through so much incoherency, makes the narrative less of an adventure and more of an obstacle before it really gets going.\\n\\n\r\nANIMATION\\n\\n\r\nPunch Line takes place primarily in one area: the boarding house where the cast members reside. As such, there isn\u2019t too much diversity when it comes to the locations visited, but it is present within the house itself. Each character has their room and subsequently their own themes attached to them. Rabura\u2019s is purple and filled with weird objects to match her divination powers. Meika\u2019s is green, mechanical, and futuristic. And Ito\u2019s is dark and blue due to her recluse status, with cluttering rampant. The anime also employs stylistic eye-catches at the break between parts A and B. They often feature the women in nothing but their underwear (panties and bra) but the old-school look to them makes the pictures quite refined.\\n\\n\r\nThe character designs are not amazing but at least provide a good sense of individuality. Like their rooms, the characters often have a specific color attributed to them \u2013 Ito wears blue-striped socks, Mikatan is all pink, etc. \u2013 but they each have their own nice amount of detail on top this. Meika has her glasses and large headphones whereas Rabura has her earrings, sexy dress, and teal-bun hair. Their colorings coincide with their personality: Meika is yellow for happiness, Mikatan is pink for girly, Rabura is purple for beauty, and Ito is blue for sadness, all of which demonstrate the attention their designs received.\\n\\n\r\nActual animation for the show is roughly around average. There\u2019s surprisingly quite a bit of action involved for the majority of the show, but it isn\u2019t too extravagant. Hand-to-hand combat is the norm, with jumping, floating, and clothes ruffling being located here and there. The characters often have overzealous reactions as well that adds variety. But the greatest sequences come near the end, where the finale involves missiles, tanks, robots, brawls, and swords that increase anything the show did previously.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS\\n\\n\r\nPunch Line\u2019s weakest link is by far the characters that traverse it.\\n\\n\r\nOf particular note is the antagonist; Ryuuto \u2013 who is really Guri in Pine\u2019s original body \u2013 acts as the main adversary, but this is not explicitly known until much later. For whatever reason, though, even when he is introduced, the show continues to keep his motivations a secret. She wants her friends to join her on the ark that will escape the meteor\u2019s blast, but why she is so bent on murdering nearly all of humanity is not explained. That is, until right near end in an attempt to make her plight a bit more relatable or at the minimum understandable. It makes sense, that she wishes to enact the \u201csame\u201d pain on the people who did this to her or anyone else in the future, but her development comes too little, too late to be meaningful.\\n\\n\r\nInterestingly, Narugino \u2013 who is really Chiyoko in Guri\u2019s original body \u2013 doesn\u2019t fare much better. Growing up, she was slated as being a \u201chero of justice,\u201d due to her overwhelming powers through Uberfication and training at the hands of Meika. When the anime gets underway, she does not do much outside of attempting to conceal her identity, and even then, when she is revealed to be \u201cStrange Juice,\u201d nothing really comes of it. In essence, her character is there to expound on parts of the past; her, Pine\u2019s, and Chiyoko\u2019s younger days, what she went through following their separation, and what led her to the point she is at now.\\n\\n\r\nShe is not an incredibly deep or complex character which would not be a bad thing, and is even handled nicely, except at the finale. There, she rather selfishly goes against orders and indirectly kills her best friend. The idea was to create a scenario in which Guri \u201catones for her sins,\u201d Pine, who has lived literally 6 billion and more lives, completes his duty, and Chiyoko follows her \u201chero of justice\u201d mantra by sacrificing her person to protect Pine. But her actions were quite unnecessary considering what happened and even contradictory because of the results.\\n\\n\r\nTo make matters worse, Yuuta \u2013 whose soul is actually in Chiyoko\u2019s original body (confused yet?) \u2013 is quite the lame main character. As was briefly talked about earlier, the first half has him taking on a passive role; the second half an active one. But throughout the whole season, it is difficult to determine what he wants or what he wishes to accomplish. Through him, it becomes quite evident how story-driven the anime is; his character is all comedy and information gathering without granting him much in the way of development. The anime attempts to make his drive more personable through a few situations involving all of the residents, but he never comes off as \u201cone of the gang\u201d and subsequently his reason for fighting to save the world \u2013 protecting his friends \u2013 is rather weak. This in turn makes the ending a moot point, since his decision does not have much of a basis nor was there enough focus on his actual character to make him worth caring about.\\n\\n\r\nThe rest of the main cast \u2013 Meika, Rabura, and Ito \u2013 likewise find themselves sitting low on the totem pole. At least with Ito, the anime gives her a transitional phase, where she moves away from shy and lonesome to determined and friendly through the experiences she has at the house. As for the other two, Meika is a robot and Rabura works with ghosts, but that is the extent of who they are. If anything, they all have one commonality: an everlasting bond.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND\\n\\n\r\nThe opening theme is pretty good, with various tempos filling the piece to make it a very fun listen. The various vocalists, combined with the strange instruments and catchy beats, create quite the random arrangement, which is undoubtedly fitting given the anime\u2019s content. The ending theme also manages to be well-composed, with the first half having some nice guitar playing while the second half has an easy-to-follow beat.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the rest of the soundtrack, it\u2019s mostly filled with electronic instruments (such as in \u201cPressure\u201d and \u201cAgility\u201d), tracks consisting of otherworldly sounds (such as in \u201cState of Tension\u201d and \u201cInvisible Fear\u201d) that, like the OP, find themselves fitting snuggly within the confines of the show\u2019s randomness and dooms day setting. Others, like \u201cVictim,\u201d are signature to the anime \u2013 it\u2019s the song that plays when Yuuta is viewing some panties. Others still, like \u201cDeep in the Past,\u201d are very melancholic, rounding out the depressing moments poignantly. While some of the tracks blend together, it is still an interesting OST that does its job.\\n\\n\r\nVoice acting for Punch Line is somewhere above average. Special shout-outs are deserved for Sora Amamiya as Mikatan for her girly voice and Marina Inoue as Yuuta for giving a more androgynous voice to match the character\u2019s predicament.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT\\n\\n\r\nI can\u2019t say that I liked this one. Part of me wished that the show focused solely on the \u201cecchi\u201d elements, since the panty viewing was not as critical to the plot as it was originally made out to be. This became quite evident when the second half had nothing to do with the first half\u2019s problem of Yuuta seeing said panties; no longer was it about avoiding them entirely but instead only seeing them now and again when the plot demanded.\\n\\n\r\nAt the same time, super random comedy like this one had is not up my alley. I do not mind a bit of randomness, but events like the pigeon-head dance and especially Chiranosuke the talking ghost cat were not funny to me in the slightest. Along these same lines, I was not too fond of the characters themselves. Mikatan could be cute, but Yuuta was not comical, Ito and Meika were somewhat annoying, and Rabura did not have nearly enough screen-time to make her relevant.\\n\\n\r\nPunch Line is completely random and, oddly enough, simultaneously not. The art and animation is good, as are certain musical pieces. But the story\u2019s minor flaws, the poorly executed characters, and the stale comedy prevent the anime from being something more. While the cast members might have achieved a \u201csupremely happy future,\u201d the whole package certainly did not.\\n\\n\r\nSUMMARY\\n\\n\r\nStory: Fine, the randomness is used effectively, the time-travel aspect makes sense, but issues such as little thematic presence, a lackluster plot, and poor timing on the twist weaken the experience\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: Good, nice art style, nice character designs, about average actual animation\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Bad, Ryuuto (Guri), Mikatan (Chiyoko), and Yuuta (Pine) are all rather weak, with Rabura, Meika, and Ito barely being passable\\n\\n\r\nSound: Good, good OP, okay ED, interesting soundtrack, above average VA work\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Bad, the \u201cecchi\u201d moments are boring, the random comedy is a huge miss, and the characters are largely forgettable\\n\\n\r\nFinal Score: 5/10",

Still the story was quite interesting. This was an anime I watched when I was free but in middle of the anime it turned to opposite.I made time for it so that I can watch it. The anime started of fun (like most anime do) and ended with an unexpected small feel trip [I literally cried cause the character I was attached to died (Ain't revealing name cause \"Spoilers\" for other people who haven't watched it yet)] along with some big bang and happy ending.  I forgot to mention that this anime is a complete original anime. In other words the anime isn't adapted from manga or any other source but was created.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8/10 Near the end of the anime the songs started to really make it awesome with some nice tracks in the last episode. I sure wish they had the tracks in the early episodes but as the story started slow the tracks wouldn't have made sense and it would have lost it's purpose. Still was good hearing it. The OP was really good too.  Also oh the sound of those explosions was just so awesome. (Loving tanks do what is best since I was born) \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 7/10 Hmm... Nearly all the characters were uninteresting except Iridatsu Yuuta, Narugino Mikatan, And Teraoka Ryuuto. Also Chiranosuke the ghost cat was also a nice Side Character.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: 8/10 Animation Huh? Well it is ok. I don't remember a part where it was rushed in animation. It was pretty detailed though so points I give is perfect for it\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8/10 Enjoyment in the starting episode was pretty good and hilarious and when the story started getting serious so the enjoyment went down and up and down trying it's way to entertain the viewers.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: It never did concentrate ecchi on the future episodes as for it the story was becoming more important\\n\\n\r\nOverall Rating: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nPersonal note: I recommend that you buy the blu-ray version when it comes out as the anime is pretty good according to me.\\n\\n\r\nPersonal note 2: The ecchi is at minimum except the first episode so you can enjoy the anime without seeing too much ecchi scenes.\\n\\n\r\nPersonal note 3: It's a little hidden gem of this season. Even if the starting is pretty slow the episodes near ending are normal paced and really good. So don't drop this show and watch it till the last episode.",

I certainly do not regret it. This anime was one of the most \"didn't-see-it-coming\" I've ever watched. It's a good fun even though the main theme might sound weird at first. Panties? Saving the world? Huh???\r\nI don't want to get too much into storyline, but this anime will most certainly surprise you.After a few slower episodes of really mediocre gags it grasps you and doesn't let go. I would suggest watching it in one shot to catch all the little things that are in it. It really gets much better with time.\\n\\n\r\nIt is not a very sophisticated title, it doesn't really take on character development or moral issues, it rather focuses on ways to resolve the current problem using all available means, which sometimes gets slightly crazy. But the idea is good, execution is decent, plot twists are awesome!, the characters likable and not really obvious, and I wasn't really feeling like it's a bunch of weird ideas put into one, it rather mended together pretty well and gave me much enjoyment :)\\n\\n\r\nArt is really nice, cute, but darker at times, gets better with every episode. I was not really convinced with using 3D at the beginning episodes, but later on it blends in well.\\n\\n\r\nDefinitely worth watching, especially since it's not really long, so I'd suggest giving it a try.",

            "content": "When you finish something that you don't truly \"understand\", what should your reaction be?  Should you be critical and hateful towards it because it doesn't make sense in the natural realm of one's understanding?  Or should you congratulate it for being stand out and different from amongst the rest of the lot?  If something is considered unique, should we dismiss it for being too odd and too experimental?  Or should we congratulate it for going such a direction?  Aw fuck it, screw the philosophy.  Here's a review of Punch Line.  Ready, set, go.\r\nStory (6.22/10): Our protagonist Yuta iscould in a rather...peculiar situation.  For one thing, he was just in a bus crash.  For another thing, he's a ghost who is now away from his physical body.  And third, according to the ghost cat that he finds himself hanging around, if he sees a girl's underwear twice in a row, his excitement level will cause the world to end, thus creating the apocalypse.  Well, uh...that's...that's quite a predicament.\\n\\n\r\nOn the surface, Punch Line seems to be nothing more than a slice of ecchi, as the main grab from the show is apparently this ghost guy now trying to be careful in his dorm filled with girls to not try and see their underwear twice in a row.  But when you really get into it, not everything is as it seems.  The plot for Punch Line is one that I feel is one that is one that requires a lot of attention.  You see, the show itself has very different first and second halves, basically saying that depending on which part of the show you're on, you'll be watching something that differs greatly from what you would be seeing previously.  You see, there really is no consistency in Punch Line itself on account of every episode being something different, both answering and asking new questions at the same time as the plot unfolds for this show.  \\n\\n\r\nPersonally, I feel like the show is actually a Punchline for itself, seeing as how for the first six episodes, it's basically all setup giving a rather...unsavory viewing experience because it raises a lot more questions that answers before everything kinda makes sense in episode 7.  The fact that you have to sit through half the show focusing on something that seems like it doesn't actually pertain to the show's premise at all is something that I feel like makes the show a lot less appealing than it actually may be.  Simply put, the first half of the show makes almost zero sense.  The second half ties everything together so that whatever we're watching we can understand to some degree.  As the viewer, you have to tie everything together yourself, using the information, events, and characters that you're presented in order to create a neat plot line that you can follow as you go on and finish the show.  In theory, this is quite ingenious, but in practice, it was shaky at best.\\n\\n\r\nThe biggest issue I have with Punch Line was with the way it presented itself.  A lot of the points that we get don't actually feel like complete information, a lot of things still actually don't make a whole lot of sense, and the show goes into the realm of confusing so often that at times, even the show's characters get confused.  As a result, having to wait around for the second half might not happen with a lot of people because the show doesn't provide a cohesive plot line where things happen in a straight line.  (There's a lot of wibbly wobbly timey-wimey things in this anime.)\\n\\n\r\nAs far as personal complaints go, I'm not a big fan of the plot period.  There were a lot of things within the actual story that really I felt like needed more explanation, and I'm also not a big fan of having to pay attention to every little thing that happens just in case something important shows up later on, cause that does actually happen in this show.  Overall, I didn't personally find the show's story to be all that pleasurable.  It has a nice touch of having you piece the events yourself like the show itself is a little puzzle, but because it relied so heavily on the viewer, if you didn't know that ahead of time, the show would make little to no sense unless the show connected the dots for you.  Plus, I felt like a few things were thrown in there just because, so that soured my experience a little.\\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+    Decent second half\\n\r\n+/- Interesting storytelling format  (a negative as well because the format isn't for everyone)\\n\r\n-     Somewhat poor/confusing first half\\n\r\n-     A lot of things felt very unexplained and/or just thrown in\\n\r\n-     First half was a bit of a time waster  (sadly, it is necessary to watch\\n\\n\r\nCharacters (6.33/10): To be fair, while the story of Punchline can arguably be a great way of storytelling or a poor way of storytelling depending on who you're asking, the characters themselves really don't stand up all too much.\\n\\n\r\nFirst we have Yuta, our main ghostly protagonist.  Much like I have said before, the first half of the show doesn't really focus on our protagonist all that much, but rather the lives of the four other girls that live in their dorm house in the middle of nowhere.  This brings me to another point of confusion and why people may drop this show early.  Yuta as the main character, doesn't show up all that much.  In fact, he's for the most part an observer till later on in the series which really hampers the show a bit early on because when it comes to first impressions, Punchline doesn't really make any good ones.  His character does get explanation later on in the series, but the first six episodes of what is essentially exposition really doesn't make him shine or seem important.\\n\\n\r\nThen we have the girls of the dorm hourse, Korai house.  Narugino, Meika, Rabura, and Ito.  Each girl represents a different kind of anime troupe (idol, braniac, the lonely one, gamer) and each has their own functionality within our story.  (I grouped them all together to try and avoid spoilers on each one of them)  While they all do play an important part to the story later on, each one of them feels like they were thrown random character traits to make them seem a little bit more wacky/a little bit more interesting to watch early on, which admittedly, feels a bit forced.  \\n\\n\r\nIn terms of side characters, PunchLine has quite a number of them all with varying uses and importance, those uses and importances being basically, plot devices.  Pretty much every character is used to drive that plot and explain a little bit more in the world of PunchLine, and the secrets that it holds.  Overall though, I felt as if the characters really didn't make all that much sense.  The protagonist is essentially non-existent for the majority of the show, and all of the girls just don't really seem that interesting to me personally.  The side characters don't really have much going for them since they're mainly used to explain things, so their use is quite limited.  \\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n-  Almost non-existent protagonist\\n\r\n-  Female heroines felt bland\\n\r\n-  Side characters are mostly just plot devices\\n\\n\r\nArt and Sound (8.00/10 and 6.01/10): The art for Punchline was made by Mappa, a relatively new animation studio that's been up and coming as of late at the time of this review.  Punchline's animation is a style that relies mostly on a neon colored scheme, using a lot of bright colors on its palette.  Honestly, the art for the series is relatively nice looking.  It definitely has a unique feel to it.\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of sound, there's really not much to say.  Aside from the OP being somehow really addicting with its repeating word \"Punchline\" at the beginning, there's not really much to say as all of it is pretty forgettable and not really memorable.\\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+ Good art\\n\r\n-  Forgettable music\\n\\n\r\nPersonal Enjoyment (3.00/10): Admittedly...I don't really like Punchline.  While many people have seen it as a great experimentation of a new kind of story, really....I don't actually see it.  Instead, I see a very broken story with only being fed little bits of information that really don't constitute much of anything because we're given such minute amounts that while it does have an impact, doesn't really impact me as a viewer in a grave way as to how I view the story and all that.\\n\\n\r\nDid I enjoy this anime?\\n\\n\r\nNot...really.  I found it more to be confusing than anything.\\n\\n\r\nWhat didn't I like about this anime?\\n\\n\r\nThe first half really felt completely pointless to me.  Until you get to the latter half, then things start to make actual sense.  But until then, confusion just took ahold of my head because I had absolutely no idea what was going on.  There was all sorts of plot convenience, pigeon heads...  To be honest, I have absolutely no idea what I watched because it didn't really make sense to me.  \\n\\n\r\nWould I recommend this anime?\\n\\n\r\nPersonally, I didn't like it.  But because it has such a varying opinion, I feel like it's worth a shot.  It's very similar to FLCL in the sense that both shows have that sense of randomness and they're both shows that can have varying opinions depending on who's watching them.  There's slight ecchi, but there's not a whole lot to honestly worry about.  \\n\\n\r\nOverall Score: 6.43/10",

            "content": "Punch Line is the type of show where the first reaction you\u2019ll get is something along the lines on \u201cwhat the bloody hell?!\u201d Or something like that. Perhaps some might not get this type of reaction but the first episode literally feels like it drops you in the middle of nowhere. So, a question that pops up would be: how exactly can Punch Line be described as? Long story short. It\u2019s like a certain kind of twisted fun.\r\nAs an anime original show by Noitamina, there\u2019s not much to go on except for the main premise. Uemura Yutaka direct this series as his second anime project.However, it\u2019s not anything like Dantalian no Shoka. Punch Line is a standalone show that has no connection to any franchise. The premise is exactly what it sounds like. We have this young man named Yuuta Iridatsu with his peculiar habit. And to quote \u201cWhen he sees a girl's panties, he gets so excited he faints!\u201d The reality is that it affects him so much to the point where his spirit is separated from his body. However, a show like this also isn\u2019t without its mishaps. A major part of the story involves Yuuta trying to save the world because according to the series\u2019 tagline\u2026\\n\\n\r\n\u201cIf he sees underwear, humanity will be destroyed!?\u201d\\n\\n\r\nIn a nutshell, Punch Line is more of a misadventure. The series chronicles Yuuta\u2019s daily life that involves ghosts, time travel, idols, terrorism, tragedies, heroes, and of course panties. While most series use it more of as an advertising gimmick, Punch Line actually uses it as part of its plot device. When Yuuta sees panties, he literally gets a big nosebleed. Oh and then, there\u2019s the whole big apocalypse that he brings with him in the form of a meteoroid hitting the Earth. While this setup really sounds deadly, it mostly plays it for laughs for the first few episodes. Then somewhere down the road, the show decides to shake things up a bit with some startling revelations. Along the way, there\u2019s also a bit of tragedy. Now, I do give some credit to the series\u2019 ability to actually mix its ideas of death and comedy together. Although the series seems like a parody or gimmick, it actually does take itself seriously, to a point where death really does result in death. However, it\u2019s hard to convince the audience to accept all of this until we learn more of the truth. And that\u2019s something to remember in Punch Line. The series really builds up its story by showing rather than just telling. In fact, it does both while throwing bits of foreshadowing and red herring along the way. In retrospect, patience will be a key if you plan to finish this series as the first few episodes is nothing more like insane.\\n\\n\r\nAt some point of the series, I think people will wonder what the purpose of Punch Line really is. Is it a punch in the face for comedy? Is it a serious misadventure of craziness? Or is just about saving the world? Maybe it\u2019s more about the characters themselves rather than the story. Admiringly, the character cast is small yet colorful with a diverse range of personalities. The main protagonist has a hot-blooded personality although he is generally helpful towards the people he meets. Then we have characters like Mikatan with her energetic personality, Ito with her timid behavior, and Rabura with her curiosity. The show even takes time to fill in background stories for certain characters such as Ito to really give the audience an idea at what they are in for. Punch Line\u2019s character cast is perhaps one of the strongest attributes of the show as it has the courage to show off its characters. It also embraces its panty gimmick and while silly at first actually makes the show more fun to watch as part of the story. Every now and then though, it can seem more like a repetition. It knows its shamelessness and exploits it at times to a degree that may be distracting. I guess it\u2019s really a hit or miss to people with such a premise. The more detailed parts of the show comes in later and by foreshadowing, it also adds a bit of thrill for the audience to interpret or analyze ahead to what may come. Pieces of the story connect and come together as in the end, it knows its intentions. Along the way, you may even find the comedy to be appealing with the small doses of shenanigans going on. \\n\\n\r\nStudio MAPPA is in charge of this series. And although I praise them for some of their latest works such as the fantastic visual features of Shingeki no Bahamut, Punch Line doesn\u2019t live up exactly to its hype. The artwork seems goofy most of the time and although it\u2019s on track, it\u2019s really hard to take the show seriously. Character design is decent for most of what\u2019s worth although still lacks a sharp edge. I think the most prominent aspects of the show are the facial features. Each episode seems to be clear on what it\u2019s doing when it comes to character reactions and expressive tones. On the negative side, the setting and its backgrounds are hardly noticeable with diehard action scenes. The show clearly isn\u2019t drawn to show action as most of it just spells silliness. \\n\\n\r\nSoundtrack brings in a variety of ways to showcase this series. Although the OST works well, I\u2019d say that most of the successes comes from the character voice mannerisms. A small character cast such as Punch Line really needs to connect with the audience so it can keep the viewers at bay. Thanks to our characters\u2019 voice expressions and tones, that was easily achieved. Emotional scenarios, lighthearted moment, or hyperactive scenes are performed all at above standards by the voice actors/actresses. Even the cat Chiranosuke (voiced by Yuri Yoshida) has this amusing voice tone that is convincing. On the other hand, OP and ED theme songs are easily forgettable.\\n\\n\r\nThis isn\u2019t a show like X-Men or some parody such as the \u201cSuperhero Movie\u201d. It does takes itself seriously with the story despite its appalling gimmicks. The character cast is what keeps this show shining and each episode characterizes more and more. For any story to work, we are also given explanations so your initial impression of \u201cWHAT\u201d will likely change into \u201cOh\u201d later on. Some may dismiss this as a mindless fun journey though and this is what I had thought first as well. After all, the technical aspects of the show doesn\u2019t exactly set a golden egg-tier standard. However, it\u2019s still a fun ride from start to finish in the end. And it\u2019s all begins with panties.",

            "content": "Puchline is a very simple concept that is mashed together by so many unconventional aspects. If you see panties, the world ends. Which is exactly what this show seems to be about. Even still, despite it seeming to be a simple ecchi comedy, slice of life series, it doesn't stop it from being hilariously fascinating but why is it fascinating? Well that stems from it's creative writing and some-what unique plot progression. I say unique simple because of the way it's presented, at times we're introduced to certain events that, at first, seems completely random or just forced but turn out to make somewhat senseonce they explain it as or after the event occurs. This may seem like it's a bad thing but on the contrary it's actually reasonable for a series such as this, one thing to note is the pacing of this show. The pacing is somewhat high, whilst this is usually a bad thing in Punchline's case it isn't. I feel like a show like Punchline can only work at high pace or else it may just not click like it originally did with me but that's a completely subjective matter. \\n\\n\r\nNow as for the other reason as to why it's fascinating, the writing in this show may seem dumb at times but that's just the tip of the iceberg, let me explain. At first we're led to believe (minor spoiler) that the main plot of this show is to get Yuta back into his original body but as we move along the episodes we can see that isn't the only objective, I feel like the writers are deliberately misleading us with cliches to make more of an impact in whatever's to come. Overall the story of Punchline is really fun and fascinating, hell even the fanservice seems necessary for the show to progress but unfortunately that aspect's not for everyone.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters of this series aren't really unique, they're pretty much characters that we've seen in many other series but the characters in this series are what brings it to life. We're introduced to pretty much all the main characters in the first couple of episodes, that allowed us to establish each of the characters traits thus allowing the story to flourish properly. Pretty much all the characters have received some sort of developments whether it be a tragic past that adds depth the character or strong bonds that you didn't think could exist.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the animation, what can I say? I think MAPPA did a great job on animating a series like this, they paid attention to small details like the facial expressions and *cough* panties *cough* along with some great action scenes which judging from there past works was to be expected. I would definitely say that this was one of the better animated shows this year and my god am I glad MAPPA got the opportunity to do something like this. As for the sound, I think the OST fits this show perfectly, for example, scenes that usually wont have much of an impact on you tend to do because of how well the OST's where used. As for the opening and ending of this show, there's not much to really say. They're average but they fit the show so there's really nothing wrong about them.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I know it seems like I'm praising this show too much but that just shows how much it clicked with me. I'm fully aware that the synopsis of this show may put many people of but I highly recommend you stick with it at least until the 4th episode.",

            "content": "Thank you based MAPPA. Thank you Ushikoshi, i've never played your games so i didn't exactly know what to expect from you even with what i've heard. Punchline was waaay better than what i expected and this is pretty much the hidden gem of this season. \r\nThis review is pretty much what i thought exactly after watching the ending so ... sorry if there's a weird sentence or somethign like that.\r\nI can't talk too much about the story but what i can say is this : After an incident happened in a bus, the soul of our MC Yuuta separates from his body but surpriseand now his spirit wanders around his apartment. However he has a mission : Save the Earth from an asteroid hitting the planet and destroy it. Oh, and if he gets too excited while seeing panties the earth is doomed. So yeah ... thats pretty much the only things i can say. Which is pretty much what you can read on the page of the anime. That was pointless. \\n\\n\r\nAnyway, the art is really good, the animation it reminds me of Kill la kill and other stuff done by Trigger and Gainax and its done very well most of time. Anyway, in my case i like that style so .. that's a plus. The action is really good too, thats something you'll really enjoy it !\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is really good and varied. The OST of Punchline is a least less forgetable than a good chunk of anime these days and goes well with what happens in the scene and can get you pumped or sad. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters are good, but thats pretty much it. I have to say that they are pretty much are forgetable beside Meika and the cat, Chiranosuke. Still they have their moments. Again, i'm not gonna talk about it too much because ... yeah. Let's just say that they are pretty stereotypical at the beginning and after a while stuff happens. \\n\\n\r\nSo yeah, you've read that i didn't say a lot and there's a reason. Punchline starts off with a pretty strong first episode but after that, you might get turned off by it. However, don't drop it. Ooooh don't do it because a little bit before the first half this is where the fun really start with a lot of plot-twist and a really good ending. You know like Madoka magica that starts off like a cute magica girl anime and starts being dark after a couple of episodes ? Yeah, it's pretty much the case here. It starts like an Ecchi/Comedy. It just takes more time to really start. It's totally worth it. Don't look at the rating, it's pretty low because a lot of people dropped it and gave it a bad rating before the good part.\\n\\n\r\nOne last thing : The comedy sucked most of the time.\\n\\n\r\nTL;DR : The anime is really good. Some episodes in the first half are crap imo. The rest is reeaaaally good.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, 8/10. \\n\\n",

            "content": "The written Review to my Video Review.\r\nHow serious can you be when your super power activates when you see panties? Well not too serious I would presume, but this anime may take itself too seriously for it\u2019s concept. \r\nStory - 3/10\r\nThe story of Punch Line is kind of a complex one. It may sound simple, but not at all. Punch Line follows the story of Yuuta Iridatsu as he tries to save the world. How does he do that one may ask, well we don\u2019t really figure that out till episode 6. But the premise of the story is that Yuuta has been transformed intoa ghost and there is a big gigantic meteor coming down to destroy the world, and the key to stopping the meteor is apparently spending time in an apartment lot and figuring out how to stop the meteor? However the world can also be destroyed if Yuuta sees panties as well, twice that is in a short amount of time. So he\u2019s got to figure out how to save the world while keeping himself away from panties. The story is rather confusing until episode 6 when it all starts making sense. But the premise of the plot is time traveling, because Yuuta must gather as much information as he can from the present in order to travel back to the past to prevent the meteor from hitting, thus looking for a better future.\\n\\n\r\nThe whole idea about spending time as an onlooker to figuring out how to change time is a confusing concept indeed. It is hard to understand the story, when everything just looks so normal with little plot happening in them. And the story is kind of boring pre episode 6, because you don\u2019t know exactly what is happening and even after episode 6, it kind of repeats itself and you still don\u2019t know the full extent on what is going on. The backstory in Punch Line is vaguely touched upon, sure we see it, but we don\u2019t know how and why it\u2019s happening. And the plot takes itself way too seriously, it gets very dramatic for a show that was supposed to be a comedy, and it doesn\u2019t work well because it\u2019s all very hard to take in. And honestly I don\u2019t think the payoff was that worth it. Even the twist at episode 6 felt very predictable.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters - 3/10\\n\\n\r\nYuuta Iridatsu is the main protagonist, he\u2019s goal is save the world while trying to avoid from looking up panties as well. From what we can see he\u2019s just as confuse as we are, he doesn\u2019t understand why he has superpowers when he looks up girls panties, he doesn\u2019t know why he\u2019s a ghost and he doesn\u2019t understand what is going on. It\u2019s like the writer did that on purpose to symbolise us in him, and I\u2019m not sure that\u2019s a good thing. We came for the ecchi, but we\u2019re confused with the story. There is also rather little character development for him as we just see him having the same attitude throughout the rest of show, where he is a guy living with a bunch of girls trying to avoid them, while being nice and also trying to be the hero, with the will to save everyone as best as he can.\\n\\n\r\nOther characters that make up residents of the apartment lot are, Mikatan Narugino who also has superhero persona and has little development as she pretty portrays the happy girl. Ito Hikiotani, a NEET spends most of her time on the computer, however has more development over the course of the series than the other mains as she starts to get more involved with the people around her. Meika Daihatsu who is a mechanic and the landlord serves as the guardian to pretty much everyone. And lastly there is Rabura Chichibu, who despite her incompetency is shown to be a very reliable spiritual medium as the series progress. \\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately I don\u2019t the main cast was all that good, as I was so caught up in trying to understand the situations to get a clearer picture of the characters. By the end of the series they felt like they were just used to show their individual talents in the last battle, because honestly their interactions with each other was kind of boring. And I would go on to the some of the other supporting characters if one of the characters didn\u2019t really annoy the hell out of me. Seriously SCREW THE CAT.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation and Sound - 6/10. 7/10\\n\\n\r\nThe art style I can\u2019t complain too much, because although it doesn\u2019t look bad, it doesn\u2019t look anything great as well. The shape of the characters feel a lot more rounded than other animes and the colour palette felt very simple, although some of the scenes looked very childish in a good way as it reflects on the characters rather well, and it shows the show is not a serious show to begin with. However the action scenes although that last one is completely fine, everything else before it is nothing special at all. And it does suffer have some frame rate problems, but none to breaking. As a personal opinion, I\u2019m not a huge fan on this kind of anime art style, as it just looks very simplistic and a bit messy for me with the more rounded nature in the designs of the characters. I mean if their supposed to be adults and teenagers, how come they look like pre-teen kids.\\n\\n\r\nI actually kind of enjoy the soundtrack of Punch Line. Although the opening and ending songs are nothing to write home about they\u2019re find perfectly accept. The opening theme maybe a bit catchy, in a bad way. However it\u2019s not too annoying. The OST for the show is a mixture of J-pop and rock. Which I find quite enjoyable to listen to. I especially like it even more when they have their many variety of electro music kicking in. I like how they have almost a different OST for each situation, which gives it a huge variety and it usually does the job in fitting in with the scene. As for the voice acting, it\u2019s fine and acceptable. But seriously SCREW THE CAT. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 3/10\\n\\n\r\nI did not enjoy watching Punch Line because I could not get my head around the story. Not only was it a hard story to follow, it was quite a boring one at the same time. The show does get a tad better after episode 6, but that felt too long before anything interesting starts happening and even then, it felt like it repeated right after. Also the fact the story takes itself way too seriously, when the concept is stupid to begin with. The comedy in the show has very little impact, as some of the jokes weren\u2019t really all that funny and gets kind of repetive. The last fight scene wasn\u2019t bad and the soundtrack was enjoyable, but I don\u2019t t feel that\u2019s enough to make it enjoyable. Especially if the characters are lacking and aren\u2019t as interesting. And seriously SCREW THE CAT.\\n\\n\r\nVerdict - 4.5/10\\n\\n\r\nFor the story I give it a 3, as the story is confusing and uninteresting to begin with. It takes way too long to go anywhere and the payoff wasn\u2019t really worth it. Also the fact that the story takes itself way too seriously for such a stupid concept. The story sort of got better at the half way, but that was still too long.\\n\\n\r\nFor animation and sound I give them a 6 and 7 respectively. Although the animation is good, but not great. Some of the scenes look good and some of them don\u2019t. I\u2019m not a huge fan of the art style, but it shouldn\u2019t affect you all that badly. The soundtrack is actually quite enjoyable and it good to hear there is a variety of different tracks being played throughout the show, and they\u2019re pretty good ones at that.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters get a 3 from me. As I found little interest in them, and felt like they were just there to fill out a certain role. There is little development in them and the interactions just felt awkward between them. There are a few exceptions for some of the characters such as Ito, and other supports. The characters a bearable and not too annoying. However for the last time seriously, SCREW THE CAT.\\n\\n\r\nFor my personal enjoyment I give it a 3. Because it was very hard following this show, plus I\u2019m not a huge fan of the art style. It looked quite simplistic and the story didn\u2019t feel like it fitted well with the art style. Some of the fight scenes and music are enjoyable, but that\u2019s it, I couldn\u2019t delve very deep into the characters as I didn\u2019t find them all too interesting. And the jokes weren\u2019t all that funny to begin with as well.\\n\\n\r\nSo for the final score after rounding it all I up, I give Punch Line a 4.5/10. It feels like a below average anime was being made, which is reflected upon the art style, although it\u2019s perfectly fine if the plot wasn\u2019t so serious and dramatic and should\u2019ve been more silly like the concept. If you want to watch Punch Line go ahead, but if you\u2019re looking for the ecchi there\u2019s not that much and if you\u2019re looking for something weird, there are plenty of better options out there.\\n",

            "content": "Punch Line started relatively slowly, I was watching it when it was airing and only got up to 3 episodes before dropping it in favour of other titles. Boy do I regret that now! Around episode 5 things got really interesting and I was hooked on the story, characters and ambiance of the show. It's so fun but at the same time it has the right amount of comedy to action/drama ratio, and even some feels!\r\nStory - 8\r\nI found the story for Punch Line fun, but lukewarm up until about episode 5, where the real story came into its own. It's a pretty ridiculous premisethat can only be appreciated by viewing, not by having it explained to you! Despite it being so zany, the plot really doesn't FEEL ridiculous in the context of the world presented and the characters, so it's really enjoyable to watch everything unfold and be party to what is happening in each of the character's lives. It's a pretty basic saving the world type plot on the surface, but in reality every part of what you see is important to some degree and even the first few episodes, whilst not gripping, contain some important scene setting components and clues.\\n\\n\r\nArt - 9\\n\r\nThe art is what initially drew me to Punch Line, it has a bit of a Kill La Kill vibe, although I'd go so far as to say it's more colourful. Lines are clean and crisp, and the colours are very saturated and bright but not too bright that it would burn your eyes out. I love the character designs and each of them has their own palette which was brought out nicely, too, in their room designs, which made each of them feel unique (not just having the standard anime room with little embellishments and no personality).\\n\\n\r\nSound - 8\\n\r\nSound is usually something I notice less in anime (with the exception of the voices, of course) but I LOVED the score used in Punch Line. The action scenes had punchy music that would get you excited for what was about to happen and the more sombre moments had fitting music too. Comedic moments and their associated sounds were timed perfectly making for some truly hilarious moments.\\n\r\nVoice actors did a stellar job, Rie Kugimiya especially is worth mentioning for me here as often I find her voice to have a quality I don't enjoy listening to, but I found her to be more toned-down and less squeaky in this anime and I really enjoyed her performance.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 9\\n\r\nThe characters are what held the most charm for me in this anime (as they should in any anime, I suppose). Each character had a purpose and role to play in the grand scheme of things within the anime, there was no token character or character who made no sense. I also enjoyed the fact that they weren't really moulded to fit within tropes, as so many characters are in anime.\\n\r\nI found Yuuta, the protagonist, clever and charismatic, unlike most male leads he had a backbone and worked out things himself instead of having deus ex machinas appear to progress the plot and conveniently show up when he is in a pinch.\\n\r\nChiranosuke, the cat spirit, I honestly found hilarious. Some may find him annoying but I warmed to him very early on when he goes to show Yuuta something on the computer and..let's just say he gets the wrong page. A very relate-able experience for many, I'm sure.\\n\r\nI found all of the girls held their own ground in this anime so I felt really involved in their world, they were believable within the context, each had their quirks but each was ultimately a strong, fighting individual who knew her own mind, which is also a nice thing to see.\\n\\n\r\nI thoroughly enjoyed Punch Line once I picked it back up, it has more surface qualities like great art and animation, and great sound track, but when you look past face value there is loads to appreciate deeper down in the anime, such as a great story and lovable cast of characters. There are comedic moments which made me laugh, tense scenes which had me practically sitting on the edge of my seat needing to know what the outcome would be, action-filled scenes (though honestly this isn't the main draw of this anime as it's so short) which felt exciting and even a couple of tear-jerking scenes.\\n\r\nHighly recommended for a fun afternoon watch.",

            "content": "The only thing more mystifying than the existence of Punch Line is the reception it got from the anime community upon release. Not necessarily the violent levels of hatred it got given the premise - although anyone who saw the PV should have been prepared for what was to come long ago - but for some specific bile they used to discredit it itself. FLCL without a clear direction or identity you say? First of all, if something doesn't have an identity, than how it can possibly be compared to something else? Second, who exactly made that shitty comparison to begin with?\r\nI've compared Bruno Matteito a piece of cheese, and yet I don't see how the two anime are similar in the least. FLCL established from the start that it'd be a story about a kid struggling with inner demons, whilst Punch Line established at its start that it'd be about a boy being thrown into an unfamiliar situation, Silent Hill-style if Silent Hill replaced the horrifying monsters and dense fog with horrifying anime girls and dense wackiness. They couldn't be more different. A closer comparison would have been if you matched Punch Line up with...well, Silent Hill. The most accurate comparison would have been if you compared it to Steins;Gate or Madoka aka \"the best anime of 2011\" according to most people. In fact, I can just see those three anime being siblings with the former two having grown up to be mega-successful corporate sell-outs whilst the latter is the black sheep that nobody loves because he's ugly and misunderstood and the only one who'll so much as breathe the same air as him is Samurai Flamenco.\\n\\n\r\nSorry for spoiling some important plot points to those who get the references, but considering how so many fans of them will probably never watch this show (and non-fans probably won't either), I don't think anyone's going to cry about it. I mean have you seen the ratings this show is getting in Japan? Even Glee at its worst is laughing at 'em. But yes, Punch Line is basically Steins;Gate's story combined with Madoka's execution, except with magical girls replaced by Flamenco-esque superheroes that fight with the finesse insanity of a character from Air Master. And the result? Not bad. Not great, but the fact that it has so much bile thrown at it compared to Steins;Gate or Madoka is very confusing to me.\\n\\n\r\nPunch Line is admittedly a very off-putting anime, even once you discover what it's really about. I mean I knew right away that it'd be an anime about time traveling in order to stop disaster and I still had moments when I couldn't really dig deep into it. I've made it clear that I'm not a fan of the visual novel structure and that even the best of what comes from \u201cvisual novel writer\u201d anime can't get away from having entire episodes devoted to boring setup and explanations that don\u2019t progress things in any real way. This is particularly obnoxious in the second half when after a really hilarious reveal regarding who\u2019s who and what\u2019s what, the show repeats events from the first few episodes from a different perspective. It would have been fine if the reveals actually progressed things, but all they did was make me go \u201cyeah, I kinda figured. Can we go back to playing that dramatic music again, please?\u201d\\n\\n\r\nAs for my opinion on the panty antics, I honestly don\u2019t give two shits. I don\u2019t usually like ecchi humor (actually, I\u2019ve never liked ecchi humor), but it\u2019s not an automatic turn-off for me...1% of the time. I was sold on following the show when I realized that despite the first episode telling you otherwise, Yuta\u2019s nosebleeds don\u2019t cause the destruction of the world so much as make him time travel to said destruction. That little flash-forward bit that happened right after his first eruption as a ghost wasn\u2019t exactly subtle about it. So I figured seeing if they can follow through on this \u201cend of the world\u201d conspiracy and tolerated how he has to act like a pervert in order to turn into a Super Saiyan. That said, I\u2019m not really sure why he has to do that considering everyone else seems to have no problems powering up themselves. I know he has body issues, but so do some of the other characters, and I very much doubt the author had gender differences in mind in regards to the issue apart from a cheap gag.\\n\\n\r\nNot to say that the comedy is good. But for what it\u2019s worth, it\u2019s not bad when it\u2019s not focusing on making the main character try to relive the early to mid-00s. There are a couple of moments that made me laugh like Miyazawa Kenji before the show realized his true identity was more obvious than a 50-foot tall giant hunchback trying to blend in on the Mayflower. However, for a show called Punch Line, I\u2019d have expected an ending that blew my expectations so much that I\u2019d crack up harder than Ed from The Lion King after going through a large amount of coke. But no, the show plays out rather fittingly climactic before ending on another panty joke. Not a bad thing as most VN adaptations tend to chicken out with some awkwardly crowbarred-in \u201ctrue ending shit\u201d that ruin the flow when you bring it to the moving picture medium. Still, I felt it could have been stronger. Maybe I missed one of Uchikoshi\u2019s many hidden messages. I dunno.\\n\\n\r\nWith regards to the actual story, my issue with it is that it doesn\u2019t really push its agenda hard enough. I know it's common in visual novel-type stories to mask characters' personal turmoil by having them act like anime stereotypes, but it's also common in light novel adaptations to have heroines whose bust is three sizes too large break the laws of physics or for our Republicans to hate the legalization of gay marriage across the country, so I wouldn't go around using that as a defense if I were you. More than though, whilst the show actually tackles many of the political grudges and youth culture issues that Japan is suffering from underneath all the wackiness, it doesn\u2019t really say much that you wouldn\u2019t know about them other than saying we should fight \u2018em with a giant robot, which isn\u2019t applicable to the real world at all unless Japan has a secret facility they\u2019re not telling us about. It also doesn\u2019t say too much about superheroes either that you haven\u2019t seen before. In fact, it\u2019s actually kind of standard with the only thing standing out is that all the sentai members are female.\\n\\n\r\nBut there is one standout clever moment in the end, and without getting too spoiler-y, it involves a sacrifice that whilst kinda predictable and nothing all that new in theory, is pretty f*cked up when you think about it. Could it have been a metaphor for how Japan\u2019s youth will always suffer for its crimes? Is it a subversion of the childhood-friend trio trope? Honestly, it could be, but I don\u2019t care enough about the show to analyze it. Maybe if said scene wasn\u2019t succeeded by another panty gag...\\n\\n\r\nPunch Line isn\u2019t leaving this review without a positive grade from me, but said grade has a bit of a noticeable minus-sign next to it if you know what I mean. Whilst a good majority of the show is solid enough, it succumbs to the same middling lows expected of VN writing and the only thing that really amazes is the visual style. And that takes a noticeable hit during the middle stretch because in order to make the finale as impressive as possible - which they succeeded at quite spectacularly mind you - compromises have to be made, and Mappa aren\u2019t exactly KyoAni/Bones in terms of raking in the dough. Still, as a fan of animation and what can be accomplished with it, Punchline does a fine job of satisfying that itch, so if you want to see what the medium can accomplish and aren\u2019t deathly allergic to panty/nosebleed humor and Rie Kugimiya\u2019s nasally voice, check it out. \\n\\n\r\nNow if you\u2019ll excuse me, I\u2019m going to look at that other Spring 2015 \u201cvisual novel writer\u201d anime that people seem to think is a much better series and stomp holes into its pristine soullessness with all the ferocity of a kangaroo riding a jackhammer.",

Yet it isn't getting as much love as it deserves. There is a reason for that. Basically, the creators of punchline basically fucked up in attracting anyone to the series. The first few episodes are pure randomness and I mean PURE RANDOMNESS. Because of that people just rated it because of their first impressions which I see to be pretty common here. Once you get past episode 6 you will start understanding the story and whenthat happens there is a very high chance you will enjoy it.\\n\r\nThanks for reading this short review.

            "content": "This show is awful, terrible garbage, the kind of trash that is the reason why so many people are hesitant to admit they watch anime. The premise alone is horrible and unappealing.\r\nAnd yet it's pretty good somehow.\r\nI would compare this type of absolute trash entertainment to the movie Venom. It's pretty objectively a poor work, but you're having so much ridiculous fun that you can ignore that and just go along for the ride.\r\nSo yeah, this is an anime about ghosts and time loops and asteroids and robot scientists and superheroes and gene editing and gender identity and government coverups and school bullying and catgods and romance and friendship and panties and panties and panties. It covers the whole damn spectrum of Weird Anime Stuff, gives absolutely no thought into actually making a coherent piece out of it all, and just blows into the story.\\n\\n\r\nPart of the reason Punch Line probably wasn't as successful as it could have been is because of just how brazen it is about refusing to dumb itself down (or in this case, smarten itself up) for audience expectations. It knows exactly what kind of show it is, so instead of trying to hunker down and deliver an appealing fanservice show or a compelling character drama, it just dicks around however it wants and throws every possible element against the wall seemingly at random. The show starts off as some bombastic action show, before suddenly and violently veering into a supernatural apartment roommate comedy, one that of course quickly reveals itself to be a sci-fi/fantasy hodgepodge that never quite explains its own existence. The same episode that introduces ghostly possession also introduces the NSA. Yeah, it's that kind of show.\\n\\n\r\nThe cast is good, the four main girls all being pretty solid archetypes you've seen before but in an interesting dynamic because each character gets just a little bit of extra development to make them really apt to clash with each other. Add in the main hero and his psuedo-shounen hero self, and you actually have a pretty eclectic mix. A couple of of them have some legitimately well-done dramatic moments as well, rare for any action or comedy series.\\n\\n\r\nThe main hero, Yuuta, is one of the biggest standouts of the series, in that his role as a generic male protagonist is a sleight-of-hand by the show itself. I can't divulge too much here, but let's just say that the story is in medias res for a reason.\\n\\n\r\nAnd... that's really the biggest hook here for Punch Line. It is constantly trying to fool its audience, throwing in crazy plot twists and unbelievably dumb backstories, slowly unfolding the entire story in all its convolution. LARGELY the story is predictable and if you're paying attention you can pretty much figure out where it's going by the end of episode 2 or 3, but there will be a few shockers to throw you off balance even then. It's really stupid but I very much enjoyed every stupid plot development. \\n\\n\r\nThe writers were clearly having a ton of fun making this story, and their excitement really translates into a fun end product. You see lots of shows where it seems like they were just making it out of obligation, or maybe the passion left before production actually begun, or something else that is reflected in the paint-by-numbers elements of the end product. Punch Line is the opposite of this and you can pinpoint each moment where the writers definitely thought they were being super clever. It's good to be in love with your own story!\\n\\n\r\nSadly, the show is a bit too scatterbrained for its own good, and the finale isn't particularly strong. It actually feels like they were too rushed, and that the series needed another three or six episodes to truly tell the story they wanted to tell. But thanks to the anime industry's pointless and strict season requirements, we only got twelve episodes out of it. Honestly, if it had gone a full 24 episodes, I think it might have actually been able to ascend past being stupid fun and become something truly good. As it was, there wasn't quite enough time available, though the fast pace is definitely welcome.\\n\\n\r\nUnless you're a moron who takes everything too seriously, Punch Line is probably for you. It sucks and is great simultaneously, and it's rare to see that kind of thing. Despite my 6/10 rating, I actually recommend this quite a bit! Just... don't expect anything good!",

            "content": "Let me start off by saying that the only reason I started watching Punch Line in the first place is because the concept seemed ridiculous enough to provide some laughs. I mean, based on everything I had seen, it looked like any common ecchi. Like many reviewers have already stated, that's how it started out. It interested me at first and I was excited to watch it but eventually it became more like a chore as the attention grabbing features became muted and the less than subtle panty shots took over. However, by the time it got to the fifth episode (I think that's whatit was but don't hold me on it), everything changed. \\n\\n\r\nStory (7/10)\\n\r\nPunch Line began without a strong story or any real sense of direction. The opening act of the show appeared to be merely a series of disconnected gags with no purpose. Even for myself, someone who finds great enjoyment in cheap comedy and slice of life, found the show to be a bore. Let me tell you though, it was so worth it to stick with the show. All the things that seemed dumb began to make sense. All the random threads were being connected. All the characters I didn't care for became important to me. The show just began to work. I don't want to spoil anything here so I won't be specific about anything so I'll just say this: the show stops being a show about panties and becomes a dynamic adventure with elements, plot threads, and emotions you'd never think could come from a show with a main character who seems to have more blood in his general nose area than a normal person has in their whole body. The only reason I gave the story a 7 is because that slow part does really put a dent in it. If they had found a way to make that more entertaining that would be a different case. \\n\\n\r\nArt (8/10)\\n\r\nI don't think this section needs to be as long winded as the story section (yeah sorry about that) so I'll just get right to it. Is the art great? No, not particularly. But is it bad? Certainly not. The art style does however fit  the overall tone of the story very well. It's not too detailed and it shouldnt be. It's not generic either. It has enough imagination and individuality to make it stand out, even if just a little.\\n\\n\r\nSound (7/10)\\n\r\nI usually don't pay attention to soundtracks unless they are particularly good. Meaning if they are just average I tend not to notice them. That is Punch Line. I don't mean to say the soundtrack is bad, it's just kind of there. It normally did its job (although the score underperformed in some scenes) and generally blended in quite well. But if I can't remember a single tune after watching the show, it didn't have much of an impact. However, I did like the opening and ending themes a lot. The opening in particular was very catchy and lighthearted, much like the show itself.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter (9/10)\\n\r\nPunch Line did an excellent job in portraying it's characters. The show made me feel a connection to the cast and not all shows can do that. Everyone is unique and has his or her own demons and/or motives. It was fun to go on the ride with them. Sure there we some cliches, but they weren't so glaringly obvious that they couldn't be looked past. Plus the protagonist, Yuta, was very likable for me and if the protagonist sucks than...oh well. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (9/10)\\n\r\nI freaking loved this show. Sure it had its down time, but all the rest more than made up for it. I was so surprised by this show that I expected nothing out of. Out of nowhere it became one of my favorite shows of the season, maybe even my favorite. I was just so pleasently surprised I just couldn't help but enjoy it immensely. And just in case you're worried, yes it was funny. I made it seem like it wasn't but it really was. \\n\\n\r\nOverall (9/10)\\n\r\nHats off to Punch Line here. If you are able to stick with it through the first 4 or 5 episodes I believe you will find it is worth it. Everything comes together in only the way Punch Line can do it (and the only way that makes sense). Your efforts will be rewarded and then some.\\n\\n\r\nThis is my first review so go easy on me here. I'm not quite sure what exactly I should be saying yet. I'll do better next time!",

            "content": "The last part of a story or a joke that explains the meaning of what happened previously which intends to provoke laughter or thought.\r\nA pun on \u201cpanchira\u201d that literally means panty shot in Japanese which the show wears on its sleeve.\r\nOr both?\r\nThere are anime that follow the bait and switch formula, and this is one of them.\r\n[Story]\r\n- \u201cThat sounds like something from a video game.\u201d\r\nWith a tagline so ridiculous that says \u201cIf he sees underwear, humanity will be destroyed!?\u201d this must be the one of those typical ecchi harems, right? There\u2019s much more to Punchline than by solely judging it from the divisive premise.(Hint: The protagonist isn\u2019t the cause why the world is destroyed when he sees panties, he fails to save it if he sees too much).\\n\\n\r\nOriginal story by MAGES, distilled into a 12 episode anime by Kotaro Uchikoshi (Ever17, Zero Escape). While there are many anime that model after MMORPGs, Punchline\u2019s structure is pulled out from adventure games. \\n\\n\r\nWe follow the odyssey of a boy named Yuta Iridatsu. On December 21st, he is taken hostage on a hijacked bus by a terrorist group. He catches a glimpse of panties which gives him a power up, and tackles the bad guy. But sees panties again, and passes out. After that, he is zapped by a yellow light in the sky. He wakes up in his apartment, confused, and finds out that he\u2019s separated from his own body. The only help he receives is from a crazy ghost cat, named Chiranosuke, that explains his situation and abilities. Yuta uses his newfound powers to protect his house mates from danger.\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately, because of Yuta\u2019s idiosyncratic condition, he must avoid seeing panties twice, or else he loses consciousness, and as a spirit, time jumps to a point when an impending giant asteroid destroys Earth. What is going on exactly? For now, I\u2019ll just quote the crazy talking cat, \u201cYou don\u2019t have to over think it.\u201d\\n\\n\r\nI won\u2019t say more and make sense of what Punchline is, because it will involve spoilers. The story really is about the daily lives of the Korai House residents in a span of 10 days, and how they fight fate. It doesn\u2019t make much sense in the convoluted first half of the series, still it bids full attention as it won\u2019t really spoonfeed the details later. How the scattered puzzle pieces form together is a satisfying experience, the way it executes its story resembles Baccano! or Durarara!!\\n\\n\r\n[Visuals]\\n\r\n- \u201cHuh? I\u2019m in my apartment!?\u201d\\n\\n\r\nMAPPA delivers in aesthetics. As an anime that is damn casual with it\u2019s panty shots, they even have a legit good Lingerie Designer, Uemura Hiromi for that. The panties shown all over the show are pretty, and you can easily tell which girl it is based on the type they wear. Punchline can easily be mistaken as an anime from Gainax or Trigger because of the art style, it\u2019s not surprising because the staff really are from Gainax. It\u2019s the second time for Uemura Yutaka as a director. I like how Punchline is visually pleasing with its use of color pallete and expressive faces, but I\u2019ll complain about the weak direction of two setup episodes because it felt like watching filler even if they weren\u2019t. The colorful 3d CG interior of the Korai House designed by Mai Yoneyama is gorgeous, each room subtly shows a lot about the character who lives in it without outright telling us. Shota Iwasaki (Gurren Lagann, Kill la Kill) is one skilled character designer. Every character is iconic and varied in appearance, no sameface, different sizes, skin types, cute outfits, and no boring school uniforms. My favorite is Yuta\u2019s androgynous design, who knew?\\n\\n\r\n[Sound]\\n\r\n- \u201cThe song earlier was a sign that there\u2019s an emergency!\u201d\\n\\n\r\nThe sound effects are cool and full of impact, like the sound when a character activates Uber and the punchy sounds that give every hit in fights more intense. The OP composed by Hyadain (Nichijou, Baka to Test) is catchy, that pumps you up when the show starts, and the ED is very cute. The voice cast are all talents (except the Engrish parts, the thick Japanese accent was too obvious), every single character\u2019s voice stands out, and sounded like they had fun with their roles with all the swapping shenanigans. Marina Inoue\u2019s performance as Yuta is brilliant. Tetsuya Komuro did a good job with the OST, tracks I particularly like are [Strange Juice Action] when the heroine kicks ass, [Destruction] pulls my heart strings, and [Pressure] when shit starts to go down.\\n\\n\r\n[Character]\\n\r\n- \u201cI can\u2019t believe Narugino is Strange Juice.\u201d\\n\\n\r\nPunchline has an interesting cast of characters. Will only introduce the tenants here and avoid spoiler characters.\\n\\n\r\nYuta, a boy that has a panty fetish. He\u2019s one of the most unusual protagonists I ever met (you know what I mean). A big fan of Seas May. His life is turned upside-down after someone stole his body. Yuta cares deeply for people close to him, has an altruistic outlook, but tends to make rash actions. He starts of clueless, and a passive observer (he\u2019s a spirit!) as he tries to figure out what\u2019s happened to him. He gets more active later on when he gets used to his powers after the midpoint shift of the series, and eventually leads to form a secret organization called \u201cJustice Punch,\u201d that strives to save the world from destruction.\\n\\n\r\nThe ally of justice, Mikatan. She is a country bumpkin from Tsugaru but hides it so she can be member of the idol group Seas May. Despite her a dark past, she\u2019s the most cheerful and just wants everyone to get along, though a bit of a ditz. Mikatan may be sweet and nice, but she\u2019s not soft. Harm the weak or her friends and you\u2019ll get a beatdown. Mikatan is actually the famous superhero called \u201cStrange Juice\u201d but keeps that a secret. Has a crush on Yuta. Does not like turtles.\\n\\n\r\nMeika, a genius at anything mechanical, but bad at athletic things like handstands. The landlady of the Korai House, which she inherited from her grandpa. She\u2019s protective of the apartment and doesn\u2019t allow anyone who damages the property. Meika likes to troll the tenants for giggles. She possesses vast intelligence on certain topics. She names her fancy inventions with -maker at the end. Meika is actually Strange Juice\u2019s assistant, called \u201cPumpkin Chair\u201d.\\n\\n\r\nA hikkikomori and otaku, Ito. Ito is actually the legendary mech-FPS-gamer called \u201cTorahachiro.\u201d She\u2019s enrolled in an elite private all-girls school but became a NEET because of a traumatic event. Ito\u2019s dad is an education board member and disowned her once once she stopped going to school. She\u2019s blunt, and can get aggressive. Ito prefers to spend most of her time playing online games. She loves to keep animals.\\n\\n\r\nRabura, a single 29 year old woman who\u2019s desperate to find a lover. She\u2019s from a family of skilled exorcists and works as a spirit medium, but ironically thinks she\u2019s no good at it, and doesn\u2019t believe in the supernatural herself. Owns a pet turtle. She ships Mikatan and Yuta. She\u2019s also Ito\u2019s big cousin and is not happy of her not going to school. Rabura gets pissed whenever Meika comments about her search for men.\\n\\n\r\nThe pet sidekick, Chiranosuke. It enjoys cracking jokes, drinking alcohol and not being helpful to Yuta. The talking cat\u2019s origins remain a mystery.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are a dynamic bunch. However, 12 episodes just weren\u2019t enough to give them equal development.\\n\\n\r\n[Overall]\\n\r\n- \u201cTo a supremely happy and peaceful future.\u201d\\n\\n\r\nThe humor of show is more subjective than usual due to several puns that are lost in translation. Personally, the juvenile silliness leaves me a smile often. The panty nonsense doesn\u2019t bother me because it\u2019s presented in an exaggerated tongue-in-cheek way, like it\u2019s not intended to titillate, and it\u2019s mostly plot relevant too. The anime knows when it needs to be quirky and funny, it also knows when it needs to be dead serious. The show is also rewatchable, there\u2019s a lot of detail that might not be noticed the first time, or a second or third time.\\n\\n\r\nIf you need to avoid panties like our hero Yuta for some reason or allergic to constant mood whiplashes, then stay away at all costs. If you don\u2019t mind a fun screwy sci-fi mystery, then this anime is surely not to miss. I recommend a marathon watch. Maybe you can figure out the punchline. \\n\\n",

            "content": "Rarely do we see ecchi cater to something more than just simple, exploited fan service. Too often, an anime series that is considered ecchi would have no qualms whatsoever to deliver a decent, substantial story. However, Punch Line\u2019s case, if the series is ever considered ecchi, is different. The series presents that substantial story we were all looking for plus many more things that we all would love in an anime series.\r\nThe story is a roller coaster ride I might say, one that would keep you in grips. Between conspiracies, superheroes, strange occult stuff you never knew existed, and that seemingly inevitable asteroid, you willnever know where it will go. It amazes me how Punch Line weaves its elements together to for one intricate, exciting, and well-developed story. It reveals but not too much at one time, giving the show a generous amount of suspense and cleverness. The narrative is well pace and all too good with the plot twists and the oh-damn-I-didn\u2019t-see-that-coming moments.\\n\\n\r\nPunch Line also pokes innocent fun at different anime tropes and clich\u00e9s \u2013 unlikely superheroes, genius inventors, giant robots, idols singing about just anything under the sun (stacking buns higher than the Burj Khalifa), and, of course, panty shots. It is not malicious or anything.  It should be pointed out that this element was incorporated into the story smoothly.\\n\\n\r\nThe visuals may not be unlike anything I have ever seen before, but MAPPA outdid themselves here. It is nice to watch that the studio did not spare any effort putting it all together. Just like the story, the designs are quirky, spunky, and creative and there is not a lagging moment in the animation (heck, even the panty shots are nicely drawn). It is indeed well thought of and excellently crafted.\\n\\n\r\nI was surprised to find out that there were going to be at least three occult-related anime series released this season. For some reason, I picked up Punch Line, maybe because it had the most ridiculous synopsis. Well, what could go wrong? \\n\\n\r\nAbsolutely nothing. Everything about Punch Line is beyond expectation. It is not sad fan service (the type we consider detrimental to the industry). It embodies what anime studios should at least consider in creating a series \u2013 pure, innocent, and well-meaning fun. If you\u2019re thrown by the ecchi (which is almost non-existent in the series by the way) or maybe even the synopsis, I will say about Punch Line what I have always said about Kill la Kill: Don\u2019t drop it, give it some time, and pay attention. If you\u2019re planning to overlook the series, then you\u2019re going to miss out on a lot.\\n\\n\r\nLoaded with laughs, twists, and a whole lot of nosebleed-inducing panty shots, Punch Line shines as one of the season\u2019s most outstanding anime series. Added to that, it is a quirky, fun-filled must-watch. I would recommend this to anyone with enough sense not to judge a book by its cover.\\n",

            "content": "Spoiler free, most of the fun is being confused and figuring it out, only to be wrong and get slapped in the face with something strange, so I won;t get into to much detail. \r\nPunch Line\r\nPunch Line starts out as an ecchi comedy with no sense of direction. Just some lame jokes, awkward situations, and pantsu viewing with absurd consequences with no explanation behind it in an attempt to catch you off guard. But you've already been introduced with good foreshadowing into what slowly becomes a convoluted and intriguing mystery, and quite possibly the wildest, \"wtf\" show I have watched (or at least sat through).Digging deep into the ground of human scientific experiments, mecha, government cover ups, spiritual beings, genetic mutation, militant attacks, time travel, and the space time continuum, it's actually pretty decent to a point. Although they continue to dig deeper and deeper til they look up and say, \"oh shit, how are we gonna get out of this fucking hole?\" Well, in short, they don't.\\n\\n\r\nStory: *sigh* The show starts off a heroine chasing a hijacked bus on her motorcycle. She beats up a few then gets held at gun point. Then PLOT TWIST our MC Yuuta, sees some pantsu, goes SSJ, and tackles the dude with the gun. They fall out of the bus off a bridge into the river. Yuuta then wakes up at his apartment complex as a spirit. then PLOT TWIST. A porn loving ghost cat (don't ask), explains that he is experiencing an out of body phenomenon while someone else is possessing his body. He then sets out to find a strange book that the porn cat says he can use to regain his body. That's like the first episode, I'm gonna get into all the insane twists and turns cause it's pointless unless I share every detail. But it turns into something far more grand and completely ridiculous than that. For example, when he sees pantsu, he goes SSJ, he sees pantsu again, PLOT TWIST! his excitement increases, thus triggering a meteor to fall from the sky and end humanity. This happens a couple times. Why? ........ in short, after a sudden PLOT TWIST he joins up with the super hero team Justice Punch who ironically lives with him to save the world from complete annihilation.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Our characters get some decent back story but they're all spoilers. They have an mysterious past that is slowly revealed in small detail and are bond by fate/destiny/coincidence/divine intervention then PLOT TWIST!. Yuuta is our main MC and ghost, he sees pantsu, he goes SSJ, he cares about his friends. Mika-tan is the best character, is very positive and happy, as well as caring for her friends. However, she tends to keep her problems to herself and hide them. PLOT TWIST she's obvious from the start that she is the heroine from the opening scene, alter ego, Strange Juice, and a member of the idol group She's May. Meika is a genius inventor/hacker, a smart, intelligent and cheerful girl. She is easily upset by simple things, and has been shown to be pushy when it comes to meeting new friends.She runs Korai House, also a member of Justice Punch, known as Pumpkin Chair, she's also a PLOT TWIST. Ito appears to be more of a shut-in than a social butterfly. She avoids the others to play video games and surf the web, she can be a bit blunt and rude at times. Rabura is a fishy spiritual medium, everyone thinks shes a fake/con. Cause she can't really do shit. She's pretty annoying too. Our heroes.......\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: I guess it's pretty decent. Although some of the action left a bit to be desired. The art was very pleasing in design and color. They especially put detail into pantsu, so if that's your thing. GG.\\n\\n\r\nSound: I guess it did it's job. The OP ED are catchy, and brought good atmosphere to the serious parts, yes it gets serious here and there. Some of the insert songs like She's May \"I wanna see your Buns\" during the mock Doki Doki Girls Everywhere Swimsuit event were absolutely historical!!!!! That shit had me in stitches!\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: It was enjoyable for sure, it had it's ups and down at first, but when the back-story and bits and pieces of the mystery unraveled it really gets your attention and becomes compelling with that PLOT TWIST, then again with that PLOT TWIST. Then there's these random moments where you can't decide what you're laughing about. Was it actually funny? Or is it so bad and random that you can't help but laugh? The point it falls off unfortunately is the very last episode when PLOT TWIST. It's almost like, \"hmmm, I'm not sure how we can really pull this off, so .... eh, this will work.\" It was very unsatisfying to me. And they did such a good job of setting up during the last few eps with that PLOT TWIST just leave me wanting better than that. And anything involving time travel will have it's holes, such as the unsolvable chicken and egg paradox, but I feel like the gap they left is understandable, but also just leaves to much possibility to feel satisfied.\\n\\n\r\nThis show wasn't the best by any means, but it's so unusual, fun, wild, and filled with PLOT TWISTS I think it's worth everybody checking out. Just keep in mind it's rather misleading for the first three eps. I was about to drop it, but something about it made me keep watching and I'm glad I did. 6/10",

            "content": "I had to write a review for Punch Line because the current score (7.11 as of 6/25/15) is far underrating this surprise favorite. \r\nPunch Line is a show that many people dropped within the first few episodes and honestly, I don't blame them. It harbors an absolutely ridiculous premise and while the first episode is action-packed, the next four episodes focused more on (admittedly) lackluster comedy. However, those that stuck around to episode five got on a train ride with no stops. \r\nThe art and sound production were one of the main draws to the show for me and for many others that initially pickedup the show. It has unique character designs, bursting with personality. The soundtrack isn't extremely memorable, but it always did a good job at setting the mood and drawing me into the story. The voice actors all portrayed their characters amazingly well.\\n\\n\r\nBut more importantly, let's get to the story. Punch Line's premise, again, is ridiculous. What's amazing about Punch Line is that it manages to make its premise MAKE SENSE. From episode 5 onwards, almost every weird and ridiculous thing in the show is explained in a way that makes logical sense within the confines of this universe. There are a few plot threads left open at the end of the series, some of which I really wanted a conclusion to, but for the most part, everything that we see in episode one comes together by the final episode.\\n\\n\r\nThat is the single biggest reason to watch Punch Line, in my opinion. Watch the first episode and observe the wacky premise and wonder to yourself, \"How the hell does this make any sense?\" Then watch the rest of the show and be impressed at how it comes together. Punch Line, although its first half is rather weak, comes together in the second half to become an absolute must-watch for any anime fan.",

            "content": "Have you ever been at a modern art exhibit and felt like the artist just threw paint at the canvas? Many around you proclaim that it's \"original,\" \" bold,\" or \"expressive,\" while they point at the rectangle of incomprehensible shapes and sloppy paint. While they might see something praiseworthy, from where you're standing, it looks like a kindergarten arts and crafts project, where the kids ate a little too much Elmer's paste.\r\nPunch Line gives me that feeling, but instead of paint being thrown randomly at a canvas, we have themes and concepts instead. It felt like the creators just threw a bunch of ideas intoa hat after one too many drinks and began selecting random slips of paper from it to form the finished product. A string of loose thoughts, unsupported themes and underutilized concepts that somehow made it past the rough draft stage of some drunken editor's desk, where it was prematurely approved to become a final script. It's a tumultuous mess that tried to contain as many elements as possible and ended up imploding as a result. \\n\\n\r\nOrganized chaos isn't impossible to obtain, there has been countless of shows that have proven itself in accomplishing that. As long as the 'chaos' is guided by some kind of subtext or uniformity in each aspect's inclusion, it should turn out fine. However, if there's little in the way of connective tissue to hold the madness together, it doesn't take long before onlookers notice the shortcomings. With elements that do little to nothing to mesh together, it's hard to feel like there's any semblance of being behind Punch Line's existence. It's a project that confuses quirkiness with creative merit. There's no coherency between any of the show's plethora of flavoring, just a bunch of \"whys\" that are never properly explained. Why cinnamon? Why a bear for a pet? Why super saiyan? Why ghost cats? Why super sentai? Why panties? Why do panty-shots cause the world to explode outside of an obvious innuendo? Why body swaps? Why paradoxical time-travel? Why witchcraft? Why moe robot girl? Why anything? All these needless aspects that the show continuously tosses in felt like it was only there to distract from what little plot it was working with. A dribble of ideas thrown together, hoping a few would stick. And for the occasional instances where the show attempted to answer some of it, thematically it was as conclusive as the writers saying \"just because.\" Punch Line brings up more questions than it answers, a trend that finds itself bleeding over into the main story-line.\\n\\n\r\nFor the most part, the show tries to tell a straightforward story about our protagonist, Yuuta Iridatsu, who has to travel through time to stop the impending destruction of Earth by ways of a meteorite strike. While it seems simple enough, it's the inclusion of the aforementioned elements that makes a fairly ordinary tale into a muddled mess. With plot twists and reveals that do absolutely nothing for the show's overall story or the characters involved, these tacked on tidbits ended up being questionable content instead of tasteful flavoring. Flavoring isn't bad by itself, but it needs to be used in moderation, or at least add something to the overall dish. A little dressing on a salad will enhance the taste, but adding too much would just make it into a repulsive swampy soup. Punch Line became that swampy soup, by effectively drowning out its content with too many unwarranted aspects.\\n\\n\r\nMany of the plot points introduced during the show's run-time ended up not mattering in the long run since it was all negated by the \"save the world\" storyline that was introduced later on. The pointless elements discussed did nothing but further the issue, by taking time away from the narrative to travel down several detours that had no conclusion. It felt like a bait-and-switch from an over-the-top comedy/parody of super sentai, to an angst filled character drama along the lines of The Butterfly Effect. This was made even more jarring from the show's constant tonal shifts. Serious moments were often followed up by comedic gags, that not only downplayed the situation but also negated any tension that was supposed to arise from it. It destroyed any substantial weight behind incidents before it had time to sink in. There are times where serious moments that endangered the characters' lives were built up, only to be resolved by a flash of a girl's panties. It's not funny and it certainly isn't dramatic. The show's constant tonal shifts just kept on butting heads with each other. It made any conflict the show was trying to sell to feel pointless since it was easily washed away by the next scenario. When there's no consequence for life-threatening events, it's hard to get invested in a show's outcome.\\n\\n\r\nBut perhaps the biggest misstep of Punch Line was its use of time-travel. Time-travel is something that needs proper measure taken in order to stay relevantly coherent but the time-travel in Punch Line was beyond contrived and paradoxical. Every half-assed attempt to make sense of it only backfired. Since the theory of time-travel is riddled with paradoxes, to begin with, it's hard to put all the blame on the show. There are always loopholes whenever it is used in stories but there are some things that any iteration of time-travel tends to follow. Cardinal rules if you will. May that be the \"butterfly effect\" commonly found with linear travel or the \"grandfather\" paradox that's commonly shared with most iterations. Punch Line doesn't follow any of them, which causes it to make little sense when viewed as a whole. The closest thing to the type of time-travel Punch Line used would be parallel world jumping similar to what's used in TV shows like Sliders. But here's the problem, the protagonist already exist in this universe and even interacts with the other version of 'himself'. This should cause a rift in time or an anomaly to form but that never happens... and why you may ask? Well \"just because\", since it's something the writers seem to have no explanation for as usual. This lack of common sense was perfectly summed up with what I can only describe as the writer's not so subtle explanation via expository dialogue during the show's final moments. Our protagonist tries to explain and tie up the Gundam size plot holes by addressing the audience through the conversation 'he' had with the rest of the side characters. This laughable attempt to bring everything full-circle only shined a light on how improperly put together it was. All the explanation did was bring up more questions that would never get resolved. \\n\\n\r\nIf the show had anything going for it, it'll be the art and animation. It was vibrant and energetic. Similar to 2015 Winter season's Rolling Girls, it looked like a child's imagination brought to life. If you weren't watching this with any set standards it would be passable as visual entertainment. Being brought together by the relatively new studio MAPPA, Punch Line is yet another example of their visual prowess. The character designs were all very pleasant and felt well incorporated with the show's art choices. While they weren't all unique, it did have a trademark look about it that help to differentiate itself from other titles.\\n\r\nWhile it was well presented, for the most part, there were still times where the animation was stilted and stiff. This was more evident towards the middle portion of the show and the earlier slice-of-life episodes. The inconsistency from episode to episode can't be overlooked and hindered it from being better. But thankfully it made up for it by the 3/4 mark where the episodes maintained proper form and MAPPA strutted their stuff.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack for Punch Line is your typical J-pop/rock musical selection, with the added bonus of a few keyboard synthesizers and electronic instruments tossed in for good measure. This gave the music a vibe similar to the Euro House music scene, which worked in unison with the visual flare presented throughout the show. While nice for what it was, most of it wasn't used to its fullest potential and could have been incorporated better. Some standout tracks included \"Concentration\", \"Crisis\" and \"MUHI.\" It's nothing new and undoubtedly the kind of OST you would have heard many times over, but still did the job nonetheless. The opening theme \"PUNCH LINE!\" by Shokotan \u2665 Denpa Gumi was a very catchy idol-heavy musical number. Like the OST, it worked well with the show's visual presentation. Again, nothing new but still a nice toe-tapping ear-worm. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, the presentation of Punch Line was good and helped to make the nonsensical script more bearable than it would have been without it.\\n\\n\r\nNow, what little appraisal I could offer Punch Line presentation-wise, the same can't be done when addressing the character lineup. With no memorable characteristics or features to speak of, each character was given a basic archetypal role and simple personality quirk to substitute for actual personality. They're no better than the cast of children shows like The Care Bears or Teletubbies, where it seems like their color palette and character design directly corresponded to their simplistic portrayal. They're more like caricatures than actual people.\\n\r\nYuuta Iridatsu being our protagonist was the only one that was somewhat easy to relate to. Notice I said \"somewhat,\" as there was not much done to flesh out 'his' character. 'He' would most likely be remembered for a plot twist that I dear not spoil here than for 'him' as a person. \\n\r\nAlso, the ghost cat was probably the show's way of flipping the bird to the audience. For the entire run-time, he was presented as a guide for our protagonist that seemed to have an ulterior motive. There was no direct focus on the cat's actions but it always felt like it was meddling in the shadows. But it just turned out that the cat was just an expository mouthpiece for giving the audience painfully obvious info dumps, as well as serving as a plot-device for whenever the show(writers) needed to move the story along.\\n\r\nThe antagonists for the series was also a let down since, like the rest of the cast, they had no proper characterization or personality to speak of. They were simply bad because the show demanded it and again was another pointless plot twist that didn't matter in the end. \\n\\n\r\nAlso, expect A LOT of troll character \"death flag\" scenes. \\n\\n\r\nAs a whole, the cast was a disappointment and forgettable almost immediately after completion. And while the show had some memorable moments, as a whole, it was a title that left me with more of a headache than anything satisfying. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 5/10\\n\\n\r\nWith an inviting 1st episode, I thought I was getting ready to watch a fun super sentai journey with batshit insane presentation and over-the-top altercations but what I got instead was a show that quickly lost steam,  a comedic gag that lost its novelty and a plot that went up its own ass. Visually, it was fine but the tonal shifts and misuse of concepts brought my enjoyment down.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 4/10\\n\\n\r\nThe presentation ultimately saved this anime from being completely unwatchable. Where it could have worked as a satirical outlook on fanservice and super sentai flicks, it ended up going a more serious route, while not having the appropriate tone or pedigree of writing needed to back it up. It was an ambitious undertaking that fell short of the mark and squandered its chances of being better by trying to do too much at once. An idea was there but unfortunately, it was poorly realized.",

            "content": "**SPOILER FREE REVIEW**\r\nPunchline is a fascinating and ambitious, but ultimately failed experiment by Studio MAPPA to tell unique, non-chronological, wacky, plot-twist filled story much in the same vain as Haruhi Suzumiya. What went wrong? To make a long story short: incompetent writing. This anime introduces a plethora of confusing and poorly explained plot devices that turn out to be completely pointless, totally nonsensical, and/or dead ends, making the show a ridiculous comedy at best and an incomprehensible mess at worse. But let\u2019s talk about that:\r\nSynopsis: Whenever out protagonist, Yuuta Iradatsu, sees a girl\u2019s underwear, the world explodes. How? I don\u2019t know. Why? Not important apparently.Does this ever become a necessary plot point? No. Just roll with it. Anyway, Yuuta\u2019s soul has become separated from his body, and his goal is to save the world, his friends, and himself by observing a particular series of events over and over again in spirit-form, with each iteration ending in a time reset.\\n\\n\r\nExplaining exactly why a show doesn\u2019t make any sense is not an easy thing to do to somebody who hasn\u2019t seen it, especially without spoilers, but I\u2019ll do my best. If I had to sum up the reason Punchline\u2019s plot is absolutely awful in a single sentence, it would be this: Everything is pulled out of their ass. There is NO logical consistency or flow to the events of the show. Things that have no good explanations behind them just appear out of nowhere at random intervals as if the viewer is supposed to understand what is going on when nothing is being explained. I guess they were hoping that people would overlook the lack of explanation in favor of the fun factor, but that did not end up being the case because it\u2019s TOO vague and TOO \u201cout-there\u201d. Most anime fans are willing to overlook minor or even major discrepancies if the rest of the show makes sense, but very few were willing to tolerate the sheer amount of incompetence that Punchline vomited onto our screens. If ever there was an example of throwing shit to the wall to see what sticks, this anime is now the quintessential case. To reiterate once more, since I can\u2019t stress it enough, this show makes NO sense, and the very limited amount of mindless fun that it occasionally provides is not nearly enough to compensate for that.\\n\\n\r\nPerhaps the main reason Puchline fails to connect with the audience is because its characters are so flat and one-dimensional. Any semblance of a backstory or motivations that a character receives are always the barest of barebones, not to mention that they don\u2019t even make sense more often than not (have you spotted a pattern?). In fact, every time this show attempts to answer a question about one of its characters, it just raises three more. The show really banks on the fact that the viewers get attached to these basic archetypes and feel the chemistry/friendship that they have with each other, but they simply never give us a reason to. I didn\u2019t care about these characters because I had no idea who any of them were, and that includes the protagonist, who is on screen over 90% of the time. That\u2019s a major, MAJOR issue. Oh, and the pointless plot devices that have no reason to exist that I mentioned earlier? The characters have a ton of those. All I can guess is that they are an attempt to make the show seem more \u201ccrazy\u201d and \u201cfun\u201d, when really they just serve to make it even more incomprehensible. I don\u2019t remember any of their names; that\u2019s how truly unmemorable and uninteresting they are. Oh, and I\u2019m still pretty confused about who the villain was supposed to be and what his motivations were. This show is just one big giant clusterfuck of disorientation.\\n\\n\r\nBeing animated by Studio MAPPA, Punchline is not totally without its strong points. The art, art direction, cinematography, and animation in general are easily the highlights of the show. Actions scenes are made more fun with unique and experimental angles as well as over-the top choreography that can be pretty entertaining at times. MAPPA continues distinguish themselves with their stellar visuals. As for the use of sound, it\u2019s pretty standard. The OP and ED themes are catchy, but I\u2019ll forget them in a month. The OST is also pretty run of the mill and sound design was pretty hit or miss for me. To sum it up, Punchline has above average animation and average sound.\\n\\n\r\nIf you\u2019re looking for an over-the-top, mindless-fun sort of show, Punchline tries too hard to have a plot. If you are looking for a complex, Suzumiya-eque, intertwining story, Punchline is too confusing and nonsensical. As a result, this anime gets caught somewhere in the middle to these two target audiences, satisfies neither of them, and fails to establish any positive identity of its own. All things considered though, I must applaud the attempt at creating an original, multifaceted show. I truly hate the fact that I have to bash this anime because I really wanted to like it, but writing was simply too awful to tolerate. I do not recommend Punchline to anyone.",

            "content": "I have lusted after a good ecchi for years. My friends at MAPPA and Uchikoshi, the author of the Zero Escape video games series collaborated together to bring us just that. Like it's spiritual predecessor Kill la Kill, which virtually allowed the market for shows like this to be created once again, it is ecchi parody. The whole concept of the show is ecchi, the gag of reflexively destroying the world when chancing on panties immediately feels too obtuse. Why the hell would anyone ever watch something so blatantly dumb? Probably because if the narrative wasn't daringly original it would have been definitively the worstshow to be made in quite some time. \\n\\n\r\nWith that said, the ecchi portions of the show are absurdly flashy and basically so in-your-face jokes that there is no ecchi at all. Punch Line is not an arousing show. It was not created with the purpose of being arousing. It was a slice-of-life mystery from episode one. It's a riotous comedy that inverts all sorts of terribleness from the known-to-all loved-by-none (or degenerate) genre of ecchi. It has everything; a zany premise, harem situation, super powers, nose bleeds, the promise of sex jokes, robots, time travel, ninjas, mascot characters, archetypal cast, forgettable lead, low-budget setting, and the list goes on. We are given the direct dose of horrible ecchi setting, but Punch Line just wants to shake you up a little bit. What if the ecchi setting was used for something other than... vapid and lustful entertainment?\\n\\n\r\nWe are dealt a handful of hilariously offbeat slice-of-life episodes and then as audience, MAPPA knocks in the head a few times. Were you paying attention? If you haven't seen Punch Line yet, look out - There's no men in the main cast.\\n\\n\r\nThe music arrangement in Punch Line is standard issue for the most part. It's electronic and it's ambient and retains some of the doujin and sugar coated feel that the opening brings. The opening theme is really an anthem though, a real stupid, a real catchy, and really bizarre anthem. An ecchi show is all about the assets. It does everything to get your attention. Yet where ecchi shows usually begin to shy away from sexualizing after a certain point, resigning that the audience either gets it or won't watch, they throw together a sloppily and hastily made opening and ending theme. Punch Line does the opposite. Since the show itself is barely about seeing panties or having perverted moments linger, the opening does that in a 90 seconds full salvo. The ending is the opposite, an innocent and childlike fantasy. This ending theme is often at odds with the shows rather dark themes of imminent destruction and isolation.\\n\\n\r\nAnd that's actually what Punch Line is about. It's about a group of people with actually very little in common, living in the suburbs of Japan, in small rooms all right next door to each other. What do a bullied hikkikimori, annoying land-owner, a drunk floozy, and an ordinary school girl all have in common? Is it possible to live in such proximity to people and have no connection with them? The story of Punch Line is absurd and starts and ends promising, quite literally, the destruction of the world. And we get the destruction of the world. A couple times actually. But what Punch Line is a good flex of narrative muscle, bringing together originally stereotypical characters into a community that gives them just a little more innovation than the rest of the industry can do right now. Ecchi is a whole genre built on absurdism - how far can the label be pushed until the audience doesn't want to watch anymore and how far can the program go before the government axes production clean off the air for indecency. It is a totally unconventional place to actually enjoy a cast of characters, but Punch Line does it. Punch Line ends up being a believable story of unlikely friendships. \\n\\n\r\nThis completely absurd show with no boundaries and just an handful of troupes that the scriptwriter wanted to toy with actually manages to make you care. That is Punch Lines charm.\\n\\n\r\nWhen you get down and dirty with Punch Line you end up with a more riveting and somehow believable conclusion than the finale of Steins;Gate. The finesse it takes to bring such a lurid and stupid premise and breathe life into a genre devoid of any human dignity makes for a grand display, one you can't believe. I have to seriously congratulate Punch Line for managing to show that Kill la Kill wasn't just a one and done thing. It takes a lot of lace to tie together a show this buoyant.",

            "content": "(This has been adapted from my blog/reddit thread. Spoilers ahead!)\r\nCarl Sagan, a famous physicist, once said, \u201cExtinction is the rule. Survival is the exception.\u201d Whether we are conscious of it or not, our lives are filled with numerous instances of us simply trying to survive. Having a healthy diet keeps our body working well whereas wearing a seatbelt in a car provides immeasurable safety. Even something as simple as looking both ways when crossing the street could potentially save our life. We do these things \u2013 increasing our chances to live \u2013 because we do not want to die. Sounds rudimentary, but there is nota whole lot more to it than that; we all want to experience a \u201csupremely happy future.\u201d Punch Line is apocalyptic aversion incarnate, that\u2019s random in nature but not quite memorable.\\n\\n\r\nSTORY\\n\\n\r\nPunch Line starts with a bang, not a punch. After the super hero \u201cStrange Juice\u201d prevents a bus hijacking, young Yuuta Iridatsu has his body taken over by another soul, forcing him to find a special book capable of getting him his body back. But as the tale unfolds, strange events and mysteries come to the forefront.\\n\\n\r\nWhen a dice is tossed or a coin is flipped, the outcome of either scenario is random. Sure, there are specific outcomes attainable \u2013 a number one through six, heads or tails \u2013 but if the experiment is carried out with no bias, then the dice or the coin will provide a completely random \u201canswer\u201d on each use. This is Punch Line\u2019s approach during the first half of the anime. Everything involved is absolutely random with no sense, direction, reason, or otherwise rationality placed behind it. There are talking, perverted, ghost cats, invisibility cloaks in the shape of squids, and power-ups provided through panty peeking; cinnamon makes poltergeists stronger, bears that have been genetically modified to further an organization\u2019s plans, and a giant robot that shoots fireworks; and there is even a weird, therapeutic dance that involves putting on a pigeon-head mask.\\n\\n\r\nThe randomness is silly and initially seems to have zero purpose, and to an extent that is correct. Punch Line intentionally leans on the wacky and ridiculous to keep the narrative shrouded in the mystery it boasts. It doesn\u2019t want the audience to understand what in the world is going on because part of the fun is trying to put the pieces together while dealing with the zaniness, and the randomness aids in that endeavor. Think of it like the dice or the coin \u2013 the randomness encountered is impossible to predict but there is a set amount of \u201canswers\u201d regardless of the probability involved. Besides keeping everything hidden plot-wise, the randomness is at least used for one thing: comedy. Looking at the first half compared to the second half it is clear that the random bits are meant to bring laughter to those watching. This type of comedy is often received well due to the uniqueness it brings and its quick-paced nature, both of which appear here.\\n\\n\r\nIn the second half of the anime, randomness gives way to coherency and the comedy is replaced by dramatic elements. What once was unknown becomes common knowledge through the show\u2019s gradual connection of the dots. That robot that shoots fireworks is used by Ito because of her amazing video game skills; the invisibility cloak shaped like a squid is worn to stealthily defeat some bad guys; and the pigeon-head dance finds use when summoning spirits. All the while the show\u2019s smaller plot mysteries are revealed due to the shift in perspective; instead of Yuuta missing specific days or not being able to see certain scenarios, he takes on a more active role in the festivities. Now, not all of the randomness is used to the anime\u2019s advantage \u2013 Muhi, the regenerating bear, is apparently incredibly important but is hardly utilized and Chiranosuke, the talking ghost cat, is little more than a guide post \u2013 but it manages to cover the majority of its bases.\\n\\n\r\nAlso of importance is the time-travel aspect which rests comfortably among the rest of Punch Line\u2019s randomness. Something paramount in any time-travel tale is making absolutely sure that there are no plot holes to speak of. It\u2019s a lot easier having them in narratives that use time-travel because of the paradoxical and cyclical nature of them. For Punch Line, it\u2019s not a vital part to the anime, but it is there nonetheless. To that end, it successfully avoids any massive errors in its timeline near the end through Yuuta\u2019s final actions, making everything as logical as possible.\\n\\n\r\nBeyond the randomness, mystery, and time-travel, there are a few problems that the narrative as a whole maintains. Thematically speaking, there isn\u2019t much; the idea of fighting for the future and the need for friendship is barely explored and essentially lost among the random moments. The actual plot with \u201cW\u201d and the \u201cQmay Group\u201d is handled poorly since the audience never really sees or learns much about them besides what is said in passing. But worst of all is the timing of the plot twist and the execution of it. Having to wait so long, and thereby needing to sit through so much incoherency, makes the narrative less of an adventure and more of an obstacle before it really gets going.\\n\\n\r\nANIMATION\\n\\n\r\nPunch Line takes place primarily in one area: the boarding house where the cast members reside. As such, there isn\u2019t too much diversity when it comes to the locations visited, but it is present within the house itself. Each character has their room and subsequently their own themes attached to them. Rabura\u2019s is purple and filled with weird objects to match her divination powers. Meika\u2019s is green, mechanical, and futuristic. And Ito\u2019s is dark and blue due to her recluse status, with cluttering rampant. The anime also employs stylistic eye-catches at the break between parts A and B. They often feature the women in nothing but their underwear (panties and bra) but the old-school look to them makes the pictures quite refined.\\n\\n\r\nThe character designs are not amazing but at least provide a good sense of individuality. Like their rooms, the characters often have a specific color attributed to them \u2013 Ito wears blue-striped socks, Mikatan is all pink, etc. \u2013 but they each have their own nice amount of detail on top this. Meika has her glasses and large headphones whereas Rabura has her earrings, sexy dress, and teal-bun hair. Their colorings coincide with their personality: Meika is yellow for happiness, Mikatan is pink for girly, Rabura is purple for beauty, and Ito is blue for sadness, all of which demonstrate the attention their designs received.\\n\\n\r\nActual animation for the show is roughly around average. There\u2019s surprisingly quite a bit of action involved for the majority of the show, but it isn\u2019t too extravagant. Hand-to-hand combat is the norm, with jumping, floating, and clothes ruffling being located here and there. The characters often have overzealous reactions as well that adds variety. But the greatest sequences come near the end, where the finale involves missiles, tanks, robots, brawls, and swords that increase anything the show did previously.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS\\n\\n\r\nPunch Line\u2019s weakest link is by far the characters that traverse it.\\n\\n\r\nOf particular note is the antagonist; Ryuuto \u2013 who is really Guri in Pine\u2019s original body \u2013 acts as the main adversary, but this is not explicitly known until much later. For whatever reason, though, even when he is introduced, the show continues to keep his motivations a secret. She wants her friends to join her on the ark that will escape the meteor\u2019s blast, but why she is so bent on murdering nearly all of humanity is not explained. That is, until right near end in an attempt to make her plight a bit more relatable or at the minimum understandable. It makes sense, that she wishes to enact the \u201csame\u201d pain on the people who did this to her or anyone else in the future, but her development comes too little, too late to be meaningful.\\n\\n\r\nInterestingly, Narugino \u2013 who is really Chiyoko in Guri\u2019s original body \u2013 doesn\u2019t fare much better. Growing up, she was slated as being a \u201chero of justice,\u201d due to her overwhelming powers through Uberfication and training at the hands of Meika. When the anime gets underway, she does not do much outside of attempting to conceal her identity, and even then, when she is revealed to be \u201cStrange Juice,\u201d nothing really comes of it. In essence, her character is there to expound on parts of the past; her, Pine\u2019s, and Chiyoko\u2019s younger days, what she went through following their separation, and what led her to the point she is at now.\\n\\n\r\nShe is not an incredibly deep or complex character which would not be a bad thing, and is even handled nicely, except at the finale. There, she rather selfishly goes against orders and indirectly kills her best friend. The idea was to create a scenario in which Guri \u201catones for her sins,\u201d Pine, who has lived literally 6 billion and more lives, completes his duty, and Chiyoko follows her \u201chero of justice\u201d mantra by sacrificing her person to protect Pine. But her actions were quite unnecessary considering what happened and even contradictory because of the results.\\n\\n\r\nTo make matters worse, Yuuta \u2013 whose soul is actually in Chiyoko\u2019s original body (confused yet?) \u2013 is quite the lame main character. As was briefly talked about earlier, the first half has him taking on a passive role; the second half an active one. But throughout the whole season, it is difficult to determine what he wants or what he wishes to accomplish. Through him, it becomes quite evident how story-driven the anime is; his character is all comedy and information gathering without granting him much in the way of development. The anime attempts to make his drive more personable through a few situations involving all of the residents, but he never comes off as \u201cone of the gang\u201d and subsequently his reason for fighting to save the world \u2013 protecting his friends \u2013 is rather weak. This in turn makes the ending a moot point, since his decision does not have much of a basis nor was there enough focus on his actual character to make him worth caring about.\\n\\n\r\nThe rest of the main cast \u2013 Meika, Rabura, and Ito \u2013 likewise find themselves sitting low on the totem pole. At least with Ito, the anime gives her a transitional phase, where she moves away from shy and lonesome to determined and friendly through the experiences she has at the house. As for the other two, Meika is a robot and Rabura works with ghosts, but that is the extent of who they are. If anything, they all have one commonality: an everlasting bond.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND\\n\\n\r\nThe opening theme is pretty good, with various tempos filling the piece to make it a very fun listen. The various vocalists, combined with the strange instruments and catchy beats, create quite the random arrangement, which is undoubtedly fitting given the anime\u2019s content. The ending theme also manages to be well-composed, with the first half having some nice guitar playing while the second half has an easy-to-follow beat.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the rest of the soundtrack, it\u2019s mostly filled with electronic instruments (such as in \u201cPressure\u201d and \u201cAgility\u201d), tracks consisting of otherworldly sounds (such as in \u201cState of Tension\u201d and \u201cInvisible Fear\u201d) that, like the OP, find themselves fitting snuggly within the confines of the show\u2019s randomness and dooms day setting. Others, like \u201cVictim,\u201d are signature to the anime \u2013 it\u2019s the song that plays when Yuuta is viewing some panties. Others still, like \u201cDeep in the Past,\u201d are very melancholic, rounding out the depressing moments poignantly. While some of the tracks blend together, it is still an interesting OST that does its job.\\n\\n\r\nVoice acting for Punch Line is somewhere above average. Special shout-outs are deserved for Sora Amamiya as Mikatan for her girly voice and Marina Inoue as Yuuta for giving a more androgynous voice to match the character\u2019s predicament.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT\\n\\n\r\nI can\u2019t say that I liked this one. Part of me wished that the show focused solely on the \u201cecchi\u201d elements, since the panty viewing was not as critical to the plot as it was originally made out to be. This became quite evident when the second half had nothing to do with the first half\u2019s problem of Yuuta seeing said panties; no longer was it about avoiding them entirely but instead only seeing them now and again when the plot demanded.\\n\\n\r\nAt the same time, super random comedy like this one had is not up my alley. I do not mind a bit of randomness, but events like the pigeon-head dance and especially Chiranosuke the talking ghost cat were not funny to me in the slightest. Along these same lines, I was not too fond of the characters themselves. Mikatan could be cute, but Yuuta was not comical, Ito and Meika were somewhat annoying, and Rabura did not have nearly enough screen-time to make her relevant.\\n\\n\r\nPunch Line is completely random and, oddly enough, simultaneously not. The art and animation is good, as are certain musical pieces. But the story\u2019s minor flaws, the poorly executed characters, and the stale comedy prevent the anime from being something more. While the cast members might have achieved a \u201csupremely happy future,\u201d the whole package certainly did not.\\n\\n\r\nSUMMARY\\n\\n\r\nStory: Fine, the randomness is used effectively, the time-travel aspect makes sense, but issues such as little thematic presence, a lackluster plot, and poor timing on the twist weaken the experience\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: Good, nice art style, nice character designs, about average actual animation\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Bad, Ryuuto (Guri), Mikatan (Chiyoko), and Yuuta (Pine) are all rather weak, with Rabura, Meika, and Ito barely being passable\\n\\n\r\nSound: Good, good OP, okay ED, interesting soundtrack, above average VA work\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Bad, the \u201cecchi\u201d moments are boring, the random comedy is a huge miss, and the characters are largely forgettable\\n\\n\r\nFinal Score: 5/10",

Still the story was quite interesting. This was an anime I watched when I was free but in middle of the anime it turned to opposite.I made time for it so that I can watch it. The anime started of fun (like most anime do) and ended with an unexpected small feel trip [I literally cried cause the character I was attached to died (Ain't revealing name cause \"Spoilers\" for other people who haven't watched it yet)] along with some big bang and happy ending.  I forgot to mention that this anime is a complete original anime. In other words the anime isn't adapted from manga or any other source but was created.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8/10 Near the end of the anime the songs started to really make it awesome with some nice tracks in the last episode. I sure wish they had the tracks in the early episodes but as the story started slow the tracks wouldn't have made sense and it would have lost it's purpose. Still was good hearing it. The OP was really good too.  Also oh the sound of those explosions was just so awesome. (Loving tanks do what is best since I was born) \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 7/10 Hmm... Nearly all the characters were uninteresting except Iridatsu Yuuta, Narugino Mikatan, And Teraoka Ryuuto. Also Chiranosuke the ghost cat was also a nice Side Character.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: 8/10 Animation Huh? Well it is ok. I don't remember a part where it was rushed in animation. It was pretty detailed though so points I give is perfect for it\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8/10 Enjoyment in the starting episode was pretty good and hilarious and when the story started getting serious so the enjoyment went down and up and down trying it's way to entertain the viewers.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: It never did concentrate ecchi on the future episodes as for it the story was becoming more important\\n\\n\r\nOverall Rating: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nPersonal note: I recommend that you buy the blu-ray version when it comes out as the anime is pretty good according to me.\\n\\n\r\nPersonal note 2: The ecchi is at minimum except the first episode so you can enjoy the anime without seeing too much ecchi scenes.\\n\\n\r\nPersonal note 3: It's a little hidden gem of this season. Even if the starting is pretty slow the episodes near ending are normal paced and really good. So don't drop this show and watch it till the last episode.",

I certainly do not regret it. This anime was one of the most \"didn't-see-it-coming\" I've ever watched. It's a good fun even though the main theme might sound weird at first. Panties? Saving the world? Huh???\r\nI don't want to get too much into storyline, but this anime will most certainly surprise you.After a few slower episodes of really mediocre gags it grasps you and doesn't let go. I would suggest watching it in one shot to catch all the little things that are in it. It really gets much better with time.\\n\\n\r\nIt is not a very sophisticated title, it doesn't really take on character development or moral issues, it rather focuses on ways to resolve the current problem using all available means, which sometimes gets slightly crazy. But the idea is good, execution is decent, plot twists are awesome!, the characters likable and not really obvious, and I wasn't really feeling like it's a bunch of weird ideas put into one, it rather mended together pretty well and gave me much enjoyment :)\\n\\n\r\nArt is really nice, cute, but darker at times, gets better with every episode. I was not really convinced with using 3D at the beginning episodes, but later on it blends in well.\\n\\n\r\nDefinitely worth watching, especially since it's not really long, so I'd suggest giving it a try.",

            "content": "When you finish something that you don't truly \"understand\", what should your reaction be?  Should you be critical and hateful towards it because it doesn't make sense in the natural realm of one's understanding?  Or should you congratulate it for being stand out and different from amongst the rest of the lot?  If something is considered unique, should we dismiss it for being too odd and too experimental?  Or should we congratulate it for going such a direction?  Aw fuck it, screw the philosophy.  Here's a review of Punch Line.  Ready, set, go.\r\nStory (6.22/10): Our protagonist Yuta iscould in a rather...peculiar situation.  For one thing, he was just in a bus crash.  For another thing, he's a ghost who is now away from his physical body.  And third, according to the ghost cat that he finds himself hanging around, if he sees a girl's underwear twice in a row, his excitement level will cause the world to end, thus creating the apocalypse.  Well, uh...that's...that's quite a predicament.\\n\\n\r\nOn the surface, Punch Line seems to be nothing more than a slice of ecchi, as the main grab from the show is apparently this ghost guy now trying to be careful in his dorm filled with girls to not try and see their underwear twice in a row.  But when you really get into it, not everything is as it seems.  The plot for Punch Line is one that I feel is one that is one that requires a lot of attention.  You see, the show itself has very different first and second halves, basically saying that depending on which part of the show you're on, you'll be watching something that differs greatly from what you would be seeing previously.  You see, there really is no consistency in Punch Line itself on account of every episode being something different, both answering and asking new questions at the same time as the plot unfolds for this show.  \\n\\n\r\nPersonally, I feel like the show is actually a Punchline for itself, seeing as how for the first six episodes, it's basically all setup giving a rather...unsavory viewing experience because it raises a lot more questions that answers before everything kinda makes sense in episode 7.  The fact that you have to sit through half the show focusing on something that seems like it doesn't actually pertain to the show's premise at all is something that I feel like makes the show a lot less appealing than it actually may be.  Simply put, the first half of the show makes almost zero sense.  The second half ties everything together so that whatever we're watching we can understand to some degree.  As the viewer, you have to tie everything together yourself, using the information, events, and characters that you're presented in order to create a neat plot line that you can follow as you go on and finish the show.  In theory, this is quite ingenious, but in practice, it was shaky at best.\\n\\n\r\nThe biggest issue I have with Punch Line was with the way it presented itself.  A lot of the points that we get don't actually feel like complete information, a lot of things still actually don't make a whole lot of sense, and the show goes into the realm of confusing so often that at times, even the show's characters get confused.  As a result, having to wait around for the second half might not happen with a lot of people because the show doesn't provide a cohesive plot line where things happen in a straight line.  (There's a lot of wibbly wobbly timey-wimey things in this anime.)\\n\\n\r\nAs far as personal complaints go, I'm not a big fan of the plot period.  There were a lot of things within the actual story that really I felt like needed more explanation, and I'm also not a big fan of having to pay attention to every little thing that happens just in case something important shows up later on, cause that does actually happen in this show.  Overall, I didn't personally find the show's story to be all that pleasurable.  It has a nice touch of having you piece the events yourself like the show itself is a little puzzle, but because it relied so heavily on the viewer, if you didn't know that ahead of time, the show would make little to no sense unless the show connected the dots for you.  Plus, I felt like a few things were thrown in there just because, so that soured my experience a little.\\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+    Decent second half\\n\r\n+/- Interesting storytelling format  (a negative as well because the format isn't for everyone)\\n\r\n-     Somewhat poor/confusing first half\\n\r\n-     A lot of things felt very unexplained and/or just thrown in\\n\r\n-     First half was a bit of a time waster  (sadly, it is necessary to watch\\n\\n\r\nCharacters (6.33/10): To be fair, while the story of Punchline can arguably be a great way of storytelling or a poor way of storytelling depending on who you're asking, the characters themselves really don't stand up all too much.\\n\\n\r\nFirst we have Yuta, our main ghostly protagonist.  Much like I have said before, the first half of the show doesn't really focus on our protagonist all that much, but rather the lives of the four other girls that live in their dorm house in the middle of nowhere.  This brings me to another point of confusion and why people may drop this show early.  Yuta as the main character, doesn't show up all that much.  In fact, he's for the most part an observer till later on in the series which really hampers the show a bit early on because when it comes to first impressions, Punchline doesn't really make any good ones.  His character does get explanation later on in the series, but the first six episodes of what is essentially exposition really doesn't make him shine or seem important.\\n\\n\r\nThen we have the girls of the dorm hourse, Korai house.  Narugino, Meika, Rabura, and Ito.  Each girl represents a different kind of anime troupe (idol, braniac, the lonely one, gamer) and each has their own functionality within our story.  (I grouped them all together to try and avoid spoilers on each one of them)  While they all do play an important part to the story later on, each one of them feels like they were thrown random character traits to make them seem a little bit more wacky/a little bit more interesting to watch early on, which admittedly, feels a bit forced.  \\n\\n\r\nIn terms of side characters, PunchLine has quite a number of them all with varying uses and importance, those uses and importances being basically, plot devices.  Pretty much every character is used to drive that plot and explain a little bit more in the world of PunchLine, and the secrets that it holds.  Overall though, I felt as if the characters really didn't make all that much sense.  The protagonist is essentially non-existent for the majority of the show, and all of the girls just don't really seem that interesting to me personally.  The side characters don't really have much going for them since they're mainly used to explain things, so their use is quite limited.  \\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n-  Almost non-existent protagonist\\n\r\n-  Female heroines felt bland\\n\r\n-  Side characters are mostly just plot devices\\n\\n\r\nArt and Sound (8.00/10 and 6.01/10): The art for Punchline was made by Mappa, a relatively new animation studio that's been up and coming as of late at the time of this review.  Punchline's animation is a style that relies mostly on a neon colored scheme, using a lot of bright colors on its palette.  Honestly, the art for the series is relatively nice looking.  It definitely has a unique feel to it.\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of sound, there's really not much to say.  Aside from the OP being somehow really addicting with its repeating word \"Punchline\" at the beginning, there's not really much to say as all of it is pretty forgettable and not really memorable.\\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+ Good art\\n\r\n-  Forgettable music\\n\\n\r\nPersonal Enjoyment (3.00/10): Admittedly...I don't really like Punchline.  While many people have seen it as a great experimentation of a new kind of story, really....I don't actually see it.  Instead, I see a very broken story with only being fed little bits of information that really don't constitute much of anything because we're given such minute amounts that while it does have an impact, doesn't really impact me as a viewer in a grave way as to how I view the story and all that.\\n\\n\r\nDid I enjoy this anime?\\n\\n\r\nNot...really.  I found it more to be confusing than anything.\\n\\n\r\nWhat didn't I like about this anime?\\n\\n\r\nThe first half really felt completely pointless to me.  Until you get to the latter half, then things start to make actual sense.  But until then, confusion just took ahold of my head because I had absolutely no idea what was going on.  There was all sorts of plot convenience, pigeon heads...  To be honest, I have absolutely no idea what I watched because it didn't really make sense to me.  \\n\\n\r\nWould I recommend this anime?\\n\\n\r\nPersonally, I didn't like it.  But because it has such a varying opinion, I feel like it's worth a shot.  It's very similar to FLCL in the sense that both shows have that sense of randomness and they're both shows that can have varying opinions depending on who's watching them.  There's slight ecchi, but there's not a whole lot to honestly worry about.  \\n\\n\r\nOverall Score: 6.43/10",

            "content": "Punch Line is the type of show where the first reaction you\u2019ll get is something along the lines on \u201cwhat the bloody hell?!\u201d Or something like that. Perhaps some might not get this type of reaction but the first episode literally feels like it drops you in the middle of nowhere. So, a question that pops up would be: how exactly can Punch Line be described as? Long story short. It\u2019s like a certain kind of twisted fun.\r\nAs an anime original show by Noitamina, there\u2019s not much to go on except for the main premise. Uemura Yutaka direct this series as his second anime project.However, it\u2019s not anything like Dantalian no Shoka. Punch Line is a standalone show that has no connection to any franchise. The premise is exactly what it sounds like. We have this young man named Yuuta Iridatsu with his peculiar habit. And to quote \u201cWhen he sees a girl's panties, he gets so excited he faints!\u201d The reality is that it affects him so much to the point where his spirit is separated from his body. However, a show like this also isn\u2019t without its mishaps. A major part of the story involves Yuuta trying to save the world because according to the series\u2019 tagline\u2026\\n\\n\r\n\u201cIf he sees underwear, humanity will be destroyed!?\u201d\\n\\n\r\nIn a nutshell, Punch Line is more of a misadventure. The series chronicles Yuuta\u2019s daily life that involves ghosts, time travel, idols, terrorism, tragedies, heroes, and of course panties. While most series use it more of as an advertising gimmick, Punch Line actually uses it as part of its plot device. When Yuuta sees panties, he literally gets a big nosebleed. Oh and then, there\u2019s the whole big apocalypse that he brings with him in the form of a meteoroid hitting the Earth. While this setup really sounds deadly, it mostly plays it for laughs for the first few episodes. Then somewhere down the road, the show decides to shake things up a bit with some startling revelations. Along the way, there\u2019s also a bit of tragedy. Now, I do give some credit to the series\u2019 ability to actually mix its ideas of death and comedy together. Although the series seems like a parody or gimmick, it actually does take itself seriously, to a point where death really does result in death. However, it\u2019s hard to convince the audience to accept all of this until we learn more of the truth. And that\u2019s something to remember in Punch Line. The series really builds up its story by showing rather than just telling. In fact, it does both while throwing bits of foreshadowing and red herring along the way. In retrospect, patience will be a key if you plan to finish this series as the first few episodes is nothing more like insane.\\n\\n\r\nAt some point of the series, I think people will wonder what the purpose of Punch Line really is. Is it a punch in the face for comedy? Is it a serious misadventure of craziness? Or is just about saving the world? Maybe it\u2019s more about the characters themselves rather than the story. Admiringly, the character cast is small yet colorful with a diverse range of personalities. The main protagonist has a hot-blooded personality although he is generally helpful towards the people he meets. Then we have characters like Mikatan with her energetic personality, Ito with her timid behavior, and Rabura with her curiosity. The show even takes time to fill in background stories for certain characters such as Ito to really give the audience an idea at what they are in for. Punch Line\u2019s character cast is perhaps one of the strongest attributes of the show as it has the courage to show off its characters. It also embraces its panty gimmick and while silly at first actually makes the show more fun to watch as part of the story. Every now and then though, it can seem more like a repetition. It knows its shamelessness and exploits it at times to a degree that may be distracting. I guess it\u2019s really a hit or miss to people with such a premise. The more detailed parts of the show comes in later and by foreshadowing, it also adds a bit of thrill for the audience to interpret or analyze ahead to what may come. Pieces of the story connect and come together as in the end, it knows its intentions. Along the way, you may even find the comedy to be appealing with the small doses of shenanigans going on. \\n\\n\r\nStudio MAPPA is in charge of this series. And although I praise them for some of their latest works such as the fantastic visual features of Shingeki no Bahamut, Punch Line doesn\u2019t live up exactly to its hype. The artwork seems goofy most of the time and although it\u2019s on track, it\u2019s really hard to take the show seriously. Character design is decent for most of what\u2019s worth although still lacks a sharp edge. I think the most prominent aspects of the show are the facial features. Each episode seems to be clear on what it\u2019s doing when it comes to character reactions and expressive tones. On the negative side, the setting and its backgrounds are hardly noticeable with diehard action scenes. The show clearly isn\u2019t drawn to show action as most of it just spells silliness. \\n\\n\r\nSoundtrack brings in a variety of ways to showcase this series. Although the OST works well, I\u2019d say that most of the successes comes from the character voice mannerisms. A small character cast such as Punch Line really needs to connect with the audience so it can keep the viewers at bay. Thanks to our characters\u2019 voice expressions and tones, that was easily achieved. Emotional scenarios, lighthearted moment, or hyperactive scenes are performed all at above standards by the voice actors/actresses. Even the cat Chiranosuke (voiced by Yuri Yoshida) has this amusing voice tone that is convincing. On the other hand, OP and ED theme songs are easily forgettable.\\n\\n\r\nThis isn\u2019t a show like X-Men or some parody such as the \u201cSuperhero Movie\u201d. It does takes itself seriously with the story despite its appalling gimmicks. The character cast is what keeps this show shining and each episode characterizes more and more. For any story to work, we are also given explanations so your initial impression of \u201cWHAT\u201d will likely change into \u201cOh\u201d later on. Some may dismiss this as a mindless fun journey though and this is what I had thought first as well. After all, the technical aspects of the show doesn\u2019t exactly set a golden egg-tier standard. However, it\u2019s still a fun ride from start to finish in the end. And it\u2019s all begins with panties.",

            "content": "Puchline is a very simple concept that is mashed together by so many unconventional aspects. If you see panties, the world ends. Which is exactly what this show seems to be about. Even still, despite it seeming to be a simple ecchi comedy, slice of life series, it doesn't stop it from being hilariously fascinating but why is it fascinating? Well that stems from it's creative writing and some-what unique plot progression. I say unique simple because of the way it's presented, at times we're introduced to certain events that, at first, seems completely random or just forced but turn out to make somewhat senseonce they explain it as or after the event occurs. This may seem like it's a bad thing but on the contrary it's actually reasonable for a series such as this, one thing to note is the pacing of this show. The pacing is somewhat high, whilst this is usually a bad thing in Punchline's case it isn't. I feel like a show like Punchline can only work at high pace or else it may just not click like it originally did with me but that's a completely subjective matter. \\n\\n\r\nNow as for the other reason as to why it's fascinating, the writing in this show may seem dumb at times but that's just the tip of the iceberg, let me explain. At first we're led to believe (minor spoiler) that the main plot of this show is to get Yuta back into his original body but as we move along the episodes we can see that isn't the only objective, I feel like the writers are deliberately misleading us with cliches to make more of an impact in whatever's to come. Overall the story of Punchline is really fun and fascinating, hell even the fanservice seems necessary for the show to progress but unfortunately that aspect's not for everyone.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters of this series aren't really unique, they're pretty much characters that we've seen in many other series but the characters in this series are what brings it to life. We're introduced to pretty much all the main characters in the first couple of episodes, that allowed us to establish each of the characters traits thus allowing the story to flourish properly. Pretty much all the characters have received some sort of developments whether it be a tragic past that adds depth the character or strong bonds that you didn't think could exist.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the animation, what can I say? I think MAPPA did a great job on animating a series like this, they paid attention to small details like the facial expressions and *cough* panties *cough* along with some great action scenes which judging from there past works was to be expected. I would definitely say that this was one of the better animated shows this year and my god am I glad MAPPA got the opportunity to do something like this. As for the sound, I think the OST fits this show perfectly, for example, scenes that usually wont have much of an impact on you tend to do because of how well the OST's where used. As for the opening and ending of this show, there's not much to really say. They're average but they fit the show so there's really nothing wrong about them.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I know it seems like I'm praising this show too much but that just shows how much it clicked with me. I'm fully aware that the synopsis of this show may put many people of but I highly recommend you stick with it at least until the 4th episode.",

            "content": "Thank you based MAPPA. Thank you Ushikoshi, i've never played your games so i didn't exactly know what to expect from you even with what i've heard. Punchline was waaay better than what i expected and this is pretty much the hidden gem of this season. \r\nThis review is pretty much what i thought exactly after watching the ending so ... sorry if there's a weird sentence or somethign like that.\r\nI can't talk too much about the story but what i can say is this : After an incident happened in a bus, the soul of our MC Yuuta separates from his body but surpriseand now his spirit wanders around his apartment. However he has a mission : Save the Earth from an asteroid hitting the planet and destroy it. Oh, and if he gets too excited while seeing panties the earth is doomed. So yeah ... thats pretty much the only things i can say. Which is pretty much what you can read on the page of the anime. That was pointless. \\n\\n\r\nAnyway, the art is really good, the animation it reminds me of Kill la kill and other stuff done by Trigger and Gainax and its done very well most of time. Anyway, in my case i like that style so .. that's a plus. The action is really good too, thats something you'll really enjoy it !\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is really good and varied. The OST of Punchline is a least less forgetable than a good chunk of anime these days and goes well with what happens in the scene and can get you pumped or sad. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters are good, but thats pretty much it. I have to say that they are pretty much are forgetable beside Meika and the cat, Chiranosuke. Still they have their moments. Again, i'm not gonna talk about it too much because ... yeah. Let's just say that they are pretty stereotypical at the beginning and after a while stuff happens. \\n\\n\r\nSo yeah, you've read that i didn't say a lot and there's a reason. Punchline starts off with a pretty strong first episode but after that, you might get turned off by it. However, don't drop it. Ooooh don't do it because a little bit before the first half this is where the fun really start with a lot of plot-twist and a really good ending. You know like Madoka magica that starts off like a cute magica girl anime and starts being dark after a couple of episodes ? Yeah, it's pretty much the case here. It starts like an Ecchi/Comedy. It just takes more time to really start. It's totally worth it. Don't look at the rating, it's pretty low because a lot of people dropped it and gave it a bad rating before the good part.\\n\\n\r\nOne last thing : The comedy sucked most of the time.\\n\\n\r\nTL;DR : The anime is really good. Some episodes in the first half are crap imo. The rest is reeaaaally good.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, 8/10. \\n\\n",

            "content": "The written Review to my Video Review.\r\nHow serious can you be when your super power activates when you see panties? Well not too serious I would presume, but this anime may take itself too seriously for it\u2019s concept. \r\nStory - 3/10\r\nThe story of Punch Line is kind of a complex one. It may sound simple, but not at all. Punch Line follows the story of Yuuta Iridatsu as he tries to save the world. How does he do that one may ask, well we don\u2019t really figure that out till episode 6. But the premise of the story is that Yuuta has been transformed intoa ghost and there is a big gigantic meteor coming down to destroy the world, and the key to stopping the meteor is apparently spending time in an apartment lot and figuring out how to stop the meteor? However the world can also be destroyed if Yuuta sees panties as well, twice that is in a short amount of time. So he\u2019s got to figure out how to save the world while keeping himself away from panties. The story is rather confusing until episode 6 when it all starts making sense. But the premise of the plot is time traveling, because Yuuta must gather as much information as he can from the present in order to travel back to the past to prevent the meteor from hitting, thus looking for a better future.\\n\\n\r\nThe whole idea about spending time as an onlooker to figuring out how to change time is a confusing concept indeed. It is hard to understand the story, when everything just looks so normal with little plot happening in them. And the story is kind of boring pre episode 6, because you don\u2019t know exactly what is happening and even after episode 6, it kind of repeats itself and you still don\u2019t know the full extent on what is going on. The backstory in Punch Line is vaguely touched upon, sure we see it, but we don\u2019t know how and why it\u2019s happening. And the plot takes itself way too seriously, it gets very dramatic for a show that was supposed to be a comedy, and it doesn\u2019t work well because it\u2019s all very hard to take in. And honestly I don\u2019t think the payoff was that worth it. Even the twist at episode 6 felt very predictable.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters - 3/10\\n\\n\r\nYuuta Iridatsu is the main protagonist, he\u2019s goal is save the world while trying to avoid from looking up panties as well. From what we can see he\u2019s just as confuse as we are, he doesn\u2019t understand why he has superpowers when he looks up girls panties, he doesn\u2019t know why he\u2019s a ghost and he doesn\u2019t understand what is going on. It\u2019s like the writer did that on purpose to symbolise us in him, and I\u2019m not sure that\u2019s a good thing. We came for the ecchi, but we\u2019re confused with the story. There is also rather little character development for him as we just see him having the same attitude throughout the rest of show, where he is a guy living with a bunch of girls trying to avoid them, while being nice and also trying to be the hero, with the will to save everyone as best as he can.\\n\\n\r\nOther characters that make up residents of the apartment lot are, Mikatan Narugino who also has superhero persona and has little development as she pretty portrays the happy girl. Ito Hikiotani, a NEET spends most of her time on the computer, however has more development over the course of the series than the other mains as she starts to get more involved with the people around her. Meika Daihatsu who is a mechanic and the landlord serves as the guardian to pretty much everyone. And lastly there is Rabura Chichibu, who despite her incompetency is shown to be a very reliable spiritual medium as the series progress. \\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately I don\u2019t the main cast was all that good, as I was so caught up in trying to understand the situations to get a clearer picture of the characters. By the end of the series they felt like they were just used to show their individual talents in the last battle, because honestly their interactions with each other was kind of boring. And I would go on to the some of the other supporting characters if one of the characters didn\u2019t really annoy the hell out of me. Seriously SCREW THE CAT.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation and Sound - 6/10. 7/10\\n\\n\r\nThe art style I can\u2019t complain too much, because although it doesn\u2019t look bad, it doesn\u2019t look anything great as well. The shape of the characters feel a lot more rounded than other animes and the colour palette felt very simple, although some of the scenes looked very childish in a good way as it reflects on the characters rather well, and it shows the show is not a serious show to begin with. However the action scenes although that last one is completely fine, everything else before it is nothing special at all. And it does suffer have some frame rate problems, but none to breaking. As a personal opinion, I\u2019m not a huge fan on this kind of anime art style, as it just looks very simplistic and a bit messy for me with the more rounded nature in the designs of the characters. I mean if their supposed to be adults and teenagers, how come they look like pre-teen kids.\\n\\n\r\nI actually kind of enjoy the soundtrack of Punch Line. Although the opening and ending songs are nothing to write home about they\u2019re find perfectly accept. The opening theme maybe a bit catchy, in a bad way. However it\u2019s not too annoying. The OST for the show is a mixture of J-pop and rock. Which I find quite enjoyable to listen to. I especially like it even more when they have their many variety of electro music kicking in. I like how they have almost a different OST for each situation, which gives it a huge variety and it usually does the job in fitting in with the scene. As for the voice acting, it\u2019s fine and acceptable. But seriously SCREW THE CAT. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 3/10\\n\\n\r\nI did not enjoy watching Punch Line because I could not get my head around the story. Not only was it a hard story to follow, it was quite a boring one at the same time. The show does get a tad better after episode 6, but that felt too long before anything interesting starts happening and even then, it felt like it repeated right after. Also the fact the story takes itself way too seriously, when the concept is stupid to begin with. The comedy in the show has very little impact, as some of the jokes weren\u2019t really all that funny and gets kind of repetive. The last fight scene wasn\u2019t bad and the soundtrack was enjoyable, but I don\u2019t t feel that\u2019s enough to make it enjoyable. Especially if the characters are lacking and aren\u2019t as interesting. And seriously SCREW THE CAT.\\n\\n\r\nVerdict - 4.5/10\\n\\n\r\nFor the story I give it a 3, as the story is confusing and uninteresting to begin with. It takes way too long to go anywhere and the payoff wasn\u2019t really worth it. Also the fact that the story takes itself way too seriously for such a stupid concept. The story sort of got better at the half way, but that was still too long.\\n\\n\r\nFor animation and sound I give them a 6 and 7 respectively. Although the animation is good, but not great. Some of the scenes look good and some of them don\u2019t. I\u2019m not a huge fan of the art style, but it shouldn\u2019t affect you all that badly. The soundtrack is actually quite enjoyable and it good to hear there is a variety of different tracks being played throughout the show, and they\u2019re pretty good ones at that.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters get a 3 from me. As I found little interest in them, and felt like they were just there to fill out a certain role. There is little development in them and the interactions just felt awkward between them. There are a few exceptions for some of the characters such as Ito, and other supports. The characters a bearable and not too annoying. However for the last time seriously, SCREW THE CAT.\\n\\n\r\nFor my personal enjoyment I give it a 3. Because it was very hard following this show, plus I\u2019m not a huge fan of the art style. It looked quite simplistic and the story didn\u2019t feel like it fitted well with the art style. Some of the fight scenes and music are enjoyable, but that\u2019s it, I couldn\u2019t delve very deep into the characters as I didn\u2019t find them all too interesting. And the jokes weren\u2019t all that funny to begin with as well.\\n\\n\r\nSo for the final score after rounding it all I up, I give Punch Line a 4.5/10. It feels like a below average anime was being made, which is reflected upon the art style, although it\u2019s perfectly fine if the plot wasn\u2019t so serious and dramatic and should\u2019ve been more silly like the concept. If you want to watch Punch Line go ahead, but if you\u2019re looking for the ecchi there\u2019s not that much and if you\u2019re looking for something weird, there are plenty of better options out there.\\n",

            "content": "Punch Line started relatively slowly, I was watching it when it was airing and only got up to 3 episodes before dropping it in favour of other titles. Boy do I regret that now! Around episode 5 things got really interesting and I was hooked on the story, characters and ambiance of the show. It's so fun but at the same time it has the right amount of comedy to action/drama ratio, and even some feels!\r\nStory - 8\r\nI found the story for Punch Line fun, but lukewarm up until about episode 5, where the real story came into its own. It's a pretty ridiculous premisethat can only be appreciated by viewing, not by having it explained to you! Despite it being so zany, the plot really doesn't FEEL ridiculous in the context of the world presented and the characters, so it's really enjoyable to watch everything unfold and be party to what is happening in each of the character's lives. It's a pretty basic saving the world type plot on the surface, but in reality every part of what you see is important to some degree and even the first few episodes, whilst not gripping, contain some important scene setting components and clues.\\n\\n\r\nArt - 9\\n\r\nThe art is what initially drew me to Punch Line, it has a bit of a Kill La Kill vibe, although I'd go so far as to say it's more colourful. Lines are clean and crisp, and the colours are very saturated and bright but not too bright that it would burn your eyes out. I love the character designs and each of them has their own palette which was brought out nicely, too, in their room designs, which made each of them feel unique (not just having the standard anime room with little embellishments and no personality).\\n\\n\r\nSound - 8\\n\r\nSound is usually something I notice less in anime (with the exception of the voices, of course) but I LOVED the score used in Punch Line. The action scenes had punchy music that would get you excited for what was about to happen and the more sombre moments had fitting music too. Comedic moments and their associated sounds were timed perfectly making for some truly hilarious moments.\\n\r\nVoice actors did a stellar job, Rie Kugimiya especially is worth mentioning for me here as often I find her voice to have a quality I don't enjoy listening to, but I found her to be more toned-down and less squeaky in this anime and I really enjoyed her performance.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 9\\n\r\nThe characters are what held the most charm for me in this anime (as they should in any anime, I suppose). Each character had a purpose and role to play in the grand scheme of things within the anime, there was no token character or character who made no sense. I also enjoyed the fact that they weren't really moulded to fit within tropes, as so many characters are in anime.\\n\r\nI found Yuuta, the protagonist, clever and charismatic, unlike most male leads he had a backbone and worked out things himself instead of having deus ex machinas appear to progress the plot and conveniently show up when he is in a pinch.\\n\r\nChiranosuke, the cat spirit, I honestly found hilarious. Some may find him annoying but I warmed to him very early on when he goes to show Yuuta something on the computer and..let's just say he gets the wrong page. A very relate-able experience for many, I'm sure.\\n\r\nI found all of the girls held their own ground in this anime so I felt really involved in their world, they were believable within the context, each had their quirks but each was ultimately a strong, fighting individual who knew her own mind, which is also a nice thing to see.\\n\\n\r\nI thoroughly enjoyed Punch Line once I picked it back up, it has more surface qualities like great art and animation, and great sound track, but when you look past face value there is loads to appreciate deeper down in the anime, such as a great story and lovable cast of characters. There are comedic moments which made me laugh, tense scenes which had me practically sitting on the edge of my seat needing to know what the outcome would be, action-filled scenes (though honestly this isn't the main draw of this anime as it's so short) which felt exciting and even a couple of tear-jerking scenes.\\n\r\nHighly recommended for a fun afternoon watch.",

            "content": "The only thing more mystifying than the existence of Punch Line is the reception it got from the anime community upon release. Not necessarily the violent levels of hatred it got given the premise - although anyone who saw the PV should have been prepared for what was to come long ago - but for some specific bile they used to discredit it itself. FLCL without a clear direction or identity you say? First of all, if something doesn't have an identity, than how it can possibly be compared to something else? Second, who exactly made that shitty comparison to begin with?\r\nI've compared Bruno Matteito a piece of cheese, and yet I don't see how the two anime are similar in the least. FLCL established from the start that it'd be a story about a kid struggling with inner demons, whilst Punch Line established at its start that it'd be about a boy being thrown into an unfamiliar situation, Silent Hill-style if Silent Hill replaced the horrifying monsters and dense fog with horrifying anime girls and dense wackiness. They couldn't be more different. A closer comparison would have been if you matched Punch Line up with...well, Silent Hill. The most accurate comparison would have been if you compared it to Steins;Gate or Madoka aka \"the best anime of 2011\" according to most people. In fact, I can just see those three anime being siblings with the former two having grown up to be mega-successful corporate sell-outs whilst the latter is the black sheep that nobody loves because he's ugly and misunderstood and the only one who'll so much as breathe the same air as him is Samurai Flamenco.\\n\\n\r\nSorry for spoiling some important plot points to those who get the references, but considering how so many fans of them will probably never watch this show (and non-fans probably won't either), I don't think anyone's going to cry about it. I mean have you seen the ratings this show is getting in Japan? Even Glee at its worst is laughing at 'em. But yes, Punch Line is basically Steins;Gate's story combined with Madoka's execution, except with magical girls replaced by Flamenco-esque superheroes that fight with the finesse insanity of a character from Air Master. And the result? Not bad. Not great, but the fact that it has so much bile thrown at it compared to Steins;Gate or Madoka is very confusing to me.\\n\\n\r\nPunch Line is admittedly a very off-putting anime, even once you discover what it's really about. I mean I knew right away that it'd be an anime about time traveling in order to stop disaster and I still had moments when I couldn't really dig deep into it. I've made it clear that I'm not a fan of the visual novel structure and that even the best of what comes from \u201cvisual novel writer\u201d anime can't get away from having entire episodes devoted to boring setup and explanations that don\u2019t progress things in any real way. This is particularly obnoxious in the second half when after a really hilarious reveal regarding who\u2019s who and what\u2019s what, the show repeats events from the first few episodes from a different perspective. It would have been fine if the reveals actually progressed things, but all they did was make me go \u201cyeah, I kinda figured. Can we go back to playing that dramatic music again, please?\u201d\\n\\n\r\nAs for my opinion on the panty antics, I honestly don\u2019t give two shits. I don\u2019t usually like ecchi humor (actually, I\u2019ve never liked ecchi humor), but it\u2019s not an automatic turn-off for me...1% of the time. I was sold on following the show when I realized that despite the first episode telling you otherwise, Yuta\u2019s nosebleeds don\u2019t cause the destruction of the world so much as make him time travel to said destruction. That little flash-forward bit that happened right after his first eruption as a ghost wasn\u2019t exactly subtle about it. So I figured seeing if they can follow through on this \u201cend of the world\u201d conspiracy and tolerated how he has to act like a pervert in order to turn into a Super Saiyan. That said, I\u2019m not really sure why he has to do that considering everyone else seems to have no problems powering up themselves. I know he has body issues, but so do some of the other characters, and I very much doubt the author had gender differences in mind in regards to the issue apart from a cheap gag.\\n\\n\r\nNot to say that the comedy is good. But for what it\u2019s worth, it\u2019s not bad when it\u2019s not focusing on making the main character try to relive the early to mid-00s. There are a couple of moments that made me laugh like Miyazawa Kenji before the show realized his true identity was more obvious than a 50-foot tall giant hunchback trying to blend in on the Mayflower. However, for a show called Punch Line, I\u2019d have expected an ending that blew my expectations so much that I\u2019d crack up harder than Ed from The Lion King after going through a large amount of coke. But no, the show plays out rather fittingly climactic before ending on another panty joke. Not a bad thing as most VN adaptations tend to chicken out with some awkwardly crowbarred-in \u201ctrue ending shit\u201d that ruin the flow when you bring it to the moving picture medium. Still, I felt it could have been stronger. Maybe I missed one of Uchikoshi\u2019s many hidden messages. I dunno.\\n\\n\r\nWith regards to the actual story, my issue with it is that it doesn\u2019t really push its agenda hard enough. I know it's common in visual novel-type stories to mask characters' personal turmoil by having them act like anime stereotypes, but it's also common in light novel adaptations to have heroines whose bust is three sizes too large break the laws of physics or for our Republicans to hate the legalization of gay marriage across the country, so I wouldn't go around using that as a defense if I were you. More than though, whilst the show actually tackles many of the political grudges and youth culture issues that Japan is suffering from underneath all the wackiness, it doesn\u2019t really say much that you wouldn\u2019t know about them other than saying we should fight \u2018em with a giant robot, which isn\u2019t applicable to the real world at all unless Japan has a secret facility they\u2019re not telling us about. It also doesn\u2019t say too much about superheroes either that you haven\u2019t seen before. In fact, it\u2019s actually kind of standard with the only thing standing out is that all the sentai members are female.\\n\\n\r\nBut there is one standout clever moment in the end, and without getting too spoiler-y, it involves a sacrifice that whilst kinda predictable and nothing all that new in theory, is pretty f*cked up when you think about it. Could it have been a metaphor for how Japan\u2019s youth will always suffer for its crimes? Is it a subversion of the childhood-friend trio trope? Honestly, it could be, but I don\u2019t care enough about the show to analyze it. Maybe if said scene wasn\u2019t succeeded by another panty gag...\\n\\n\r\nPunch Line isn\u2019t leaving this review without a positive grade from me, but said grade has a bit of a noticeable minus-sign next to it if you know what I mean. Whilst a good majority of the show is solid enough, it succumbs to the same middling lows expected of VN writing and the only thing that really amazes is the visual style. And that takes a noticeable hit during the middle stretch because in order to make the finale as impressive as possible - which they succeeded at quite spectacularly mind you - compromises have to be made, and Mappa aren\u2019t exactly KyoAni/Bones in terms of raking in the dough. Still, as a fan of animation and what can be accomplished with it, Punchline does a fine job of satisfying that itch, so if you want to see what the medium can accomplish and aren\u2019t deathly allergic to panty/nosebleed humor and Rie Kugimiya\u2019s nasally voice, check it out. \\n\\n\r\nNow if you\u2019ll excuse me, I\u2019m going to look at that other Spring 2015 \u201cvisual novel writer\u201d anime that people seem to think is a much better series and stomp holes into its pristine soullessness with all the ferocity of a kangaroo riding a jackhammer.",

Yet it isn't getting as much love as it deserves. There is a reason for that. Basically, the creators of punchline basically fucked up in attracting anyone to the series. The first few episodes are pure randomness and I mean PURE RANDOMNESS. Because of that people just rated it because of their first impressions which I see to be pretty common here. Once you get past episode 6 you will start understanding the story and whenthat happens there is a very high chance you will enjoy it.\\n\r\nThanks for reading this short review.

            "content": "This show is awful, terrible garbage, the kind of trash that is the reason why so many people are hesitant to admit they watch anime. The premise alone is horrible and unappealing.\r\nAnd yet it's pretty good somehow.\r\nI would compare this type of absolute trash entertainment to the movie Venom. It's pretty objectively a poor work, but you're having so much ridiculous fun that you can ignore that and just go along for the ride.\r\nSo yeah, this is an anime about ghosts and time loops and asteroids and robot scientists and superheroes and gene editing and gender identity and government coverups and school bullying and catgods and romance and friendship and panties and panties and panties. It covers the whole damn spectrum of Weird Anime Stuff, gives absolutely no thought into actually making a coherent piece out of it all, and just blows into the story.\\n\\n\r\nPart of the reason Punch Line probably wasn't as successful as it could have been is because of just how brazen it is about refusing to dumb itself down (or in this case, smarten itself up) for audience expectations. It knows exactly what kind of show it is, so instead of trying to hunker down and deliver an appealing fanservice show or a compelling character drama, it just dicks around however it wants and throws every possible element against the wall seemingly at random. The show starts off as some bombastic action show, before suddenly and violently veering into a supernatural apartment roommate comedy, one that of course quickly reveals itself to be a sci-fi/fantasy hodgepodge that never quite explains its own existence. The same episode that introduces ghostly possession also introduces the NSA. Yeah, it's that kind of show.\\n\\n\r\nThe cast is good, the four main girls all being pretty solid archetypes you've seen before but in an interesting dynamic because each character gets just a little bit of extra development to make them really apt to clash with each other. Add in the main hero and his psuedo-shounen hero self, and you actually have a pretty eclectic mix. A couple of of them have some legitimately well-done dramatic moments as well, rare for any action or comedy series.\\n\\n\r\nThe main hero, Yuuta, is one of the biggest standouts of the series, in that his role as a generic male protagonist is a sleight-of-hand by the show itself. I can't divulge too much here, but let's just say that the story is in medias res for a reason.\\n\\n\r\nAnd... that's really the biggest hook here for Punch Line. It is constantly trying to fool its audience, throwing in crazy plot twists and unbelievably dumb backstories, slowly unfolding the entire story in all its convolution. LARGELY the story is predictable and if you're paying attention you can pretty much figure out where it's going by the end of episode 2 or 3, but there will be a few shockers to throw you off balance even then. It's really stupid but I very much enjoyed every stupid plot development. \\n\\n\r\nThe writers were clearly having a ton of fun making this story, and their excitement really translates into a fun end product. You see lots of shows where it seems like they were just making it out of obligation, or maybe the passion left before production actually begun, or something else that is reflected in the paint-by-numbers elements of the end product. Punch Line is the opposite of this and you can pinpoint each moment where the writers definitely thought they were being super clever. It's good to be in love with your own story!\\n\\n\r\nSadly, the show is a bit too scatterbrained for its own good, and the finale isn't particularly strong. It actually feels like they were too rushed, and that the series needed another three or six episodes to truly tell the story they wanted to tell. But thanks to the anime industry's pointless and strict season requirements, we only got twelve episodes out of it. Honestly, if it had gone a full 24 episodes, I think it might have actually been able to ascend past being stupid fun and become something truly good. As it was, there wasn't quite enough time available, though the fast pace is definitely welcome.\\n\\n\r\nUnless you're a moron who takes everything too seriously, Punch Line is probably for you. It sucks and is great simultaneously, and it's rare to see that kind of thing. Despite my 6/10 rating, I actually recommend this quite a bit! Just... don't expect anything good!",

            "content": "Let me start off by saying that the only reason I started watching Punch Line in the first place is because the concept seemed ridiculous enough to provide some laughs. I mean, based on everything I had seen, it looked like any common ecchi. Like many reviewers have already stated, that's how it started out. It interested me at first and I was excited to watch it but eventually it became more like a chore as the attention grabbing features became muted and the less than subtle panty shots took over. However, by the time it got to the fifth episode (I think that's whatit was but don't hold me on it), everything changed. \\n\\n\r\nStory (7/10)\\n\r\nPunch Line began without a strong story or any real sense of direction. The opening act of the show appeared to be merely a series of disconnected gags with no purpose. Even for myself, someone who finds great enjoyment in cheap comedy and slice of life, found the show to be a bore. Let me tell you though, it was so worth it to stick with the show. All the things that seemed dumb began to make sense. All the random threads were being connected. All the characters I didn't care for became important to me. The show just began to work. I don't want to spoil anything here so I won't be specific about anything so I'll just say this: the show stops being a show about panties and becomes a dynamic adventure with elements, plot threads, and emotions you'd never think could come from a show with a main character who seems to have more blood in his general nose area than a normal person has in their whole body. The only reason I gave the story a 7 is because that slow part does really put a dent in it. If they had found a way to make that more entertaining that would be a different case. \\n\\n\r\nArt (8/10)\\n\r\nI don't think this section needs to be as long winded as the story section (yeah sorry about that) so I'll just get right to it. Is the art great? No, not particularly. But is it bad? Certainly not. The art style does however fit  the overall tone of the story very well. It's not too detailed and it shouldnt be. It's not generic either. It has enough imagination and individuality to make it stand out, even if just a little.\\n\\n\r\nSound (7/10)\\n\r\nI usually don't pay attention to soundtracks unless they are particularly good. Meaning if they are just average I tend not to notice them. That is Punch Line. I don't mean to say the soundtrack is bad, it's just kind of there. It normally did its job (although the score underperformed in some scenes) and generally blended in quite well. But if I can't remember a single tune after watching the show, it didn't have much of an impact. However, I did like the opening and ending themes a lot. The opening in particular was very catchy and lighthearted, much like the show itself.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter (9/10)\\n\r\nPunch Line did an excellent job in portraying it's characters. The show made me feel a connection to the cast and not all shows can do that. Everyone is unique and has his or her own demons and/or motives. It was fun to go on the ride with them. Sure there we some cliches, but they weren't so glaringly obvious that they couldn't be looked past. Plus the protagonist, Yuta, was very likable for me and if the protagonist sucks than...oh well. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (9/10)\\n\r\nI freaking loved this show. Sure it had its down time, but all the rest more than made up for it. I was so surprised by this show that I expected nothing out of. Out of nowhere it became one of my favorite shows of the season, maybe even my favorite. I was just so pleasently surprised I just couldn't help but enjoy it immensely. And just in case you're worried, yes it was funny. I made it seem like it wasn't but it really was. \\n\\n\r\nOverall (9/10)\\n\r\nHats off to Punch Line here. If you are able to stick with it through the first 4 or 5 episodes I believe you will find it is worth it. Everything comes together in only the way Punch Line can do it (and the only way that makes sense). Your efforts will be rewarded and then some.\\n\\n\r\nThis is my first review so go easy on me here. I'm not quite sure what exactly I should be saying yet. I'll do better next time!",

On December 21st, he is taken hostage on a hijacked bus by a terrorist group. He catches a glimpse of panties which gives him a power up, and tackles the bad guy. But sees panties again, and passes out. After that, he is zapped by a yellow light in the sky. He wakes up in his apartment, confused, and finds out that he\u2019s separated from his own body. The only help he receives is from a crazy ghost cat, named Chiranosuke, that explains his situation and abilities. Yuta uses his newfound powers to protect his house mates from danger.\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately, because of Yuta\u2019s idiosyncratic condition, he must avoid seeing panties twice, or else he loses consciousness, and as a spirit, time jumps to a point when an impending giant asteroid destroys Earth.

The story really is about the daily lives of the Korai House residents in a span of 10 days, and how they fight fate. It doesn\u2019t make much sense in the convoluted first half of the series, still it bids full attention as it won\u2019t really spoonfeed the details later. How the scattered puzzle pieces form together is a satisfying experience, the way it executes its story resembles Baccano! or Durarara!!\\n\\n\r\n[Visuals]\\n\r\n- \u201cHuh?

As an anime that is damn casual with it\u2019s panty shots, they even have a legit good Lingerie Designer, Uemura Hiromi for that. The panties shown all over the show are pretty, and you can easily tell which girl it is based on the type they wear. Punchline can easily be mistaken as an anime from Gainax or Trigger because of the art style, it\u2019s not surprising because the staff really are from Gainax. It\u2019s the second time for Uemura Yutaka as a director. I like how Punchline is visually pleasing with its use of color pallete and expressive faces, but I\u2019ll complain about the weak direction of two setup episodes because it felt like watching filler even if they weren\u2019t. The colorful 3d CG interior of the Korai House designed by Mai Yoneyama is gorgeous, each room subtly shows a lot about the character who lives in it without outright telling us. Shota Iwasaki (Gurren Lagann, Kill la Kill) is one skilled character designer. Every character is iconic and varied in appearance, no sameface, different sizes, skin types, cute outfits, and no boring school uniforms. My favorite is Yuta\u2019s androgynous design, who knew?\\n\\n\r\n[Sound]\\n\r\n- \u201cThe song earlier was a sign that there\u2019s an emergency!\u201d\\n\\n\r\nThe sound effects are cool and full of impact, like the sound when a character activates Uber and the punchy sounds that give every hit in fights more intense. The OP composed by Hyadain (Nichijou, Baka to Test) is catchy, that pumps you up when the show starts, and the ED is very cute. The voice cast are all talents (except the Engrish parts, the thick Japanese accent was too obvious), every single character\u2019s voice stands out, and sounded like they had fun with their roles with all the swapping shenanigans. Marina Inoue\u2019s performance as Yuta is brilliant. Tetsuya Komuro did a good job with the OST, tracks I particularly like are [Strange Juice Action] when the heroine kicks ass, [Destruction] pulls my heart strings, and [Pressure] when shit starts to go down.\\n\\n\r\n[Character]\\n\r\n- \u201cI can\u2019t believe Narugino is Strange Juice.\u201d\\n\\n\r\nPunchline has an interesting cast of characters. Will only introduce the tenants here and avoid spoiler characters.\\n\\n\r\nYuta, a boy that has a panty fetish. He\u2019s one of the most unusual protagonists I ever met (you know what I mean). A big fan of Seas May. His life is turned upside-down after someone stole his body. Yuta cares deeply for people close to him, has an altruistic outlook, but tends to make rash actions. He starts of clueless, and a passive observer (he\u2019s a spirit!) as he tries to figure out what\u2019s happened to him. He gets more active later on when he gets used to his powers after the midpoint shift of the series, and eventually leads to form a secret organization called \u201cJustice Punch,\u201d that strives to save the world from destruction.\\n\\n\r\nThe ally of justice, Mikatan. She is a country bumpkin from Tsugaru but hides it so she can be member of the idol group Seas May. Despite her a dark past, she\u2019s the most cheerful and just wants everyone to get along, though a bit of a ditz. Mikatan may be sweet and nice, but she\u2019s not soft. Harm the weak or her friends and you\u2019ll get a beatdown. Mikatan is actually the famous superhero called \u201cStrange Juice\u201d but keeps that a secret. Has a crush on Yuta. Does not like turtles.\\n\\n\r\nMeika, a genius at anything mechanical, but bad at athletic things like handstands. The landlady of the Korai House, which she inherited from her grandpa. She\u2019s protective of the apartment and doesn\u2019t allow anyone who damages the property. Meika likes to troll the tenants for giggles. She possesses vast intelligence on certain topics. She names her fancy inventions with -maker at the end. Meika is actually Strange Juice\u2019s assistant, called \u201cPumpkin Chair\u201d.\\n\\n\r\nA hikkikomori and otaku, Ito. Ito is actually the legendary mech-FPS-gamer called \u201cTorahachiro.\u201d She\u2019s enrolled in an elite private all-girls school but became a NEET because of a traumatic event. Ito\u2019s dad is an education board member and disowned her once once she stopped going to school. She\u2019s blunt, and can get aggressive. Ito prefers to spend most of her time playing online games. She loves to keep animals.\\n\\n\r\nRabura, a single 29 year old woman who\u2019s desperate to find a lover. She\u2019s from a family of skilled exorcists and works as a spirit medium, but ironically thinks she\u2019s no good at it, and doesn\u2019t believe in the supernatural herself. Owns a pet turtle. She ships Mikatan and Yuta. She\u2019s also Ito\u2019s big cousin and is not happy of her not going to school. Rabura gets pissed whenever Meika comments about her search for men.\\n\\n\r\nThe pet sidekick, Chiranosuke. It enjoys cracking jokes, drinking alcohol and not being helpful to Yuta. The talking cat\u2019s origins remain a mystery.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are a dynamic bunch. However, 12 episodes just weren\u2019t enough to give them equal development.\\n\\n\r\n[Overall]\\n\r\n- \u201cTo a supremely happy and peaceful future.\u201d\\n\\n\r\nThe humor of show is more subjective than usual due to several puns that are lost in translation. Personally, the juvenile silliness leaves me a smile often. The panty nonsense doesn\u2019t bother me because it\u2019s presented in an exaggerated tongue-in-cheek way, like it\u2019s not intended to titillate, and it\u2019s mostly plot relevant too. The anime knows when it needs to be quirky and funny, it also knows when it needs to be dead serious. The show is also rewatchable, there\u2019s a lot of detail that might not be noticed the first time, or a second or third time.\\n\\n\r\nIf you need to avoid panties like our hero Yuta for some reason or allergic to constant mood whiplashes, then stay away at all costs. If you don\u2019t mind a fun screwy sci-fi mystery, then this anime is surely not to miss. I recommend a marathon watch. Maybe you can figure out the punchline. \\n\\n",

            "content": "Rarely do we see ecchi cater to something more than just simple, exploited fan service. Too often, an anime series that is considered ecchi would have no qualms whatsoever to deliver a decent, substantial story. However, Punch Line\u2019s case, if the series is ever considered ecchi, is different. The series presents that substantial story we were all looking for plus many more things that we all would love in an anime series.\r\nThe story is a roller coaster ride I might say, one that would keep you in grips. Between conspiracies, superheroes, strange occult stuff you never knew existed, and that seemingly inevitable asteroid, you willnever know where it will go. It amazes me how Punch Line weaves its elements together to for one intricate, exciting, and well-developed story. It reveals but not too much at one time, giving the show a generous amount of suspense and cleverness. The narrative is well pace and all too good with the plot twists and the oh-damn-I-didn\u2019t-see-that-coming moments.\\n\\n\r\nPunch Line also pokes innocent fun at different anime tropes and clich\u00e9s \u2013 unlikely superheroes, genius inventors, giant robots, idols singing about just anything under the sun (stacking buns higher than the Burj Khalifa), and, of course, panty shots. It is not malicious or anything.  It should be pointed out that this element was incorporated into the story smoothly.\\n\\n\r\nThe visuals may not be unlike anything I have ever seen before, but MAPPA outdid themselves here. It is nice to watch that the studio did not spare any effort putting it all together. Just like the story, the designs are quirky, spunky, and creative and there is not a lagging moment in the animation (heck, even the panty shots are nicely drawn). It is indeed well thought of and excellently crafted.\\n\\n\r\nI was surprised to find out that there were going to be at least three occult-related anime series released this season. For some reason, I picked up Punch Line, maybe because it had the most ridiculous synopsis. Well, what could go wrong? \\n\\n\r\nAbsolutely nothing. Everything about Punch Line is beyond expectation. It is not sad fan service (the type we consider detrimental to the industry). It embodies what anime studios should at least consider in creating a series \u2013 pure, innocent, and well-meaning fun. If you\u2019re thrown by the ecchi (which is almost non-existent in the series by the way) or maybe even the synopsis, I will say about Punch Line what I have always said about Kill la Kill: Don\u2019t drop it, give it some time, and pay attention. If you\u2019re planning to overlook the series, then you\u2019re going to miss out on a lot.\\n\\n\r\nLoaded with laughs, twists, and a whole lot of nosebleed-inducing panty shots, Punch Line shines as one of the season\u2019s most outstanding anime series. Added to that, it is a quirky, fun-filled must-watch. I would recommend this to anyone with enough sense not to judge a book by its cover.\\n",

            "content": "Spoiler free, most of the fun is being confused and figuring it out, only to be wrong and get slapped in the face with something strange, so I won;t get into to much detail. \r\nPunch Line\r\nPunch Line starts out as an ecchi comedy with no sense of direction. Just some lame jokes, awkward situations, and pantsu viewing with absurd consequences with no explanation behind it in an attempt to catch you off guard. But you've already been introduced with good foreshadowing into what slowly becomes a convoluted and intriguing mystery, and quite possibly the wildest, \"wtf\" show I have watched (or at least sat through).Digging deep into the ground of human scientific experiments, mecha, government cover ups, spiritual beings, genetic mutation, militant attacks, time travel, and the space time continuum, it's actually pretty decent to a point. Although they continue to dig deeper and deeper til they look up and say, \"oh shit, how are we gonna get out of this fucking hole?\" Well, in short, they don't.\\n\\n\r\nStory: *sigh* The show starts off a heroine chasing a hijacked bus on her motorcycle. She beats up a few then gets held at gun point. Then PLOT TWIST our MC Yuuta, sees some pantsu, goes SSJ, and tackles the dude with the gun. They fall out of the bus off a bridge into the river. Yuuta then wakes up at his apartment complex as a spirit. then PLOT TWIST. A porn loving ghost cat (don't ask), explains that he is experiencing an out of body phenomenon while someone else is possessing his body. He then sets out to find a strange book that the porn cat says he can use to regain his body. That's like the first episode, I'm gonna get into all the insane twists and turns cause it's pointless unless I share every detail. But it turns into something far more grand and completely ridiculous than that. For example, when he sees pantsu, he goes SSJ, he sees pantsu again, PLOT TWIST! his excitement increases, thus triggering a meteor to fall from the sky and end humanity. This happens a couple times. Why? ........ in short, after a sudden PLOT TWIST he joins up with the super hero team Justice Punch who ironically lives with him to save the world from complete annihilation.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Our characters get some decent back story but they're all spoilers. They have an mysterious past that is slowly revealed in small detail and are bond by fate/destiny/coincidence/divine intervention then PLOT TWIST!. Yuuta is our main MC and ghost, he sees pantsu, he goes SSJ, he cares about his friends. Mika-tan is the best character, is very positive and happy, as well as caring for her friends. However, she tends to keep her problems to herself and hide them. PLOT TWIST she's obvious from the start that she is the heroine from the opening scene, alter ego, Strange Juice, and a member of the idol group She's May. Meika is a genius inventor/hacker, a smart, intelligent and cheerful girl. She is easily upset by simple things, and has been shown to be pushy when it comes to meeting new friends.She runs Korai House, also a member of Justice Punch, known as Pumpkin Chair, she's also a PLOT TWIST. Ito appears to be more of a shut-in than a social butterfly. She avoids the others to play video games and surf the web, she can be a bit blunt and rude at times. Rabura is a fishy spiritual medium, everyone thinks shes a fake/con. Cause she can't really do shit. She's pretty annoying too. Our heroes.......\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: I guess it's pretty decent. Although some of the action left a bit to be desired. The art was very pleasing in design and color. They especially put detail into pantsu, so if that's your thing. GG.\\n\\n\r\nSound: I guess it did it's job. The OP ED are catchy, and brought good atmosphere to the serious parts, yes it gets serious here and there. Some of the insert songs like She's May \"I wanna see your Buns\" during the mock Doki Doki Girls Everywhere Swimsuit event were absolutely historical!!!!! That shit had me in stitches!\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: It was enjoyable for sure, it had it's ups and down at first, but when the back-story and bits and pieces of the mystery unraveled it really gets your attention and becomes compelling with that PLOT TWIST, then again with that PLOT TWIST. Then there's these random moments where you can't decide what you're laughing about. Was it actually funny? Or is it so bad and random that you can't help but laugh? The point it falls off unfortunately is the very last episode when PLOT TWIST. It's almost like, \"hmmm, I'm not sure how we can really pull this off, so .... eh, this will work.\" It was very unsatisfying to me. And they did such a good job of setting up during the last few eps with that PLOT TWIST just leave me wanting better than that. And anything involving time travel will have it's holes, such as the unsolvable chicken and egg paradox, but I feel like the gap they left is understandable, but also just leaves to much possibility to feel satisfied.\\n\\n\r\nThis show wasn't the best by any means, but it's so unusual, fun, wild, and filled with PLOT TWISTS I think it's worth everybody checking out. Just keep in mind it's rather misleading for the first three eps. I was about to drop it, but something about it made me keep watching and I'm glad I did. 6/10",

            "content": "The outlook you carry as you consider this show may be different from the preconceptions I had a few months ago. First, it was announced that MAPPA was the studio handling Punch Line's animation. This led me to rejoice, as I had been anticipating more of their work since I had seen Shingeki no Bahamut last year; a show that greatly satisfied me (for the most part [give it a shot {go on, try it!}]). In addition, multiple notable voice actors were revealed as part of the cast, which in and of itself is reason enough for many people to 'Plan To Watch'.\r\nHowever, it ishard for me to say that I was wholeheartedly behind this show from the get-go. You see, a short PV was soon after posted online. That promo allotted a decent portion of its time to shots of panties and nosebleeds, and as a result, I became a bit more apprehensive towards the upcoming premiere of this show. Truth be told, ecchi definitely plays a part in the plot of Punch Line, but that does not necessarily hold the show back. For example, the main protagonist certainly does receive a power up when he's turned on, similarly to a certain future Harem King, but Punch Line wields its pervert card in a slightly different manner.\\n\\n\r\nThe setting is a boarding house and the main character Yuuta. He's your typical young lad who looks out for his friends/apartment mates and can cause the end of the world if too aroused. Events in the action-packed beginning of the show lead him to become a spirit forcibly separated from his body. Go figure, right? I say \"typical\", but he really isn't so reminiscent of any one other character that I ever saw him as boring or annoying. Overall, Yuuta is given a fair amount of time and depth as a character.\\n\r\nNarugino is the idol-by-day-superhero-by-day-as-well character. She is sweet, kind, shy, and kind of annoying at first. She's your stereotypical nice girl character, but eventually Narugino receives enough backstory and development that she actually sort of grows on you, so give her a chance. I saw her panties.\\n\r\nThe resident techie and bespectacled dorm head goes by the name of Meika. Unless you literally started watching anime yesterday, you've undoubtedly heard her voice in shows such as Zero no Tsukaima and Shakugan no Shana to name just two. However, Meika's character is severely different from the usual tsundere archetype you've seen before to the point that its a breath of fresh air to not hear squeal and yell before attacking some pitiable male teenager. She aid Narugino in her hero endeavors, and she's fairly cool. I saw her panties, too.\\n\r\nIto plays videogames and keeps a pet bear. She is a bit of a shut-in, meaning she does not possess that much self-confidence, but she still cares her friends and breaks out of her shell as the story calls for it. I also saw her panties.\\n\r\nThe last resident of the dorm is Rabura the so-called exorcist. I'll be honest and say that while everyone else feels equally like main characters, it was hard to see her beyond the capacity of a supporting role, not that that's a bad thing. I suppose she is still fairly likeable, albeit more plot device than protagonist. She's your mature older woman who cannot get a boyfriend and helps her friends in a pinch. You will see her panties.\\n\r\nChiranosuke, the flying spiritual cat who loves porn and guides Yuuta gets a special mention as he was one of my favorite parts of the show. Alas, he does not wear panties. Not even spirit panties.\\n\\n\r\nIf the multiple paragraphs devoted to character descriptions wasn't enough of a hint, Punch Line begins as a show mostly depicting the interactions of the boarding house residents, despite the overarching story premise set forth in the first episode. As a result, one believes this anime will be focused on moving forward the grand, mysterious plot from the start. However, the pace feels pretty slow until mid-way through, as it transitions back from character-oriented to a progressing plot.\\n\\n\r\nEven still, this unsettling change-of-pace left me interested in the show and I looked forward to seeing where Punch Line would take me. It displayed above-average animation and solid voice acting. The plot kept me invested. In fact, I would not have been surprised had it been a two-cour show. Therein was the problem that arose. Namely, the ending did not quite live up to expectations. It fit, and I suppose it was not entirely a bad ending, but I was hoping for more. To use an analogy, it was like building up a thirst and being handed a cold can of soda. You're feeling great as you anticipate that carbonated, unhealthy, cold, sugary drink. But upon that first gulp, you realize it's slightly flat and not all that cold. It has by no means lost its carbonation and bubbliness, nor is it warm, but it simply did not live up to the hype you forced onto it.\\n\\n\r\nThough I say this, don't misunderstand. I enjoyed watching Punch Line and I believe it to be pretty decent show. It was a fun watch with a varied ensemble of characters with good chemistry. Ecchi didn't ruin or hinder the quality and was sparsely used for the most part. My advice is to not walk into the world of Punch Line with high expectations and you, too, can have a good time. My other advice is to (re)watch Shingeki no Bahamut.",

            "content": "General liberal,\r\ndeflation spiral,\r\nNatural mineral,\r\nCome on!\r\nThis is the Cheermancy cheer from episode 2. It has been a while since I have yet to see another good anime in Spring 2015, and finally I found one. I know, you might think that I hate this anime just because it is ecchi. To be honest, I actually enjoyed this anime.\r\nSTORY (7):\r\nThe story follows Yuta Iridatsu, a boy living in Korai House with 4 girls. Yuta was caught in an accident which turned him into a spirit, and he was guided by the cat spirit known as Chiranosuke. He has to master his spirit powers and find out howto protect the 4 girls from terrible situations. If he sees too many panties in a row, the earth will be destroyed.\\n\\n\r\nI am not looking forward to seeing this anime. This is because it was titled as an ecchi. In fact, the first episode shows the wind blowing one of the girl's skirt, which totally enraged me because I saw this scene in Rail Wars and I am getting tired of such jokes. The synopsis also completely destroyed my enjoyment towards this show.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime was directed by Yukata Uemura, former Ganinax member. \\n\\n\r\nThe story is not actually about ecchi jokes. The story involves Yuta about finding out what happened to the situations he is in and how he tries to solve these mysteries. I did like the way how the story is like a mystery that keeps people thinking. \\n\\n\r\nThe is one scene in episode 4 which is the funniest scene where Rabura is mistakenly offered the wrong items and she freaks out. I didn't see that one coming.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, at times the plot is very confusing and I feel that they could at least explore some details better.\\n\\n\\n\r\nART (8):\\n\\n\r\nThe animation style looks like Gurren Laggan and Kill la Kill. The animation is fun.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND (8):\\n\\n\r\nThe voice acting was good. \\n\\n\r\nThe opening was addictive. \"Punchline\"\\n\\n\r\nThe ending was also fun to listen to. It felt like a J-rock band playing the song. Although the voice was a bit processed, the music is fun to listen to.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER (7):\\n\\n\r\nI have no problem with the characters. None of them stood out the most to me in my opinion. However, the problem is that characters need to have motivations and reasons as to why they have to save world. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters at least have personality.\\n\\n\r\nMeika Daihatsu, the name of Mecha. Yes, she is interesting as a character who thinks quicker and implement solutions like impersonating someone.\\n\\n\r\nRabura was funny when she freaked out in episode 4 and when she does the cheermancy cheer.\\n\\n\r\nYuuta, I would say he did his best trying to reunite the team together. However, he was not interesting as a character.\\n\\n\r\nIto Hikiotani, the name inspired by \"Ito\" & \"Hikikomori\". Just like Hachiman Hikigaya. She is also an interesting character however, she rarely participates in battles.\\n\\n\r\nNarugino Mikatan is cheerful and lively. I did appreciate the fact that they gave her a personality to work with. However, she didn't interest me that much.\\n\\n\r\nChiranosuke is like a father figure to Yuta. \\n\\n\r\nGuriko was by far intimidating as a villain although he appeared only in the later episodes. If he was given more material on why he acted the way he did, I thought that would be more interesting. He also has a cool personality with his charm.\\n\\n\r\nSo far, the interesting characters are Rabura, Chiranosuke, Guriko and \\n\r\nMeika.\\n\\n\r\nCONCLUSION (7):\\n\\n\r\nI know you might be surprised that I give this anime a 7 out of 10. To be honest, I enjoyed this anime. Sometimes, life can surprise you in different ways.\\n\\n\r\nEven though I have few problems with this anime, I still enjoyed this anime regardless. Try not to make those ecchi jokes offend you, otherwise you will not be able to enjoy the show.\\n\\n\r\nI give this anime a 7 out of 10. \\n\\n\r\nThe lesson is \"Never judge a book by its cover\".\\n",

            "content": "Pardon if this review isn't the best. I'm not that experienced on writing them.\r\nPunch Line is an interesting case. It starts out with a ridiculous premise that's enough to make you not want to bother with the show. It leads you to believe it's going to be a story about nothing more than a boy trying his best to avoid looking at panties. In expected fashion, he ends up in situation after situation where seeing panties is unavoidable. Yet out of the blue, it changes into something completely different. It all culminated in a final episode that was, admittedly, pretty well done. It was quitethe surprising bait and switch. So why the 7? Well let's get down to it.\\n\\n\r\nI won't spoil anything, but I will say there's a pretty interesting plot twist a few episodes in. As soon as that twist happened, the show felt like it suddenly took a bit darker and more action heavy turn. I thought that was pretty cool. However, I also think those first few episodes were overall detrimental to the entire experience. \\n\\n\r\nBy the end of the series, I only really felt like I cared about two of the five main characters. If those first few episodes were in the tone of the rest of the series, I feel they could have been repurposed better towards making me care about the characters. Or at least towards making the story that pops up later more interesting. If anything, I just sort of disliked those three other characters and found them annoying more than I did care about them. In my eyes, it would certainly be putting the episodes to better use to repurpose them and drop the whole original premise that basically gets thrown to the side anyways.\\n\\n\r\nAnd what about all the stuff they spent the first few episodes explaining? It more or less doesn't even matter in terms of the rest of the series. The first few episodes really just feel like a pointless excuse to show panties, and some silly reasoning shoehorned in to distract you from that fact. While the series definitely picked up after the twist was revealed, I still didn't feel all that invested in what was going on until the final episode.\\n\\n\r\nSo in short, the story felt weak, only some of the characters felt well done, and it overall really didn't make me feel overly invested in what was going on. If anything, I felt an overwhelming disappointment. The show felt like it could have been so much more than it was. I wanted it to be more. Instead we got pointless panty shots and a story with a cool premise that doesn't really shine until the very end.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the positives, there were definitely some cool action scenes. The story was enjoyable at certain parts, though fleeting as they were. The soundtrack wasn't half bad. The art was pretty cool, though the animation certainly wasn't the best out there. Bottom line: check it out if you got nothing you're dying to watch and willing to stick it out until the end. You may enjoy yourself. But don't go in expecting a masterpiece of any sort.",

            "content": "This is a review from someone who's not a fan of ecchi,  but can deal with it. \r\nSo straight up, if you're not a fan of ecchi, you're perfectly fine to take a pass on this anime, because while it's decent enough if you're bored, there's definitely better stuff out there to watch. \r\nThe art is unique and eye catching (though the limited action sequences are awkward and clunky, epecially in the final episode), the sound is good enough (the music is zany and cutesy;  as is the rest of the show), and the characters are OK.\r\nReally, the only thing that you canknock this show on,  is that the pacing is just a tad off. While bits of the very start and very end are interesting enough, the middle episodes suffer a noticeable lul; and that's a bit unforgivable in a series that's only 12 episodes long. \\n\\n\r\nThe ecchi, while part of the premise, feels kind of almost like a gimmick (it's used and it's not hurt by it, but the story makes equal sense without it),  and one you can for the most part ignore. I can say though that,  if i were someone who WAS a fan of ecchi,  i could see how I could focus on the rest of the positives enough to give it a 7, maayybe an 8, because it's quite good--for an ecchi. (To give it perspective, this is a solid one, probably two notches down from another recent ecchi with an interesting premise,  No Game No Life--which, incidentally,  is a series good enough to watch as an anime, period). Being that I'm not though,  comparing it to all other anime,  ecchi and not, I give this about a 6.\\n\\n\r\nNot being a fan of the sub-genre,  I stuck around because the premise was bizarre, zany, and interesting enough that I decided to give it a start to finish shot, but ultimately, while nearly everything was tied up by the end, i still felt like it didn't live up 100% to the potential I saw, and the other positives weren't standout enough to make this show worth actively seeking out. \\n\\n\r\nGive it a shot of you're bored and have watched absolutely everything else, otherwise, pick another show.",

            "content": "Punchline was made by the same people who made Kill la Kill so if you're into the subtle fanservice and string of jokes, Punchline could be totally what you need! I binge watched it after the first episode. And yes the description of Yuuta getting power from a girl's panties is a big keypoint of the plot.  Just believe me however at first the anime seems like any other harem/ecchi with a bunch of fanservice but if you just go through the first episode you can see how great it is with a complex plot and interesting characters. Let's get to it!!\r\nStory:8\r\nThe story isvery fun to solve out with the character and can get you, the viewer, hyped.  The plot is unique but I can't really explain it without spoiling the story, but just look out for: \\n\r\n-an evil government\\n\r\n-betrayal (dramatic music plays)\\n\r\n-body switching\\n\r\n-internet gaming\\n\r\n-a romantic subplot\\n\r\n-ghost possession \\n\r\n-panties sending a meteor to kill all life on earth\\n\r\nAND MUCH MORE!!!\\n\\n\r\nArt:9\\n\\n\r\nThe art style is just adorable, the lines are smooth and the animation is surprisingly fluid.  The art for the girls (which brings the harem back into play) make them all look unique and have a clear different personality, and the screens between transitions gives the viewer something to stare at.  Of course with such a perverted premise of a boy getting his power from panties, those scenes show have a large importance and the style that's drawn is clear, each panty shot looks detailed and let's the viewer appreciate animation as a whole.\\n\\n\r\nSound:6\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack of Punchline was nothing special, music never really influenced the anime whether it be the scenes or tone of the moment as a whole.  The opening is pretty enjoyable however, it's fun, fast paced, and showcases everything in a fast manner that makes the viewer watch it each time in an attempt to identify everything on screen.  Besides that the OST's were pretty decent, nothing to brag about\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:7\\n\\n\r\nMost characters got some form of closure except for one girl in the shared house, I won't say who as to avoid spoilers but she gets no backstory whatsoever.  Besides this one exception, each character has some form of a unique background that all link back to part of the main conflict and form the main story.  They're all tied by invisible bonds formed years before they knew who was who, and the character development stays consistent and lets the viewer see the character truly grow up.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:10\\n\\n\r\nI cried while watching this.  Punchline is a fun anime that gets the viewer immersed in the small world it created.  It gets emotional at some points but besides that moment it has moments that could get the meanest people to crack a smile.  Even if moments seem pointless or random, they all tie together and got me thinking of my own friendships.  You can see the girls fight and argue, and it goes further from just another silly fanservice anime if you keep an open mind (panty shots were a nice add in too though).\\n\\n\r\nOverall:8\\n\\n\r\nThe anime 'Punchline' is a favorite of mine, yet it does hold it's flaws.  This review held a VERY biased view over it since it was the first time i watched an entire anime in one sitting at 6 in the morning that I remember clear as day.  It can get emotional while it can also be silly and stupid, but if you give it a chance you could be surprised too.  Punchline holds a nice theme overall of how friendships have to go through hardships and fights so that the people in them can get closer and bond. If you want an anime that'll be easy to watch, or something to get immersed in, try giving Punchline a try.",

            "content": "First of all, this anime ruined itself by trying to be echhi. Besides that it did a fair job at the story and was actually fairly clever at points. This is an example of a good story with decent characters and humor being ruined by the need to add unnecessary echhi humor. \r\nStory: It's decent, not necessarily new but it does it well even if it's rather slow around the first half. Has some very nice twists that it hints at during the show. The story would've been much better if they hadn't relied on the crappy nose-bleed echhi factor as it quickly became tiredand irritating, at least for me.\\n\\n\r\nArt: I have nothing to complain about here but then again there's nothing that stood out to me as well. Definitely liked that there was a lack of obvious CGI animation as that's my pet peeve with some recent anime.\\n\\n\r\nSound: Same with art, nothing to complain about, seemed well done.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: The characters were decently fleshed out, though Rabura was a bit bland (just my opinion though). By this point you may have noticed that I'm not particularly concerned about extensive reviews of a show as I usually get that out of the way while I'm watching it.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: I finished it in a single day so, yeah, it was enjoyable but I did find myself skipping five-second intervals every once in a while, so not a good sign. Would've enjoyed it more if it had taken itself more seriously.\\n\\n\r\n*Spoilers and ranting ahead* \\n\\n\r\nJust want to throw it out there, the ending is so good until after the death scene. They ruin the lasting feeling of sacrifice by making it seem almost arbitrary and just that it happened so whatever. If it had ended with just his sacrifice it wouldn't have been a perfect ending but it sure as hell would've been better and my ranking of the show would've been an 8 instead of a 9. Besides that they had good humor, I personally liked the cat porn joke. I did like the fact that they kind of led to Ito using the mecha by having her be really good at a game that the mecha's controls were pulled from. I hate the fact that they didn't take the story seriously. When a character dies you don't offer panties, that is in every aspect offensive, maybe not necessarily to the character but to me the viewer who is trying to take the damn ending seriously. That shit ruined the tempo of the ending and combined with all the other crappy choices made me dislike this anime. I liked aspects of this anime, which is why I'm not giving it a 3, but I would never recommend this.",

            "content": "I feel like a review for this particular anime is warranted because this is probably one of the only anime I have watched that started out bad and had one of the most surprisingly good outcomes overall. It's like watching a track runner trip at the start of a race but was able to get up and recover to have a respectable finish. \r\nIt is interesting to note that I had wanted to watch this anime when it was airing weekly because I loved the bright colorful art style but this was one that I ended up not starting because of bad press but comethe end of the season I had people saying that this anime was good and underrated so I had to see for myself why everyone felt the way they did. \\n\\n\r\nThe story starts in probably one of the most turn off ways that it could possibly start, a main male character turning into a ghost and literally threatens the world by exploding whenever he sees panties or opai  from the other four female main characters he lives in the same building with. If you had decided to drop the anime after the first three or so episodes I would not have blamed you but hear me out for a second. Once I reached the half way point of the show and beyond I started getting answers to questions that I didn't even know the show had any intention of answering and revealed plot twists that I didn't even think was possible with a show about a ghost boy trying to avoid panties and blowing up the world. Also the main kicker is this anime not only does a complete 180 with its story in terms of quality but it mostly justifies the ridiculous fanservice  plot line that made people drop the anime in the first place which is something very few anime had been able to accomplish (looks in Kill la Kills general direction).\\n\\n\r\nThe characters at first seem very one dimensional in terms of purpose but over time even the female characters that were thought to only serve as fanservise vessels begin to show their motivations and their troubles and I feel that it would be safe to say that not a single one of the characters is wasted. Even the main character who I expected to be just another generic pervert has got an incredibly unexpected amount of depth to him especially come the second half of the show. \\n\\n\r\nThe art and animation are really good. As stated previously that was main draw to the anime in the first place before I heard people had started dropping it. I am a big fan of bright and colorful art and the characters all have their distinct style. There are even some action scenes in this show which are pulled off pretty well. \\n\\n\r\nThe music of this show was pretty forgettable and or out there. The opening especially could have driven people away from watching the anime in the first place as the song wasn't that good and also the visuals accurately describe the major problem the show had when it first started. The only exception to this is the ending theme. The ending not only has a great song that I feel was overlooked at the time but the visuals more accurately describe the show as a whole in my opinion. The colorful cast of characters and their main characteristics as well as their fun natures show why this show is actually enjoyable. \\n\\n\r\nOverall this show isn't for everyone. Especially for people who can't handle fanservice at all. I feel like Kill la Kill is a perfect indicator of whether or not you will like this show in it's entirety considering it is much more well known and a more emphasized example of a show that justifies its fanservice. This anime is a short one so if you can handle the very rough start you will be rewarded with some very pleasant surprises. I am happy I gave the show a chance so give it a go and see if you feel the same way I do.",

This anime i would best describe using the word 'Wacky' but that would be expected from an anime where the plot says that \"humanity will be destroyed if he sees underwear\" or more accurately if he sees a girls underwear, he becomes so excited he becomes superhuman but if he see the underwear again inhis excited state.....\\n\\n\r\nJoin Yuta who lives at Korai House conveniently with 4 other hot girls(I knew that Ecchi tag wasn't just for show) but is now a spirit and he has to figure out how to save the world and get his body back all while being guided by our resident Yoda, who is a pervy ghost cat.\\n\\n\r\nThe anime, though it starts of as your typical ecchi harem, after about 5 episodes you'll realize this anime is more than meets the eye. All the weird and crazy occurrences all start to piece together towards the end. I feel sad for those who thought this is a cliche harem and called quits early on. You can expect the humor to be over-the-top sorta like kill la kill or Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann.\\n\\n\r\nIf you feel like watching something funny that is weird and wacky but at the same time not cliche like other ecchi harems and still has a complex storyline, this is a great pick.\\n\\n\r\n*This is obviously my opinion, if our opinions match...Great, I look forward to hearing your opinions as well as giving you more of mine, Otherwise we're obviously very different people*\\n\r\nThis also happens to be my first review, Woohoo! I finally wrote one",

Plot wise it is ridiculous and doesn't have much coherent consistencies. The saving grace, if you can even call it that, is the prepubescent boy's wet dream service.\r\nThe show has episodic nature presented in a chronological order with a little bits of clear time rewinds. The show's presentation of time-travel and character limelights weren't bad, but weak narrative direction took a big toll on the anime asa whole.\\n\\n\r\nThe very gamy nature of this show definitely makes it a downside rather than up by making the viewers feel like they are watching a bad stream of some game. As you progress you slowly learn more about each characters, their goals and motives as well as learning new powers for our main ghost character.\\n\\n\r\nOpening song with a beautifully choreographed animations and ending song with faded picture book story telling was unskippably well done.\\n\\n\r\nThe art direction was concise yet containing details when looked at closely, while the colour was vibrant yet conserved. Animation focused more on fight scenes but still easily managed to keep up above average on other segments.\\n\\n\r\nManglobe dared to tread the experimental road with Punch Line. But it didn't pay well as the weird gimmicky game feel doubled with an uninspiring narrative focus couldn't be saved with just animation and art alone.\\n\\n\r\nAs a disclosure I am bias as panty when it comes to superhero content.\\n\r\nShould you recommend Punch Line?

            "content": "If Abenobashi is ON drugs, then Punch Line IS drugs.\r\n...is what I'd like to say about this show, but I'm not sure I can set aside my conscience long enough to compare it to a rightfully respected and equally feared Spanish surrealist painter. In fact I don't know that it would be a compliment even if I did; after freebasing this series in the span of an evening, I can't say for sure if I was confused and mixed-up and slightly aroused but nonetheless enjoyed the ride, or if the dancing lights and strange revelations about my cat were just a distraction from the braincells I was losing.\\n\\n\r\nBut enough extending metaphors about purely hypothetical substance abuse no really I swear it's hypothetical you can't prove anything. Does Punch Line live up to the modest, yet dedicated hype it's already received from fans? ...Nah, not really. But it's pretty cool I guess.\\n\\n\r\nAlthough I don't normally believe in spoilers, this particular show is kinda process-heavy. So I think I'll keep plot details to a minimum and just do an off-the-cuff assessment. Maybe I'll come back later and fill in the rest after a re-watch. Would be thematically appropriate, for reasons I just told you why I can't explain.\\n\\n\r\nSo! What should you expect going into PANCHI RAIN? A clusterfuck, basically. Ghosts, robots, asteroids, superpowers, time travel, sex puns, the middle-aged dating scene, a high school drop-out who's amazing at Mechwarrior, a plot that folds over itself enough to make a pretzel blush, some REALLY, OSTENSIBLY WEIRD choices for sword-clanging sound effects that sound more like steel girders colliding...\\n\\n\r\nThe tricky thing when you're creating a mood-bending, genre-blending pastiche is not necessarily mixing chemicals that don't go together, or making a lot of different ideas conform to a single direction. You want to bring out the best in the things you're referencing\u2014rejoice in their differences\u2014or else it defeats the purpose. Comedy can exist with tragedy, sex appeal with drama, action with emotion; each one just needs its space to grow and flourish.\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately, much of Punch Line is these disparate elements stepping on each other's toes. A truly heart-felt moment is marred by a pointless panty shot; the impact of a fight scene is diluted by the absurdity of a skimpy teenager clobbering a fully-grown man with a titanium silly straw. These things try to work together to build up a satisfying climax (HEH), but often end up fighting each other instead, and the end result is that your intolerance for one may ruin the others.\\n\\n\r\nThat said, something made me want to keep watching. Maybe it was the super-fluid animation. Maybe it was the occasional, sudden gut punch of human interest when a surprisingly down-to-earth problem befell one of the cast. Maybe it was the sheer audacity of it all. But for every time I threw up my arms and said, \"Jesus Christ, are you SERIOUS?\" I still settled back down and clicked play again, anxious to see what happened next.\\n\\n\r\nSo yeah, it doesn't quite live up to its ambitions, but I've always believed it's better to fail gloriously than succeed blandly. Punch Line's not the hay-maker I was hoping it would be, but I'm certainly not gonna go back in time and stop myself from watching it.\\n\\n\r\n...Although if you (like me) were first introduced to the show through the gifset of Maika explaining that the skirt-chasing Yuuta is biologically female, and are now anticipating anime's first real foray into the trans narrative: Don't get your hopes up. The explanation is complete horseshit.",

            "content": "I am going to state this as simply as possible. When I review anime, a 7 is a 70% which means the anime was average but nothing special. I noticed most people would say that was worth a 5, or a 50%, but that is an F. If an anime didn't have any obvious flaws other than being nothing special, then I don't think it failed. So please read my reviews with this in mind. This is why most of my ratings seem on the high end. If I enjoyed it enough to finish it, it should be getting a C, not any lower.\r\nPunchline isan anime that took me a little by surprise. I will say that I was expecting a typical ecchi comedy with a little bit of super power stuff, but I got quite a bit more. Though the show did surprise me, it still wasn't really anything I could lose my mind about or give too much more than the 'entertaining and interesting' stamp, landing it around a seven, even though I was tempted to give it a little higher of a score.\\n\\n\r\nStory(7/10)\\n\r\nThe story is what surprised me. If this anime was what I expected, this could have easily been a 5 or lower, but the story actually had some work put into it. I will do my best to give you an idea spoiler free. Th story isn't entirely linear, it deals with time manipulation, and spirits, which was actually an interesting idea. There were also a good few twists in it as well. My only complaint is that a lot of these twists are simply unimportant, or don't really make sense. However, this story is a lot more dark and developed that I think anyone was expecting.\\n\\n\r\nArt(7/10)\\n\r\nThis is pretty much your typical anime art, and it is of the same quality as just about everything else made recently. It does have a slightly more toony look, but I don't think it stood out all that much. \\n\\n\r\nSound(6/10)\\n\r\nhis is pretty much the usual sound rating I give an anime, and this isn't much different. he sound was nice, but nothing really stood out. I ever felt lik 'wow, this soundtrack is so good.' Basically, the sound could be completely removed with little impact on the show.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter(7/10)\\n\r\nI enjoyed the characters, for the most part. There wasn't too much development, aside from the main character, but it wasn't all that bad.  liked the backstory given to some of them, it reminded me of Zankyou No Terror quite a bit. I think there could have been more work put into each character, but twelve episodes rarely allows for that kind of development.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment(8/10)\\n\r\nI can certainly say that Punchline is entertaining. It has some good comedy in there, an interesting plot, some fan service, and is just overall fun to watch. Though it is more serious than I expected, the show doesn't draw on you like many others do.\\n\\n\r\nSo, Punchline is a pretty average show, that took me by surprise. t had a pretty unique concept, but I don't think it was revolutionary or anything. So I recommend this to people who like comedy, twisted plots, or ecchi. I think this show is good on those three points, and it should be worth your time. I wouldn't recommend this is you like dark shows, if you are turned away by fan service, or if you want a lot of action. This show doesn't have really any action, and never gets too dark or serious.",

Although the viewer is left with a inkling of a doubt as to whether it is a forgery of Steins Gate or Madoka Magica, the anime makes up for it with the way the story plays out and wraps up beautifully in a meager 12 episodes. Although some of the ecchi was unnecessary / not funny, I believe it can be overlooked when it comes to a broader perspective.\r\nArt- Not much to bediscussed but I feel like the studios choice of art design fit well with the supernatural aspect of the show. Panties weren't unique.\\n\\n\r\nSound- 7, great choice of voice actors, kept getting nostalgic over the Familiar of Zero voice but the obnoxious screaming of the MC at times was off-putting.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter- 8, I thought that it was a nice mix of unique characters and although a lot of people believe that there was absolutely no character development in this anime, I truly believe that adding any more unnecessary twists and features to the plot would confuse the viewers into oblivion.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment- 3, Ending left a very sour taste in my mouth, it didn't make much sense on behalf of any standard human morals. Definitely a memorable anime so much so because of the way i was unsatisfied with the ending.",

What the hell kind of name is '27enemies' anyway?!\"\r\nMy only complaint about artwork is thesmall bit of 3d that's thrown in for what seems like no reason (but after watching Shirobako who knows the reason? :P). But the backgrounds are good, detailed but lacking enough to leave your attention where it should be. The main artwork is awesome. For an anime that has such a small setting, it is sooo diverse! Loved it!\\n\\n\r\nSound... Hmm... It was... good. I have no complaints but nor do I think Punch Line was a clear winner in this category. The voice acting was great but I guess the soundtrack was a little lacking...? Not alot to say here.\\n\\n\r\nHere is one of the stand outs... Character development... One season. A mere 12 episodes. And yet, what they manage to pack in, is amazing. Enough info to have you blaze the trail with the characters, but enough blanks to have you feel like only you can understand them.

From this description it does  not seem like much, which is what I thought as well.  But from here the crazy plot of Punchline unfolds. Almost anything else I say will delve in to spoiler, except onedetail, whenever Yuuta gets a nose bleed a comet hits earth.\\n\\n\r\nArt:7/10\\n\r\nPunchline has a very interesting style. It's very organic and rounded, but besides that it's nothing special. The characters are not particularly detailed besides their hair.  The small amount of action is also quite good, but is still nothing special.\\n\\n\r\nSound:9/10\\n\r\nAs I said in my Kekkai Sensen review, sound is my hardest part to review. Despite this I liked all of the music and VA's in Punchline. The opening is strange but very catchy. The VA's were all very enjoyable, especially Yuri Yoshida as Chiranouske and Haruka  Tomatsu as  Rabura. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter:9/10\\n\r\nAll of the 5 main characters, Yuuta, Meika, Ito, Mikatan, and Rabura were all great in their own way. Yuuta was a very funny character who proved he was more than  just a perv. Meika was a great leader/mother figure and helped everyone else. Ito(who is my new waifu) is a neet who opens up over  the show.  Mikatan proved to be more than just an idol. Rabura brought a lot to the single older woman trope. All of the main characters brought something to the trope they fit in to. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:10/10\\n\r\nI am not the biggest fan of Ecchi, in many respects I do not like it. Shows like Shimoneta and  Prison School are better than most Ecchi because they add something to it. Punchline does the same. It takes a pretty stupid concept,  and turned it into a truly great and heartwarming show. It also helps that there are 2 meganekkos. \\n\\n\r\nOverall:9/10\\n\r\nI would give this show a 10/10, but there is one major problem. The story is not finished. We did get a very nice conclusion, but there is still a lot to learn. This does seem a very trivial thing to lessen the score fun, but feeling unsatisfied with an ending is a really big problem. The ending is paramount after all.",

            "content": "Punch Line \r\nArt: I don\u2019t have very much to say on this topic other than the art style is pretty generic. While the animations are good and it\u2019s overall pleasing to look at, I found myself easily drawn away or distracted by other things. The main thing I did appreciate was the amount of detail that went in to some things, for example after Mikatan has been crying for what we would assume has been a long time, she actually has redness surrounding her eyes, and it stays like that for quite a while. It\u2019s those little things that really no one would really careabout if it wasn\u2019t there, but because it is there, it shows the amount of detail that went into making it. One of the main things that drives this show is Fan-Service. There is no way to hide that fact as one of the main plot points is that the main character, Yuta, goes berserk whenever he sees panties or anything suggestive, and in a house full of girls, it happens often. Whenever this happens early on in the show his nose will gush with blood, ill talk about this later, but this is a type of thing that I find just over-the-top and sometimes a bit annoying.\\n\\n\r\nMusic: So the songs in both the opening and closings are catchy, but I\u2019ll be honest, I did not feel any regrets just skipping past them, but from the opening animation, one could really get the gist of the entire show: kid sees panties and goes crazy while his nose gushes blood. This being said the music used in the show, while usually under the voices or the action is pretty solid and worth a listen because it really adds to the shows experience. While there was no real extra sound like I\u2019ve heard before, other than the occasional crash, that is something that I feel like if it was included the show would be quite a bit better. \\n\\n\r\nStory: In a word - Confusing. I had a hard time following this show and while everything seemed to pan out as time went on, after the first few episodes I was confused. Then, after episode 6, the plot made those first six episodes close to meaningless outside of episodes 7 and 8. The over usage of the bloody nose is something that I get is a cliche but when it is so exaggerated it makes the show feel like it\u2019s trying really hard to be funny when it really doesn\u2019t need to be. Yuta ends up being a disembodied spirit in the very first episode and as the show progresses he learns how to use this form better and better. He realizes that there is a terror group, the Qmay group, that is trying to use an asteroid to destroy humanity and breed a perfect world, So the show mostly consists of Yuta teaming us with the other people in his friend group that can go berserk like he can to stop this group from succeeding. At its core this show really is about \u2018superheros\u2019 working together to save the world.\\n\\n\r\nPersonal Reflection: So I want to point out that I am not really a fan of superhero things. Be it movies, TV shows, comics, whatever, I just don\u2019t really care for them. And while this stigma against these types of things may have factored into how I felt about this show, it doesn\u2019t change that I had to try and convince myself to come back to the show over doing other things. The overuse of fan-service is something that I thought was a little much, and I don\u2019t mind it at all, but because it was such a large part of the story, I found myself wondering \u201cwhy?\u201d I felt like there was a lot that could have been done well here and it just wasn\u2019t. And while near the end of the show I began to care more and more about this cast, by the time this happened the show was over. It was not a bad show by any means, but it isn\u2019t one that I plan on watching again anytime soon. What I really want to say with this is; watch out for fan-service in this zany superhero comedy/drama. \\n\\n\r\nOverall Rating: 7/10",

I should state that it first several episodes wouldn't stick you on your seat, but further into it you wouldn't mind the premise that has been set up at the start. I think the Author had the idea of catering the story to every kind of viewer which is saying combat, art, story, music and ecchi enthusiasts would love to watch, there isn't anything lacking in relevance tohow the story is plotted.",

            "content": "Punch Line\r\nI started watching this as a guilty pleasure. A guy who\u2019s sexual arousal destroys the world was a hilarious premise. And I enjoyed the show, really. It\u2019s pervy fanservice, without the need of inexplicable beams of light and oh so convenient steam clouds. So why didn\u2019t I enjoy it more? Two things: one is the fact that the comedy has to take a back seat in the final third of the series in order for the story to play out. I really hate that when that happens. The premise is ludicrous and silly, but the series takes a serious turn, because of the seriousstory they present. Like halfway through the original writer hit a wall and had to hire someone else to finish the story. But writer two didn\u2019t know it was a comedy.\\n\r\nSecond is more of a personal thing. It comes from being a fan of science and science fiction and is in two parts. First is the time travel paradox. I won\u2019t spoil anything here but let\u2019s just say either time IS absolute therefore no action one takes can affect the outcome; or time ISN\u2019T absolute therefore there cannot be dire consequences for effecting history.and Punch Line tries to have it both ways. Otherwise the show wouldn\u2019t make it to 12 episodes. The other part is according to Dr. Kaku, conservation mass says you\u2019d have to atomize an asteroid to prevent it from causing widespread destruction. Even if you reduced it to golfball sized pieces, there\u2019d be so many of them the would cause destruction over a vast area of the world.\\n\r\nNow I know the seems petty in a comedy, but as I stated earlier, the comedy takes a back seat in the last third, so I have to rate what they give me. Watch it, or don\u2019t; either way you\u2019ll be no better or worse for it.",

It goes too much into absurd at times, which is in contrast with the storyline, which is really linear in the end. Anyway, seeing how it ends it's really satisfying, almost every episode ends in a plot twist.\r\nDecent. The colors are pretty and the rooms of the house are pretty detailed. One thing i don't like is the character design, but that is just personal taste. Animation is not very fluid.\r\nThe openingis catchy af, the rest passes by.\\n\r\nI loved them by the end, they were all my little cuties friendies patooties pretty cuties. At the beginning they almost had 0 character traits and you knew nothing about them, BUT. As the plot progresses the characters progress with it. Very interesting thing that I haven't seen in othe animes.\\n\r\nThe difference between this anime and the others is one: it takes you by surprise. The peculiarity of it makes it original, and because of that i can't help but rate it 10.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 10\\n\\n\r\nsubscribe on youtube: talkshh",

This method of presenting the story was definitely not new but it was really well executed in this anime.\r\nThe ecchi present in the show was well used to serve the purpose of the story with just the right amount and placement of the ecchimoments to not make it feel annoying so i think that even people who don't like ecchi won't mind this show\\n\r\nThe show also provided some really good action scenes (last two episodes were extreme)\\n\\n\r\nCharacters (8/10):\\n\r\nI loved the way the show connected it's characters together in a way that served the plot without being forced. characters stories and histories were well written.\\n\r\nCharacter development was kind of tricky because of the nature of the show (can't explain this without spoilers) but at the same time the show presented different growth results of characters who had different upbringings which was nice.\\n\\n\r\nArt and Animation (9/10):\\n\r\nThe show had limited environment but what was shown was well drawn and colored.

            "content": "Punchline really surprised me, it started out with the empression that it was going to be a silly natured anime full of fan service. As the season progresses, so does the seriousness of the plot, and the situation that the MC is in. \r\nStory - So we have our MC Yuta, he finds himself in the middle of a bus hijacking where a pink haired girl named Strange Juice is able to subdue all, but one of the assailants. The leader, an unnamed white haired guy, of the group who attacked the bus, prepares to shoot Strange Juice. He is stopped by Yuta, who hadsomehow powered up after seeing his neighbours Rabura's panties. Yuta tackles him out of the bus and into the sea below the highway, while falling the white haired guy happily says something to yuta which is quieted out. He wakes up on the shore with Strange Juice, but ends up unconscious again after seeing her panties, suddenly a beam of light comes from the sky and hits Yuta and he is thrown out of his body. Yuta wakes up in his dormitory and finds that he has become a spirit with only a talking cat, Chiranosuke, to guide and help him. \\n\\n\r\nThroughout the season, Yuta learns that an impending disater is going to hit Earth in the future, and the only way he can change that future is by trying to affect current events to ensure that devastating future doesn't happen. He also remembers the events surrounding his childhood, and his two friends at the time Chiyoko and Guriko.  \\n\\n\r\nArt & Sound - Overall art is fine, no complaints or anything worth mentioning. The OP is catchy, and ED is decent, and the insert song in EP 12 fits the moment perfectly. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter - I enjoyed Yuta as a MC, I felt the anime allows the viewer to follow him along with the events as well as learn of his past, and how he has ended up where he is. Yuta has the power to uber-fy, which allows him to push his body further giving him extra strength and speed. \\n\\n\r\nWe also have Mikatan, Ito, Meika, and Rabura, these are the 4 neighbours of Yuta. \\n\\n\r\nMikatan - She is the hero Strange Juice who stopped the gang involved in the bus hijacking, she is a good natured girl and loves to playing with her friends. She has links to Yuta's childhood and just like Yuta has the ability to uber-fy, although her body suffers as a result of using it, this means she has to take medication. \\n\\n\r\nIto - She is a NEET and prefers to stay in her room playing video games (don't we all?) she has a pet bear name Muhi who seems to be the target of an evil group called the Q-may group who are intent on allowing the disater, that is going to strike earth in the future, to happen. \\n\\n\r\nMeika - She is a robot who is the landlay of the dormitory, she is brilliant at hacking which plays a part latter in the season. She also helps Mikatan with her Strange Juice persona. \\n\\n\r\nRabura - She is an exorcist although she doesn't believe in spirits. She can be temporarily possessed by Yuta's spirit when there is cinnamon ( Cinnamons hightens spiritual powers) in the area.\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - I enjoyed Punchline while it starts out as ok, it does gets better as the season goes on, what really made this good in my opinion, is how light-hearted everything is from the fan service, to the fights, and even the ending was very light given the circumstance. The anime also does well to not go with the most obvious ending. \\n\\n\\n",
