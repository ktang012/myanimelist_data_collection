            "content": "For all the uninspired rubbish that each season seems to be permeated by, Space Dandy represents a glimmer of hope. It may not have a great story or well-developed characters, and while the excessive fanservice can feel a bit immature, it is one of very few anime that dare to be different from the usual harem or action series. It also happens to be a whole load of fun... provided you don't mind seeing T&A every sixty seconds. \r\nSpace Dandy is perhaps most recognisable for being Shinichiro Watanabe's most recent project. There is a noticeable Cowboy Bebop influence here, but at the same time itfeels like the antithesis of what Bebop represents. Space Dandy is all sorts silly and zany. There never seems to be a moment where the show takes itself seriously, and even when it appears to, there is usually some joke waiting at the end. There are no deep messages to be extracted from the episodes. It never aims to be anything more than simple fun-- and it works for that very reason. \\n\\n\r\nThe story follows the adventures of space greaser Dandy, a cat-like creature named... 'Meow', and the ship's cleaning robot, QT. The three spend their days lazing about while occasionally hunting for rare aliens to fetch them a nice price on market. They are incredibly inept at their job, lacking in any form of intelligence, and everything, always, goes terribly wrong in some way or another.\\n\\n\r\nSpace Dandy follows an episodic format, although I don't believe the term is entirely appropriate as 'episodic' implies continuity in some form. There is absolutely no continuity in Space Dandy. Zero. The main characters might die at the end of an episode and then it will casually roll the credits before showing them alive and healthy in the next episode. The character development is essentially nil as a result. Dandy and the rest aren't characters that you will ever find yourself emotionally attached to, but that's actually okay. Focusing solely on the comedy is what allows it to work. Drama would never be able to exist in the bizarre world of Space Dandy- at least not without seeming entirely out-of-place. Even deus ex machina (and they are aplenty) are intentionally used for comedic purposes. The show just doesn't give a damn about being taken seriously.  \\n\\n\r\nEverything about Space Dandy oozes charm. The setting is reminiscent of a 1950's vision of the future, with ray guns, greaser slang and antiquated technology. The episodes themselves deal with every prominent sci-fi trope (time loops, wormholes, zombies, sentient AI) in a fun manner. There is always something different each episode, though some are certainly much weaker than others. A few of them are honestly dull enough to put the viewer to sleep, while others, like the episode involving Meow's family, are nothing short of greatness. There's unfortunately no consistency to the quality of the episodes- an issue that seems to be common in episodic comedies. \\n\\n\r\nThe shameless fanservice is the show's one major flaw. There's nothing wrong with an adult character having an interest in women (or more specifically, boobs), but Dandy's obsession verges from perversion to outright debauchery. An equivalent to Hooters, named \"Boobies\" in the show (really!) is frequently present. Boobies this, Boobies that. Dandy's entire reason for existence is to go to Boobies and ogle all the big-breasted blondes that walk about. Every time he visits, there are close-up cleavage or ass-shots of the girls. When he is not there, he hits on every female in sight; human or alien, it doesn't matter to him. There is no problem with shows that are mature enough to embrace sexuality as a normal part of human nature, but this maturity is nowhere to be seen in Space Dandy. Its obsession with women resembles a starving 12-year-old who just reached puberty rather than something of a grown adult. The fanservice has its place, but there is no reason for it to exist to this extent. It's just uncomfortable. \\n\\n\r\nSpace Dandy has some of the best art seen in a television anime for years. The first episode looks absolutely stellar, on-par with big-budget series such as Shingeki no Kyojin and not too far behind films such as Redline. The animation does take a dip in the later episodes but its quality always remains well above the average anime. Space Dandy gives a great deal of attention to its action scenes by animating them in full. Most anime studios decide to take the shortcut approach with panning shots (or just plain bad animation), which makes Space Dandy's visuals all the more commendable. The animators could have taken the lazy way out, but they did not. \\n\\n\r\nThe sound is average; nothing noteworthy. Most scenes are accompanied by ambient sounds in order to convey a distinct sci-fi atmosphere. A few scenes, like the battle between QT and a giant robot, and Dandy taking care of an alien child, have more noticeable music, but these moments are all too rare. The opening track is much more interesting, performed by what I would describe as \"Japanese Bloc Party\". It encapsulates the quirky charm of the series. \\n\\n\r\nIf you have ever found yourself bored by the homogeneity of the anime industry, or simply want to watch something fun and silly, Space Dandy is an anime definitely deserving of your time. There's an undeniable sense of childishness to the fanservice, and sure, not every episode is a massive joy to watch, but there is rarely a moment that makes you wish you were watching something else instead. It dared to be different and it succeeded. If only more anime took from Space Dandy's example.",

            "content": "You don\u2019t understand how badly I want to like Space Dandy. The fantastic visuals, Dandy as a character, some of the great ideas that go into the episodes\u2026there\u2019s so much going on that could make for great entertainment\u2026\r\nBut instead, Space Dandy has one good episode and is mired by tons of flat humor,  a whole load of boring to bad episodes, and overusing Boobies as a humor device.\r\nPros\r\n1.) Great Animation and Soundtrack- Seriously, Space Dandy looks sexy as hell. From the retro character designs to the whacky aliens to the trippy worlds, Space Dandy is a great acid trip. Many episodes have a uniquestyle from the others. The plant episode and the library episode did a good job of providing a unique enough experience to be memorable as far as the animation is concerned, though flat lined in every other department. The soundtrack is also brilliant, with tons of the flair and flavor we can expect from the people who brought us Bebop and Samurai Champloo.\\n\\n\r\n2.) Some Good Ideas- Some of the episodes contained good ideas that weren\u2019t capitalized on, or would have been awesome if they were fleshed out. Space Dandy is definitely smart somewhere, but the execution is so poor and the episodes so devoid of any of the humor or entertainment that it is supposed to provide. The references to classic sci-fi tropes and movies are great nods to the classics Dandy attempts to emulate, and those occasionally provide humor, but, for the most part, episodes as a whole fall apart.\\n\\n\r\n3.) That One Good Episode- The only good episode in the series is the one that makes fun of Disney\u2019s copyright laws and also has one of the best space races I\u2019ve ever seen. This is episode seven; an episode that I will think of anytime anyone mentions Space Dandy. It\u2019s a fantastic episode. Watch it and avoid the rest. The rest sucks.\\n\\n\r\nCons\\n\r\n1.) Uninteresting and Unfunny Characters- The first episode Dandy is a pretty cool character and you think, \u201cDamn, they\u2019re gonna do some awesome things with him\u201d. But they never do. His character is as stagnant as the rest of the series and he\u2019s never particularly funny. Most of the jokes surrounding him are way too juvenile and overused to elicit even a chuckle. Boobies was funny the first time, but by the twelfth episode, it\u2019s downright annoying. And this lack of comedy can be found in QT, whose autotuned voice makes sense, but isn\u2019t a great design choice in the long run. Meow is also uninteresting as a character.\\n\\n\r\nAnd then there\u2019s a bad guy, Commodore Perry, who chases them around for some reason or other. The character\u2019s just don\u2019t provide anything worth mentioning to the table.\\n\\n\r\n2.) Decent Enough Plot to Work With, Uninteresting Execution- You see me use the word \u201cuninteresting\u201d a lot because that about sums up Space Dandy. The setup, Dandy is searching for never before seen aliens in order to obtain a bounty, is pretty cool. But the execution is so boring. He goes to a planet where two aliens fight over the ultimate clothing. He returns a lost library book. There\u2019s an alien that shape shifts, there\u2019s a plant planet. The animation and style for every one of these episodes is fantastic and the still shots are goddam beautiful but I can\u2019t watch a comedy anime for its formalism. And maybe if this anime were not a comedy I would rate it higher, but that\u2019s what it wants to be, and that\u2019s what I\u2019ll treat it as.\\n\\n\r\n3.) So Much Wasted Potential, Baby- What I ultimately hate this anime for is wasting so much potential. I can\u2019t emphasize enough the amount of good ideas that went into Space Dandy that are wasted by poor writing, directing, and characters. I can see where this could be funny, and it does provide the occasional chuckle, but it\u2019s so much better taken as abstract sci-fi than a comedy. Maybe if you were high this show would work, but as it stands, Space Dandy is just poor.\\n\\n\r\nOverall\\n\r\nSigh. Space Dandy, Space Dandy, Space Dandy. Wasted potential central. It feels so much like Kids on the Slope, another anime made by director Shinichiro Watanabe. It is set up so well, but fails in every way except animation and music. After Cowboy Bebop, I think Watanabe decided to go style over substance, which tends not to work for me, especially in a comedy series. As I said, if this had been a formalistic sci-fi anime (with occasional comedy elements), it would have worked better. But as a comedy, it fails miserably. It\u2019s unfunny, has terrible characters, and is begging for a better team to handle it.\\n\\n\r\nWatch episode seven. But pass up the rest.",

            "content": "Space Dandy has been described as a sort of testing ground for directors - a large number of different directors, most of whom are accomplished, have been called in to create their own episodes utilizing the flexible setting of the show, resulting in Space Dandy being the most creative show I have seen at its peaks. Unfourtunately, in every experiment there is bound to be a few failures, and this is undoubtedly not a very consistent series.\r\nBeing a very experimental anime, each episode (this is an episodic anime in case you weren't clear) is unique and quirky, but each and every one of them havea common factor - they are amazing fun. Comedy is the main point of Space Dandy, and it has been handled exteremely well throughout the series. This might not seem to be the case at first (the show opens with boob jokes), but some of the jokes here are really unique, and the delivery is often top notch. I will not go into much detail in order to avoid spoilers, but in my opinion the first few episodes really aren't that good and in my opinion the weakest point of the series, so if you find yourself not liking the show much I urge you to continue to give it a chance - it is definitely worth it.\\n\\n\r\nA very common complain with the show is its lack of an overall plot. I personally don't find any problem with this, and think that some of the greatest shows have been like that. (Mushishi being my best example) Whilst there have been hints that there is something bigger at play, whether it will evolve into something is not certain. So if you are one of those who doesn't like shows which don't have a strong overall plot, this might not be the show for you.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are, simply put, outstanding. Whilst Dandy might seem annoying at first with all of his boob jokes and stuff like that, he is undoubtedly a character that will simply win you over throughout the course of the series with his over the top, contagious stupidity and antics. There is also sufficient development in the series despite it simply being episodic, and it weaves the backstories of the characters very well into its episodes. Meow's (episode 10) was done particularly well in my opinion. And QT is simply hilarious.\\n\\n\r\nThe visuals pretty good, and certain episodes do take on certain different (wierd) art styles. I think that they are used pretty well and I love how they are used to tell the story. Episode 11 springs to mind as one which used a very interesting art style to tell a even more interesting story, and I think the show is capable of utilizing creative visuals at times to help reinforce the plot.\\n\\n\r\nAmazing OP and ED, fitting use of music in scenes. I have little experience in music so I won't comment much on it, but I felt that the overall usage of sound was very effective in my viewing of the anime. Loved the voice acting (note that I am watching the jap version of the show so I don't know how the dub sounds) and feel that it fits perfectly to every character.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Space Dandy is hilarious, amazing, and overall a great pleasure to watch. It does start off with some weak episodes, but when it gets going, the stories are simply some of the best. Looking forward to when it returns after the break (its split cour!), and hopefully it continues to pump out these amazing episodes, and maybe even connect the dots and reveal that an overall plot (Not really neccessary, but I think it would be cool!) Highly recommended by me, with an overall score of 9/10.",

            "content": "I remember when I reached the end of the 3rd episode of Space Dandy. I was fairly pleased with the show. It was the kind of enjoyable humor that you can sit back, watch and turn your brain off for a half hour as you watch the antics of Space Dandy and his brave space crew...in space.\r\nOnce I watched the 4th episode \"Sometime you can't live with dying, baby\" that I knew I was in for something different. A majority of the episode was about the crew after they became zombies and the story was progressed via narration. While it wasn't the same goofy humorthat I had loved about the first 3 episodes it was still pretty funny, but what I really appreciated was how the creators were willing to try something different.\\n\\n\r\nThe desire to challenge the status quo set the standard for the following nine episodes. Not content to just throw out something we had seen before, Space Dandy challenged the anime comedy genre with solid characters, a fun soundtrack, fantastic art direction, and a vast array of episodes that ranged from hilariously nonsensical (A Race in Space Is Dangerous, Baby and Nobody Knows the Chameleon Alien, Baby) to character dramas reminiscent of director Shinichiro Watanabe's earlier show Cowboy Bebop (A Merry Companion Is a Wagon in Space, Baby and Even Vacuum Cleaners Fall in Love, Baby) to beautifully artistic (Plants Are Living Things, Too, Baby and I'm Never Remembering You, Baby).\\n\\n\r\nI was always excited to watch the next episode to see what new and exciting thing the creators would attempt to do in the show. Granted, there were several episodes that ended up being rather lackluster, but you certainly can't fault the creators for trying. However, the low points are few and far between when compared to the high quality of the rest of the series. All in all I would highly recommend Space Dandy to any anime fan.",

            "content": "Cowboy Bebop was a very important series for me as an anime fan. When it first appeared on American television with the birth of Cartoon Network's Adult Swim programming block I quickly fell in love. I had enjoyed a number of anime prior to that, but it really did prove to me how evocative and thoroughly entertaining the medium could be. I'd generally credit it with being the singular show that lead me to wanting to seek out other anime on my own in hopes of finding shows just as good or better than it--something I've only successfully done a handful of times even now.It remains a masterful work and deserves every bit of the legacy it holds to this day. \\n\\n\r\nSo, naturally, the people involved in the creative process for Cowboy Bebop are people I would want to follow closely. As it were, the director of the show would release another TV anime a few years later, Samurai Champloo, that while not as good, definitely revealed this man, Shinichiro Watanabe as a leading auteur in the world of anime. That following this he was effectively quiet for a decade, save for some work on OVAs and doing the music for a few things was kind of a shame. He returned to the world of TV animation in 2012 with Kids on the Slope, a series which despite having his name attached I could not work up much of an interest to watch. Two years later, however, we find Watanabe roaming the galaxy once more with another new TV anime, Space Dandy.\\n\\n\r\nTruth be told, Space Dandy was not an easy sell on me either. As much as I loved Cowboy Bebop, I just did not expect much from it. I didn't see anything in the art and character designs that demanded I give it my attention, and with the goofy name and premise I was quick to assume it was something I would be safe to dismiss outright. It wasn't actually until just a week before the end that word of mouth caught up to me and I decided to finally give it a look. Having done so, I'm glad. While this is not Watanabe returning to his Cowboy Bebop form, what it is is a very entertaining and surprisingly rewarding little anime that is well worth a look.\\n\\n\r\nIn all fairness, it's not entirely a Shinichiro Watanabe project in the same sense as Bebop or Champloo was. He is the chief, general director and the auteur who's fingerprints are undeniably all over it, yes, but lots of different directors are brought in to direct different episodes. The same is true of the writers; the series does not have a single main writer working on the composition but instead a number of writers all supplying different episodes. Naturally this leads to inconsistencies from episode to episode, but Space Dandy is built to make it work. Whereas in most series having so many different hands guide the characters in different ways might make for a muddled mess, Space Dandy really embraces an episodic nature, much like Cowboy Bebop, save with even less need for the episodes to follow one another logically.\\n\\n\r\nWith its spacey premise and episodic nature along with Watanabe's touch, it's actually very tempting to call Space Dandy something of a goofy younger sibling to Cowboy Bebop, though the goofiness really needs to be stressed. Cowboy Bebop had a lot of humor and some pretty goofy episodes too, but with Space Dandy silliness is front and center and fairly unrelenting. You might assume that so much wackiness without any weight behind it would get overbearing at times, and you'd probably be a little right. There are moments where the show seems to chug along from one joke to the next and it's all a little obvious really. Still, if you ask me, there is enough that is legitimately funny here to make it worth your time. \\n\\n\r\nReally though, the show is almost more impressive when it sets the goofiness aside just a little and tries to be more earnest. I suppose that while in Cowboy Bebop, some of the most memorable standout episodes were some of the more humorous and whimsical ones, in Space Dandy, it follows that the memorable stuff would be the ones that focus more on mature and genuine character development. Episode five, written by Code Geass' Ichiro Okouchi, was probably the strongest in my opinion, developing Dandy's character in a positive way in 20 minutes than the rest of the series was interested in doing through its entire run. Episode 10, from the series' most regular writer, Kimiko Ueno nearly has the same effect with Meow's character. It could probably honestly have used more episodes that take themselves seriously. Oftentimes all the focus on humor and silliness just makes the lesser episodes feel like diverting filler. The best episodes just overshadow the rest, and make Space Dandy look overall kind of lazy. I'm not sure it's an entirely fair comparison, but Kill la Kill did just prove that an anime can successfully manage a thoroughly ridiculous, over the top and comedic tone and also have strong character development and an engaging core story line. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters themselves are all right, I suppose, though those important character development episodes help to make you care about them beyond their function. It's really important for the main character Dandy, who appears as a rather useless, thickheaded, perverted simpleton that he gets the most moments to redeem him or else the show would just come undone. His two sidekicks, cat alien Meow and robot QT probably could have used some more early character development episodes to make us care about them though. It's kind of strange that the first episode we get trying to develop QT's character in a real way beyond just the useful robot assistant is what caps off the first season. The three of them are enjoyable enough in their antics though, I suppose. It could maybe use more of a supporting cast; most characters that are encountered appear for just an episode.  Exceptions come in the form of waitress Honey and alien inspector Scarlett, two very different women who Dandy regularly is made to visit, though who are yet to really serve much purpose outside of their roles; neither really makes up for the series' lack of a major female protagonist. There is also a chief antagonist in the form of the ape like mad scientist Dr. Gel and his boss Admiral Perry, who appear frequently in the show to generate deus ex machinas or somehow manage to end up looking even more foolish than the unwitting Dandy and his crew.It probably could have done more to establish these villains, their place in the story and what level of threat they actually pose by this point in things. As it is, it's hard to know what to really make of them most of the time.\\n\\n\r\nWhile the plotting is inconsistent and the cast could be stronger, where Space Dandy shines brightest is in it's exquisite production. Studio Bones is fairly known for good work and this is one of their best looking anime yet. It's regularly quite striking, with perfectly smooth animation and gorgeous art. Some episodes, such as episode nine with its psychedelic trip through a bizarre plant world are a complete visual delight. Clearly no expense was spared in making this anime look as good as it could. Sound is great too. Watanabe is a master of making bold musical choices in his anime, and it's the sort of soundtrack we'd expect from him. The opening and ending themes are both really catching and memorable, and there are a lot of cool tracks scattered elsewhere throughout.\\n\\n\r\nUltimately, it's probably the flawless production that allows me to still call Space Dandy a pretty great anime despite some of its more obvious problems and juvenile tendencies. If you want deep and engaging, you're looking at the wrong show, but if you want a fun time, you could do a lot worse than Space Dandy. It is at this point essentially half finished, it's two cours having been split by the spring anime season, but what I've seen thus far is enough to leave me optimistic about what the rest might hold.

            "content": "(With minimal spoilers!)\r\nI had the fun of watching Space Dandy, it was something definitely worthwhile to watch in many ways. It was to say the least... distinct. It felt very fresh to watch something so diverse and\u2026 silly. I guess(?), that would be the best way to describe the tone of this show. It doesn\u2019t really to take itself too seriously, while at the same time I still looked forward to seeing this show every Saturday night. I feel. I know you will enjoy this show for the same reasons I did.\r\nStory \u2013 8\r\nThe story of space dandy is not in any way complex ordeep. It can be summed up in one sentence: Space Dandy and his crew are alien hunters, who hunt aliens through space for money. That\u2019s basically it, but where it really excels is its execution. \\n\r\nFrom the sarcastic narrator, to the pure silliness of the characters, to the many visual gags. This is where this shows excels. It takes the liberty to take the pressure off of themselves and the viewer to deliver something really deep and complex with a lot of symbolism. They simply let you sit back and just watch. Not to say that it\u2019s completely mindless, there are many references to many other things, like western culture, Japanese culture, anime, etc. \\n\r\nWhich is how the main premise of this show comes about. It\u2019s about mocking anime\u2019s nuances/traits: tropes, storylines, characters, animation, plot devices, fan service, and (holy shit) the deus ex machinas. It does it all in a very humorous, silly way; it does it in such a way that it\u2019s almost ridiculous. *Spoiler* For example, even though it\u2019s an episodic series, it makes no logical sense for dandy to die at the beginning of the series. *Spoiler*\\n\\n\r\nAnimation \u2013 9\\n\r\nBones did an amazing job with the animation, and the styles fit every episode perfectly. Mostly because things where designed that way\u2026 Throughout the series, they are constantly changing styles to fit the mood and plot. \\n\r\nThis is again where the parodying comes in, they use a similar style as too what they are trying to mock. Everything from Westerns to Suzumiya Haruhi, from Pacific Rim to vague-anime-you\u2019ve-never-heard-of, is up for grabs for these guys. They did well with mocking each one perfectly, while still maintaining their own style and quality.\\n\\n\r\nSound \u2013 8.5\\n\r\n(Just a note I watched the Dubbed version, but I have heard the Japanese OP and ED)\\n\r\nThe sound was on par with everything. The first OP and ED, are amazing (I also love jazz music). They fit very well with the 90's, tripy-funk, space-adventure feel, the show has to it. It would be honestly something I would listen to everyday, and I don\u2019t listen to anime music in my free time. The OST was something I didn\u2019t notice for some episodes, but when I did notice it fit very well. *Spoiler* Except for episode 11, which completely sets the mood, and was perfect. It had the same mood as Kenji Yamamoto. *Spoiler*\\n\\n\r\nCharacters \u2013 7.5\\n\r\nThe voice actors for each of the characters were perfect. I could not imagine a single character being performed by anyone else. Each of the small nuances and personalities of the characters were spot on, and brought them to life.\\n\r\nDuring the series, they took a little time for the development of the characters, but not very much. But because of the nature of the show, and it being focused \u201call\u201d on dandy that would have felt somewhat weird. So it is passable, barely. The characters were pretty life like because they were each unique and had their own quirks. The narrator also  strangely adds to the cast, with his own personality.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment \u2013 9\\n\r\nI definitely enjoyed Space Dandy, it was simple and yet achieves exactly what\u2019s trying to do. It tries to be more relevant to western audiences, because of the jokes and overall silliness of the show. Which is why I think I enjoyed it so much, because the humor was so natural and fit so well.\\n\r\nOne thing to add, is the narrator who comes in at completely unnecessary times was hilarious.\\n\\n\r\nOverall \u2013 8.4/10\\n\r\nIt is definitely a show worth watching in many ways, and if not for anything else it\u2019s funny and completely smooth at it. After seeing a bunch of shows this season that were very sub-par. This show is definitely the best show of MY season. This show has great production values, the characters are silly but lovable, the soundtrack was very good, and it is flat out hilarious in both: the way it mocks anime and also by itself. As a stand-alone work, Space Dandy does lack, but where it achieves in its inclusion of many cultures and Anime into its own, making it something not unique but something that is distinct in its own way.\\n\r\nExcited for the second season this July!\\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\r\nFeel free to leave some constructive Criticism, by either a pm or comment!

            "content": "Have you ever done something special in your life? Perhaps it was something small and trivial like spinning a basketball on your fingertip or getting a Helpful vote for a review on this site. Maybe it was something that you will forever remember, like winning a video game tournament or having sex for the first time. Whatever the case, if you had done something special, did you try to re-create the magic, to reach those dizzying heights once more? Most people ho manage to do something extraordinary attempt doing it again and they either fail or end up settling for a vague imitation of whatthey\u2019ve done. Shinichiro Watanabe, the most famous anime director not named Hayao Miyazaki, once achieved something special in Cowboy Bebop, for which he was endlessly praised. Bebop, Watanabe\u2019s first project, established a ridiculously high standard that he would have to reach with his other works. Throughout his decorated career, Watanabe spearheaded a multitude of anime series, all receiving solid recommendations but none achieved the all-around excellence, the \u201csomething-for-everyone\u201d magic, of Cowboy Bebop. Realizing that his efforts to create something original wouldn\u2019t be good enough anymore, Watanabe decided to return to his roots and craft another intergalactic space opera of bounty hunters, christening it \u201cSpace Dandy\u201d. \\n\\n\r\n\tFrom the get-go, you can easily spot the similarities between Dandy and Bebop. For one, the wulong is the widely accepted currency in both series. Another, less obvious, hint is that the contaminated fridge from Cowboy Bebop\u2019s Session 11 makes a cameo in episode 8 of Space Dandy. It\u2019s obvious that Space Dandy is set in the same universe as Bebop but these two shows are so fundamentally different. What made Cowboy Bebop special, among other things, was its talent for world-building, how the setting was carefully crafted to perfection. The thing about Bebop\u2019s universe was that although it was set in the future, it was still grounded in reality whereas the world of Dandy is so expansive and discombobulated that the feeling of continuity is gone. Then, there are the characters\u2026\\n\\n\r\n\tMore than anything else, Cowboy Bebop was a show about people. From the cooler-than-cool protagonist Spike Spiegel down to the side-note trio of old men, this series portrayed its cast with painstaking amounts of emotion and depth that every character registered as realistic. With Space Dandy, however, the effort just isn\u2019t there. Dandy (voiced by Ian Sinclair) is the titular character of the show; his overzealous speeches, hair-brained schemes, and memorable one-liners craftily cover up Dandy\u2019s lack of dimensions and character development. Dandy\u2019s sidekicks QT the vacuum cleaner and Meow the cat are barely worth mentioning. In a show chock-full of bizarre characters, in appearance and/or personality, it\u2019s more than a tad frustrating that the only intriguing one (excluding Dandy) is the narrator (voiced by R. Bruce Elliot). Space Dandy\u2019s narrator, in essence, is simply a bored viewer like the rest of us. He sometimes falls asleep. He gets aroused during fan-service moments. He occasionally forgets important elements of the show. He even yells at the characters when he\u2019s irritated.\\n\\n\r\nI too get upset at Space Dandy from time to time.\\n\\n\r\n\tWhy? It\u2019s because this show is afraid. It\u2019s afraid to venture outside the norm. It\u2019s afraid to take risks. It\u2019s afraid to attempt something groundbreaking. Instead, Space Dandy settles for doing what\u2019s already been done before, albeit with a distinctive deviation. Don\u2019t think so? Well, listen to what the ever-quotable Dandy has to say:\\n\\n\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t fight it. Going against the flow means you\u2019re swimming in place. One day, you\u2019re too tired to paddle and then suddenly you drown. Whole thing was pointless and now you\u2019re dead. The end. No, going with the flow is where it\u2019s at and that\u2019s (cue dramatic pause) the Dandy Way to live,\u201d \u2013 from episode 1\\n\\n\r\nIronic, huh?\\n\\n\r\n\tSpace Dandy\u2019s animation is, without a doubt, the crown jewel of this series. It\u2019s mercurial (in a good way). It\u2019s stunning. It\u2019s abstract. It\u2019s stylish. It\u2019s absolute eye candy. And yet, this show\u2019s beautiful, beautiful surface does little to conceal its incredibly bland humor (I laughed exactly twice in this season) and scarcity of dramatic appeal (When your MC dies in episode 1, inexplicably resurrects in episode 2, and forgets about episode 1, there\u2019s no reason to sympathize with anyone in life-threatening situations). By the way, Cowboy Bebop possessed ample amounts of humor and drama.\\n\\n\r\n\tThe finale to Space Dandy\u2019s season one failed to redeem this series but it was most certainly impressive. What began as an intriguing and heartwarming tale of romance evolved into a high-stakes showdown between a pissed-off army of machines ready to destroy mankind and a lone vacuum cleaner (QT) willing to save it (Oh, and there\u2019s a really cool cameo from Brandon Potter, who\u2019s among my favorite VAs ever). It was episode 13 that caused me to appreciate the most outstanding qualities of Space Dandy. The amusing previews do a fantastic job at maintaining the viewers\u2019 interest. As mentioned, Space Dandy presents what\u2019s been done before with a unique twist to it (Its portrayal of time loops and shape shifters are especially enjoyable). Every now and then, the show includes some magnificent moments, unforgettable scenes that truly capture the imagination, like the surfboard sequence at the end of episode 6. With Space Dandy, I finally feel as though Shinichiro Watanabe has stopped aiming for the next Cowboy Bebop and simply wanted to let loose with this project, and the result has been quite entertaining to watch.\\n\\n\r\nHere\u2019s to Season Two, Baby!\\n",

            "content": "For me at least, it\u2019s rather hard to find a anime comedy that isn't a romantic comedy or full of referential humor I likely won\u2019t get. So seeing stuff like Space Dandy is truly a breath of fresh air, even if it's more in the vein of a western cartoon (though this show is much better than some of the stuff you\u2019ll see in Adult Swim).\r\nStory and Characters (6/10):\r\nSpace Dandy is a rather odd one to review. Being a bit similar to western cartoons in that there is no continuity whatsoever, this can lead to some comedy gold though at the same time lead tosome forgettable episodes. Each of the episodes seem to have their own story with no relation to one another, so rather than review the show as a whole, I\u2019ll review each episode briefly and individually to show the good, the bad, and the Dandy. Besides the first episode, you can watch any of the episodes in any order.\\n\\n\r\nLive With the Flow, Baby (2/5)- The start of the episode was trying a bit too hard at being self-aware. More of an introductory episode so at least see this for some exposition and how the characters meet. Not really that funny and the ending is rather abrupt, and not in a good way.\\n\\n\r\nThe Search For the Phantom Space Ramen, Baby (3/5)- That ending to the first episode\u2026 just forget about it, this shows the obvious lack on continuity. However, this episode is definitely more creative than the first. Not much comedy in this one, although the story of the alien is a decent, touching tale. Scarlett is introduced, although she\u2019s basically the serious tsundere character of the series and not much more.\\n\\n\r\nOccasionally Even the Deceiver is Deceived, Baby (3/5)- Not much to say on this one. A lot of the laughs come from an impending plot twist, which was pretty funny. So people, Is It Wrong to Try to Pick Up Girls in a Empty Planet? Yes.\\n\\n\r\nSometimes You Can\u2019t Live With Dying, Baby (4.5/5)- This was when I knew Space Dandy could be something truly special. It starts off as the usual tired Zombie episode. But, the second half, my goodness. So much irony, so much creative gags, and so much you can do with life insurance. This the best comedy episode of the season.\\n\\n\r\nA Merry Companion Is a Wagon in Space, Baby (3.5/5)- This is the episode that Space Dandy proved it can be taken seriously. There isn\u2019t much gags, but this episode is more of a feel good episode so that can be excused. Adelie is an interesting character, but due to the status quo nature of the series, we won\u2019t be seeing her after this which is a shame since if you've seen Cowboy Bebop, she could have been the Edward of the Series.\\n\\n\r\nThe War of the Undies and Vests, Baby (2.5/5)- Meh, not really a memorable episode. I mean Underwear people versus Vest people? I usually don\u2019t enjoy argument episodes (remember \"The Great Divide\" from Last Airbender, well that was a travesty), and the same holds true here. While the history of the war is amusing, the only gag I laughed at was with our unlucky baddie, Dr. Gel.\\n\\n\r\nA Race in Space Is Dangerous, Baby (3.5/5)- Being a parody of classic racing cartoons, this is a pretty funny homage. Having not seen said cartoons, I couldn't really appreciate some of the gags, but even so the episode was still entertaining. That ending was really something though. Space Dandy has this thing where it tends to give the most over-exaggerated, bizarre ending possible and in this case I think it was a bit too random for its own good.\\n\\n\r\nThe Lonely Pooch Planet, Baby (2/5)- Not really a fan of this one. Jumps from a \u201cMarley and Me\u201d type story to an avenge story to another destruction of a planet story. None of these plots really blended well for me and it was jarring for the most part. At least Dr. Gel was able to give me another good laugh, that poor, poor guy.\\n\\n\r\nPlants Are Living Things, Too, Baby (3.5/5)- Another serious episode, this one is definitely the most atmospheric. The Meow storyline wasn't really needed though to be honest. The artistic design for this was beautiful, the environment was breathtaking, and the character designs were very original. However, the ending was surprisingly sad and Dandy\u2019s reaction just didn't feel right.\\n\\n\r\nThere's Always Tomorrow, Baby (4.5/5)- If the Zombie episode was the best comedic episode, then this episode was the best at a serious tone. Great character story and development from Meow. The story takes a groundhog day approach which led to some great gags and a very well done story. Bonus points for a certain couple haha.\\n\\n\r\nI'm Never Remembering You, Baby (3/5)- This episode was a bit confusing as it relies a lot on memory gags. It was fairly enjoyable and the ending is classic Dandy randomness. Other than that, there\u2019s not much to this one, it\u2019s quite forgettable.\\n\\n\r\nNobody Knows the Chameleon Alien, Baby (4/5)- A very funny impersonation episode. Unlike the last one, this is confusing done right. There isn\u2019t really a resolution, but it actually adds to the main gag \u201cWho\u2019s the real Dandy?\u201d. This episode reminded me a lot of \u201cImitation Krabs\u201d from \u201cSpongebob\u201d which is a great thing and in fact this episode still has more funny tricks up its sleeve.\\n\\n\r\nEven Vacuum Cleaners Fall in Love, Baby (3.5/5)- A decent, romance episode for QT. It\u2019s a cute episode to watch and it definitely adds character to QT. The relationship between QT and Maker was believable, which is an amazing feat in just a 22 minute episode. The episode pokes some fun at the mecha genre in a certain scene which I thought was pretty amusing. It's not really last episode material, but still a fine episode.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation (9/10): \\n\\n\r\nStudio Bones once again proves their talents with great animation and art that blends so well with Space Dandy\u2019s wild universe. Some episodes such as the Plant episode may have different animation, but this really isn't an animation drop, but rather different directors handling a episode with their own style. And these different, creative styles show the flexibility and range Space Dandy has. There may be some slight animation inconsistencies, but the presentation still greatly overshadows this.\\n\\n\r\nSound (7/10):\\n\\n\r\nThe first opening is a bit similar to Cowboy Bebop which kind of gets in the way of the show\u2019s identity. Nevertheless, its still awesome jazz although its short runtime is a bit odd. The second opening is more like it. Its pop beat catchy and blends well with the fun nature of the show, and the animation is filled with some great, corny, Dandy style.\\n\\n\r\nFor a Watanabe show, Space Dandy\u2019s OST doesn\u2019t stand out as much as his previous works. But even so, the funky and original beats combined with some jazz are still a joy to listen to and it blends so well with the show. It may not have the charismatic pizazz of Cowboy Bebop or the chill, \u201cI could play this forever\u201d beat of Samurai Champloo, but Space Dandy still has its own auditory identity and that's something many shows these days lack.\\n\\n\r\nConclusion:\\n\\n\r\nDon\u2019t watch Space Dandy expecting a story with continuity or depth. This show is definitely experimental with a few really funny episodes as well as a fair share of okay ones and then some weak ones. Its inconsistent, but I still had a blast. Watch this as you would watch a Western Cartoon and I guarantee you\u2019ll have a laugh at least once. I give Space Dandy a 6/10.",

            "content": "Space Dandy was a show I was very excited for, from the very first preview I saw. Being headed by director Shinichiro Watanabe, who I've been a fan of for a long time, I naturally came into it with high expectations. The show didn't meet those expectations, for a few reasons, yet... the entire thing still manages to be very enjoyable, and even beautiful at times.\r\nI watched the 5.1 English Dub, and it sounded great. I liked the choice of sound effects, and the audio mix ended up being very nicely done. The soundtrack has some great songs in it, all of which fit thetone of the world. The voice acting was well done, too. Each of the actors gave their character exactly the right kind of personality, and were able to keep the tone of the Japanese version, while still making the lines sound perfectly natural in English.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of the characters, I felt the main cast were all very well designed, and have a very iconic-looking, Watanabe art style. They're also all very different from each other, not only in terms of design, but also in terms of personality. This means that they often end up clashing with each other, which makes for some really good character moments. The crew also seems to grow closer to each other over the course of the episodes, and by episode 13, they all feel very fleshed-out and memorable. However, as much as I love the main cast, a lot of the supporting cast seems to feel very one-dimensional, especially the main antagonists.\\n\\n\r\nThis is where the problems start. Space Dandy's story seems like it's much more concerned with simply making jokes and doesn't bother with consistency or any type of over-arching plotline. Most episodes have narrative elements that seem well thought out at first, but end up being incredibly self-contained, never to be re-visited. Because of this, much of the character-development gets snubbed, as does the world... which generally feels like a new universe with each passing episode. Of course, it's not all bad. Some of the episodes end up being very memorable, and the overall style of the directing really helps to tell the stories that do get told. It's just too bad most of these stories end up being completely nonsensical, the butt of a joke, or some type of satirical element.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, the show really brings it home in the art department. It's fantastically animated, using many impressive, jaw-dropping techniques commonly only seen in animated feature films. The show also makes great use of color, and the art style is well suited to the diverse nature of the worlds that Dandy & crew end up visiting. There's so much variety to it all! As much as that's a bad thing for the story, I feel it does wonders for the art. It seems a ton of time and effort was put into making every inch of this show just look absolutely gorgeous.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, the show is incredible to look at, but if you're looking for an interesting story, I'd say you should definitely look elsewhere. The characters are fun, and the jokes are funny, but the stories are really only there in service of everything else. In the end, Space Dandy manages to be a fun, entertaining show, with some gorgeous looking art... but it lacks any real substance, which ends up being it's one major flaw. This prevents me from giving it an incredible rating, and instead, I simply give it an 8/10.",

            "content": "Stylistically sound and surprisingly fresh, \"Space Dandy\" is by no means a masterpiece, but then again I don't think it tried to be. Watanabe, Shinichiro is a man with a solid vision for his works, and you can tell. From \"Cowboy Bebop\" to \"Samurai Champloo\" Watanabe has forged a very recognizable rhythm that each of his tales match too. Whether it be jazz or Hip Hop, Watanabe has an unmatched \"swagger\" no matter what direction he takes. So if I were to try to describe what path \"Space Dandy\" took, well, lets just say it was groovy. Oh baby was it groovy. \r\nStory: 7/10 \r\nThisfunky adventure through space (even time) was one sporadic ride, and this more or less senseless journey was at the end of the day at least unique. Now unique is actually a huge complement (I know surprising right), Watanabe has one hell of an imagination, and this show is a testament to it. Voyaging across 13 episodes in the first season the story remains relatively episodic as it goes from adventure to adventure. Each contained story at bare minimum kept my attention, and at the most engaged my senses with its \"acid dropping\" narrative. From this handful of stories there was plenty of fun to be had, but the general lack of focus might turn people away. It does what it went for well, but at the end of the day it has been done better (hell by shows from Watanabe himself). This leaves us very lopsided in terms of the shows narrative, but because most of the episodes manage to hit their mark with remarkable accuracy the overall product comes out well for it.  \\n\\n\r\nArt: 8/10 \\n\\n\r\nVibrantly colorful, and distinctly stylistic \"Space Dandy\" mixes together a very solid art direction with various blends of masterful camera work. The story boarding alone was incredibly well done. All of these aspects come together to make some wonderful eye candy, and helped the show stay fresh throughout by adding various new visual morsels for your eyes to devour. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 9/10 \\n\\n\r\nI don't usually phrase my input quite this crass, but I have to say this \"Shit's so cash\". Original, groovy, funky, and well dandy; it mixes together so many different vibes that it effortlessly bounces around from story to story. It not only matches each one on an individual level, but ties the show itself together in such a distinct rhythm that you find yourself moving along to the beat. Much like what Watanabe did with his previous works, he found the right swing, and the show grooves along to it. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 6/10 \\n\\n\r\nThis for me was the weakest point of the show. Dandy and crew were quite the enjoyable group of individuals, but unlike the vastness of space there just wasn't that much there. Dandy himself was interesting, and every episode I looked forward to learning more about this dandy in space. He was charismatic, self centered, and kind of an ass hat. However in certain moments throughout the show we had glimpses at some other qualities to this dandy man. Although brash and poser like, I was still engaged into seeing more about this roguish character who proclaimed himself to be a \"great\" bounty hunter. Sadly Dandy himself was the only real \"charm\" that the show had going for it. Meow and QT, although excellent side editions, didn't really have the same draw or appeal. Both of them were pretty much one note except in their respective character episodes, which tried to further evolve who these people were. Sadly they just come up even in the end, and don't really do much. The show is Dandy's, and it makes no attempt to hide this fact. \\n\\n\r\nAs for the collection of other characters like the Dr. Gel, Admiral Perry, and other individuals that Dandy meets on his journey they were serviceable. Out of the lot who were restricted to their one episode my favorites were Ad\u00e9lie and Prince.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nI had a load of fun with \"Space Dandy\", and can't wait for season 2 to air. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7/10 \\n\\n\r\n\"Space Dandy\" is about a Dandy in space, and his grand adventures across the cosmos. Although missing the mark from time to time, Watanabe still manages to pump this show full of style, and creativity. It isn't quite \"Cowboy Bebop\" or \"Samurai Champloo\", but it is something wonderful. In the vastness of space where Anime seems to run the same tired scripts over and over again it was nice to something this fresh. Dandy may not be Captain Kirk, but this space traveler tries his hardest to go where no man has gone before. \\n",

            "content": "Mixed feelings. I deeply enjoyed the sakuga sequences, Meow's character, and various scenes and designs scattered throughout. However, for a fun pastime Dandy can come across as lukewarm depending on how tolerant of wasted potential you are. Not saying it doesn't take its concepts somewhere, but more like the canvas is so big it begs for things to transcend what one would expect. While the show does have its fair share of surprising twists, it mostly plays out like a Watanabe series, filled with predictable jokes and perfunctory resolutions. Its carefree nature excuses most of its underthinking, but just the thought that it could befar better and push its ideas much further bothers me. Conceptually, Space Dandy isn't far from something like Rick & Morty. The execution, however, shows the gargantuan distance between the two.",

            "content": "The Space Dandy anime is an anime with Dandy in space. \r\nComing from Shinichiro Watanabe, the director of Cowboy Bebop and Samurai Champloo, and animated by Studio Bones, Space Dandy is easily one of the most high profile show to air in the Winter 2014 season.  It takes in space and follows three alien hunters on the spaceship, the Aloha Oe, as they get caught up in various antics.  \r\nSetting itself apart from most shows, which have an overarching plot, Space Dandy takes a different approach to its narrative. Watanabe sets up the core foundations of the three main characters and lets thewriters and animators on his team loose in the Space Dandy playground. Highlights include a fresh take on the zombie genre, reuniting a small alien girl with her grandfather and  a race that is reminiscent of Outlaw Stars and Redline. However, there is little to connect all the various stories together and some episodes don't hit it quite on the mark. To its credit, the consistency in the quality of episodes is quite good as opposed to other shows like Panty and Stocking, which had some sub-par moments.        \\n\\n\r\nMaking up for the inherent weakness that the episodic structure brings, the visuals do not disappoint in the less. Depending on the episode, the vast range of artistic style that is presented is a testament to the talent of Studio Bones. Colors are bright and varied and the motion is well animated. The aliens design are creative and fit with wild universe of Space Dandy.  \\n\\n\r\nUnprecedented for an anime, Space Dandy is available in subs or dub at the same time. As for the question of sub or dub, I prefer the dub as the main character has that 50s American character design and it matches up much better than the Japanese. The other voices do an adequate job and flows well with the fun light hearted nature of the show. In the music department, the soundtracks have great chemistry with whatever episode is playing , whether is a frantic race through space or a psychedelic  journey on a planet filled with plants.       \\n\\n\r\nOverall, Space Dandy is a pleasant show that excel in taking a set concepts and taking it to new creative heights on a week to week basis. \\n",

Space Dandy doesn't really have a direction (well so far even though it been 18 episodes). But honestly I don't think anybody really cares where its going. It's just a fun anime to watch. I like to watch it because of the art direction in each episode. No two episodes are the same and I really enjoy that. You honestly can never expect what adventures Dandy, Meow, and QT are going to run into next. The music is great like in almost all Shinichiro Watanabe animes.

            "content": "Gag series are quite a handful to keep up with, they are all about the jokes, logic and common sense don't have to apply, they never hold back into diving into fantasies and referencing pop culture icons, each one of those rules of thumb is hard enough to nail as an individual aspect of making up a solid series, but Space\u2606Dandy hammers each one of them like a professional, baby.\r\nStory (8.5/10):\r\nWhat's really flexible about similar shows is that they don't have to follow a linear storyline to be called a proper show with its ups and downs, this is literally like a youtuber from the2016-2018 era, today's' video is a vlog, and tomorrow's is a let's play, it's all about the variety of content and emitting repetition, there is a special appreciation that goes along with starting up a new episode almost from scratch, not knowing what it will be about, probably the last one was all cheery and happy, but nothing is stopping this one to be different, a little more about a sad backstory or a depressing turn of events, baby.\\n\\n\r\nlooking from a very 3rd person view, a trio of weirdos composed of an intelligent vacuum cleaner looking robot named QT whose chips have grown dated, a talking cat alien that draws a lot from the modern definition of otaku. We're talking about an obsession with social media, Anime styled games, and of course, likes his fair share of boobies. And finally and more importantly, the dandiest man in space, space dandy, with his marvelous Elvis-influenced hairstyle and his unique taste in clothing, a respected slave of the booty and a regular at the galactic restaurant called \u201cBoobies\u201d, along they spend their days hunting down rare alien species for a living, baby.\\n\\n\r\nIt sounds simple enough, but don't let that fool you into thinking that they have one definitive goal at the end of the day, yes, they may be alien hunters (That sounds badass), but they are not tied to an end goal, all they want is to drop by \u201cBoobies\u201d and have a sweet glass of beer at the end of a hard hunting day, nothing like saving the world or delivering on a prophecy matters here, baby.\\n\\n\r\nThere were some unfortunate drawbacks on its episodic serialization, while some episodes were just phenomenal, you could almost flesh out an entire seasonal series out of that amazing 24 minutes of content into its own standalone plotline if you wanted to. Some other episodes (Only one to be more precise) were a bit bad directed, their concept was just amazing, no, probably one of the best concepts presented in this series, but it just didn't have the best direction and storyboarding to compliment it. And let me tell you, some episodes were the best I've seen in any entertainment medium, baby.\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt (9/10):\\n\r\nThere is something mysterious that always scream of \u201cAmerican\u201d when you put space and Elvis into a mix, not only on paper but they managed to carry on that ideology on the artwork as well, I believe that I had trained my eyes enough for it to confidently tell an Anime and a cartoon apart, and I still can't spot anything that tells me this show was not some ordinary American cartoon aside from it being labeled as an Anime. Which is not a bad thing, baby.\\n\\n\r\nDuring the fast-paced action-packed scenes, the animation looked surreal, so fluid and tasty to the eye you would beg for your eyes to be stuck on an eternal loop on that same exact scene, to think that this degree of amazing Saguka would work with an art style like this and with a perfect juxtaposition too, baby.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound (9.5/10):\\n\r\nNow, before we get controversial, I've watched the DUB version and let me tell you, and I have taken a closer look to both versions, but the DUB here blows the SUB by a large margin, I mean, it's not even close.\\n\r\nThe SUB version is decent, on the same level of every other SUBed show, however, the DUB was just godly, and you can only feel the animation look more solid being handled by an English voice acting, it just works so well.\\n\r\nMost of the jokes have a strange western vibe to them so it only feels more natural to hear them in DUB rather than to read them as subtitles, baby.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtracks were phenomenal, those buttle fluid frames? Oh, they look even better when you layer the soundtrack on top of them, it's like the same thing with Cowboy Bebop all over again, something so retro about them that make them work in this setting, and oh boy do they vary, there are the hyperactive ones for action moments, the sad ones for the gloomy moments, I mean, there are even ones that sound flirty by nature that go so well with Dandy's pickup lines, baby.\\n\\n\r\nNot to be harsh on the opening and ending sequences as they are only being spoken about this late. I can't stress this enough.\\n\r\nThe DUBed version of the show had two opening sequences due to some strange reason, the original opening sequence was only used until halfway through the series, as the first one was never used in the subbed version, and that's where I have to stack up for my boys, both of them were amazing. They sounded so simplistic and boy do they put you in the spirit, baby.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacter (8.5/10):\\n\r\nObviously, this isn't a character heavy plot that relies on edge cutting character development or anything of that nature. There are some guys that honestly relate to most of the audience despite being from a distant future were memes actually still a thing (Confirmed by QT), this is a show about the gags and the jokes, and those guys are supposed to be like those guys you want to hang out with, they are likable and that was the point.\\n\r\nDespite the trio being so incompatible with one another, they always find some way to interact like buddies to give you the impression that they mean more than family to each other where they are most of the time ready to kiss each other goodbye for good on life-threatening moments, baby.\\n\\n\r\nSomething that really set this show apart from anything I've watched, is that even the narrator felt more of the main character than most of the off-screened naruto characters from the hidden leaf. The dude sounded so chill, often broke the fourth wall and even contributed in steering down the action in the show, and it was glorious, baby.\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (9/10):\\n\r\nThere is a lot to like about this series, and too little to hate unless you just want to nitpick every mico-sized flaw there is.\\n\r\nA lot of people would complain about the bad pacing of the series or at sometimes, the lack of action, but really, not every episode is going to be about skyscraper-sized robots exchanging epic blows, the varying mini-stories were just the best, from referencing the astronaut doggo Laika to a very wholesome family-centered episode with Meow. It just felt home being in front from the screen while watching the Aloha Oe (The name of their spaceship) crew rocking it up, baby.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall (8.7/10):\\n\r\nFirst of all, sorry about the excessive use of \u201cbaby\u201d to end every paragraph, that was just my tribute to the series, and will probably do the same when I review the second season.\\n\r\nThis was one show that I never knew would make me beg for more, and to my luck, there is already a second season. A really underrated comedy centered Anime series, it really is heavy on satire and ridicule it definitely deserves the time of every comedy fanatic out there, even if they weren't into Anime, baby.",

            "content": "(7.5/10)\r\nThis is a show about a Dandy... in space...\r\nAnd in a way,  it isn't. This episodic space-romp full of pop-culture references, boobies, monsters, chase-sequences, and physical gags serves as an outlet for animators and storyboarders to create some of the coolest and most well-choreographed pieces of animation in televised anime history.\r\nNot only that, it gives Shinichiro Watanabe, the director of Cowboy Bebop the ability to travel back out into space with a bigger budget and bigger, wackier ideas. Letting go of the reigns and seeing where the space cruiser takes him. \r\nHowever, at its core, it's also a very inconsistent show. It makes sensewhy, since there are so many different people working on all the different episodes, but regardless if it's logical, it's still frustrating. Space Dandy has bouts of absolute mind-blowing greatness but also depression-filled states of dull, boring, and unfunny episodes. It's the definition of a mixed bag, which makes the idea of pushing it from a \"good\" show to a \"Very good\" show very hard, grading wise. \\n\\n\r\nBut lets get into why!\\n\\n\r\n______________________________________________________________\\n\\n\r\n[ART]\\n\\n\r\n______________________________________________________________\\n\\n\r\nAs I've said, this is the most impressively animated piece of televised anime I've ever seen. Maybe it isn't a marvel when it comes to something like shot composition and art direction, but it's vibrant and full of energy. It's the opposite of something like Fate/Zero, which tries really hard to look pretty at all times but sacrifices any actual movement or animation for that. \\n\\n\r\nSpace Dandy jumps around on screen making goofy faces with spectacularly beautiful scenery and hair-raising action sequences. The characters bend and contort out of their designs constantly, making it undoubtedly cartoonish. But that's what they're going for. \\n\\n\r\nThe consistently creative monster designs are paired with equally creative space ship designs which put the likes of Cowboy Bebop to shame. It appears that when Shinichiro decides to go goofy, his designs improve drastically. Everything from the villainous Dr.Gel and his awesome spaceship that's pretty much the statue of liberty's head with a ball gag to  the Aloha Oe's sleek yellow exterior reminds me of distinctly 60's sci-fi that's unfortunately often forgotten about.\\n\\n\r\nI got a lot of Dune vibes, especially the unfortunately unmade Dune film by Alejandro Jodorowsky. Small plug here, if you haven't seen \"Jodorowsky's Dune\", the documentary, you should!\\n\\n\r\n...\\n\\n\r\nThe spaceship and creature designs aren't the only thing standing out, either. With our main characters being distinctly malleable and creative, especially Space Dandy himself, who sports a leather jacket and sick pompadour is one of the most creative looking anime MC's I've ever seen. He's also one of my favorites. More on that later. \\n\\n\r\n...\\n\\n\r\nTo round everything up. We have spectacular animation that puts 99.99% of televised anime to complete shame. We have great creature designs. We have great character designs overall. Fantastic action sequences devoid of any filler, focusing solely on creating something frantic, memorable, and funny., and lastly, a solid list of guest animators that all do their jobs splendidly.\\n\\n\r\nSome episodes may look similar to others, but certain episodes completely stand out in terms of animation. Not just in quality, but in style. Specifically, episode 9 was jaw-droppingly pretty and one of the most memorable parts of the show. \\n\\n\\n\r\n______________________________________________________________\\n\\n\r\n[SOUND]\\n\\n\r\n______________________________________________________________\\n\\n\r\nIt's very good. Especially for a TV anime. The sound effects range from corny to impactful, but that's what the show needs. It's entire personality is that. From the goofy character reactions to the ships zooming through space, everything has a sound effect and these sound effects add to the entire likability of the show. \\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is almost wholly exceptional, too. Ranging from guitar riffs to whole songs created specifically for this show. To my surprise, there's a distinct lack of that generic J-pop that plagues just about every anime known to man. Instead, the director and writers, I assume, decided to use a less generic and more interesting approach with a wide variety of tracks. \\n\\n\r\nThe intro is catchy and vibrant, fitting the theme of the show, and the ED is equally great. The sound design is very solid overall. \\n\\n\\n\r\n______________________________________________________________\\n\\n\r\n[CHARACTER + STORY]\\n\\n\r\n______________________________________________________________\\n\\n\r\nThese are going to be in one section because more often than not, the story comes from the characters and vice versa.  As I said in my introduction, this show is very clunky in terms of its storytelling being consistent. \\n\\n\r\nOne episode is making me misty-eyed and another episode is just frustrating me with it's daftness. On one hand it makes some of the great episodes truly stand out. On the other hand, it makes the not-so-great episodes truly stand out too. \\n\\n\r\n...\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe writers created our protagonists as lovable doofuses, but more importantly, as people (or robots) with actual character. I often criticize anime with just throwing a bunch of quirks into a character and calling it a day. Which makes a quirky thing, but not really a character.\\n\\n\r\nA real character that you remember is one that not only speaks to you, but also shows themselves to you. Someone you feel like you understand, especially if they are the protagonists. \\n\\n\r\nHere, just about every main character is someone I grew to not only like, but also understand. This is doubly the more impressive since the show is by no means serialized and every episode is something completely different. This level of characterization is very hard to accomplish. This show does that. \\n\\n\r\nWhere this show falls a little flat character-wise is in it's secondary characterization. Just about every secondary character is either forgettable or simply there to propel the characters forward. Even the villains just kind of get brushed to the side, and the gag that they play through every episode can feel a little dull and played out by the end of this shows thirteen episode run. \\n\\n\r\n...\\n\\n\\n\r\nSpace Dandy does nail it every so often though. I don't mean in a \"hey, that's a good episode of cartoon!\" Kinda nail. I mean a \"Holy shit, now that's something that I might never forget,\" level good. Specifically three different episodes became some of my favorite pieces of short-form storytelling this year. Surprisingly, each one did that in a completely different way. \\n\\n\\n\r\nWith Episode 5 we have Shinichiro do his signature 'emotion in the face of comedy' routine by bringing in an adorable little girl that Dandy must be around... no spoilers. She is the shows most memorable secondary character, from her heart-splittingly adorable design to great VA work she left her mark on the episode, and me. This episodes saccharine personality never felt like it wasn't earned. \\n\\n\r\nWith Episode 7 there was a redline-esq race that is one of the most breathtaking pieces of action in television anime. This matched with some genuinely funny lines makes for a really solid and memorable episode.\\n\\n\r\nWith Episode 9 comes the best use of a guest animator in the show. Eunyoung Choi handled the dazzling storyboards for the this episode. But where I thought the animation would surely be the highlight (and it was, in a way), the episode packs a really great melancholy touch towards the end. \\n\\n\r\n...\\n\\n\r\nThese three episodes elevate the show from a beautiful experiment that generally ignores great storytelling in favor of eye-catching animation to a show that occasionally gives a perfect mix of both. \\n\\n\r\nMatched with a narrator that serves not only as a devise of exposition, but also as a humorous touch, consistently breaking the fourth wall, there really isn't too much to dislike in terms of progression.\\n\\n\r\n...\\n\\n\r\nThat being said, the show is generally never side-splittingly funny. Which is, unfortunately, an issue. There are undoubtedly parts where I let out a soft guffaw or smirk, but for the most part, I simply sat back and enjoyed some of the bathos and more surreal elements mixed in with a small amount of sobering storytelling.\\n\\n\r\nThere really isn't much in terms of actual humor of substance apart from some very specific and memorable scenes. The humor in Space Dandy can be described in the same way the entire shows personality can. It's vibrant, goofy, frantic, but may often feel empty when held up to scrutiny. However, occasionally, it really really nails it. \\n\\n\\n\r\n______________________________________________________________\\n\\n\r\n[CONCLUSION]\\n\\n\r\n______________________________________________________________\\n\\n\r\nSo's the life of a show that by nature isn't consistent. Bringing in different writers and storyboard artists between episodes can make the show feel understandably disjointed. Sometimes for the better, but sometimes for the worse. \\n\\n\r\nIt is, however, truly impressive that the show managed to do what it has done with it's characters in a setting that really doesn't call for it. The amount of connection I felt with the protagonists as well as a very small amount of secondaries was nothing short of impressive. Especially for a show that doesn't really have any hints at serialization at all. \\n\\n\r\nIt's a dynamic journey into a world with no rules, laws, or restrictions. Let go of the reigns and soak on the madness.",

            "content": "There really are a variety of anime around aren't there. This anime was probably the highlight of the winter season compared to Kill La Kill which lost its overall promise easily. Standard hype strategy of start with a bang, end with a dissapointment. But space dandy is different. As much as I despise the Gintama-esque animes such a dandy, I enjoyed Dandy thoroughly as it was the best of the winter 2013-14 season. \r\nStory 5/10\r\nThis anime is very experimental and reminded me of the tatami galaxy because every episode seemed like a different 'world line' of the Space Dandy galaxy. Every episode is different andmay be unique or just completely flat. I get that each episode had different directors, but the show's execution was done in a way that was boring at times with no merit. Even though that being said, I really loved those 'unique' episodes as they were very well done. But really there is no story other than the fact that it's about 1 human 1 Talking Cat and 1 Robot trying to catch aliens with a ambiguous 'to be continued' sign at the end. The overall episodes are somewhat enjoyable, but nothing to be amazed at except for those few gem episodes. \\n\\n\r\n9/10\\n\r\nArt's really good and reminds me of the old style animation while being somewhat modern at the same time.  Animation is top-notch with little to no rough edges. \\n\\n\r\nMusic 10/10\\n\r\nThe music is outstanding, esp. the ED/OP of the anime. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter 9/10\\n\r\nSpace dandy like Cowboy Bebop is more about the ride rather than the destination. The characters are all likable and even the side characters are thoroughly explained unlike the latter of TV shows. They are all interesting and likable, but the fact that most side characters are thrown away after an episode makes me wonder the question, why even include them. Well just waiting for the next season. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 8/10\\n\r\nI throughly enjoyed this experiemental anime show as it was unique in its own way. There were a few unique episodes which I absolutely loved, but most of space dandy's episodes were either dull or not even worth mentioning. Even though, I didn't like the episodes itself, I loved the characters inside it. \\n\\n\r\nOverall 7/10\\n\r\nOverall it's a fun ride to watch dandy, but I found it very difficult to review because of the fact that every episode was different in its own way whether they are bad or good. I would definately watch this anime at the expense of free time, but it's not a must-watch.",

            "content": "I watched Space Dandy since it first started airing, and it quickly became one of my favorites. It's not for everyone: it's a bit experimental and really meta, but if you're into that kind of thing, it's nothing short of a masterpiece. \r\nStory: 8\r\nUnlike most anime, Space Dandy has almost no continuity aside from the last two episodes. Characters come and go without explanation, and it isn't uncommon for the main cast to die at the end of an episode and show up just fine in the next. I really like this, though: I'm easily distracted, and as much as I love the concept ofspace operas, their convoluted storylines can get in the way of my enjoyment. \\n\r\nI also think this means each episode's story is more developed: some episodes are silly, some are cute, some are heartwrenching, but almost all of them are interesting, entertaining, and immersive.  Even the final two episodes, the only ones that can be considered plot-relevant, sufficiently wrapped up a story I didn't want to see end to begin with in a satisfying way.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8\\n\r\nI love the art in this show, but I can't objectively give it higher than an 8 because of the mediocre animation quality, which I think can get a lot of people. The movement direction, color and layout, and general aesthetic is amazing, but the series's budget really shows in most episodes' lack of fluid animation and occasional off-model distance shots. \\n\r\nThe art particularly shines in the second season, which had a number of guest animation directors that showed their distinctive styles. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 9\\n\r\nThe opening and ending themes are great: the opening gets me pumped and the ending makes me feel good, just like I think good music should. I wish they could have had different openings and endings between the seasons, but the series was already clearly pushing its budget. \\n\r\nThe background music is also very good. It's usually very jazzy, doesn't steal the spotlight, but adds excitement or poignancy to a scene. \\n\r\nI watched most of the series dubbed, but I have seen a few episodes in Japanese. Both are good, but as I'm easily distract--I mean, like to multitask,  I'm more of a dub person, and the dub is fantastic. It's a little hammy, which is perfect for an over-the-top space opera, but not so hammy that I ended up mockingly repeating half the lines out loud because of their awful delivery (which I end up doing with a lot of poorly voice-directed dubs). \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 8\\n\r\nBecause of the series's episodic nature, most of the characters don't get a lot of deep development. But the designs are great, and most recurring characters get some focus episodes that provide a decent amount of development that doesn't make the plot too complicated.  \\n\r\nDandy himself warrants the most explanation if you're wondering if the characterization will appeal to you. He may seem like a shallow, poorly-developed character to many viewers, but in the grand scheme of things, that's kind of the point. I could describe him as a hedonist, or a bon-vivant, or adventurous, or whatever, but I'll be frank here: Space Dandy is a tool. He is kind of a badass, but he's also a conceited, dim-witted pervert.  And with only a couple episodes of exception, he never stops being a tool. \\n\r\nThat may seem lazy to some people, but it's fairly refreshing to me. Like in real life, just because people can change and develop into better people doesn't mean they will. And the plot of the show even explains how he's never stopped being such a tool, but I'm not elaborating on that (because spoilers).\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10\\n\r\nI think a lot of people on MAL might be more interested in anime for anime's sake, but I  personally like anime as just another form of media to consume. I gave it an 8 based on what I think most people will think about it, but to me, Space Dandy is a perfect 10. Space Dandy is exactly what I like in media, whether it's TV dramas or movies or video games or anime: it's entertaining. That's why you should watch Space Dandy. Not because it's deep or funny or revolutionary, but because it's entertaining.  Space Dandy really reminded me of why I watch anime to begin with: to have fun. \\n\r\nYou'll laugh. You'll cry. You'll quietly smile in awe. Maybe you'll bingewatch 10 episodes every 2 months, but they'll be a fun 10 episodes. But if you ask me, that's perfectly fine. It's better than watching 10 episodes of some boring, melodramatic, pseudointellectual big-budget anime that you're not even really sure if you're enjoying, but think you're supposed to like since it's deep or whatever.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8\\n\r\nAn 8 for most people, a 10 for me. Maybe you're into more (consistently) serious shows, maybe you're not into sci-fi, whatever, I can think of plenty of decent reasons to dislike it. But there's still a lot it has to offer. If you want to watch Space Dandy, don't go into it thinking it'll change your life any more than a sweet, refreshing glass of lemonade. But it's space lemonade. In space.",

            "content": "An outrageously fun, hilarious sci-fi with a lovable crew and their bizarre space adventures. \r\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\r\n(This review covers both seasons.)\r\nSpace Dandy was the most fun anime I\u2019ve seen in a long, long time. It\u2019s been a while since I\u2019ve been so motivated to marathon a show. I finished the 26 episodes in 3 days. It\u2019s hilarious, always leaving me with a smile. The characters are very charming and loveable. The plots are absurd and over-the-top, but even through the silliness it manages to settle down sometimes to make you feel at peace, even melancholy and lonely.\r\nI\u2019ve said before, but entertainment\u2014no matter what form\u2014whether it\u2019s anime ormovies or books are really just about giving you that emotional experience. Don\u2019t worry about the details. Don\u2019t worry about the logic. If you love it enough just go with it.\\n\\n\r\nFirst, the animation is absolutely amazing. It\u2019s so full of life and details it's worth re-watching. This is a show that demands to be seen in true Blu-ray quality. You would be hurting yourself to watch it any other way. You have to see this in full 1080p to experience the incredible imagination. There are bizarre aliens, exotic planets, and beautiful cosmic scenery to witness.\\n\\n\r\nThe show is about a crew of three and their space adventures trying to find and capture rare aliens. These aliens are then registered for a cash reward. Your hero is a care-free slacker who loves women and going to a space Hooters. At his side is an adorable, outdated vacuum cleaning robot that puts up with him. Then there\u2019s a space cat that\u2019s just as lazy.\\n\\n\r\nThe dub and its writing are fantastic. I strongly recommend watching that version. It\u2019s obvious the translation team took liberties to westernize the material, but it\u2019s very well-suited. If I didn\u2019t know this was an anime, I\u2019d swear it was western made because so much of the humor feels western. Even the dialogue feels very modern with slang like \u201csketchy\u201d and references to Twitter.\\n\\n\r\nEvery episode is something different because they each have a very strong emotional theme. There\u2019s a lot of variety to the plots. Everything from a zombie episode; a galactic space race; going on a date; meeting parallel dimensions; even something as simple as a road trip. There\u2019s even touches of continuity as the they refer back to older plots and items. When the show takes a break from its wacky adventures to settle down the music really adds a surreal, distant, almost lonely mood. Other times the episodes are just plain weird and abstract.\\n\\n\r\nI\u2019m reminded of Futurama: another sci-fi show that makes stories and jokes out of scientific concepts. Space Dandy was a blast to watch. It's like no other anime I can think of. Without a doubt it's my favorite of 2014.",

            "content": "For all the uninspired rubbish that each season seems to be permeated by, Space Dandy represents a glimmer of hope. It may not have a great story or well-developed characters, and while the excessive fanservice can feel a bit immature, it is one of very few anime that dare to be different from the usual harem or action series. It also happens to be a whole load of fun... provided you don't mind seeing T&A every sixty seconds. \r\nSpace Dandy is perhaps most recognisable for being Shinichiro Watanabe's most recent project. There is a noticeable Cowboy Bebop influence here, but at the same time itfeels like the antithesis of what Bebop represents. Space Dandy is all sorts silly and zany. There never seems to be a moment where the show takes itself seriously, and even when it appears to, there is usually some joke waiting at the end. There are no deep messages to be extracted from the episodes. It never aims to be anything more than simple fun-- and it works for that very reason. \\n\\n\r\nThe story follows the adventures of space greaser Dandy, a cat-like creature named... 'Meow', and the ship's cleaning robot, QT. The three spend their days lazing about while occasionally hunting for rare aliens to fetch them a nice price on market. They are incredibly inept at their job, lacking in any form of intelligence, and everything, always, goes terribly wrong in some way or another.\\n\\n\r\nSpace Dandy follows an episodic format, although I don't believe the term is entirely appropriate as 'episodic' implies continuity in some form. There is absolutely no continuity in Space Dandy. Zero. The main characters might die at the end of an episode and then it will casually roll the credits before showing them alive and healthy in the next episode. The character development is essentially nil as a result. Dandy and the rest aren't characters that you will ever find yourself emotionally attached to, but that's actually okay. Focusing solely on the comedy is what allows it to work. Drama would never be able to exist in the bizarre world of Space Dandy- at least not without seeming entirely out-of-place. Even deus ex machina (and they are aplenty) are intentionally used for comedic purposes. The show just doesn't give a damn about being taken seriously.  \\n\\n\r\nEverything about Space Dandy oozes charm. The setting is reminiscent of a 1950's vision of the future, with ray guns, greaser slang and antiquated technology. The episodes themselves deal with every prominent sci-fi trope (time loops, wormholes, zombies, sentient AI) in a fun manner. There is always something different each episode, though some are certainly much weaker than others. A few of them are honestly dull enough to put the viewer to sleep, while others, like the episode involving Meow's family, are nothing short of greatness. There's unfortunately no consistency to the quality of the episodes- an issue that seems to be common in episodic comedies. \\n\\n\r\nThe shameless fanservice is the show's one major flaw. There's nothing wrong with an adult character having an interest in women (or more specifically, boobs), but Dandy's obsession verges from perversion to outright debauchery. An equivalent to Hooters, named \"Boobies\" in the show (really!) is frequently present. Boobies this, Boobies that. Dandy's entire reason for existence is to go to Boobies and ogle all the big-breasted blondes that walk about. Every time he visits, there are close-up cleavage or ass-shots of the girls. When he is not there, he hits on every female in sight; human or alien, it doesn't matter to him. There is no problem with shows that are mature enough to embrace sexuality as a normal part of human nature, but this maturity is nowhere to be seen in Space Dandy. Its obsession with women resembles a starving 12-year-old who just reached puberty rather than something of a grown adult. The fanservice has its place, but there is no reason for it to exist to this extent. It's just uncomfortable. \\n\\n\r\nSpace Dandy has some of the best art seen in a television anime for years. The first episode looks absolutely stellar, on-par with big-budget series such as Shingeki no Kyojin and not too far behind films such as Redline. The animation does take a dip in the later episodes but its quality always remains well above the average anime. Space Dandy gives a great deal of attention to its action scenes by animating them in full. Most anime studios decide to take the shortcut approach with panning shots (or just plain bad animation), which makes Space Dandy's visuals all the more commendable. The animators could have taken the lazy way out, but they did not. \\n\\n\r\nThe sound is average; nothing noteworthy. Most scenes are accompanied by ambient sounds in order to convey a distinct sci-fi atmosphere. A few scenes, like the battle between QT and a giant robot, and Dandy taking care of an alien child, have more noticeable music, but these moments are all too rare. The opening track is much more interesting, performed by what I would describe as \"Japanese Bloc Party\". It encapsulates the quirky charm of the series. \\n\\n\r\nIf you have ever found yourself bored by the homogeneity of the anime industry, or simply want to watch something fun and silly, Space Dandy is an anime definitely deserving of your time. There's an undeniable sense of childishness to the fanservice, and sure, not every episode is a massive joy to watch, but there is rarely a moment that makes you wish you were watching something else instead. It dared to be different and it succeeded. If only more anime took from Space Dandy's example.",

            "content": "You don\u2019t understand how badly I want to like Space Dandy. The fantastic visuals, Dandy as a character, some of the great ideas that go into the episodes\u2026there\u2019s so much going on that could make for great entertainment\u2026\r\nBut instead, Space Dandy has one good episode and is mired by tons of flat humor,  a whole load of boring to bad episodes, and overusing Boobies as a humor device.\r\nPros\r\n1.) Great Animation and Soundtrack- Seriously, Space Dandy looks sexy as hell. From the retro character designs to the whacky aliens to the trippy worlds, Space Dandy is a great acid trip. Many episodes have a uniquestyle from the others. The plant episode and the library episode did a good job of providing a unique enough experience to be memorable as far as the animation is concerned, though flat lined in every other department. The soundtrack is also brilliant, with tons of the flair and flavor we can expect from the people who brought us Bebop and Samurai Champloo.\\n\\n\r\n2.) Some Good Ideas- Some of the episodes contained good ideas that weren\u2019t capitalized on, or would have been awesome if they were fleshed out. Space Dandy is definitely smart somewhere, but the execution is so poor and the episodes so devoid of any of the humor or entertainment that it is supposed to provide. The references to classic sci-fi tropes and movies are great nods to the classics Dandy attempts to emulate, and those occasionally provide humor, but, for the most part, episodes as a whole fall apart.\\n\\n\r\n3.) That One Good Episode- The only good episode in the series is the one that makes fun of Disney\u2019s copyright laws and also has one of the best space races I\u2019ve ever seen. This is episode seven; an episode that I will think of anytime anyone mentions Space Dandy. It\u2019s a fantastic episode. Watch it and avoid the rest. The rest sucks.\\n\\n\r\nCons\\n\r\n1.) Uninteresting and Unfunny Characters- The first episode Dandy is a pretty cool character and you think, \u201cDamn, they\u2019re gonna do some awesome things with him\u201d. But they never do. His character is as stagnant as the rest of the series and he\u2019s never particularly funny. Most of the jokes surrounding him are way too juvenile and overused to elicit even a chuckle. Boobies was funny the first time, but by the twelfth episode, it\u2019s downright annoying. And this lack of comedy can be found in QT, whose autotuned voice makes sense, but isn\u2019t a great design choice in the long run. Meow is also uninteresting as a character.\\n\\n\r\nAnd then there\u2019s a bad guy, Commodore Perry, who chases them around for some reason or other. The character\u2019s just don\u2019t provide anything worth mentioning to the table.\\n\\n\r\n2.) Decent Enough Plot to Work With, Uninteresting Execution- You see me use the word \u201cuninteresting\u201d a lot because that about sums up Space Dandy. The setup, Dandy is searching for never before seen aliens in order to obtain a bounty, is pretty cool. But the execution is so boring. He goes to a planet where two aliens fight over the ultimate clothing. He returns a lost library book. There\u2019s an alien that shape shifts, there\u2019s a plant planet. The animation and style for every one of these episodes is fantastic and the still shots are goddam beautiful but I can\u2019t watch a comedy anime for its formalism. And maybe if this anime were not a comedy I would rate it higher, but that\u2019s what it wants to be, and that\u2019s what I\u2019ll treat it as.\\n\\n\r\n3.) So Much Wasted Potential, Baby- What I ultimately hate this anime for is wasting so much potential. I can\u2019t emphasize enough the amount of good ideas that went into Space Dandy that are wasted by poor writing, directing, and characters. I can see where this could be funny, and it does provide the occasional chuckle, but it\u2019s so much better taken as abstract sci-fi than a comedy. Maybe if you were high this show would work, but as it stands, Space Dandy is just poor.\\n\\n\r\nOverall\\n\r\nSigh. Space Dandy, Space Dandy, Space Dandy. Wasted potential central. It feels so much like Kids on the Slope, another anime made by director Shinichiro Watanabe. It is set up so well, but fails in every way except animation and music. After Cowboy Bebop, I think Watanabe decided to go style over substance, which tends not to work for me, especially in a comedy series. As I said, if this had been a formalistic sci-fi anime (with occasional comedy elements), it would have worked better. But as a comedy, it fails miserably. It\u2019s unfunny, has terrible characters, and is begging for a better team to handle it.\\n\\n\r\nWatch episode seven. But pass up the rest.",

            "content": "Space Dandy has been described as a sort of testing ground for directors - a large number of different directors, most of whom are accomplished, have been called in to create their own episodes utilizing the flexible setting of the show, resulting in Space Dandy being the most creative show I have seen at its peaks. Unfourtunately, in every experiment there is bound to be a few failures, and this is undoubtedly not a very consistent series.\r\nBeing a very experimental anime, each episode (this is an episodic anime in case you weren't clear) is unique and quirky, but each and every one of them havea common factor - they are amazing fun. Comedy is the main point of Space Dandy, and it has been handled exteremely well throughout the series. This might not seem to be the case at first (the show opens with boob jokes), but some of the jokes here are really unique, and the delivery is often top notch. I will not go into much detail in order to avoid spoilers, but in my opinion the first few episodes really aren't that good and in my opinion the weakest point of the series, so if you find yourself not liking the show much I urge you to continue to give it a chance - it is definitely worth it.\\n\\n\r\nA very common complain with the show is its lack of an overall plot. I personally don't find any problem with this, and think that some of the greatest shows have been like that. (Mushishi being my best example) Whilst there have been hints that there is something bigger at play, whether it will evolve into something is not certain. So if you are one of those who doesn't like shows which don't have a strong overall plot, this might not be the show for you.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are, simply put, outstanding. Whilst Dandy might seem annoying at first with all of his boob jokes and stuff like that, he is undoubtedly a character that will simply win you over throughout the course of the series with his over the top, contagious stupidity and antics. There is also sufficient development in the series despite it simply being episodic, and it weaves the backstories of the characters very well into its episodes. Meow's (episode 10) was done particularly well in my opinion. And QT is simply hilarious.\\n\\n\r\nThe visuals pretty good, and certain episodes do take on certain different (wierd) art styles. I think that they are used pretty well and I love how they are used to tell the story. Episode 11 springs to mind as one which used a very interesting art style to tell a even more interesting story, and I think the show is capable of utilizing creative visuals at times to help reinforce the plot.\\n\\n\r\nAmazing OP and ED, fitting use of music in scenes. I have little experience in music so I won't comment much on it, but I felt that the overall usage of sound was very effective in my viewing of the anime. Loved the voice acting (note that I am watching the jap version of the show so I don't know how the dub sounds) and feel that it fits perfectly to every character.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Space Dandy is hilarious, amazing, and overall a great pleasure to watch. It does start off with some weak episodes, but when it gets going, the stories are simply some of the best. Looking forward to when it returns after the break (its split cour!), and hopefully it continues to pump out these amazing episodes, and maybe even connect the dots and reveal that an overall plot (Not really neccessary, but I think it would be cool!) Highly recommended by me, with an overall score of 9/10.",

            "content": "I remember when I reached the end of the 3rd episode of Space Dandy. I was fairly pleased with the show. It was the kind of enjoyable humor that you can sit back, watch and turn your brain off for a half hour as you watch the antics of Space Dandy and his brave space crew...in space.\r\nOnce I watched the 4th episode \"Sometime you can't live with dying, baby\" that I knew I was in for something different. A majority of the episode was about the crew after they became zombies and the story was progressed via narration. While it wasn't the same goofy humorthat I had loved about the first 3 episodes it was still pretty funny, but what I really appreciated was how the creators were willing to try something different.\\n\\n\r\nThe desire to challenge the status quo set the standard for the following nine episodes. Not content to just throw out something we had seen before, Space Dandy challenged the anime comedy genre with solid characters, a fun soundtrack, fantastic art direction, and a vast array of episodes that ranged from hilariously nonsensical (A Race in Space Is Dangerous, Baby and Nobody Knows the Chameleon Alien, Baby) to character dramas reminiscent of director Shinichiro Watanabe's earlier show Cowboy Bebop (A Merry Companion Is a Wagon in Space, Baby and Even Vacuum Cleaners Fall in Love, Baby) to beautifully artistic (Plants Are Living Things, Too, Baby and I'm Never Remembering You, Baby).\\n\\n\r\nI was always excited to watch the next episode to see what new and exciting thing the creators would attempt to do in the show. Granted, there were several episodes that ended up being rather lackluster, but you certainly can't fault the creators for trying. However, the low points are few and far between when compared to the high quality of the rest of the series. All in all I would highly recommend Space Dandy to any anime fan.",

            "content": "Cowboy Bebop was a very important series for me as an anime fan. When it first appeared on American television with the birth of Cartoon Network's Adult Swim programming block I quickly fell in love. I had enjoyed a number of anime prior to that, but it really did prove to me how evocative and thoroughly entertaining the medium could be. I'd generally credit it with being the singular show that lead me to wanting to seek out other anime on my own in hopes of finding shows just as good or better than it--something I've only successfully done a handful of times even now.It remains a masterful work and deserves every bit of the legacy it holds to this day. \\n\\n\r\nSo, naturally, the people involved in the creative process for Cowboy Bebop are people I would want to follow closely. As it were, the director of the show would release another TV anime a few years later, Samurai Champloo, that while not as good, definitely revealed this man, Shinichiro Watanabe as a leading auteur in the world of anime. That following this he was effectively quiet for a decade, save for some work on OVAs and doing the music for a few things was kind of a shame. He returned to the world of TV animation in 2012 with Kids on the Slope, a series which despite having his name attached I could not work up much of an interest to watch. Two years later, however, we find Watanabe roaming the galaxy once more with another new TV anime, Space Dandy.\\n\\n\r\nTruth be told, Space Dandy was not an easy sell on me either. As much as I loved Cowboy Bebop, I just did not expect much from it. I didn't see anything in the art and character designs that demanded I give it my attention, and with the goofy name and premise I was quick to assume it was something I would be safe to dismiss outright. It wasn't actually until just a week before the end that word of mouth caught up to me and I decided to finally give it a look. Having done so, I'm glad. While this is not Watanabe returning to his Cowboy Bebop form, what it is is a very entertaining and surprisingly rewarding little anime that is well worth a look.\\n\\n\r\nIn all fairness, it's not entirely a Shinichiro Watanabe project in the same sense as Bebop or Champloo was. He is the chief, general director and the auteur who's fingerprints are undeniably all over it, yes, but lots of different directors are brought in to direct different episodes. The same is true of the writers; the series does not have a single main writer working on the composition but instead a number of writers all supplying different episodes. Naturally this leads to inconsistencies from episode to episode, but Space Dandy is built to make it work. Whereas in most series having so many different hands guide the characters in different ways might make for a muddled mess, Space Dandy really embraces an episodic nature, much like Cowboy Bebop, save with even less need for the episodes to follow one another logically.\\n\\n\r\nWith its spacey premise and episodic nature along with Watanabe's touch, it's actually very tempting to call Space Dandy something of a goofy younger sibling to Cowboy Bebop, though the goofiness really needs to be stressed. Cowboy Bebop had a lot of humor and some pretty goofy episodes too, but with Space Dandy silliness is front and center and fairly unrelenting. You might assume that so much wackiness without any weight behind it would get overbearing at times, and you'd probably be a little right. There are moments where the show seems to chug along from one joke to the next and it's all a little obvious really. Still, if you ask me, there is enough that is legitimately funny here to make it worth your time. \\n\\n\r\nReally though, the show is almost more impressive when it sets the goofiness aside just a little and tries to be more earnest. I suppose that while in Cowboy Bebop, some of the most memorable standout episodes were some of the more humorous and whimsical ones, in Space Dandy, it follows that the memorable stuff would be the ones that focus more on mature and genuine character development. Episode five, written by Code Geass' Ichiro Okouchi, was probably the strongest in my opinion, developing Dandy's character in a positive way in 20 minutes than the rest of the series was interested in doing through its entire run. Episode 10, from the series' most regular writer, Kimiko Ueno nearly has the same effect with Meow's character. It could probably honestly have used more episodes that take themselves seriously. Oftentimes all the focus on humor and silliness just makes the lesser episodes feel like diverting filler. The best episodes just overshadow the rest, and make Space Dandy look overall kind of lazy. I'm not sure it's an entirely fair comparison, but Kill la Kill did just prove that an anime can successfully manage a thoroughly ridiculous, over the top and comedic tone and also have strong character development and an engaging core story line. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters themselves are all right, I suppose, though those important character development episodes help to make you care about them beyond their function. It's really important for the main character Dandy, who appears as a rather useless, thickheaded, perverted simpleton that he gets the most moments to redeem him or else the show would just come undone. His two sidekicks, cat alien Meow and robot QT probably could have used some more early character development episodes to make us care about them though. It's kind of strange that the first episode we get trying to develop QT's character in a real way beyond just the useful robot assistant is what caps off the first season. The three of them are enjoyable enough in their antics though, I suppose. It could maybe use more of a supporting cast; most characters that are encountered appear for just an episode.  Exceptions come in the form of waitress Honey and alien inspector Scarlett, two very different women who Dandy regularly is made to visit, though who are yet to really serve much purpose outside of their roles; neither really makes up for the series' lack of a major female protagonist. There is also a chief antagonist in the form of the ape like mad scientist Dr. Gel and his boss Admiral Perry, who appear frequently in the show to generate deus ex machinas or somehow manage to end up looking even more foolish than the unwitting Dandy and his crew.It probably could have done more to establish these villains, their place in the story and what level of threat they actually pose by this point in things. As it is, it's hard to know what to really make of them most of the time.\\n\\n\r\nWhile the plotting is inconsistent and the cast could be stronger, where Space Dandy shines brightest is in it's exquisite production. Studio Bones is fairly known for good work and this is one of their best looking anime yet. It's regularly quite striking, with perfectly smooth animation and gorgeous art. Some episodes, such as episode nine with its psychedelic trip through a bizarre plant world are a complete visual delight. Clearly no expense was spared in making this anime look as good as it could. Sound is great too. Watanabe is a master of making bold musical choices in his anime, and it's the sort of soundtrack we'd expect from him. The opening and ending themes are both really catching and memorable, and there are a lot of cool tracks scattered elsewhere throughout.\\n\\n\r\nUltimately, it's probably the flawless production that allows me to still call Space Dandy a pretty great anime despite some of its more obvious problems and juvenile tendencies. If you want deep and engaging, you're looking at the wrong show, but if you want a fun time, you could do a lot worse than Space Dandy. It is at this point essentially half finished, it's two cours having been split by the spring anime season, but what I've seen thus far is enough to leave me optimistic about what the rest might hold.

            "content": "(With minimal spoilers!)\r\nI had the fun of watching Space Dandy, it was something definitely worthwhile to watch in many ways. It was to say the least... distinct. It felt very fresh to watch something so diverse and\u2026 silly. I guess(?), that would be the best way to describe the tone of this show. It doesn\u2019t really to take itself too seriously, while at the same time I still looked forward to seeing this show every Saturday night. I feel. I know you will enjoy this show for the same reasons I did.\r\nStory \u2013 8\r\nThe story of space dandy is not in any way complex ordeep. It can be summed up in one sentence: Space Dandy and his crew are alien hunters, who hunt aliens through space for money. That\u2019s basically it, but where it really excels is its execution. \\n\r\nFrom the sarcastic narrator, to the pure silliness of the characters, to the many visual gags. This is where this shows excels. It takes the liberty to take the pressure off of themselves and the viewer to deliver something really deep and complex with a lot of symbolism. They simply let you sit back and just watch. Not to say that it\u2019s completely mindless, there are many references to many other things, like western culture, Japanese culture, anime, etc. \\n\r\nWhich is how the main premise of this show comes about. It\u2019s about mocking anime\u2019s nuances/traits: tropes, storylines, characters, animation, plot devices, fan service, and (holy shit) the deus ex machinas. It does it all in a very humorous, silly way; it does it in such a way that it\u2019s almost ridiculous. *Spoiler* For example, even though it\u2019s an episodic series, it makes no logical sense for dandy to die at the beginning of the series. *Spoiler*\\n\\n\r\nAnimation \u2013 9\\n\r\nBones did an amazing job with the animation, and the styles fit every episode perfectly. Mostly because things where designed that way\u2026 Throughout the series, they are constantly changing styles to fit the mood and plot. \\n\r\nThis is again where the parodying comes in, they use a similar style as too what they are trying to mock. Everything from Westerns to Suzumiya Haruhi, from Pacific Rim to vague-anime-you\u2019ve-never-heard-of, is up for grabs for these guys. They did well with mocking each one perfectly, while still maintaining their own style and quality.\\n\\n\r\nSound \u2013 8.5\\n\r\n(Just a note I watched the Dubbed version, but I have heard the Japanese OP and ED)\\n\r\nThe sound was on par with everything. The first OP and ED, are amazing (I also love jazz music). They fit very well with the 90's, tripy-funk, space-adventure feel, the show has to it. It would be honestly something I would listen to everyday, and I don\u2019t listen to anime music in my free time. The OST was something I didn\u2019t notice for some episodes, but when I did notice it fit very well. *Spoiler* Except for episode 11, which completely sets the mood, and was perfect. It had the same mood as Kenji Yamamoto. *Spoiler*\\n\\n\r\nCharacters \u2013 7.5\\n\r\nThe voice actors for each of the characters were perfect. I could not imagine a single character being performed by anyone else. Each of the small nuances and personalities of the characters were spot on, and brought them to life.\\n\r\nDuring the series, they took a little time for the development of the characters, but not very much. But because of the nature of the show, and it being focused \u201call\u201d on dandy that would have felt somewhat weird. So it is passable, barely. The characters were pretty life like because they were each unique and had their own quirks. The narrator also  strangely adds to the cast, with his own personality.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment \u2013 9\\n\r\nI definitely enjoyed Space Dandy, it was simple and yet achieves exactly what\u2019s trying to do. It tries to be more relevant to western audiences, because of the jokes and overall silliness of the show. Which is why I think I enjoyed it so much, because the humor was so natural and fit so well.\\n\r\nOne thing to add, is the narrator who comes in at completely unnecessary times was hilarious.\\n\\n\r\nOverall \u2013 8.4/10\\n\r\nIt is definitely a show worth watching in many ways, and if not for anything else it\u2019s funny and completely smooth at it. After seeing a bunch of shows this season that were very sub-par. This show is definitely the best show of MY season. This show has great production values, the characters are silly but lovable, the soundtrack was very good, and it is flat out hilarious in both: the way it mocks anime and also by itself. As a stand-alone work, Space Dandy does lack, but where it achieves in its inclusion of many cultures and Anime into its own, making it something not unique but something that is distinct in its own way.\\n\r\nExcited for the second season this July!\\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\r\nFeel free to leave some constructive Criticism, by either a pm or comment!

            "content": "Have you ever done something special in your life? Perhaps it was something small and trivial like spinning a basketball on your fingertip or getting a Helpful vote for a review on this site. Maybe it was something that you will forever remember, like winning a video game tournament or having sex for the first time. Whatever the case, if you had done something special, did you try to re-create the magic, to reach those dizzying heights once more? Most people ho manage to do something extraordinary attempt doing it again and they either fail or end up settling for a vague imitation of whatthey\u2019ve done. Shinichiro Watanabe, the most famous anime director not named Hayao Miyazaki, once achieved something special in Cowboy Bebop, for which he was endlessly praised. Bebop, Watanabe\u2019s first project, established a ridiculously high standard that he would have to reach with his other works. Throughout his decorated career, Watanabe spearheaded a multitude of anime series, all receiving solid recommendations but none achieved the all-around excellence, the \u201csomething-for-everyone\u201d magic, of Cowboy Bebop. Realizing that his efforts to create something original wouldn\u2019t be good enough anymore, Watanabe decided to return to his roots and craft another intergalactic space opera of bounty hunters, christening it \u201cSpace Dandy\u201d. \\n\\n\r\n\tFrom the get-go, you can easily spot the similarities between Dandy and Bebop. For one, the wulong is the widely accepted currency in both series. Another, less obvious, hint is that the contaminated fridge from Cowboy Bebop\u2019s Session 11 makes a cameo in episode 8 of Space Dandy. It\u2019s obvious that Space Dandy is set in the same universe as Bebop but these two shows are so fundamentally different. What made Cowboy Bebop special, among other things, was its talent for world-building, how the setting was carefully crafted to perfection. The thing about Bebop\u2019s universe was that although it was set in the future, it was still grounded in reality whereas the world of Dandy is so expansive and discombobulated that the feeling of continuity is gone. Then, there are the characters\u2026\\n\\n\r\n\tMore than anything else, Cowboy Bebop was a show about people. From the cooler-than-cool protagonist Spike Spiegel down to the side-note trio of old men, this series portrayed its cast with painstaking amounts of emotion and depth that every character registered as realistic. With Space Dandy, however, the effort just isn\u2019t there. Dandy (voiced by Ian Sinclair) is the titular character of the show; his overzealous speeches, hair-brained schemes, and memorable one-liners craftily cover up Dandy\u2019s lack of dimensions and character development. Dandy\u2019s sidekicks QT the vacuum cleaner and Meow the cat are barely worth mentioning. In a show chock-full of bizarre characters, in appearance and/or personality, it\u2019s more than a tad frustrating that the only intriguing one (excluding Dandy) is the narrator (voiced by R. Bruce Elliot). Space Dandy\u2019s narrator, in essence, is simply a bored viewer like the rest of us. He sometimes falls asleep. He gets aroused during fan-service moments. He occasionally forgets important elements of the show. He even yells at the characters when he\u2019s irritated.\\n\\n\r\nI too get upset at Space Dandy from time to time.\\n\\n\r\n\tWhy? It\u2019s because this show is afraid. It\u2019s afraid to venture outside the norm. It\u2019s afraid to take risks. It\u2019s afraid to attempt something groundbreaking. Instead, Space Dandy settles for doing what\u2019s already been done before, albeit with a distinctive deviation. Don\u2019t think so? Well, listen to what the ever-quotable Dandy has to say:\\n\\n\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t fight it. Going against the flow means you\u2019re swimming in place. One day, you\u2019re too tired to paddle and then suddenly you drown. Whole thing was pointless and now you\u2019re dead. The end. No, going with the flow is where it\u2019s at and that\u2019s (cue dramatic pause) the Dandy Way to live,\u201d \u2013 from episode 1\\n\\n\r\nIronic, huh?\\n\\n\r\n\tSpace Dandy\u2019s animation is, without a doubt, the crown jewel of this series. It\u2019s mercurial (in a good way). It\u2019s stunning. It\u2019s abstract. It\u2019s stylish. It\u2019s absolute eye candy. And yet, this show\u2019s beautiful, beautiful surface does little to conceal its incredibly bland humor (I laughed exactly twice in this season) and scarcity of dramatic appeal (When your MC dies in episode 1, inexplicably resurrects in episode 2, and forgets about episode 1, there\u2019s no reason to sympathize with anyone in life-threatening situations). By the way, Cowboy Bebop possessed ample amounts of humor and drama.\\n\\n\r\n\tThe finale to Space Dandy\u2019s season one failed to redeem this series but it was most certainly impressive. What began as an intriguing and heartwarming tale of romance evolved into a high-stakes showdown between a pissed-off army of machines ready to destroy mankind and a lone vacuum cleaner (QT) willing to save it (Oh, and there\u2019s a really cool cameo from Brandon Potter, who\u2019s among my favorite VAs ever). It was episode 13 that caused me to appreciate the most outstanding qualities of Space Dandy. The amusing previews do a fantastic job at maintaining the viewers\u2019 interest. As mentioned, Space Dandy presents what\u2019s been done before with a unique twist to it (Its portrayal of time loops and shape shifters are especially enjoyable). Every now and then, the show includes some magnificent moments, unforgettable scenes that truly capture the imagination, like the surfboard sequence at the end of episode 6. With Space Dandy, I finally feel as though Shinichiro Watanabe has stopped aiming for the next Cowboy Bebop and simply wanted to let loose with this project, and the result has been quite entertaining to watch.\\n\\n\r\nHere\u2019s to Season Two, Baby!\\n",

            "content": "For me at least, it\u2019s rather hard to find a anime comedy that isn't a romantic comedy or full of referential humor I likely won\u2019t get. So seeing stuff like Space Dandy is truly a breath of fresh air, even if it's more in the vein of a western cartoon (though this show is much better than some of the stuff you\u2019ll see in Adult Swim).\r\nStory and Characters (6/10):\r\nSpace Dandy is a rather odd one to review. Being a bit similar to western cartoons in that there is no continuity whatsoever, this can lead to some comedy gold though at the same time lead tosome forgettable episodes. Each of the episodes seem to have their own story with no relation to one another, so rather than review the show as a whole, I\u2019ll review each episode briefly and individually to show the good, the bad, and the Dandy. Besides the first episode, you can watch any of the episodes in any order.\\n\\n\r\nLive With the Flow, Baby (2/5)- The start of the episode was trying a bit too hard at being self-aware. More of an introductory episode so at least see this for some exposition and how the characters meet. Not really that funny and the ending is rather abrupt, and not in a good way.\\n\\n\r\nThe Search For the Phantom Space Ramen, Baby (3/5)- That ending to the first episode\u2026 just forget about it, this shows the obvious lack on continuity. However, this episode is definitely more creative than the first. Not much comedy in this one, although the story of the alien is a decent, touching tale. Scarlett is introduced, although she\u2019s basically the serious tsundere character of the series and not much more.\\n\\n\r\nOccasionally Even the Deceiver is Deceived, Baby (3/5)- Not much to say on this one. A lot of the laughs come from an impending plot twist, which was pretty funny. So people, Is It Wrong to Try to Pick Up Girls in a Empty Planet? Yes.\\n\\n\r\nSometimes You Can\u2019t Live With Dying, Baby (4.5/5)- This was when I knew Space Dandy could be something truly special. It starts off as the usual tired Zombie episode. But, the second half, my goodness. So much irony, so much creative gags, and so much you can do with life insurance. This the best comedy episode of the season.\\n\\n\r\nA Merry Companion Is a Wagon in Space, Baby (3.5/5)- This is the episode that Space Dandy proved it can be taken seriously. There isn\u2019t much gags, but this episode is more of a feel good episode so that can be excused. Adelie is an interesting character, but due to the status quo nature of the series, we won\u2019t be seeing her after this which is a shame since if you've seen Cowboy Bebop, she could have been the Edward of the Series.\\n\\n\r\nThe War of the Undies and Vests, Baby (2.5/5)- Meh, not really a memorable episode. I mean Underwear people versus Vest people? I usually don\u2019t enjoy argument episodes (remember \"The Great Divide\" from Last Airbender, well that was a travesty), and the same holds true here. While the history of the war is amusing, the only gag I laughed at was with our unlucky baddie, Dr. Gel.\\n\\n\r\nA Race in Space Is Dangerous, Baby (3.5/5)- Being a parody of classic racing cartoons, this is a pretty funny homage. Having not seen said cartoons, I couldn't really appreciate some of the gags, but even so the episode was still entertaining. That ending was really something though. Space Dandy has this thing where it tends to give the most over-exaggerated, bizarre ending possible and in this case I think it was a bit too random for its own good.\\n\\n\r\nThe Lonely Pooch Planet, Baby (2/5)- Not really a fan of this one. Jumps from a \u201cMarley and Me\u201d type story to an avenge story to another destruction of a planet story. None of these plots really blended well for me and it was jarring for the most part. At least Dr. Gel was able to give me another good laugh, that poor, poor guy.\\n\\n\r\nPlants Are Living Things, Too, Baby (3.5/5)- Another serious episode, this one is definitely the most atmospheric. The Meow storyline wasn't really needed though to be honest. The artistic design for this was beautiful, the environment was breathtaking, and the character designs were very original. However, the ending was surprisingly sad and Dandy\u2019s reaction just didn't feel right.\\n\\n\r\nThere's Always Tomorrow, Baby (4.5/5)- If the Zombie episode was the best comedic episode, then this episode was the best at a serious tone. Great character story and development from Meow. The story takes a groundhog day approach which led to some great gags and a very well done story. Bonus points for a certain couple haha.\\n\\n\r\nI'm Never Remembering You, Baby (3/5)- This episode was a bit confusing as it relies a lot on memory gags. It was fairly enjoyable and the ending is classic Dandy randomness. Other than that, there\u2019s not much to this one, it\u2019s quite forgettable.\\n\\n\r\nNobody Knows the Chameleon Alien, Baby (4/5)- A very funny impersonation episode. Unlike the last one, this is confusing done right. There isn\u2019t really a resolution, but it actually adds to the main gag \u201cWho\u2019s the real Dandy?\u201d. This episode reminded me a lot of \u201cImitation Krabs\u201d from \u201cSpongebob\u201d which is a great thing and in fact this episode still has more funny tricks up its sleeve.\\n\\n\r\nEven Vacuum Cleaners Fall in Love, Baby (3.5/5)- A decent, romance episode for QT. It\u2019s a cute episode to watch and it definitely adds character to QT. The relationship between QT and Maker was believable, which is an amazing feat in just a 22 minute episode. The episode pokes some fun at the mecha genre in a certain scene which I thought was pretty amusing. It's not really last episode material, but still a fine episode.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation (9/10): \\n\\n\r\nStudio Bones once again proves their talents with great animation and art that blends so well with Space Dandy\u2019s wild universe. Some episodes such as the Plant episode may have different animation, but this really isn't an animation drop, but rather different directors handling a episode with their own style. And these different, creative styles show the flexibility and range Space Dandy has. There may be some slight animation inconsistencies, but the presentation still greatly overshadows this.\\n\\n\r\nSound (7/10):\\n\\n\r\nThe first opening is a bit similar to Cowboy Bebop which kind of gets in the way of the show\u2019s identity. Nevertheless, its still awesome jazz although its short runtime is a bit odd. The second opening is more like it. Its pop beat catchy and blends well with the fun nature of the show, and the animation is filled with some great, corny, Dandy style.\\n\\n\r\nFor a Watanabe show, Space Dandy\u2019s OST doesn\u2019t stand out as much as his previous works. But even so, the funky and original beats combined with some jazz are still a joy to listen to and it blends so well with the show. It may not have the charismatic pizazz of Cowboy Bebop or the chill, \u201cI could play this forever\u201d beat of Samurai Champloo, but Space Dandy still has its own auditory identity and that's something many shows these days lack.\\n\\n\r\nConclusion:\\n\\n\r\nDon\u2019t watch Space Dandy expecting a story with continuity or depth. This show is definitely experimental with a few really funny episodes as well as a fair share of okay ones and then some weak ones. Its inconsistent, but I still had a blast. Watch this as you would watch a Western Cartoon and I guarantee you\u2019ll have a laugh at least once. I give Space Dandy a 6/10.",

            "content": "Space Dandy was a show I was very excited for, from the very first preview I saw. Being headed by director Shinichiro Watanabe, who I've been a fan of for a long time, I naturally came into it with high expectations. The show didn't meet those expectations, for a few reasons, yet... the entire thing still manages to be very enjoyable, and even beautiful at times.\r\nI watched the 5.1 English Dub, and it sounded great. I liked the choice of sound effects, and the audio mix ended up being very nicely done. The soundtrack has some great songs in it, all of which fit thetone of the world. The voice acting was well done, too. Each of the actors gave their character exactly the right kind of personality, and were able to keep the tone of the Japanese version, while still making the lines sound perfectly natural in English.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of the characters, I felt the main cast were all very well designed, and have a very iconic-looking, Watanabe art style. They're also all very different from each other, not only in terms of design, but also in terms of personality. This means that they often end up clashing with each other, which makes for some really good character moments. The crew also seems to grow closer to each other over the course of the episodes, and by episode 13, they all feel very fleshed-out and memorable. However, as much as I love the main cast, a lot of the supporting cast seems to feel very one-dimensional, especially the main antagonists.\\n\\n\r\nThis is where the problems start. Space Dandy's story seems like it's much more concerned with simply making jokes and doesn't bother with consistency or any type of over-arching plotline. Most episodes have narrative elements that seem well thought out at first, but end up being incredibly self-contained, never to be re-visited. Because of this, much of the character-development gets snubbed, as does the world... which generally feels like a new universe with each passing episode. Of course, it's not all bad. Some of the episodes end up being very memorable, and the overall style of the directing really helps to tell the stories that do get told. It's just too bad most of these stories end up being completely nonsensical, the butt of a joke, or some type of satirical element.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, the show really brings it home in the art department. It's fantastically animated, using many impressive, jaw-dropping techniques commonly only seen in animated feature films. The show also makes great use of color, and the art style is well suited to the diverse nature of the worlds that Dandy & crew end up visiting. There's so much variety to it all! As much as that's a bad thing for the story, I feel it does wonders for the art. It seems a ton of time and effort was put into making every inch of this show just look absolutely gorgeous.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, the show is incredible to look at, but if you're looking for an interesting story, I'd say you should definitely look elsewhere. The characters are fun, and the jokes are funny, but the stories are really only there in service of everything else. In the end, Space Dandy manages to be a fun, entertaining show, with some gorgeous looking art... but it lacks any real substance, which ends up being it's one major flaw. This prevents me from giving it an incredible rating, and instead, I simply give it an 8/10.",

            "content": "Stylistically sound and surprisingly fresh, \"Space Dandy\" is by no means a masterpiece, but then again I don't think it tried to be. Watanabe, Shinichiro is a man with a solid vision for his works, and you can tell. From \"Cowboy Bebop\" to \"Samurai Champloo\" Watanabe has forged a very recognizable rhythm that each of his tales match too. Whether it be jazz or Hip Hop, Watanabe has an unmatched \"swagger\" no matter what direction he takes. So if I were to try to describe what path \"Space Dandy\" took, well, lets just say it was groovy. Oh baby was it groovy. \r\nStory: 7/10 \r\nThisfunky adventure through space (even time) was one sporadic ride, and this more or less senseless journey was at the end of the day at least unique. Now unique is actually a huge complement (I know surprising right), Watanabe has one hell of an imagination, and this show is a testament to it. Voyaging across 13 episodes in the first season the story remains relatively episodic as it goes from adventure to adventure. Each contained story at bare minimum kept my attention, and at the most engaged my senses with its \"acid dropping\" narrative. From this handful of stories there was plenty of fun to be had, but the general lack of focus might turn people away. It does what it went for well, but at the end of the day it has been done better (hell by shows from Watanabe himself). This leaves us very lopsided in terms of the shows narrative, but because most of the episodes manage to hit their mark with remarkable accuracy the overall product comes out well for it.  \\n\\n\r\nArt: 8/10 \\n\\n\r\nVibrantly colorful, and distinctly stylistic \"Space Dandy\" mixes together a very solid art direction with various blends of masterful camera work. The story boarding alone was incredibly well done. All of these aspects come together to make some wonderful eye candy, and helped the show stay fresh throughout by adding various new visual morsels for your eyes to devour. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 9/10 \\n\\n\r\nI don't usually phrase my input quite this crass, but I have to say this \"Shit's so cash\". Original, groovy, funky, and well dandy; it mixes together so many different vibes that it effortlessly bounces around from story to story. It not only matches each one on an individual level, but ties the show itself together in such a distinct rhythm that you find yourself moving along to the beat. Much like what Watanabe did with his previous works, he found the right swing, and the show grooves along to it. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 6/10 \\n\\n\r\nThis for me was the weakest point of the show. Dandy and crew were quite the enjoyable group of individuals, but unlike the vastness of space there just wasn't that much there. Dandy himself was interesting, and every episode I looked forward to learning more about this dandy in space. He was charismatic, self centered, and kind of an ass hat. However in certain moments throughout the show we had glimpses at some other qualities to this dandy man. Although brash and poser like, I was still engaged into seeing more about this roguish character who proclaimed himself to be a \"great\" bounty hunter. Sadly Dandy himself was the only real \"charm\" that the show had going for it. Meow and QT, although excellent side editions, didn't really have the same draw or appeal. Both of them were pretty much one note except in their respective character episodes, which tried to further evolve who these people were. Sadly they just come up even in the end, and don't really do much. The show is Dandy's, and it makes no attempt to hide this fact. \\n\\n\r\nAs for the collection of other characters like the Dr. Gel, Admiral Perry, and other individuals that Dandy meets on his journey they were serviceable. Out of the lot who were restricted to their one episode my favorites were Ad\u00e9lie and Prince.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nI had a load of fun with \"Space Dandy\", and can't wait for season 2 to air. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7/10 \\n\\n\r\n\"Space Dandy\" is about a Dandy in space, and his grand adventures across the cosmos. Although missing the mark from time to time, Watanabe still manages to pump this show full of style, and creativity. It isn't quite \"Cowboy Bebop\" or \"Samurai Champloo\", but it is something wonderful. In the vastness of space where Anime seems to run the same tired scripts over and over again it was nice to something this fresh. Dandy may not be Captain Kirk, but this space traveler tries his hardest to go where no man has gone before. \\n",

            "content": "Mixed feelings. I deeply enjoyed the sakuga sequences, Meow's character, and various scenes and designs scattered throughout. However, for a fun pastime Dandy can come across as lukewarm depending on how tolerant of wasted potential you are. Not saying it doesn't take its concepts somewhere, but more like the canvas is so big it begs for things to transcend what one would expect. While the show does have its fair share of surprising twists, it mostly plays out like a Watanabe series, filled with predictable jokes and perfunctory resolutions. Its carefree nature excuses most of its underthinking, but just the thought that it could befar better and push its ideas much further bothers me. Conceptually, Space Dandy isn't far from something like Rick & Morty. The execution, however, shows the gargantuan distance between the two.",

            "content": "The Space Dandy anime is an anime with Dandy in space. \r\nComing from Shinichiro Watanabe, the director of Cowboy Bebop and Samurai Champloo, and animated by Studio Bones, Space Dandy is easily one of the most high profile show to air in the Winter 2014 season.  It takes in space and follows three alien hunters on the spaceship, the Aloha Oe, as they get caught up in various antics.  \r\nSetting itself apart from most shows, which have an overarching plot, Space Dandy takes a different approach to its narrative. Watanabe sets up the core foundations of the three main characters and lets thewriters and animators on his team loose in the Space Dandy playground. Highlights include a fresh take on the zombie genre, reuniting a small alien girl with her grandfather and  a race that is reminiscent of Outlaw Stars and Redline. However, there is little to connect all the various stories together and some episodes don't hit it quite on the mark. To its credit, the consistency in the quality of episodes is quite good as opposed to other shows like Panty and Stocking, which had some sub-par moments.        \\n\\n\r\nMaking up for the inherent weakness that the episodic structure brings, the visuals do not disappoint in the less. Depending on the episode, the vast range of artistic style that is presented is a testament to the talent of Studio Bones. Colors are bright and varied and the motion is well animated. The aliens design are creative and fit with wild universe of Space Dandy.  \\n\\n\r\nUnprecedented for an anime, Space Dandy is available in subs or dub at the same time. As for the question of sub or dub, I prefer the dub as the main character has that 50s American character design and it matches up much better than the Japanese. The other voices do an adequate job and flows well with the fun light hearted nature of the show. In the music department, the soundtracks have great chemistry with whatever episode is playing , whether is a frantic race through space or a psychedelic  journey on a planet filled with plants.       \\n\\n\r\nOverall, Space Dandy is a pleasant show that excel in taking a set concepts and taking it to new creative heights on a week to week basis. \\n",

Space Dandy doesn't really have a direction (well so far even though it been 18 episodes). But honestly I don't think anybody really cares where its going. It's just a fun anime to watch. I like to watch it because of the art direction in each episode. No two episodes are the same and I really enjoy that. You honestly can never expect what adventures Dandy, Meow, and QT are going to run into next. The music is great like in almost all Shinichiro Watanabe animes.

            "content": "Gag series are quite a handful to keep up with, they are all about the jokes, logic and common sense don't have to apply, they never hold back into diving into fantasies and referencing pop culture icons, each one of those rules of thumb is hard enough to nail as an individual aspect of making up a solid series, but Space\u2606Dandy hammers each one of them like a professional, baby.\r\nStory (8.5/10):\r\nWhat's really flexible about similar shows is that they don't have to follow a linear storyline to be called a proper show with its ups and downs, this is literally like a youtuber from the2016-2018 era, today's' video is a vlog, and tomorrow's is a let's play, it's all about the variety of content and emitting repetition, there is a special appreciation that goes along with starting up a new episode almost from scratch, not knowing what it will be about, probably the last one was all cheery and happy, but nothing is stopping this one to be different, a little more about a sad backstory or a depressing turn of events, baby.\\n\\n\r\nlooking from a very 3rd person view, a trio of weirdos composed of an intelligent vacuum cleaner looking robot named QT whose chips have grown dated, a talking cat alien that draws a lot from the modern definition of otaku. We're talking about an obsession with social media, Anime styled games, and of course, likes his fair share of boobies. And finally and more importantly, the dandiest man in space, space dandy, with his marvelous Elvis-influenced hairstyle and his unique taste in clothing, a respected slave of the booty and a regular at the galactic restaurant called \u201cBoobies\u201d, along they spend their days hunting down rare alien species for a living, baby.\\n\\n\r\nIt sounds simple enough, but don't let that fool you into thinking that they have one definitive goal at the end of the day, yes, they may be alien hunters (That sounds badass), but they are not tied to an end goal, all they want is to drop by \u201cBoobies\u201d and have a sweet glass of beer at the end of a hard hunting day, nothing like saving the world or delivering on a prophecy matters here, baby.\\n\\n\r\nThere were some unfortunate drawbacks on its episodic serialization, while some episodes were just phenomenal, you could almost flesh out an entire seasonal series out of that amazing 24 minutes of content into its own standalone plotline if you wanted to. Some other episodes (Only one to be more precise) were a bit bad directed, their concept was just amazing, no, probably one of the best concepts presented in this series, but it just didn't have the best direction and storyboarding to compliment it. And let me tell you, some episodes were the best I've seen in any entertainment medium, baby.\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt (9/10):\\n\r\nThere is something mysterious that always scream of \u201cAmerican\u201d when you put space and Elvis into a mix, not only on paper but they managed to carry on that ideology on the artwork as well, I believe that I had trained my eyes enough for it to confidently tell an Anime and a cartoon apart, and I still can't spot anything that tells me this show was not some ordinary American cartoon aside from it being labeled as an Anime. Which is not a bad thing, baby.\\n\\n\r\nDuring the fast-paced action-packed scenes, the animation looked surreal, so fluid and tasty to the eye you would beg for your eyes to be stuck on an eternal loop on that same exact scene, to think that this degree of amazing Saguka would work with an art style like this and with a perfect juxtaposition too, baby.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound (9.5/10):\\n\r\nNow, before we get controversial, I've watched the DUB version and let me tell you, and I have taken a closer look to both versions, but the DUB here blows the SUB by a large margin, I mean, it's not even close.\\n\r\nThe SUB version is decent, on the same level of every other SUBed show, however, the DUB was just godly, and you can only feel the animation look more solid being handled by an English voice acting, it just works so well.\\n\r\nMost of the jokes have a strange western vibe to them so it only feels more natural to hear them in DUB rather than to read them as subtitles, baby.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtracks were phenomenal, those buttle fluid frames? Oh, they look even better when you layer the soundtrack on top of them, it's like the same thing with Cowboy Bebop all over again, something so retro about them that make them work in this setting, and oh boy do they vary, there are the hyperactive ones for action moments, the sad ones for the gloomy moments, I mean, there are even ones that sound flirty by nature that go so well with Dandy's pickup lines, baby.\\n\\n\r\nNot to be harsh on the opening and ending sequences as they are only being spoken about this late. I can't stress this enough.\\n\r\nThe DUBed version of the show had two opening sequences due to some strange reason, the original opening sequence was only used until halfway through the series, as the first one was never used in the subbed version, and that's where I have to stack up for my boys, both of them were amazing. They sounded so simplistic and boy do they put you in the spirit, baby.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacter (8.5/10):\\n\r\nObviously, this isn't a character heavy plot that relies on edge cutting character development or anything of that nature. There are some guys that honestly relate to most of the audience despite being from a distant future were memes actually still a thing (Confirmed by QT), this is a show about the gags and the jokes, and those guys are supposed to be like those guys you want to hang out with, they are likable and that was the point.\\n\r\nDespite the trio being so incompatible with one another, they always find some way to interact like buddies to give you the impression that they mean more than family to each other where they are most of the time ready to kiss each other goodbye for good on life-threatening moments, baby.\\n\\n\r\nSomething that really set this show apart from anything I've watched, is that even the narrator felt more of the main character than most of the off-screened naruto characters from the hidden leaf. The dude sounded so chill, often broke the fourth wall and even contributed in steering down the action in the show, and it was glorious, baby.\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (9/10):\\n\r\nThere is a lot to like about this series, and too little to hate unless you just want to nitpick every mico-sized flaw there is.\\n\r\nA lot of people would complain about the bad pacing of the series or at sometimes, the lack of action, but really, not every episode is going to be about skyscraper-sized robots exchanging epic blows, the varying mini-stories were just the best, from referencing the astronaut doggo Laika to a very wholesome family-centered episode with Meow. It just felt home being in front from the screen while watching the Aloha Oe (The name of their spaceship) crew rocking it up, baby.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall (8.7/10):\\n\r\nFirst of all, sorry about the excessive use of \u201cbaby\u201d to end every paragraph, that was just my tribute to the series, and will probably do the same when I review the second season.\\n\r\nThis was one show that I never knew would make me beg for more, and to my luck, there is already a second season. A really underrated comedy centered Anime series, it really is heavy on satire and ridicule it definitely deserves the time of every comedy fanatic out there, even if they weren't into Anime, baby.",

            "content": "(7.5/10)\r\nThis is a show about a Dandy... in space...\r\nAnd in a way,  it isn't. This episodic space-romp full of pop-culture references, boobies, monsters, chase-sequences, and physical gags serves as an outlet for animators and storyboarders to create some of the coolest and most well-choreographed pieces of animation in televised anime history.\r\nNot only that, it gives Shinichiro Watanabe, the director of Cowboy Bebop the ability to travel back out into space with a bigger budget and bigger, wackier ideas. Letting go of the reigns and seeing where the space cruiser takes him. \r\nHowever, at its core, it's also a very inconsistent show. It makes sensewhy, since there are so many different people working on all the different episodes, but regardless if it's logical, it's still frustrating. Space Dandy has bouts of absolute mind-blowing greatness but also depression-filled states of dull, boring, and unfunny episodes. It's the definition of a mixed bag, which makes the idea of pushing it from a \"good\" show to a \"Very good\" show very hard, grading wise. \\n\\n\r\nBut lets get into why!\\n\\n\r\n______________________________________________________________\\n\\n\r\n[ART]\\n\\n\r\n______________________________________________________________\\n\\n\r\nAs I've said, this is the most impressively animated piece of televised anime I've ever seen. Maybe it isn't a marvel when it comes to something like shot composition and art direction, but it's vibrant and full of energy. It's the opposite of something like Fate/Zero, which tries really hard to look pretty at all times but sacrifices any actual movement or animation for that. \\n\\n\r\nSpace Dandy jumps around on screen making goofy faces with spectacularly beautiful scenery and hair-raising action sequences. The characters bend and contort out of their designs constantly, making it undoubtedly cartoonish. But that's what they're going for. \\n\\n\r\nThe consistently creative monster designs are paired with equally creative space ship designs which put the likes of Cowboy Bebop to shame. It appears that when Shinichiro decides to go goofy, his designs improve drastically. Everything from the villainous Dr.Gel and his awesome spaceship that's pretty much the statue of liberty's head with a ball gag to  the Aloha Oe's sleek yellow exterior reminds me of distinctly 60's sci-fi that's unfortunately often forgotten about.\\n\\n\r\nI got a lot of Dune vibes, especially the unfortunately unmade Dune film by Alejandro Jodorowsky. Small plug here, if you haven't seen \"Jodorowsky's Dune\", the documentary, you should!\\n\\n\r\n...\\n\\n\r\nThe spaceship and creature designs aren't the only thing standing out, either. With our main characters being distinctly malleable and creative, especially Space Dandy himself, who sports a leather jacket and sick pompadour is one of the most creative looking anime MC's I've ever seen. He's also one of my favorites. More on that later. \\n\\n\r\n...\\n\\n\r\nTo round everything up. We have spectacular animation that puts 99.99% of televised anime to complete shame. We have great creature designs. We have great character designs overall. Fantastic action sequences devoid of any filler, focusing solely on creating something frantic, memorable, and funny., and lastly, a solid list of guest animators that all do their jobs splendidly.\\n\\n\r\nSome episodes may look similar to others, but certain episodes completely stand out in terms of animation. Not just in quality, but in style. Specifically, episode 9 was jaw-droppingly pretty and one of the most memorable parts of the show. \\n\\n\\n\r\n______________________________________________________________\\n\\n\r\n[SOUND]\\n\\n\r\n______________________________________________________________\\n\\n\r\nIt's very good. Especially for a TV anime. The sound effects range from corny to impactful, but that's what the show needs. It's entire personality is that. From the goofy character reactions to the ships zooming through space, everything has a sound effect and these sound effects add to the entire likability of the show. \\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is almost wholly exceptional, too. Ranging from guitar riffs to whole songs created specifically for this show. To my surprise, there's a distinct lack of that generic J-pop that plagues just about every anime known to man. Instead, the director and writers, I assume, decided to use a less generic and more interesting approach with a wide variety of tracks. \\n\\n\r\nThe intro is catchy and vibrant, fitting the theme of the show, and the ED is equally great. The sound design is very solid overall. \\n\\n\\n\r\n______________________________________________________________\\n\\n\r\n[CHARACTER + STORY]\\n\\n\r\n______________________________________________________________\\n\\n\r\nThese are going to be in one section because more often than not, the story comes from the characters and vice versa.  As I said in my introduction, this show is very clunky in terms of its storytelling being consistent. \\n\\n\r\nOne episode is making me misty-eyed and another episode is just frustrating me with it's daftness. On one hand it makes some of the great episodes truly stand out. On the other hand, it makes the not-so-great episodes truly stand out too. \\n\\n\r\n...\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe writers created our protagonists as lovable doofuses, but more importantly, as people (or robots) with actual character. I often criticize anime with just throwing a bunch of quirks into a character and calling it a day. Which makes a quirky thing, but not really a character.\\n\\n\r\nA real character that you remember is one that not only speaks to you, but also shows themselves to you. Someone you feel like you understand, especially if they are the protagonists. \\n\\n\r\nHere, just about every main character is someone I grew to not only like, but also understand. This is doubly the more impressive since the show is by no means serialized and every episode is something completely different. This level of characterization is very hard to accomplish. This show does that. \\n\\n\r\nWhere this show falls a little flat character-wise is in it's secondary characterization. Just about every secondary character is either forgettable or simply there to propel the characters forward. Even the villains just kind of get brushed to the side, and the gag that they play through every episode can feel a little dull and played out by the end of this shows thirteen episode run. \\n\\n\r\n...\\n\\n\\n\r\nSpace Dandy does nail it every so often though. I don't mean in a \"hey, that's a good episode of cartoon!\" Kinda nail. I mean a \"Holy shit, now that's something that I might never forget,\" level good. Specifically three different episodes became some of my favorite pieces of short-form storytelling this year. Surprisingly, each one did that in a completely different way. \\n\\n\\n\r\nWith Episode 5 we have Shinichiro do his signature 'emotion in the face of comedy' routine by bringing in an adorable little girl that Dandy must be around... no spoilers. She is the shows most memorable secondary character, from her heart-splittingly adorable design to great VA work she left her mark on the episode, and me. This episodes saccharine personality never felt like it wasn't earned. \\n\\n\r\nWith Episode 7 there was a redline-esq race that is one of the most breathtaking pieces of action in television anime. This matched with some genuinely funny lines makes for a really solid and memorable episode.\\n\\n\r\nWith Episode 9 comes the best use of a guest animator in the show. Eunyoung Choi handled the dazzling storyboards for the this episode. But where I thought the animation would surely be the highlight (and it was, in a way), the episode packs a really great melancholy touch towards the end. \\n\\n\r\n...\\n\\n\r\nThese three episodes elevate the show from a beautiful experiment that generally ignores great storytelling in favor of eye-catching animation to a show that occasionally gives a perfect mix of both. \\n\\n\r\nMatched with a narrator that serves not only as a devise of exposition, but also as a humorous touch, consistently breaking the fourth wall, there really isn't too much to dislike in terms of progression.\\n\\n\r\n...\\n\\n\r\nThat being said, the show is generally never side-splittingly funny. Which is, unfortunately, an issue. There are undoubtedly parts where I let out a soft guffaw or smirk, but for the most part, I simply sat back and enjoyed some of the bathos and more surreal elements mixed in with a small amount of sobering storytelling.\\n\\n\r\nThere really isn't much in terms of actual humor of substance apart from some very specific and memorable scenes. The humor in Space Dandy can be described in the same way the entire shows personality can. It's vibrant, goofy, frantic, but may often feel empty when held up to scrutiny. However, occasionally, it really really nails it. \\n\\n\\n\r\n______________________________________________________________\\n\\n\r\n[CONCLUSION]\\n\\n\r\n______________________________________________________________\\n\\n\r\nSo's the life of a show that by nature isn't consistent. Bringing in different writers and storyboard artists between episodes can make the show feel understandably disjointed. Sometimes for the better, but sometimes for the worse. \\n\\n\r\nIt is, however, truly impressive that the show managed to do what it has done with it's characters in a setting that really doesn't call for it. The amount of connection I felt with the protagonists as well as a very small amount of secondaries was nothing short of impressive. Especially for a show that doesn't really have any hints at serialization at all. \\n\\n\r\nIt's a dynamic journey into a world with no rules, laws, or restrictions. Let go of the reigns and soak on the madness.",

            "content": "There really are a variety of anime around aren't there. This anime was probably the highlight of the winter season compared to Kill La Kill which lost its overall promise easily. Standard hype strategy of start with a bang, end with a dissapointment. But space dandy is different. As much as I despise the Gintama-esque animes such a dandy, I enjoyed Dandy thoroughly as it was the best of the winter 2013-14 season. \r\nStory 5/10\r\nThis anime is very experimental and reminded me of the tatami galaxy because every episode seemed like a different 'world line' of the Space Dandy galaxy. Every episode is different andmay be unique or just completely flat. I get that each episode had different directors, but the show's execution was done in a way that was boring at times with no merit. Even though that being said, I really loved those 'unique' episodes as they were very well done. But really there is no story other than the fact that it's about 1 human 1 Talking Cat and 1 Robot trying to catch aliens with a ambiguous 'to be continued' sign at the end. The overall episodes are somewhat enjoyable, but nothing to be amazed at except for those few gem episodes. \\n\\n\r\n9/10\\n\r\nArt's really good and reminds me of the old style animation while being somewhat modern at the same time.  Animation is top-notch with little to no rough edges. \\n\\n\r\nMusic 10/10\\n\r\nThe music is outstanding, esp. the ED/OP of the anime. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter 9/10\\n\r\nSpace dandy like Cowboy Bebop is more about the ride rather than the destination. The characters are all likable and even the side characters are thoroughly explained unlike the latter of TV shows. They are all interesting and likable, but the fact that most side characters are thrown away after an episode makes me wonder the question, why even include them. Well just waiting for the next season. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 8/10\\n\r\nI throughly enjoyed this experiemental anime show as it was unique in its own way. There were a few unique episodes which I absolutely loved, but most of space dandy's episodes were either dull or not even worth mentioning. Even though, I didn't like the episodes itself, I loved the characters inside it. \\n\\n\r\nOverall 7/10\\n\r\nOverall it's a fun ride to watch dandy, but I found it very difficult to review because of the fact that every episode was different in its own way whether they are bad or good. I would definately watch this anime at the expense of free time, but it's not a must-watch.",

            "content": "I watched Space Dandy since it first started airing, and it quickly became one of my favorites. It's not for everyone: it's a bit experimental and really meta, but if you're into that kind of thing, it's nothing short of a masterpiece. \r\nStory: 8\r\nUnlike most anime, Space Dandy has almost no continuity aside from the last two episodes. Characters come and go without explanation, and it isn't uncommon for the main cast to die at the end of an episode and show up just fine in the next. I really like this, though: I'm easily distracted, and as much as I love the concept ofspace operas, their convoluted storylines can get in the way of my enjoyment. \\n\r\nI also think this means each episode's story is more developed: some episodes are silly, some are cute, some are heartwrenching, but almost all of them are interesting, entertaining, and immersive.  Even the final two episodes, the only ones that can be considered plot-relevant, sufficiently wrapped up a story I didn't want to see end to begin with in a satisfying way.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8\\n\r\nI love the art in this show, but I can't objectively give it higher than an 8 because of the mediocre animation quality, which I think can get a lot of people. The movement direction, color and layout, and general aesthetic is amazing, but the series's budget really shows in most episodes' lack of fluid animation and occasional off-model distance shots. \\n\r\nThe art particularly shines in the second season, which had a number of guest animation directors that showed their distinctive styles. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 9\\n\r\nThe opening and ending themes are great: the opening gets me pumped and the ending makes me feel good, just like I think good music should. I wish they could have had different openings and endings between the seasons, but the series was already clearly pushing its budget. \\n\r\nThe background music is also very good. It's usually very jazzy, doesn't steal the spotlight, but adds excitement or poignancy to a scene. \\n\r\nI watched most of the series dubbed, but I have seen a few episodes in Japanese. Both are good, but as I'm easily distract--I mean, like to multitask,  I'm more of a dub person, and the dub is fantastic. It's a little hammy, which is perfect for an over-the-top space opera, but not so hammy that I ended up mockingly repeating half the lines out loud because of their awful delivery (which I end up doing with a lot of poorly voice-directed dubs). \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 8\\n\r\nBecause of the series's episodic nature, most of the characters don't get a lot of deep development. But the designs are great, and most recurring characters get some focus episodes that provide a decent amount of development that doesn't make the plot too complicated.  \\n\r\nDandy himself warrants the most explanation if you're wondering if the characterization will appeal to you. He may seem like a shallow, poorly-developed character to many viewers, but in the grand scheme of things, that's kind of the point. I could describe him as a hedonist, or a bon-vivant, or adventurous, or whatever, but I'll be frank here: Space Dandy is a tool. He is kind of a badass, but he's also a conceited, dim-witted pervert.  And with only a couple episodes of exception, he never stops being a tool. \\n\r\nThat may seem lazy to some people, but it's fairly refreshing to me. Like in real life, just because people can change and develop into better people doesn't mean they will. And the plot of the show even explains how he's never stopped being such a tool, but I'm not elaborating on that (because spoilers).\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10\\n\r\nI think a lot of people on MAL might be more interested in anime for anime's sake, but I  personally like anime as just another form of media to consume. I gave it an 8 based on what I think most people will think about it, but to me, Space Dandy is a perfect 10. Space Dandy is exactly what I like in media, whether it's TV dramas or movies or video games or anime: it's entertaining. That's why you should watch Space Dandy. Not because it's deep or funny or revolutionary, but because it's entertaining.  Space Dandy really reminded me of why I watch anime to begin with: to have fun. \\n\r\nYou'll laugh. You'll cry. You'll quietly smile in awe. Maybe you'll bingewatch 10 episodes every 2 months, but they'll be a fun 10 episodes. But if you ask me, that's perfectly fine. It's better than watching 10 episodes of some boring, melodramatic, pseudointellectual big-budget anime that you're not even really sure if you're enjoying, but think you're supposed to like since it's deep or whatever.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8\\n\r\nAn 8 for most people, a 10 for me. Maybe you're into more (consistently) serious shows, maybe you're not into sci-fi, whatever, I can think of plenty of decent reasons to dislike it. But there's still a lot it has to offer. If you want to watch Space Dandy, don't go into it thinking it'll change your life any more than a sweet, refreshing glass of lemonade. But it's space lemonade. In space.",

It\u2019s been a while since I\u2019ve been so motivated to marathon a show. I finished the 26 episodes in 3 days. It\u2019s hilarious, always leaving me with a smile. The characters are very charming and loveable. The plots are absurd and over-the-top, but even through the silliness it manages to settle down sometimes to make you feel at peace, even melancholy and lonely.\r\nI\u2019ve said before, but entertainment\u2014no matter what form\u2014whether it\u2019s anime ormovies or books are really just about giving you that emotional experience. Don\u2019t worry about the details. Don\u2019t worry about the logic. If you love it enough just go with it.\\n\\n\r\nFirst, the animation is absolutely amazing. It\u2019s so full of life and details it's worth re-watching. This is a show that demands to be seen in true Blu-ray quality. You would be hurting yourself to watch it any other way. You have to see this in full 1080p to experience the incredible imagination. There are bizarre aliens, exotic planets, and beautiful cosmic scenery to witness.\\n\\n\r\nThe show is about a crew of three and their space adventures trying to find and capture rare aliens. These aliens are then registered for a cash reward. Your hero is a care-free slacker who loves women and going to a space Hooters. At his side is an adorable, outdated vacuum cleaning robot that puts up with him. Then there\u2019s a space cat that\u2019s just as lazy.\\n\\n\r\nThe dub and its writing are fantastic. I strongly recommend watching that version. It\u2019s obvious the translation team took liberties to westernize the material, but it\u2019s very well-suited. If I didn\u2019t know this was an anime, I\u2019d swear it was western made because so much of the humor feels western. Even the dialogue feels very modern with slang like \u201csketchy\u201d and references to Twitter.\\n\\n\r\nEvery episode is something different because they each have a very strong emotional theme. There\u2019s a lot of variety to the plots. Everything from a zombie episode; a galactic space race; going on a date; meeting parallel dimensions; even something as simple as a road trip. There\u2019s even touches of continuity as the they refer back to older plots and items. When the show takes a break from its wacky adventures to settle down the music really adds a surreal, distant, almost lonely mood. Other times the episodes are just plain weird and abstract.\\n\\n\r\nI\u2019m reminded of Futurama: another sci-fi show that makes stories and jokes out of scientific concepts. Space Dandy was a blast to watch. It's like no other anime I can think of. Without a doubt it's my favorite of 2014.",

            "content": "Opening Statements\r\nSpace Dandy (Aka Bebop on Crack) is a 13 episode sci-fi anime that has garnered a lot of attention even before it initially aired during the 2014 winter season. While part of this hype stems from the triumphant return of renounced anime director Siratou Watanabe, the man responsible for hit shows such as Cowboy Bebop, Kids on the Slope and of course Samurai Samploo, A majority of it stems from the fact that this the first anime ever to air on American TV before Japan which up until this point has only ever been a dream. \r\nI think we can all agree that thisis a craze that needs to catch on more as it would not only help in drawing in more fans to the medium but would also lead to the development of more western influenced shows and therefore, Dandy does hold some rather high expectations. It doesn't need to be the next Attack on Titan but it defiantly can't bomb. After all, if there's one thing that the Toonami revival proves it's that the internet hasn't completely destroyed TV just yet.  \\n\\n\r\nSpace Dandy's story can be found within its namesake, It's about a Dandy guy name dandy who explores space with his trusty robot R2, I mean QT, and feline sidekick meow hunting for rare aliens in hopes of being able to place food on the table all the while being unknowingly hunted down under some pretense of Dandy being the secret of the universe. What follows are breasterants, galactic wars,  races that break the sound barrier, and enough wacky animation that will make you feel like you just took a bottle full of acid. \\n\\n\r\nAnalysis + Witnesses\\n\r\nNow I will admit that Space Dandy is in no way as mature as Watanabe's other works but to be honest, I don't think that's the point. In fact, at times, you can even argue that the series acts as a spiritual successor to the other Space Westerns that comparatively reached the peak of their popularity on Toonami such as Bebop, Trigun and Outlaw star. \\n\\n\r\nHowever, even with this considered, I can understand why most people would not being able to get into such a series initially due to its straight forward episodic format which prevents it from having any semblance of a serious overarching story. However, the interesting thing about Space Dandy is that unlike others, it not only seems to be self aware to its episodic nature but at times even manages to take full advantage of the creativity that such a nature offers. \\n\\n\r\nAfter all, it might be considered a problem if the first episode ends with (Spoil Alert) our main characters dying in a planetary explosion. However, Space Dandy is able to sidestep this by giving each episode its own individual reset button, ignoring everything that might have follow or preceded it and continuing with a completely different adventure. Which was only made more humorous with a comedic intentional To be continued. This structure means that the vast number of writers who were brought in to work on this little experiment can essentially get away with anything as fears about effecting the overall continuity of the show are removed, allowing for the freedom necessary to create some interesting story lines as well as some rather clever parodies of other well known western settings such as episode 4 which can be seen as a deconstruction to the typical zombie apocalypse plot line by addressing how life would ironically go on even after everyone in the universe was turned was into a zombie who live off of their own life insurance. \\n\\n\r\nHowever,  like most episodic anime, there was a bit of inconsistency in story quality between each episode as some self contained stories did not follow the standard three act structure. However, this could be due to the fact that, as an experimental series, different writers were assigned throughout the series and to be fair the focus was never really taken away from where it needed to be, portraying just how ridiculous and likable our cast was when looking at how they dealt with the situations they found themselves in. \\n\\n\r\nIn fact, within the first season, each of our main characters have at least one episode dedicated to them. And I must say that they in particular were some of the most well paced, heartwarming stand alone episodes that I've seen in quite some time. They might not have been the most original with one episode in particularly acting as a through back to one of my favorite Pixar films while another seemed to take a stab at everyone's favorite franchise (I'm looking at you endless 8), but these stories just helped in adding so much more dimension to our characters that it didn't even matter. \\n\\n\r\n (P.S. I find it a little bit funny that one of the better episodes in the show just happened to be written by the same person who wrote valvrave which I will refuse to make a definitive comment on considering I hadn't watched it yet )\\n\\n\r\nOur star of this show, Dandy himself pretty much follows his namesake to a T. He is a very laid back individual who prefers to go at his own pace, can be very stubborn, pigheaded  and, judging from the first line of dialogue the series gives us, can be extremely perverted. However despite these flaws he's never really painted to be unlikable and in fact can be quite capable when the story demands it. Meow shares many personality traits with Dandy albeit he is a bit more on the lazy, shut-in side, but still loves the idea of being out in space and exploring that which he never thought he could back on his home town  while QT acts as sort of the level headed voice of reason as well as the passive aggressive dick within the group despite the fact that as a robot his needs and desires are much simpler compared to most. \\n\\n\r\nOf course we also can't forget our hero's pursuers Dr. Gel and his assistant Be who seems to fill the role of the incompetent buffoons who not only constantly get done in by our heroes string of dumb luck but also don't even seem to have their presence known by them.\\n\\n\r\nThe rest of the cast is rather large when you consider all who are encountered throughout the shows individual stories with some even being presented differently depending on the episode. However, whether it was their comedic quirks, menacing atmospheres or touching back stories I was pleasantly surprised at just how memorable some of them were considering the amount of screen time they were given which can range from a whole episode to even just 5 minutes. \\n\\n\r\nArt/Animation\\n\r\nThe overall design of Space Dandy is defiantly one of its high points as Watanabe takes full advantage of this setting in order to give birth to something that can only be described as the love child of Redline and Star wars. \\n\\n\r\nIn fact, similarly to how certain episodes were met with different writers, each episode had its own specific art director which meant that some adventures had strikingly different styles compared to others. However, while the fluctuating story quality might be considered a determent to the show,  the fluctuating art designs were defiantly more of a complement, as it did help in solidifying the idea that each adventure had its own unique atmosphere whether it was going for a fast paced or cereal one. Plus the crafted polish and bright color pallet helped in making the show feel that much more alive and fit its comedic nature. \\n\\n\r\nIn regards to the animation, there were very few instances of still frames with a variety of standout moments were movement became incredibly fast paced and fluid to the point where I felt like I was tripping on something very hard while I was watching them. Alot of people are saying that Space Dandy will help mark the return of animation Studio bones when they were in their prime, and I will admit that these scenes greatly support this statement from an animation. However, overall it might not be the most consistent animation quality as there were some noticeable instances where Bones was in fact cutting corners, what with the lack of detail and color quality in certain scenes. In fact while the different art designs were an interesting touch, you could also argue that they were used as a cover for any noticeable instances where the quality dropped. It might not be bone's best work but it's defiantly above average and a step in the right direction. \\n\\n\r\nSound/Music\\n\r\nGoing back to Watanabe, his past works have shown that he has very distinct visions regarding the importance of the film scores and Space Dandy is no different. While often times the trumpet will be used in conjunction with the more upbeat moments, a majority of the ost is used the match the futuristic sci-fi feel of the show by using groovy techo and disco style music that felt very reminiscent of Daft Punks interstellar 555 which also air in the 90's. Then we have the slower, more emotional moments which were met with calming synthesized beats and even some beautifully crafted pieces of auto tune. \\n\\n\r\nThe dub for this series was handled by Funimation and it's interesting how, in terms of comedy, both versions have their own renditions' of humor with the dub having more western influenced jokes. In terms of the casting it was great to hear Alison Viktorin behind the mic of a main character (even if her voice was auto tuned) since her most memorable main role seems to be that of Conan from case closed. Joel McDonald did a solid job capturing the laid-back-ness of Meow and Ian Sinclair as Dandy was........just Dandy. In terms of the rest of casting I have little to no complaints, then again, what do you expect from a show that was specifically geared for the west. \\n\\n\r\nThe show also features a narrator who helps give exposition to whatever the show tends to leave out and while annoying at times, I will admit that it is rather humorous considering how much he doesn't seem to give a shit about his job at times, sort of like the narrator of The Big Lebowskii. \\n\\n\r\nClosing Statements\\n\r\nSpace Dandy, in and of itself, is a space adventure show at its purest, showing just how much fun, dangerous and unpredictable the Galaxy can be. Yes it's a little immature and its style of humor might not be for everybody, plus I really can't see anyone marathon this due to its structure.  However, personally I think it's a great show to have on Toonami as well as one to just sit back and watch casual. The animation, for the most part, is above average, it's got some very likable characters and it really does help in capturing the essence of what anime is. It's stupid yet cleaver , perverted yet aware and wacky yet heartwarming. I had a lot of fun with this show and I can't wait for its next season. \\n\\n\r\nIf you're looking for a crazy space adventure story that you could watch at your leisure and have a Dandy good time then I see no reason why you shouldn't give this show a shot. \\n",

            "content": "Having watched Cowboy Bebop and Samurai Champloo, I was craving more of Shinichiro Watanabe's unique style of directing, and along comes Space Dandy to satisfy that need.\r\nThe most immediately striking aspect of Space Dandy is its visual presentation and art style, which is varied and quite frankly outstanding. The pilot episode especially is such a visual treat that I would recommend it even to those who have no interest in the rest of the show; it's that impressive. That's not to say that the rest of the series slacks, mind you. Though there are a few episodes that have less going on visually than others,the majority are fantastic feasts for the eyes. The accompanying soundtrack, with a heavy 80s theme to it, suits the atmosphere of the show to a tee.\\n\\n\r\nI would argue that the art is Space Dandy's most prominent offering, but its other great strength is its comedy. It's certainly not for everyone, being wacky and high energy nearly all the time. The show is entirely episodic, with some episodes even concluding in such a way that the story couldn't possibly continue, but I loved this and the characters are a great fit for the scenarios the show throws at them. Speaking of the characters, I watched Space Dandy in its English dub, and after comparing it with the original Japanese I can say without a doubt that the dub is the way to go. Ian Sinclair, Joel McDonald and Alison Viktorin bring the main trio to life, and a large part of the comedy shines thanks to their delivery and that of the supporting cast.\\n\\n\r\nWith outstanding art direction and hilarious comedy, where can Space Dandy falter? In my opinion that would be when it tries to deviate from these two strengths. There are a few episodes that I would call more grounded, both in art style and in comedy, with a couple of episodes even attempting to tell a more serious story, similar to some of Watanabe's other works. But in Space Dandy I really can't say that it works. The characters just aren't suited to more emotional stories, and the lack of artistic flair that often accompanies these episodes drags the using fast pace of the show to a crawl. Space Dandy is fantastic when its doing what it knows best, but when it tries to venture out, I wouldn't say it succeeds.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Space Dandy is certainly a spectacle and laughs are a guarantee if you're a fan of zany comedy and totally out-there situations, but a few dud episodes, particular in the latter half of the series did drag it down somewhat. Nevertheless, I'm certainly going to be watching the second season of the show when I can find the time, and I recommend that you give Space Dandy a look to see if you'll do the same.",

            "content": "This is my first review here after a while of being part of MAL. I cannot say that I'm an anime expert; my repertoire is quite small compared to other people I've seen here. But, it felt right to honour Space Dandy with a review. This review includes both seasons of the show, so I'll not be just talking about season 2. And, although there's not so much of a story, as the show focused in an episodic scheme and most of them have little to do with what happened in the previous one.\r\nIf I had to describe Space Dandy with just one word, theonly one that comes to my mind is \"unique\", and I believe that that's the only word that can actually describe it. Each episode is almost completely different from the previous one (because they all have Dandy, QT and Meow as their main characters, of course), showing a distinct art style and musical choices. However, I must say that, despite the episodic choice, the show does follow a certain plot thread that keeps going along both seasons.\\n\r\nFollow Dandy and the crew of the Aloha-oe as they travel through the universe in search for rare aliens so they can register them and spend all their cash in Boobies (a sort of space Hooters). I must be honest, what brought me here was the promise of beautifully animated 2D boobies and butts (who doesn't love them, right?), but I found so much more (don't worry, there are still boobies every now and then!). Stories usually go from wacky, ridiculous to heartwarming (and, considering that this show is supposed to be comedy, they are much more appreciated).\\n\r\nIn case I haven't convinced you yet, this show was made by Shinchiro Watanabe (Remember Cowboy Bebop? Maybe Samurai Champloo?) and animated by the same studio (Bones) that animated previous Watanabe animes.\\n\r\nIf you're still reluctant to watch it, I strongly suggest you to give it a try nonetheless. I know I did and it was one of the best choices I've made.\\n\r\nStory: 8\\n\r\nArt: 10\\n\r\nSound: 9\\n\r\nCharacter: 8\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10\\n\r\nOverall: 9\\n\\n\r\nPS: Have I mentioned that \"X Jigen e Youkoso\", the show's ending song, is one of the most beautiful songs that I've ever listened to?",

The best episode is where they partake in a racing game and the ramen ep was also  good. then there was  the time loop episode that  disapointed me.  it was a great idea but how they executed it was such a shame. so much potential and not only the time loop ep and all the otherones were dissapointing. Dont  get me wrong  each adventure they had were qiuet unque, but how they putted everything together is smh. i hopped for  more.\\n\r\nohh also there is this baddie that is searching for Dandy but why or for what reasons the never tell us. also wasted potential again.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8\\n\\n\r\nThe visual were great. some eps were really trippy.  all alien designs were unique. some were ugly though. loved the colorfull visual.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9\\n\\n\r\nYoooo that Opening is  such a treat and even the ending was great a catchy.

There is not a single episode of Space Dandy where I didn't smile from minute one till the very end.  This show feels so good, it almost feels like you're revisiting both Cowboy Bebop AND Samurai Champloo in every episode. \r\nIt has an amazing soundtrack(one worth actually buying), hilarious and endearing characters and ultimately, it is a series that genuinely has a heart. Unlike its predecessors, it has no connecting plot, each episode seems to be occurring in adifferent dimension from the other(although they make a few nods to it now and then) and unlike Spike and Mugen, Dandy had it easy. \\n\\n\r\nThis is arguably the best anime this season, better, I daresay, than Kill la Kill mainly due to how its able to live up with my expectations as the third coming of Cowboy Bebop and Samurai Champloo, minus their depressing elements.",

            "content": "Note: While this is for the first season, it really's for BOTH seasons combined. It's here because anyone who is actually thinking of watching the show will read this one and not one for S2. \r\nSpace Dandy can be aptly described as Acid Trip: The Anime. It follows the exploits (or lack thereof), of the crew of the Aloha Oe: Dandy, QT, and Meow. \r\nThere is no real plot in Space Dandy. The crew works as kind of bounty hunters. They try to find rare aliens and turn them in for money. You quickly find out that they are very bad at this, or justget caught into comedic bad luck. Each episode is stand alone for the most part and there is no real sense of continuity between any of them. Actually some of them are so bizarre that the endings would end the show if continuity exited. \\n\\n\r\nThis episodic basis is both a blessing and a curse to the anime. For one it allows them to do almost anything the writers want to. At its best it creates some of the best single episodes in anime. They are funny, passionate, and sometimes even thought provoking. However, it also limits things like character development, a cohesive feeling of the world, and also makes the show feel somewhat unbalanced at times. \\n\\n\r\nHowever, don't let you think that this makes the show anything less than good, very good even. Some episodes are weaker, but the good ones more than make up for it. It's an anime that hits a few singles and then suddenly unleashes that grand slam at the right moment. \\n\\n\r\nThe cast is, okay. It's honestly one of the weaker elements of the anime. When I was asked what do I think is keeping Space Dandy from becoming one of the great anime and not just a good one, I said \"I can't relate to the cast at all.\" They are far too simple and the format of the show really doesn't help them either. \\n\\n\r\nEven so, don't let that stop you from watching the show, the cast is really secondary to the overall feeling of the show. Space Dandy, to me at least, never felt like an anime you're supposed to compare to other ones, it's a comedy, but the type of comedy will vary, and it's not beyond tossing in some serious moments from time to time. It's like Dandy is in his own little world here. \\n\\n\r\nI do have to address Boobies, the show equivalent to a Space Hooters. It's in just about every episode. Dandy and his crew frequent the place. While they do visit it a lot there is very limited fan service in the show as a whole. \\n\\n\r\nThe music is spectacular. It's hard to say if it's even better than the actual aesthetic the anime creates but it's close. It really helps to enhance the journey. \\n\\n\r\nSpace Dandy ends up being an anime that has some of the the most entertaining episodes I've seen. It does have some flops too, but even then they are just so close to being great that they still end up being entertaining. Be patient with this one, it'll surprise you before you know it.",

            "content": "Space Dandy is a unique anime to me, but not because it was the first anime to my knowledge that aired in English dubbed in the west before it aired in Japan with the Japanese dub, but for the mere fact that this is the first time in all my years of watching anime that I have seen one about alien hunters.... in space. \r\nThe story of Space Dandy follows the adventures of Dandy and his crew of alien hunters as they search the known universe looking for new alien species to capture so they could take them to the registration centre, and if thealien that they hunted down happened to be a new species they would get paid. \\n\\n\r\nSpace Dandy mainly focuses on three main characters: first we have Space Dandy, he is basically like the captain of the ship and he's very easy going, and one of his main joys in life is visiting a hooters kind of restaurant called Boobies. Next we have QT A robot that can also function as a vacuum cleaner, though he isn't the latest model he has a high advanced AI that can convey emotion and display fear, and he usually help's dandy to spot new aliens. Lastly we have Meow a cat like alien species which are called a Betelguesian. Meow likes technology and he loves to use his phone, and aside from being a free loader he helps to give Dandy advice on where he could find new aliens. There are other side characters but I won't mention them, but what I would like to talk about is my thoughts on the series  \\n\\n\r\nLiked- \\n\r\nOne of the first things that I liked about space Dandy is the Animation, the animation of Space Dandy was done by studio Bones who have been known for doing great work for anime such as Full Metal Alchemist: Brotherhood, Eureka Seven, and Darker than Black, and the animation for Space Dandy was done exceptionally well and I think its the best work Bones has done in a while, it is colourful and pleasant to look at, and there are rarely instances where the animation just looks bad. \\n\\n\r\nSecondly I liked the soundtrack, if you've seen Cowboy Bebop and heard it's soundtrack it sounds similar to that, and this is probably because the director of Space Dandy Watanabe Shinichiro was also the director of Cowboy Bebop. \\n\\n\r\nMixed Feelings- \\n\r\nEven though I really enjoyed Space Dandy there is one particular problem that I had with it, there is literally no story development or character development whatsoever, but this is because Space Dandy is a very episodic anime, and the story in that particular episode is contained only within that episode so whatever happens in that episode stays in that episode so if our heroes were to die in one episode they would be perfectly fine in another. \\n\\n\r\nI would like to add that one of the good things about Space Dandy being as episodic as it is, is that if you want to see what Space Dandy is about you can literally watch any episode and not have to worry about the story and what happened prior to that episode. \\n\\n\r\nFinal Thoughts- \\n\r\nOverall Space Dandy is amazing, fun and entertaining, its one of those anime that you can watch after a long day of school or work, That can help you relax, and I cannot recommend it enough.",

You see theories of black holes and other various space related things that seem nearly impossible. What are the limits of space?\r\nSpace Dandy is an anime that does an extremely good job of showing you exactly what the universe is capable of, or could be capable of. Each episode is separate from each other as in they don't tie together to bring a full complete story, yet as surprising as this is I call Space Dandy a Masterpiece.\r\nEach episode is filled with various things,capturing aliens, repeating the same day, traveling dimensions, getting trapped in Limbo, and even 2d and 3d dimensions crashing into each other. In other words, you will never be able to predict the next Space Dandy episode, just like it is impossible to predict what the universe might do next.\\n\\n\r\nDon't expect a story that is written over 12 episodes. Look at each episode as a story of it's own, because that is exactly how Space Dandy is written. This was an anime specifically made to have 600 episodes or more. The more episodes you watch the more you get into it, it's a never ending journey for Dandy and his friends because even if the Dandy of this universe is killed or dies. There will always be another Dandy in another universe to give us another episode.",

First of all Space Dandy has major identity issues. The show's trailer portrayed the show being a comedy; the first episode conveyed that as well. However there were a lot of serious ones or ones that were supposed be comedy but were not even chuckle-worthy. There is no plot and the characters are very dull and don't experience much growth becuase of it's heavily episodic nature. The art and animation do not showcase BONES animationprowess. I know that each Space Dandy episode is by a different director but that's no excuse for it's mediocre quality.",

            "content": "In my opinion Space Dandy would be the love child/bastard of CowBoy Bebop and Nichijou, and frankly the out come isn't too bad. I mean it's probably a little stupid, and therefore hard to take seriously, but I think that's a good thing. \r\nI think Space Dandy doesn't care what you think, even if you insult it's parents out right, the only thing it would do is comb it's hair back and then fly off into the sunset. \r\nStory: Well the story follows a very simple track, it's about a rag tag group of hunters who hunt down rare creatures for money, and that's prettymuch it, oh and add a little bit of shenanigans as well. The fan service is a bit excessive, bit I see Dandy like I see Bayonetta, it's all part of his character, but if you're not into that sort of thing I wouldn't recommend watching. Another thing this steals from it's father is the fact that it's episodic, meaning that each episode is completely different. But the only difference is that each episode really has nothing to do with the previous, like they can die in one episode, or something else will happen, and next episode, they'll have no recollection at all of the previous episode. I actually like this personally, as it's a clean slate every time, and if you're watching this you wouldn't actually expect a rich story, so it doesn't matter. \\n\\n\r\nArt: The art looks alright all the way through, it may get pretty rough at some of the intense moments, but I wouldn't get overly annoyed about it. Oh oh but one thing I would applaud, is.... the... way.... they... animate..... all.... those....boobies. Let's just say that the way... they animate bouncy stuff is top notch ( \u0361\u00b0 \u035c\u0296 \u0361\u00b0).\\n\\n\r\nSound: This show has a very light space ring to it, the OP and END themes have some pretty good songs and I enjoyed listening to them over and over again, one thing that turns me off of some animes is the opening theme, if it's really bad it just kills the mood altogether. I'm looking at you Tokyo Ghoul Season 2, with your terrible opening. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: The characters are pretty likable, Dandy is pretty much a male equivalent of Bayonetta, only he's not as dominating. One con you could add would be that there is no character development at all, because like I stated previously is that the episodes have nothing to string together and link them. So as a result you may get some character development in some episodes, like when they visit Meow's family, but in the next it never references them ever again. They still retain their base personalities still, which keeps familiar, with no unexpected turns when you watch the next episode. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: I enjoyed this pretty well, since it's pretty obvious it has a lot of influences from Cowboy Bebop,  and other shows from Shinichiro Watanabe, and I admit at sometimes the humour may fall flat completely, and the fan service may be a complete turnoff, but that doesn't stop this from being a fun light show. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: I believe that this would be if the creators working on Cowboy Bebop all got drunk, and high and decided \"Hey instead of making a serious show, lets do a complete 180 and make something completely different.\" And I believe that this is a good thing, these days there are too many comedies that try to work a story or character development in there, whereas Space Dandy almost ignores it completely and focuses only on the light art style, fun atmosphere, and overall enjoyment. \\n\\n\r\n8.5/10 Not too shabby",

This is why Space Dandy can be colorful, exciting, touching, hilarious, crass, beautiful, mysterious, genre-bending, trivial, and ultimately free.\r\nThis show will often compel you to perceive it as a profound commentary, but it will actively dissuade you from taking it seriously. You will try to give it alabel, or try to place it in a neat category, but it will passionately fight your attempt to do so. So my advice: don't fight it. Just sit back and enjoy the ride, for zombies, specters, stardust, and dandies lie ahead.",

I certainly wondered what I was watching however I didn't have to scratch far under Space Dandy's goofy, seemingly vacuous bonnet to find what is in fact a creation full of heart and beauty. Plus I like my sci fi to feel like perhaps I shouldn't have taken that second acid tab. The art and set pieces are truly glorious. For every quip about boobies and booty there's another with surprising deftness and subtlety. I know itstill won't be for everyone. Not all of its ideas are particularly original, it may seem a disjointed anthology that will withhold any sort of final payoff. While it does endeavour to tie the threads, by the end I came to realise that looking ahead just detracts from the moment. That is why I find myself rewatching, again and again, despite my long list of unseen anime, and finding a deeper fondness each time. Don't take it too seriously, let each episode take you on a ride.

            "content": "Cowboy Bebop fans will remember the fridge episode well; it was a filler episode whose events were not canon to the rest of the series, but it was a fun in-universe subplot playing out for what mostly seemed like Shinichir\u014d Watanabe's enjoyment. Everything that went right and wrong with that episode in isolation is applicable to Space Dandy in general.\r\nWhereas Watanabe's other works like Samurai Champloo and Cowboy Bebop more or less follow a consistent narrative (putting aside the occasional filler episode), Space Dandy is built more around a central, highly textured universe from which spring the individual, narratively isolated episodes. The worldbuilding in thisregard is phenomenal, with imaginatively designed aliens and amusingly tongue-in-cheek organization and location names.\\n\\n\r\nThis approach was a bit of a disappointment to me, since I got much more catharsis by the end of other Watanabe shows since there was growth and development of bonds between the characters. Further, some episodes were based on much shallower gimmicks than others or burnt out near the end with less than satisfying conclusions.\\n\\n\r\nSpace Dandy has a lot going for it though; Dandy himself, along with the supporting cast, are all amusing and have good synergy. The Poverty Aesthetic also seen in Champloo and Bebop is present, making for a great baseline theme from which to spring comedy, unexpected noblesse oblige, and even the occasional heartstring tug. The visuals are an absolute feast and even have guest art styles for certain episodes. The voice acting is similarly bursting with personality and drama.\\n\\n\r\nSpace Dandy is a great single-serving thrill kind of series. Sitting back and letting the experience wash over you is probably the best approach, perhaps with subsequent revisiting for when you get nostalgia for the kind of emotional kick a given episode has.",

I have watched both seasons, and you need to know right now: the first three episodes have a plot to the show, but take another route after those episodes. I got confused the first time, but I settled with it. But just because there isnt much of a plot, the anime still carries fairly well throughout thewhole season, it has some really good moments. Comedy isnt its only profession, it has other sub plots too, like romance and slice of life. If you like romance, find the episode where QT falls in love with a coffee machine, its actaully pretty sweet.\\n\\n\r\nAnd if you need help with the plot, let me enlighten you: Dandy is a space hunter who travels throughout space with his robot companion, QT in search to find creatures, and get them registered to earn money. They encounter a ancestor of a cat called Meow, who is basically the whole weaboo demographic. (haha.) He believes that he can find rare species to get registered, and so they have him aboard. I said before how after 3 episodes it loses its plot, but it actaully start off with the plot with every new episode, but just takes another turn.\\n\\n\r\nIf you havent watched this anime before, only watched about a couple of episodes, I pledge you to keep watching, because it really is a lost gem. DONT WATCH THE DUBBED VERSION, IT CHANGES CERTAIN ASPECTS.",

From the beautiful animation, interesting character designs, and varying genre soundtrack I was quickly sucked into the fun time that is Space Dandy.\r\nDon't get hung up on the main story, it's complete garbage and only plays a part in giving a \"Team Rocket\" sense of humor which can definitely fall flat. But it makes up for it by doing an incredible job drawing you intoa new world with each episode, introducing well drawn worlds with their own interesting conflicts and resolutions. At each episode I found myself craving more of these newly introduced characters, mostly giving them fitting ends but enjoying the short time I had with them only for them to be replaced by another well written or just plain lovably quirky character. \\n\\n\r\nAll in all Space Dandy is an enjoyable series that shouldn't be taken too seriously. Go into Space Dandy with a sense of wonder and fun, and let it take you on its colorful journey aboard the Aloha Oe.",

            "content": "Do note that this review reflects my thoughts on both \"seasons\" to Space Dandy as a whole. This said, on with the review:\r\nSpace Dandy is the fourth TV anime directed by the highly acclaimed Shinichiro Watanabe which is a sci-fi comedy focused on an alien hunter named Dandy who finds himself in some sort of comical shenanigans during his hunts in each episode. \r\nThe series is mostly a parody of sci-fi space opera tropes with the series occasionally breaking the fourth wall, Dandy often getting in some sort of dimensional hopping shenanigans, usually being killed in some episodes and being fine in the next one,members of an enemy empire incompetently seeking him out and failing to even reach him, and never stopping with his continued obsession with visiting the Hooters-like Boobies \"breastaurant\". At first glance, the series may seem completely episodic and self-contained with many of its plots considering Dandy is well and good the following episode if he or all of the universe get killed in some fashion throughout the series. But later episodes do drop hints that things are not as they would seem on the surface with our \"dandy guy in space\" and all. \\n\\n\r\nThe comedy throughout the series is hit-or-miss for me as the clueless characters of Dandy, Meow, and QT did get stale for me as episodes progressed, though some of the supporting characters such as the surprisingly insightful Honey and the no-nonsense Scarlet caught my interest with their behavior and actions. In addition, some episodes are focused on providing some more fleshing out of the characters which while appreciated, often did not do much for me to get to care for them due to mostly being focused on in a single episode.\\n\\n\r\nThe highlight of the series comes from its very impressive animation as Space Dandy sports smoothly detailed and vividly-colored designs, while offering diverse variety in the number of human and alien designs seen throughout the series. Movements are very fluid with a variety of action sequences and some unique animation styles being milked at points thanks to Dandy's interdimensional travels, with CGI renderings of spaceships and the effects of Dandy crossing into dimensions milking CG animation that blends seamlessly with the regular animation for the most part.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I felt Space Dandy's hype mostly came from Watanabe's fame and its space comedy premise being accessible to Western audiences. While Dandy's antics and the seemingly episodic developments within the show do come with a surprising reason that makes sense when revealed in its climax and was a clever twist for the series, the comedy for it did gradually lose its luster for me with time and the characters were mostly too limited with their traits and personalities for me to want to rewatch it too often. While I am a fan of Watanabe's previous works like Cowboy Bebop and Kids on the Slope, Space Dandy appears to be the weakest of the TV anime titles I've seen directed by him.",

But let's go on with our review.\r\nSpace Dandy has different themes in each episode, but it's mostly and usually in space, with the same main characters. \r\nStory\r\nAs I said, it's all random. Not a continuous story that continue each episode. It's one story each episode, but with the same main characters doing random stuff. It's got a simple story, where they hunt for aliens like what the summary says. The story's not super unique but it's pretty funny and nice to just see what the characters areup to. I'm pretty sure all the episodes are fillers since it's all got random stories that doesn't really-- I think I made my point.\\n\r\nLast episode was the same as the others, another episode that focus on one of the main characters. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, I guess the story is nice. I'd give it an 8. Enjoyable enough to watch if you're bored and just wanna see random antics. \\n\\n\r\nArt\\n\\n\r\nArt style is nice. Not super realistic, or deformed like Pop Team Epic. I guess it's more like the normal anime I've seen. Cowboy bebop with sorta Code Geass in some episodes.\\n\r\nStandard style. It fits the story just fine. The space background's pretty good. I like space. Easy to tell each other apart cause they have different designs.\\n\\n\r\nI'd give it a 10.\\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\\n\r\nThe characters fit their voice just fine. Ending and Opening song is alright too. I didn't really pay much attention to the theme songs cause I  wanted to skip right to the part of the story. I didn't think there was anything wrong with the music so I guess it's a 10.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter\\n\\n\r\nThe BBP (Blockhead, Bonehead, and Pinhead) a.k.a Dandy, Meow, and QT are alright. I don't think there was much changes or development to their personalities. They're usually just slow or dumb or doing something pointless haha. It's funny since I guess that's what I do too in my everyday life. Pointless stuff. \\n\\n\r\nGogol Empire is weird since they seem to want Dandy but it's not explained why in this season. Something that would make them more powerful, I assume. The villain gorilla man keeps dying hahaha but comes back again next episode. \\n\\n\r\nThe narrator sometimes talks with the characters and it has the 4th wall being broken but that's rare.\\n\\n\r\nI didn't dislike anyone in the show. They're all fine the way they are.\\n\\n\r\nI'm not sure if I'd remember the characters much. Maybe just the main characters and their faces.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment\\n\\n\r\nI guess people who like space and have nothing else to do with their free time can enjoy this like I do.\\n\r\nI guess Americans would like it since it's already shown in AdultSwim/Toonami.\\n\r\nDon't know if I'd rewatch anytime soon but maybe one day in the far future.\\n\r\nIt's enjoyable enough to remember from time to time.\\n\\n\r\nRating it an 8 (changed to 9)\\n\\n\r\nI'll rate it an 8 overall. It's pretty good enough and I've rated worst stuff at like, 7 or something. I should probably change it to a 9 since that seems like a better idea.",

I really tried to like Space Dandy but couldn't. The light over-hanging plot is that an alien hunter named Dandy, whose job is to discover new alien life forms across the galaxy and have them registered with the Space Alien Registration Center; the almost Cowboy Bebop vibe wasn't compelling enough to save the show. The characters have potential to be great but aren't. The only character that was almost likable was the cat alien Meow. Themain character Dandy, is a disappointing version of Spike Spiegel and Mugen. At least the animation was great because its by Bones Inc, the company who helped animate the Soul Eater anime and some of the FMA anime. If you are looking for another Cowboy Bebop or Samurai Champloo, look elsewhere.",

I suggest this series for anyone with a wide platte.\r\nThe art, sound, and writing are high quality. Nothing about the soundtrack stood out, but the music is emotionally and scenically influenced. The mean characters lack depth, but it fits the format of the show.The side characters take a lot of the light. The parts I disliked I found boring or useless.

The Show takes place in kinda different events that don't correspond with the last episode, so if per say all the characters died last episode everything would reset and a new adventure would take place. This concept is what brought this show down for me. Ya its funny, really funny, but whats the point of what is happening on the screen? Overall the story was fun, but didn't revolve like a story should, more like cartoon if you want to of it like that. (6)\r\nArt:\r\nIt was groovy.I don't have much to say about the art. Everything was animated smoothly and blended together great. The main characters were done well and really showcased their personalities. (10)\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nOne of the best parts about this show was how well the U.S voice actors played their parts. When i hear the actors speak their lines and portray their parts it makes me think this anime was meant to be spoken in English. An example would be  the narrator: The narrator Added a lot of character to the story with his deep, philosophical sounding voice that had something in it that made the show sound even funnier, though he isn't any Morgan Freeman but comes close. But in the end it sounded really good in every aspect. (9)\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nThis show revolves around the wacky space crew of Dandy, Meow, and QT, who get chased around by Dr. Gel and his wacky assistant Bee. Each of these characters and all the others that pop in each episode are so well designed and have so much character in them. I found one of the best parts of writing this review was thinking about all the characters i met in Dandy's adventures. trust me when i say this, I loved all the main and supporting characters and you will too. (10)\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nit was a fun ride. There was a lot of fun on the adventure with Dandy in the show. Every episode was funny and felt very well thought about. Nothing in this show seemed rushed or overly cheesy, i say this because some events ARE very very cheese but on purpose to make the viewer laugh which I did. (9)\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nSpace Dandy I found was a gem hidden the the toonami block of Adult Swim's Saturdays block. I hadn't heard of this show before i saw it late at night by chance, and what i like was that the show wasn't ruined by over hype that many shows and video games these days come short because of. At the end is a really interesting 13 episode season. With another one to watch. So i give Space dandy a 8 out of 10. It is a hell a lot of fun to watch. Though if you want something really serious like i did, you won't want to watch this. Despite that, this show is really something. \\n\\n\r\nP.S: If you liked this review, or hated it and want to maker me review better, than comment/message me if you have the time. I will also try to get to season 2 for this show when I can.\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "'Space Dandy' is a show that doesn't bother trying to make sense and instead just throws a bunch of stuff together in order to try and keep you entertained.\r\n     This is one of those shows that doesn't care weather or not it makes any sense, and instead just tries to entertain you with its comedy, unique style, and upbeat tone. This show is very inconstant, and makes absolutely no sense. Some episodes may leave with the entire cast dead, with them all mysteriously back in the next episode with no explanation. The tone of each episode seem to be a littledifferent from each other as well. This is probably because multiple directors worked on different episodes of this show. With most shows, not making any sense will ruin the entire series, however, there are some shows out there that don't lose everything from it and sometimes are improved by the ridiculousness of it. These are what I like to call goofy comedies. This basically means films that develop their specific tone and comedy through their bazaar plots and use the fact it makes no sense for comedy. 'Space Dandy' is a series I believe attempted to do this so the inconsistency of the show shouldn't be too much of a big deal. If you are expecting a show with a amazing plot and story-line, look elsewhere. If you just want some quick entertainment, keep reading.\\n\\n\r\nYou may think I just said that the fact the story doesn't entirely make sense wasn't that big of a deal since it fit the style of the show. Even though this may be true, there is still one mandatory thing you must have when it comes to shows like that. This is the comedy. In order for a show to gain entertainment off of it's ridiculousness, it has to be funny as well. When it comes to 'space dandy' The comedy involved in the show is very repetitive and to be fully honest, I didn't really find it that funny. Instead it just felt boring. This is probably the biggest flaw of 'Space Dandy.' There may have been a few funny scenes during this show that may be worth watching for, but if you are to watch this show than I should warn you that some episodes are far better than others. \\n\\n\r\n'Space Dandy' is a series you either love or hate. If you don't enjoy the first few episodes, than you can stop watching because you probably won't enjoy the rest. This show is designed for people who just want some quick entertainment, not those looking for a quality story or anything more. If you are still considering this show, give it a try. If you don't like it, you can give it up without worrying it will change a lot from the start. \\n\\n\r\nI give 'Space Dandy' a 5/10. (which is a pretty low rating for the way I rate stuff)",

It had me laughing out loud at times, and feeling sad at others Each episode was different and yet all played out very similarity. The bad guy would chase the three protagonists around each episode without the main characters even knowing. The fan service in the show came in the form of a resteraunt called \"boobies\" which played a major role in the show, and Dandys love for the resteraunt was hilarious at times. The shows characters are all amazingly three dimensional and youstart to care more for them as the show progresses. And to top it all off, an amazing soundtrack, cowboy bebop follows a jazz theme whereas this follows a Hawaii theme which I thought was great. The art design was beautiful and at times the animation blew me away. Overall I really enjoyed the show and would recommend it to any fan of comedy as a genre.",

I always found anime with a very peculiar concept interesting, and here, the touch of Watanabe is clear, although music is not as great as Cowboy Bebop, Samurai Champloo or Kids on the Slope, maybe because Yoko Kanno was not fully involved. It's very difficult to write a review, because the show is very weird, and surely completely different from any other show you have ever seen. However, to give a benchmark, if you like Douglas Adams' narrative you will enjoy the show and the kind of comedy depicted.",

At first when you watch it it seems like its just a cheesy fan service show. Its got a bit of that but it's not super annoying. That aspect of the show is there because it's part of the the main character's persona. Its just over the top. \r\nThe synopsis - A 50's looking womanizing greaser, in space, accompanied by a robot that cannot be upgraded and a Beatleguiseian Cat. Together they end up in adventures and predicaments and one of theonly threads from show to show is that they hunt rare aliens to categorize for $, and even that is really only a driver to move the characters from place to place. When Shinichir\u014d Watanabe does something its definitely different from anyone else's take on the subject. \\n\\n\r\nOne of the best parts of the show is that the background characters are fleshed out more than you usually see. The main Characters are memorable and have a nice dynamic. The secondary characters always seem like they have their own back story and not thrown in just to be there. Surprisingly there are some episodes that delve into some pretty deep emotional matters (while keeping the funny and ridiculous vibe) and really feel like a full story arc in themselves. Other anime that I've seen take the entire series to convey what can come across in a single episode.\\n\\n\r\nThe episodes each say \"To Be Continued\", but there is not really any continuity that I have seen so far. This does not matter in the least. Some episodes leave the characters in impossible situations with no way to escape or continue the story. You could pick up any episode and get to know the characters enough to enjoy the story without missing anything. Every episode just takes every situation to the very limits of craziness. \\n\\n\r\n** updated **\\n\\n\r\nFinished with this series and the ending is perfectly fitting. All my previous review stands and I could even add that it gets better and better the further you get into it. That was my experience. \\n\\n\r\nSo yes, just turn off your brain and... Dandy",

            "content": "Space Dandy is something else. It makes sense without making sense.\r\nStory - 9/10\r\nThe approach on story telling is properly one of the most remarkable features of the show.\r\nThere is no set time in which the episodes take place. Sometimes you have a few episodes actually taking place after another but sometimes they are timeless and there is no real telling when these events take place. The 'when' does not matter for the plot though.\r\nMost episodes are stand-alones though and have a simple main plot.\r\nBut as I was writing to begin with 'It makes sense without making sense.' the story might be utterly ridiculous. You willenjoy it on one level or the other though and if you stop expecting super serious and deep subjects, you will start to see the stories have a good depth to them.\\n\r\nSome episodes have serious themes but the show finds funny ways to deal with them and might just make you think.\\n\r\nEven if the main plot will be easy to spot for each episode, the show will find a way to twist things up and keep you at the edge of your seat.\\n\r\nTopnotch technology and established methods as common hunting practices and a pretty realistic feel for the true size of space make it a Sci-Fi anime without slapping it into your face all the time. The comedy elements range from enjoyable to simply ridiculous and obviously over-the-top so they are always present but not overtaking.\\n\r\nThe ending is no huge finale but suits the show well. It did leave me wanting more and luckily you can go straight ahead with season 2.\\n\\n\r\nArt - 10/10\\n\r\nSeen from an artistic angle you will find dominating Anime elements with some established Western cartoon practices.\\n\r\nFrom time to time you will be wowed with a bit more experimental style that is well fitted into the story.\\n\r\nJust watching the main cast walk already has a funny feeling. Movements are displayed mostly realistic and smooth.\\n\r\nThe character designs are well thought through with waitresses wearing flat shoes instead of high-heels and front-desk workers wearing a plain and non-appealing uniform. Each design could convincingly tell something about the character wearing it.\\n\r\nThe design of the main crew stands out enough to make them recognizable but not too much to make the crowd around them disappear.\\n\\n\r\nSound - 10/10 (addressing the official English dub)\\n\r\nFor a while I thought this was indeed a Western cartoon made to look and feel like an Anime.\\n\r\nThe voice actors were chosen well for their characters and did a great job truly acting and not just reading translations off a screen.\\n\r\nThe music is one of my personal highlights. I have looked up the OST several times and actually decided on one song to keep on my trip playlist.\\n\r\nEvery tune adds a little magic to the story and it never felt out off place or like it was interrupting an ongoing scene.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters - 10/10\\n\r\nThe many characteristics of the main crew are displayed on a regular basis and we get to see believable characters with dreams and fears, strengths and faults.\\n\r\nIn this show every character the main cast is involved with for more than a few minutes gets the chance to show off a more complex personality.\\n\r\nI did manage to understand and relate to a lot of the characters in this show even the villains. In a few episodes we learn about a lot about the main villain as well.\\n\r\nThe main crew does get the chance to show a bit more of their backgrounds as the rest though.\\n\r\nIt is a shame we do not learn the name of the narrator though he does get his own episode (!) and we have a lot of fun with him before and long after that as well. I have never seen a show that interacts with the narrator this smoothly even adding towards the story.\\n\\n\\n\r\nI think this show might be a good start for non-anime fans but it does add to your enjoyment if you have watched an anime before.\\n\r\nThe re-watch value of this show is very high. I finished it for the first time other half a year ago and do go back to watching just one episode or even the whole thing from time to time. True, some episodes you will remember every joke and twist after a couple of re-watches but it will never fully lose its magic.",

            "content": "This is an unusual anime.\r\nIt does not take itself seriously and bears similarities to... galaxy angel and many other works.\r\nIn essence it is based on a loos idea of space adventures - the old kind of space adventures where universe can be magical and anything possible. The protagonist - \"space dandy\" is looking for previously unknown aliens for profit. And in that setting all kind of things happen. Sometimes the anime is comedic. Sometimes it gets sad. And very often it si surreal and even psychodelic. \r\nIt doesn't take your breath away, but it is definitely enjoyable, and unusual enough to watch it. \r\nDetailed breakdownbelow:\\n\\n\r\nStory: 6/10\\n\r\nThe story is episodic in nature, and has similarity to galaxy angels. Meaning that episodes are separate from each other, and on occasion next episode completely dismisses previous one. Basically, it is not as extreme as galaxy angel's \"story reset\" at each next episode but it is quite close to it.\\n\\n\r\nThe anime is quite ironic, on occasion self-references, and break 4th wall in couple of places. The overall feeling is that somebody just took the idea and tried to have fun with it, in somewhat silly and humorous manner.\\n\\n\r\nThe theme of an episode can be anything. From serious, to silly, and to surreal. Some of the alien landscapes and locatiosn were quite amazing. And were indeed, very alien.\\n\\n\r\nIf that makes sense.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8/10:\\n\r\nIt didn't make me go wow, but it is very solid and high budget. This animation is extremely fluid along with visual style. Here it is hard to find even a single frame where somebody stays tsill and only opens/closes mouths - as it happens in many cheaper animes. Characters, even minor ones have life in them. I would say that it even bears resemblance to miyazaki's movies in terms of animation quality and attention to characters. \\n\\n\r\nThe anime does use CG in couple of occasions, but it is very well done and nearly impossible to spot.\\n\\n\r\nVery solid art work, and very good animation.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 7/10:\\n\r\nIt is good. it is not breathtaking, but it fits atmosphere of anime well, and doesn't get in your way. It is also unique enough. Basically, you won't find anything similar to \"hall of mountain king\" or \"night at the bald mountain\", but it blends very well with the atmosphere and story of the anim, and it works.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 6/10:\\n\r\nThey're walking jokes/caricatures, pretty much. however, within bounds of a single epsidoe they can be complex and lifelike. Despite constant jokes, watching interactions between them is enjoyable.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 7/10:\\n\r\nI liked it, but wouldn't say I was utterly amazed. Maybe I saw a too much stuff. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7/10:\\n\r\nIt is a very good anime with high production values. I wouldn't put it at the same level as some of the masterpieces worth watching, but it is definitely worth a watch, mostly due to amazing animations, psychodelic sequences, and humorous story. \\n\\n\r\nOverall the anime looks like as if it was something from 1990s that was done today instead - with better technologies and animation qualities. There's minor amoutn of what some people could consider fanservice (mostly cute girls and certain cafe), but it doesn't really go overboard with it.\\n\\n\r\nIt is worth a watch. Definitely.",

Perhaps, it's a mix of the aforementioned three: a little space humor; healthy nerdiness; a lot of adult humor; humor that only cartoons can get away with; and finally, a dude who is a dude, a dandy dude in space.\r\nWhat it excels in, beyond the aforementioned three, is a markedstylization at every scientific loophole and time-space jump. The ramen episode, the ramen episode, the end. I'm really surprised at how varied the animation is, and appreciate the well-fit sound and soundtrack.\\n\\n\r\nLike Cowboy Bebop, some of the steps it takes are definitively for fans of western cartoons, hence the latter two of the aforementioned three.\\n\\n\r\nFinal words: the end song is extremely addictive and geekily glorious.\\n\\n\r\nBottom line: If you enjoy Cowboy Bebop, Adventure Time, and Futurama, this is the anime for you!",

A few episodes later, when it becomes more apparent that it's just an occassional gimmick intended to keep audiences awake, there's actually a wealth of fun to be had watching this series.\r\nI binged the entire series over the past few days and have had an issue with two episodes in particular. First, the \"A Race in Space Is Dangerous, Baby\" was poorly written. It doesn't have any of that extra dimension that comes with all other episodes, and comes off as a homage to an already terrible cartoon, The Wacky Races. The otherepisode is the one where Dandy forms the Dropkix. The reason I didn't like that episode was because the entire thing was unapologetically out of character for Dandy. It was a good episode of something, but it differentiated itself in character from the rest of the series somehow - the whole band felt shoehorned in, like a TV executive mandated that one episode should be about dandy starting a band.\\n\\n\r\nAnyway, even though all the episodes seem weird and the universe seems to reset with every episode, they actually tied it up quite neatly at the end. The ending of this series is particularly awesome and well worth watching through the entire series to get to.\\n\\n\r\nI'll revisit this series down the road.",

            "content": "Kazuhira's Basic As Fuq Anime Review: Space Dandy Season 1\r\nStory 6:\r\nThe story of Space Dandy and his space crew, in space, is largely an episodic comedy. Very little information carries over to subsequent episodes. While several episodes exist in their own universe entirely. First half was relatively hit or miss, while the second half was rather enjoyably. A few episodes were quite praiseworthy, such as one of the more serious stories where Dandy encounters a rare species of alien, a little girl, whom he has to escort to collect the bounty on but bonds with.\r\nArt 9:\r\nMy gods the spectacle that is Space Dandy is abeautiful viewing experience. Even during the episodes I wasn't very fond of, the art itself made it worth watching. Use of contrasting colors, explosive particle effects and interesting character designs were glorious.\\n\\n\r\nSound 8:\\n\r\nThe OST of this anime largely consisted of jazzy grooves that just made you feel cool listening too. Very befitting of our MC Mr. Dandy. Worthy of special praise is the true OP which is fantastic. Let it be known that there were no tracks that I disliked or felt didn't belong in the scenes that they came from.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 5:\\n\r\nWhile Dandy and his crew were certainly fun to watch, there was little in the way of character development. As I stated prior, the series is largely episodic. Most of the time you could just assume that each new episode was a Dandy from a different universe. Regardless, there were enough new characters to keep interactions fresh and interesting.\\n\\n\r\nFinal Score: 7\\n\r\nSpace Dandy is a spectacle to watch. You can enjoy an episode at any time, and friends can jump into the show at pretty much any point, making it very accessible. While it may not be a masterpiece, Studio Bones has certainly put out a very good show. Looking forward to watching the second season.",

When I started watching the show. I had found clips of the English dub. I surprisingly liked it?!\r\nComing from a person who hates English dubs with a burning passion, it's surprising that I ever watched a dubbed version of a show before the subbed. The dub for this show is surprisingly enjoyable & I plan to watch the subbed after to compare the two.\r\nOverall, I enjoy the humor and the art work. The animation for theaction shots is pretty good. Especially episode one when Dandy first meets Meow. The backgrounds are also really good! However, I find the clips with the Gogol empire to be kind of boring and tedious after awhile. It was funny in the beginning, but then everything was simply expected. I didn't really care for that side of the plot. Space Dandy isn't one of my favorite animes, but I still enjoy it very much... I enjoy it so much that I'm currently saving up for a Dandy figurine... And maybe the Honey one too... If my wallet permits it.",

I typically skip the part with singing related scenes, but Space Dandy was the first one to ever just hook me onto the songs. The songs were fantastic even though no one talks about them. All the characters you meet are loveable douchebags. I enjoyed this anime not to the fullest becuase of how everythin almost seems to reset every episode, but it was still great none the less. I would recommend this anime to the people who are not into action, even though this anime is categorized as sci-fi. I took the time out of my anime binge watch just to write how much I adore this anime, especially that adorable blonde kid. This anime should have been categorized as slice of life, since it teaches about morals, even though they end up making fun of it 2 seconds later by showing how it never happens. Not my favorite anime of all time, but jesus-kun has blessed me with the music this anime has.",

Also meet more characters that are mostly forgotten about in the next episode. There's an antagonist. Okay, on with the review. Space Dandy is an odd series. Its as I said, about an idiotic bounty hunter in space. He really isn't that great of a bounty hunter or a booth hunter. This series is humorous in the way of how stupid and raunchy it can be. It's silly, dirty(ish) and it's great. The art is colourful and vibrant.The characters are quite good. The soundtrack is good. It's really enjoyable. But I have left the best thing for last. If you have watched the series you may have noticed that it has many similarities to another great series called Cowboy Bebop. This series doesn't just take inspiration from Cowboy Bebop, as many of the people who worked on Space Dandy were veterans who had worked on Cowboy Bebop. \\n\r\nDespite all the good things, there are two small problems I had with the series. It had no proper story to it, being an episodic series and the animation is a bit mixed at times with the quality sometimes getting worse but if you can look past those problems I recommend you to watch the series.",

            "content": "Space Dandy is, at the time of writing (March 8th 2016), my favorite anime. I think a lot of that is due to it being made for English audiences first, but I try to overlook that stuff. So what is Space Dandy? Many have made comparisons to Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, but I feel a more Futurama vibe from it. But enough babbling. On to the review.\r\nStory 8/10: [WARNING] - I may have spoiled something clever in this section. While the series is episodic and I can't spoil plot points, I'm throwing this up here just in case.\r\nThis show is episodic, but that doesn'tmean I can't rate the story. I just have to rate the individual stories. This series plays heavily with the multiverse, which you'll easily pick up on not only with the plot of most episodes but also in the lack of continuity. While some of the episode's plots have been done many times before (e.x., a Groundhog Day episode), the show has so much charm that they hold up on their own. While its hard to compare to Cowboy Bebop due to the massive difference in tone, it almost feels like a modern retelling of the classic. \\n\\n\r\nArt 9/10: Space Dandy is beautiful beyond belief. Bones of course has not failed to disappoint, but I feel a bit sorry for myself making this the second anime I've seen simply because it gave me such high expectations in the animation department. The outdoor backgrounds are painted with psychadelic landscapes while the indoor scenes are populated with dozens of wholly original alien creatures. Animation is always fluid and on the odd occasion where it seems more jittery it still fits with the situation. One of my favorite things about the show's look is how Dandy and Meow are animated in their movements. Both feel very alive at all times. I do have one complaint though, and that is that its painfully obvious where they cut corners in some places to save money for the rest.\\n\\n\r\nSound 10/10: Oh my God, the voice acting! The music is good too and always fits the situation but there's not much to say beyond that. The voice actors though, let me tell you, are phenomenal. I don't know what I can say about it to elaborate, but if you were to give it a listen you'd know immediately.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 8/10: Because its an episodic series its a bit more difficult to judge the characters. Dandy is the lovable buffoon who's a bit of an A-hole but not to a disgusting degree. Meow is the cute yet lazy and agressive sidekick, which makes sense considering his feline-esque species. Finally, QT is the classic straight man keeping them away from each other's throats and on task. There's also Doctor Gel and his assistant/henchman/secret lover whom I've forgotten the name of (looks like a bean) but they don't do much. These characters, despite how they may appear, do absolutely nothing in the story and act solely for comedy. Because of their ominous nature in the beginning of the series I know some people are upset by the fact that they aren't important so I felt I should get that out of the way before anyone else was disappointed.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 10/10: Nothing really to talk about here. Its good not-so-clean fun with goofy antics and subverted tropes around every corner.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 9/10: I really wanted to give Space Dandy a solid 10/10, but taking the average of all my scores for its parts came out to an even 9. This anime is clever, silly, brilliant, and a bit dumb all at the same time, and I applaud it for that. However, I had some problems with the second half. It didn't seem quite as creative, but you can hear my thoughts on that when and if I decide to review season two.",

            "content": "A fashionable Space-Chad, his auto-tune vacuum cleaner and his alien cat friend scour the galaxy in search of new life, in what could have very easily been based on a 2000-AD comic for all of its mix of clever sci-fi concepts mixed with well thought-out humour, that isn't afraid of also delving into the sophomoric (BooBies, anybody?)\r\nSpace Dandy is a show that says \"Hey, you linear continuity? F**k you, were gonna throw that out the window\" before we have even ended the first episode. I have to admire a show that has the balls to do that. \r\nThere are two things I love most aboutthis show; the first is the characters - both the regular cast and the one-time episodic characters manage to be distinct, memorable, and often hilarious. The tropes of 70's/B-movie sci-fi are fired up to the max, exaggerated to levels on par with Futurama's Zapp Brannigan. The second thing that I really love is the art style, maintaining a 70s Disco meets Cowboy Bebop vibe that serves as the shows standard, but then adjusts, usually slowly, to meet the tone of the episode (the most explicit and probably my favourite being the \"Plants Are Living Things, Too, Baby\" episode. \\n\\n\r\nThe series serves as a sort-of inverse to Cowboy Bebop in Watanabe's projects; S.D. ups the humour and lowers the feels that we see in C.B., yet both shows are able to balance these respective elements very well, which is particularly impressive to me with Space Dandy, as comedy is hard to do, particularly when translating to an audience with a completely different cultural perspective. Particularly impressive is when you manage to mix this in with crazy sci-fi concepts that are happy to build up to stupid end-of-episode punchlines (wait, am I sure this wasn't based on a 2000AD comic?)\\n\\n\r\nAs with every show, Space Dandy has its flaws, but sadly its biggest is tied in so closely to the core of the show that it becomes hard to ignore. As much as I can admire the inability of Space Dandy to not give a f**k in respect to continuity/4th wall breaking, it also serves as the shows biggest weakness. In a show where it is established that \"anything can happen\", including characters being killed off/stranded/left behind/sucked into black holes/etc and returning to normal the next week, it means that nothing in the show matters. All tension, and even arguably any character development the characters go through, is essentially killed off. I have no problems with anime being purely episodic in nature, but its hard to deny its a bit jarring, even if it is intentionally so for comedic effect. If there wasn't so much to fall back on (with particular weight put on the comedy and art-style here), I would call this particular issue critical. As I say, there is a lot else to fall back on, but I would like to have felt a little more excited in the scenes that are supposed to and established to be... well, exciting.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, there is a lot to love about Space Dandy. If you are happy with shows that don't take themselves too seriously while still delivering impressive comedy, colourful characters and some truly great episodes and stylistic animation choices, then I'd say you should stick this show on, sit back, and go with the flow, baby.",

            "content": "Space Dandy is a Dandy guy in space\r\nCreated by the same Director of Cowboy Bebop and Samurai Champloo comes a anime about Dandy and his crew and their hunt for rare aliens. If you expect to get the same story/character quality as Watanabe earlier works then you might as well skip this one. Space Dandy is a episodic series with no real connection to each episode. In one episode the crew turns into a zombie and in the next one they go for a hunt on a giant breast monster.. yes you heard me right. Then in the next episode after that they are backat their spaceship alive and ready for more stupid hunts. \\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nPlot & Story - 6\\n\r\nEach episode does something different. Some episodes are great while others are decent, but for the most part it's pretty enjoyable. There is nothing special going on other than a new setting in which Dandy and his crew are stuck in, hunting aliens or doing something weird like a space race or being on a planet with talking flowers while being chased by a gorilla general for no reason. So If you are looking for a anime with a story and buildup then you will be disappointed. It reminds me of adult cartoons like Family Guy and Simpsons, with action and humor but there does not seem to be a point A to B plot goal for the show to reach. \\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters - 6\\n\r\nDandy is Elvis inspired dude, who really loves hit up on all female characters in the show, even if they are aliens. QT is a cleaning robot who is probably the smartest out of the crew.. but then again none of them are really smart to begin with. Tho to be fair as a robot he has a pretty decent character around him, and gets his own episode at the end that shows a more emotional side of him. And at last there is Meow, a weird cat alien like creature who wears shabby clothes and spends a lot of his time on his phone being lazy. From time to time he argues and fight with Dandy which is pretty fun to watch. What I miss is more character development, its pretty lacking even if you take the episodic nature into factor. \\n\\n\\n\r\nSound & Music - 7\\n\r\nWatched the first episode in sub and there rest in dub. Both are pretty good. QT has a auto-tune voice in the dub which fits him well. The intro is good, with a funky song that I still have on my brain... don't know if it ever will leave my brain. The soundtrack is for the most part good, nothing rememberable but nowhere bad either. \\n\\n\r\nArt & Animation - 9\\n\r\nThe strong point of this series by far. Wonderful animation, particularly in the first episode. So many colors and fluid animation in motion. The animation quality drops a tad bit after that but stand very strong \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 7\\n\r\nSo far I have been very critical of Dandy expect for the animation. But despite the character and plot flaws I enjoyed Space Dandy for what it is. I did not expect another Cowboy Bebop, but I still think its important to point out what they could have done better and what someone should expect jumping in to it. I will not go out of my way to recommend it, but I recommend to everyone who I into episodic shows with action and humor. \\n\\n\r\n7/10 \\n",

            "content": "Space Dandy is a 26 (splitted in 2 parts)episodes anime series,directed by Shinichiro Watanabe(The guy behind Cowboy Bebop and Samurai Champloo)\r\nIn my opinion this is his best work yet .\r\nWhere to start...the story is mostly episodic.We follow the adventures of Dandy and his friends in search of rare aliens.And thats it,well..kinda.There is a bit of plot going in the last few episodes of season 2.\r\nThe episodic nature of the show and the setting are the strongest parts of the show in fact.The whole show is SUPER versatile and any kind of story works PERFECTLY well.There are different kinds of episodes-with drama,comedy,romance,action,mystery,you name it.The whole teamwas incredibly creative with every single episode.We explore different planets,characters,aliens,universes.Our characters die in few episodes and in the next they are alive.A lot of people hated that and thought that it would never be explained.Weil they explain it in the midlle of the second season and it's very interesting.\\n\r\nA lot of people dislike the show,because of the characters and the humour.Well in my opinion the cast is great.They are not your typical anime cliche and have positive and negative traits.Every character from the main cast gets their screen time and moments of glory.The end of season 2 focuses on character development and a bit of drama.\\n\r\nMy favourite episode from season 1 was ep 5 and from season 2- ep 10.About the humour-it's not your typical anime comedy,which can be hit or miss.It depends on your taste.\\n\r\nThe animation-in my opinion this is the best looking anime tv series.The design of the planets and the aliens is amazing.The character design is stylish.The animation style changes between some episodes to reflect the tone.The opening is super catchy and presents the show amazing.\\n\r\nI would give it an easy 10/10 it's not perfect obviously,but this is probably the most creative show out there.",

            "content": "Alright. I'm becoming more familiar with anime and have been seeing too many negative reviews for this show, so I must write my opinions down for Space Dandy whether I am a credible source or not.\r\nFirst of all, the plot: Space Dandy's crew tries to hunt rare aliens to make money and spend it how they please.\r\nThe gorilla (Dr. Gel) is chasing Dandy, because he is believed to possess a rare element known as pionium. Pionium is believed by Gel's employer- a SPACE EMPEROR WITH A FLAMING SKULL HEAD- to be the secret to defeating rival nations. How will it defeat these rival nations? Youdo not know unless you watch more of the series to discover its effects through Dandy.\\n\\n\r\n[This gives one the drive to view the series besides the creative mind-bending episodes that makes one think twice about how the universe works. Seriously. I have tried to view each new episode as critically as possible, but nearly each installment provided new and intelligent themes to enjoy and ponder.]\\n\\n\r\nArt: Space Dandy is one of the best series that I have viewed as far as animation goes. The movements are extremely fluid and no two characters are completely alike.\\n\\n\r\nSound: Fabulous. I take sound pretty seriously, and there are several episodes where my jaw tends to drop. In Season 2 episode 5, I love the scene where Dandy is dragged through multiple waves of water. How you imagine it would sound like if it were to happen to you in real life is exactly how it is replicated in the show. Voice actors are top notch as well.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Meh. Who cares. This show is all about doing whatever the heck you feel like, baby. You get 1 lazy luster, 1 techy moocher, and 1 hopeless goody-goody who are set amongst this amazing world, and you achieve a flat-out stellar experience. Feel good. Feel unashamed. Do your best. Do your worst. If all else fails, pull a cosmic string and move on to meet more species in the amazing universe both friendly...and not...\\n\\n\r\nGrasping the tone of this anime- the lightheartedness and intrigue of discovery- is probably the most difficult \"task.\" However, I believe Space Dandy to be one of the easier animes to understand, because the show makes a firm point that not everything can be understood. Dandy does not care and neither should you. This is perhaps the only reason that I rate this show a 9 instead of a 10, because it's human instinct to make logical sense of the world. Therefore, it may not have universal appeal.\\n\\n\r\nTry it and enjoy.\\n\\n",

SPACE DANDY IS AMAZING!!!!!!! If there's one criticism I have with the series is that there wasn't an OVA. Everything from the Story to even the Visuals was amazing. It's so good that I'm rewatching it at this very moment as I type these very words. But enough good. Let's get into the nitty gritty.........the BAD. Here's the thing. As fun as Space Dandy is.........it can kind of get old after a while. Sure it's fun seeing Dandytry to pick up chicks and catch aliens but......That's all Space Dandy is. A guy and his crew catching aliens and hanging out at Boobies to try and get chicks. Now that's not to say the series is in anyways bad. It's really good, and when it has it's emotional moments, it works. Those moments can get you really emotional. Overall I'd give Space Dandy a 8. It's in no way a masterpiece but it's also not the worst piece of trash in any pile. It's overall a good series. I'd recommend anyone watch it if they want Cowboy Bebop's spiritual successor.",

That's it.  If you read through the reviews, it quickly beocmes apparent most of them went in expecting Cowboy Bebop or a space adventure series with a 12 episode plot.  Space Dandy is none of that.\r\nLike K-on is cute girls doing cute girls, Space Dandy is about a cool guy doing cool things.  It is episodic and each episode is a ride in and of itself.That is what this anime is.  You can't criticize it for not having an overarching plot in each episode because that's not what Space Dandy is.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is a solid 10/10, the characters are rather static but they are great and fun to watch, and the story of each episode varies in genre and complexity but is almost always interesting.  Space Dandy has 20 minute romances that outclass what other anime do in 24 episodes.  It depicts the rise and fall of a galaxy-famous rockstar, a touching parental relationship between two unrelated people, and so much more.  Its experimental animation and story-telling techniques could have flopped, but they didn't.  \\n\\n\r\nThis is an anime you should watch and enjoy for what it is instead of complaining about what it isn't.  Just skip season 2 episode 4, which is actually trash.",

            "content": "Note: This review covers my general thoughts for both seasons of Space Dandy.\r\nThis has got to be one of the most underrated anime I have ever seen. It is consistently funny, gorgeously animated, has a surprising amount of emotion, and full of memorable moments and characters. There is such a huge variety  of episodes in terms of tone and genres that I guarantee that there is at least one episode that you will like.\r\nThe cons:\r\nThere really is just one con I could find. Space Dandy is very episodic. If you are looking for an anime with an amazing, multilayered, deep, and unpredictable plot. Youwon't find it here. The over arching story is as bare bones as it gets in Space Dandy. Though I personally feel its episodic nature is the show's greatest strength some might view it as being to simple or random and unfocused.\\n\\n\r\nAll of the characters except Dandy. Though I personally liked all of the other characters in the show besides Dandy himself, some could see them as uninteresting or underdeveloped. The Show is really all about Dandy, but I will say that every other character gets at least one episode that focuses entirely on them and gives them a chance for development.\\n\\n\r\nThe pros:\\n\r\nThe animation. if you are familiar with Studio BONES this is hands down some of their best work. The animation is stunning there is always something beautiful to look at on screen. If you are not familiar with studio BONES some of their works include: My Hero Academia, Soul Eater, One Punch Man (many free lance animators that often work with BONES worked with studio Madhouse on One PUnch Man), Cowboy Bebop, Fullmetal Alchemist, Sword of the Stranger, and Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood.  \\n\\n\r\nThe sheer variety of stories and genres this show tackles means that the show can please anyone. There is a musical episode, an episode that pays homage to all the classic George Romero zombie films, there are whacky space adventures and races, there are episodes that act as great love stories, there are episodes that are full of emotion, there is an episode like a rock and roll band bio-pic film, there are episodes about time travel, other dimensions, an episode like a courtroom drama series, there are episodes that have horror elements, and so much more. It might seem like I am spoiling a lot but trust me when I say these episodes need to be seen to be believed. This huge variety of episodes also lets us see a lot of different aspects of Dandy's (the main character) personality. I feel that you do not always need a over arching story to have complex or interesting characters and feel that Space Dandy is proof of that. He can be dumb, gentle, sleazy, smooth, genuinely kind, confident, vulnerable, bad ass, and so much more.\\n\\n\r\nThe show is almost always funny and when it isn't, there is still a surprising amount of emotion. Plus there is always some incredible animation to look at.\\n\\n\r\nSide note, The dub for Space Dandy is awesome.",

            "content": "::THIS INCLUDES MY THOUGHTS FOR THE ENTIRE SERIES, CONSIDER THIS A REVIEW FOR BOTH SEASONS::\r\nSpace\ud83c\udf1fDandy is easily the most visually impressive anime of the last couple years, excluding the Monogatari Series. And seeing as Studio Bones is responsibly for this, it's a pretty reasonable assumption to make when you haven't seen it. And if you have, like me, then you'll understand completely. Space\ud83c\udf1fDandy is a show all about free will and free expression, all the way down to its very framework (or should i say... \"bones\" haha).\r\nWhen looking at the people who worked on this show, you'll come to notice a broad range of verytalented animators and directors including its main director, Shinichiro Watanabe, who you should know as the director of Cowboy Bebop AND Samurai Champloo. Space\ud83c\udf1fDandy also boasts the involvement of Shingo Natsume (director of One Punch Man), Sayo Yamamoto (Director of Yuri on ICE), and various script writers, including Sato Dai and Ichiro Okouchi (the original creator of Code Geass). \\n\\n\r\nWhat this is is a pool of talent from all over anime, coming together to create this strange show known as Space\ud83c\udf1fDandy. When watching the show, you'll notice just how distinct Space\ud83c\udf1fDandy really is. Unbound creativity really all you can expect from any given episode of the show. It really is quite dandy.\\n\\n\r\nThe Visuals:\\n\r\nThis is where the show is not only the strongest, but also crosses the line into being groundbreaking. There is no shortage of times when I was completrly blown away by some of the animation in the show. A good example would be one of the later spisodes of season 2, where there are 4th dimensional beings and 2nd dimensional beings interacting eith the 3rd dimension (ours), and the way the show is able to visalize this already awesome idea is very interesting to look at. \\n\\n\r\nSpace\ud83c\udf1fDandy utilizes many different, yet similar methods of animation and color design. the show makes full use of the entire visible color spectrum across both seasons. Many times, the outlines of the characters will be blue, or red. And that always makes for a cool effect. The character designs are all very distinct from each other and have enough detail in the, to tell you something substantial about the characters, but also simple enough to where it can be animated easily and doesn't ever look awkward.\\n\\n\r\nThe talent that was put into this series is never wasted, and it feels asmif the show is constantly in a state of evolution. Nothing ever gets stale, and there is no real hardline status quo in terms of visuals. But it still has cohesion, and each episode is identifiably Space\ud83c\udf1fDandy without a doubt.\\n\\n\r\nThe Sound Design:\\n\r\nSpace\ud83c\udf1fDandy proudly exhibits great voice acting both in the english and japanese versions. I personally watched the dub, and I can vouch for its quality. Ian Sinclair plays Dandy, and he does an amazing job! I have liked a few Sinclair roles in the past, but this is easily his best. The dub has many other good voice actors and actresses including Alexis Tipton, who does a surprisingly good job. There is also noteworthy a minor role in season 2 played by Johnny Young Bosch that was infinitely more amusing when i realized he was playing a character with the same first name.\\n\\n\r\nThe series has a really kickass opening theme with a catchy beat and lyrics that are fun to sing along to. The OP feels like an explosion of color, which feels very appropriate for the series, even when an episode might be in monochrome.\\n\\n\r\nThe Story & Characters:\\n\r\nWhen it comes to characters, there are mainly three core cast members. Dandy, Meow, and QT. There are other recurring characters like Dr. Gel and Honey. But none pf the episodes are ever really about them. Each character has a distinct personality thatmaffords for all kinds of interesting and fun interactions between them.\\n\\n\r\nAlright so first off is Dandy. He's a dandy guy in space. He's characterized as a normal dude, and really all he lives for is to just go to Boobie, his favorite restaurant. While what he literally is described as is quite simple, what he represents  is far more fundamental to the anrrstive of the series. Dandy represents free will. And the show is a celebration of free will and free expression. And the finale of season 2 is the best literal example to give (but i won't spoil it for you, you'll just have to see for yourself!)\\n\\n\r\nThen there is Meow. I love Meow. A catperson after my own heart. Not only do i love cats, but I also love Meow's personality. He just kinda slacks off and chills and does his own thing. And what he does mostly consists of stuff I would do. I love his easygoing attitude and how he is always looking for the most convenient way to accomplish the various missions he, QT, and Dandy go on. There is a really good episode in season 1 that characterizes him more, but i'll let you experience it for yourself!\\n\r\nSome of the best jokes involve him too.\\n\\n\r\nLastly there is QT, an intelligent vacuum cleaner robot thing. He is basically the straight man of the trio. While i dont like him as much as Dandy or Meow, QT is still a really fun character. He is often the voice of reason, and the one who is constantly dragging Dandy and Meow down the muddy dirt road of responsibility. He has a pretty interesting personality considering the nature of his being, and he has some pretty witty lines and some good jokes.\\n\\n\r\nNow let's talk about the most interesting element, The story.\\n\\n\r\nSpace\ud83c\udf1fDandy is about a Dandy guy in Space. And that's really the most consistent thing across every episode. Yeah sure Dandy and his crew are alien hunters and they often are hunting rare aliens, but not every episode is about that. Some episodes start off with that being the main motivation, but it quickly evolves into something else. While some episodes are better than others, they all have some interesting element to them that is unique to THAT episode. One particularly strange episode is set on a plaent compeltely populated by plants that are not technically alive, but clearly are when you talk to them. It's stuff like this that made me go \"whoa, wtf is this?\" very often.\\n\\n\r\nThe setting is a very unique blend of Science Fiction, Contemporary Fiction, and Fantasy. So there really is no restriction in what the series can portray in any given episode. One episode will take place in a high school and be a musical, but then another episode will be about a zombie apocalypse, or it'll take place on a world where the life is so alien to what we understand as living that it's hard to describe as alive, yet it is.\\n\\n\r\nThat is another one of Space\ud83c\udf1fDandy's best elements. The fact that any episode could be about anything makes the show unpredictable. Some episodes are just goofy comedy, others are touching and sentimental, and others explore some really out there sci fi concept. \\n\\n\r\nSpace\ud83c\udf1fDandy is like a box of chocolates, you never really know what you're gonna get. And the chocolate is always tasty no matter what.\\n\\n\r\nI give this entire series a 9/10. I would recommend this to anyone looking for some cool, inventive, often trippy animation. Or if you like episodic adventure shows, or just shows that are strange. Really anyone could watch Space\ud83c\udf1fDandy and appreciate it. Either way, WATCH IT. WATCH IT NOW.",

            "content": "This show got a ton of slack from the cowboy bebop fanboys. But in all honesty, If you're wondering if you should watch the show or not i highly recommend it. The story follows dandy, who is a bounty hunter tasked with finding new species of aliens for cash.  Along for the ride with him is two other protagonists, Meow and qt, a robot and taking cat. This show will mainly keep you focused on its art style, humor, and how each episodes story progresses. Yes this anime is an episode by episode anime, But it all ties together towards the end. Dandy isan amazing character who isn't one dimensional by any means. In each episode we see that not only does he have a lust for the female figure, But that he's also a caring individual who relies on the characters who travel with him. To rap this up. Speaking from a non biased opinion. Give the show a try. If the first 5 episodes don't do it for you, then drop it. If you liked cowboy bebop. Chances are you will like this show as they are practically in the same universe.",
