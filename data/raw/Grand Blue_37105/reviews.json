            "content": "College life is a bit different from high school. For those who don\u2019t know, it\u2019s like venturing into a society where some people live by the rules and others makes them. To me, Grand Blue came as a show that explored a carefree life while mixing in adult humor, diving elements, and drinking shenanigans. It\u2019s one of those shows that is hard to not laugh your ass off once you realized what you\u2019re in for.\r\nBased on the manga written by Kenji Inoue, Grand Blue stands out more as a modern slice of life that adheres to a young adult cultural society. Here, we meet aguy named Iori Kithara who starts his new life as a college student on the Izu Peninsula. His place of residence happens to be a diving shop known as \u201cGrand Blue\u201d and thus where daily life adventure begins. Now, I should say right off the bat that a show like this relies on stereotypical humor with plenty of jokes in between. If you\u2019re not ready for that, just turn back now. \\n\\n\r\nGrand Blue\u2019s storytelling mainly chronicles the daily life adventures of Iori although plenty of other characters are featured aside him. The main cast consists of diving club, also known as the \u201cPeek-a-Boo\u201d. He meets others including his cousin Chisa, Nanaka, Kouhei, Azusa, Toshio, and Kotobuki. Among this group, the male cast seems more like they are in love with drinking more than diving. The first episode immediately sets off the humor with the nakedness and adult jokes from the very start as we meet the core members. That is to say, Iori himself also lacks common sense when he attends his first day at college while being half naked. Judging from just this impression, it should be easy to recognize that the show love to make fun of its characters. It uses stereotypes that makes fun of college life such as young adults drinking and partying. Then, there\u2019s meta-humor that plays on jokes with the nudity. It\u2019s also self-aware being that it never attempts to disguise its humor. Certain characters are very aware of their actions regardless of consequences and this often sets off the wrath of others such as Chisa.\\n\\n\r\nFor the main female cast, it consists of a colorful group with a diverse range of personalities. The most level-headed person in the show is Chisa who takes many things in life seriously. She also loves diving and geniuely enjoys the feelings of being in the azure ocean. She\u2019s like the anti-Peek-a-boo member in the show as she can\u2019t tolerate being embarrassed. Because of this, there\u2019s often a clash between her and Iori as the two gets into compromising positions. The end result is often Iori taking the blow and Chisa face palming herself. However, it\u2019s also noticeable that she does care about Iori especially during brief flashbacks before them. Often times, I guess you could say that she misses her childhood with him and reliving those moments brings a peace in her mind. Then, we have Nanaka who seems to play the role of an older sister type for the main cast although at the same time, she also has an unhealthy infatuation towards Chisa. It\u2019s the type of humor that makes fun of siblings but in a sarcastic way. Azusa is the senior student who behaves much more like the guys in the show. Her bisexuality is hinted at many times and often makes sexual jokes at others, especially Iori. Last but not least is Aina, a freshman who is much shyer compared to the others. She does go by another persona early in the series so watching her sometimes may remind you just how different her two personalities are.\\n\\n\r\nBetween the guys, a main selling point in the show is the character chemistry. Regardless whether you like it or not, there\u2019s an abundance amount of humor when the guys interact with each other and it often comes off as absurd humor. The most prominent is between Iori and Kouhei. They are often observant but says things that may be interpreted in the wrong way. They often get into trouble with the women in the show too given their actions that disregards common sense. The two also gets into many bickering moments. Early in the series, the series also makes fun of the guys with porn jokes. And let\u2019s not forget about the drinking. Pretty every male character in the series loves to drink whether it\u2019s alcohol, beer, vodka, wine, or whiskey. As you may expect from action that results in consequences, the guys behave like drunks while stripping naked and causing questionable scenes. The series pokes fun at this type of adult humor by covering their private body parts with black censored circles. It\u2019s the type of self-aware humor that you\u2019ll witness quite often.\\n\\n\r\nSo now what? Is this series just a giant ball of meaningless humor? Or is it something more deceptive that people misunderstands? To me, Grand Blue stands out as a show that deals with adult gimmicks and stereotypes but makes it into a humorous flick. It seems like a popcorn entertainment and you\u2019re not wrong if it feels like the story went nowhere in the end. However, the shows knows how it operates and inserts every joke with a clear intention. The guys in the series acts bold and behaves in ways that wild college students do. The girls are slightly mild but it doesn\u2019t detract them from getting into the party on occasions. There\u2019s a lot of running gags with the drinking jokes, nakedness, and misunderstandings. It\u2019s what the series uses to sell its humor. If you\u2019re in it for actual diving, there are some moments too with info dumps. Don\u2019t expect this like a relaxing slice of life as it\u2019s far too hyperactive to be considered as such though. Watch this for the pure entertainment and forget common logic. That way, you\u2019ll grow to love Grand Blue.\\n\\n\r\nZero-G has honestly been an unimpressive studio. Their lineup consists of shows that I hardly see anyone talks about these days (Battery, Dorei-kun the Animation, Dive!!). Their production quality is hardly stellar either. Thankfully, they managed to step up to the plate and capture the magic for this show. It deserved a glorious quality and got treated such way with the beach setting, aquatic ocean, and sunny atmosphere. Character designs also feels real with the cast looking like they are college students (although Aina sometimes makes me question this) Fan service is literally in every episode but they take the extreme during party scenes and drinking segments. Finally, I love the way characters reacts that pushes the envelope to the extreme. Iori and Kouhei are prime examples of this while others such as Chisa and Nanaka also have their own moments. Expressions of shock, anger, and confusion is shown right to your face in ridiculous ways. Thanks to the talented voice cast, it brings the best out of those moments. The OP song also adapts a playful feel to showcase the themes of the show. The ED theme song makes fun of pop culture such as karaoke that\u2019s so fun to sing along with.\\n\\n\r\nAs a fan of the manga, I think Grand Blue established itself as a self-aware humorous showstopper. Taking the risk of glorifying its humor made this show look like a joke at first glance. However, once you get sucked into Grand Blue\u2019s themes, you\u2019ll find love with this show. From the adult humor to the numerous character gags, it\u2019s an anime that plays with itself. It\u2019s a Summer sensation.",

            "content": "Every season of anime always has that one show. You know the one. From the start it receives constant praise and love by the masses, unrelenting in their desire to make their short-lived adoration known to any that will hear. For weeks it leads the figurative hype-train that has every seasonal watcher on board in anticipation to see where it ends up. The show you stay up late at night each week just to catch the latest episode on Kis-Crunchyroll.com. While every other show with potential may and probably will squander around the half-way point, this show \u2013 THIS SHOW \u2013 is the only oneto matter, for it holds the embodiment of why weeaboos traded their social life to solely watch Japanese cartoons.\\n\\n\r\nNewsflash: This ain\u2019t it chief.\\n\\n\r\nTo be honest, this season as a whole has been remarkably unremarkable given the obvious trends that take place in the anime community. Although it may not be so surprising given that the season prior was coined by many as \u2018The Greatest Season of Anime\u2019, even the most popular shows airing currently have made little more than a murmur throughout their runtime. Attack on Titan, Overlord, the \u201cfinal\u201d season of Gintama, all well-known series that have all fallen silent amongst the public. But when it comes to new series airing, Grand Blue had to have been a main attraction; based on one of the most popular manga serialized today that features Shinji Takamatsu as director \u2013 the same director for successful comedies School Rumble and Daily Lives of High School Boys. Yet\u2026 something\u2019s seriously off about this show, and since it seems to have slapped the tactfulness out of me, I\u2019m just gonna go ahead and say it: This show fucking blows. \\n\\n\r\nI was planning to say something along the lines of \u201cLet\u2019s dive into this\u201d, but whilst being the most clich\u00e9 cringe-inducing pun I could have possibly made, there\u2019s not very much at all to \u201cdive\u201d into here. Grand Blue follows 20-year-old Iori Kitahara who has moved to his uncle\u2019s seaside town for college, where he is almost immediately roped into joining a male-dominated diving club. But if you thought this show was about diving, it\u2019s a trap! Instead the club activities more or less revolve around drinking, stripping and getting hammered. Essentially, it is a comedy anime focused on the college life so a basic plot such as this is harmless so long as the comedy hits its mark. However, that simply is not the case. Instead Grand Blue comes off as an American frat house flick turned into a gag anime, except with nearly all the effort sucked out. \\n\\n\r\nNow I understand that comedy in general is heavily subjective so what personally may not land well with me could very well come off as a massive hit to someone else. Nevertheless, I have so many issues with how the show handles humour. One of the first instances of this come from the running joke where every other character tries tricking Iori into getting drunk. Conceptually, this does not strike me as humorous, but the ridiculous ways this is tried alongside dysmorphic character faces utilized certainly add to the punchline and made me laugh the first few times. But a cardinal problem with Grand Blue is that a joke which becomes par runs the risk of growing dull, and while using different scenarios can keep things fresh, Grand Blue instead decides to drive them into the ground as fast as possible. Sure, the joke earned a few chuckles the first couple times, but then they use it once more, and again, and again\u2026 and again. Numerous times the overabundance of these quips was akin to beating a dead horse, and if at that point it does not feel overdone then I just do not know what to say. Clearly Grand Blue is a comedy show that lends itself to multiple running gags throughout the 12 episodes, but the way they are used is what inevitably ceases the series to deliver the same results each time on viewers like myself. \\n\\n\r\nAnother issue with the comedy presented here more often than not is the timing. Timing is obviously a key factor for basically any form of comedy, especially with the kind of jokes Grand Blue exploits that rely heavily on the punchline. Yet here poor timing is so apparent that it comes off almost amateurish by the staff. Maybe this is a limitation when adapting the source material. I have not read the manga, but due to anime being\u2026 animated, it limits the way one can interpret a scene compared to a series of still pictures; the anime ends up much more restricting on the imagination. The punchlines themselves are also somewhat confusing at first if you had high expectations of Grand Blue without having read the manga. The series seems to treat comedy at a fairly lowbrow level where majority of the time punchlines were aimed between the more innocent characters being coerced or embarrassed by other club members. Sure, lowbrow humour can be funny and even I find it hilarious sometimes, but considering this is also a light-hearted comedy, makes Grand Blue\u2019s task of making someone like myself laugh incredulously difficult. What also works in their disfavour are the more heartfelt moments mainly centred around Iori gaining appreciation for diving as a whole. These moments COULD have been useful as far as getting better invested in his character, except there is one serious problem: he has no character. You should not expect much in the way of development or characterization presented as there are only a handful of character worth remembering just to remember the plot meanwhile everyone else, despite their own \u201cplot\u201d are flat as a pancake. Again, due to Grand Blue being primarily comedy, there is barely any expectations as far as the narrative or characters go, yet the show continues to spread itself thin that I, as a viewer, am left with barely anything to truly grasp onto. Maybe I\u2019m just an old fag.\\n\\n\r\nPerhaps the key problem I have with Grand Blue is not with the comedy or even the characters, but the subject matter. There has been an increasing amount of anime set in higher education as of late, each with their own take on a core aspect of college life. But before Grand Blue I had never been exposed to one that focuses primarily on the parts where the main characters get blasted off one\u2019s face, and after watching this, it really does makes sense why. As a student myself I can tell you with assurance that there is not much fun getting shit-faced and even then, it does not last long. To those reading this that have experienced a hangover probably understand this most and, perhaps more importantly, the after-effects. Headaches, drowsiness, poor concentration and nausea are just a mere few of the symptoms that coincidentally are also felt when watching these moments every week. One of the most common appraisals about Grand Blue is how relatable the show is. I\u2019m sorry but the main aspects that are relatable to real life here are not things that I would be celebrating as much and like those who have had poor hangovers, is something I would rather forget about. Although when it comes to alcohol in Grand Blue, there is nothing more depressing than seeing each episode open with a disclaimer about legal alcohol usage. Now, they were probably necessary to even have the series airing in the first place but way to present the exact opposite of comedy at the beginning of each episode. Of course nothing is mentioned about the nudity seemingly ever-present here; I see Japan has their priorities straight here.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of; yes, I am a straight cis-male. I\u2019m not ashamed. I have no interest in the male nudity displayed in Grand Blue, but holy hell do they have the least creative way of censoring dicks. As aforementioned I have not read the manga, so I do not know how scenes were drawn but it is such a lazy way of going about it, though it does match the effort that arguably went to the overall visuals of Grand Blue. It looks absolutely lacklustre. Below average animation for practically every scene. Poor designs, even for the male supporting cast (no homo). This is not a series to watch for its technical appeal, because there practically is none. However, I find this fact to somehow work in its favour as far as the entertainment goes. Seeing comedic scenes with laughable animation effects certainly has a charm to it; perhaps a \u201cso bad it\u2019s good\u201d quality, but not enough to warrant slogging through it all. Even fanservice for the male demographic was at a minimum. As far as the sound, both the soundtrack and voice acting are very forgettable. The opening and endings, whilst memorable, I personally found cringeworthy. Never will I not skip either if they ever happen to come up on a playlist. Just listen to these lyrics:\\n\\n\r\n\u266b\u266b Be passionate my friend\\n\r\nShine bright with the sun\\n\r\nDive into the blue sky\\n\r\nAnd let summer take it all \u266b\u266b\\n\\n\r\nAnd that is all there is to say about Grand Blue. It\u2019s clear that not many people will agree with my statements as it appears to be a strong fan-favourite of whatever is left of the community still interested in seasonal anime. If you like it then I\u2019m glad you enjoyed it, but there\u2019s probably better comedies this season. Watch them; I thought this sucked. Grand Blue was the equivalent of a grand disaster in my eyes and stands a reminder that \u201cin every age, in every place, the taste of weeaboos remain the same.\u201d I guess I\u2019m just not a fan of watching something akin to what the Fairy Tail guild would be like when knocked off their rocker. Anyways thank you to everyone who read my review. Be sure to leave a helpful if you liked-hell even if you disliked I\u2019ll still take a helpful! Leave a comment for what I should review next. 99% unlikely to actually do it but who knows. Au revoir.\\n",

            "content": "Grand Blue manga is the single most unfunny comedy series that is not Gintama. Naturally, when I heard it would be getting an anime adaptation from none less than Zero-G, I laughed like 7 minutes straight knowing how epic it would be. As expected, that was also the only funny thing related to this series.\r\nStory:\r\nWe don't have a story, but we have settings. Scuba diving. The funny part is that the series itself has practically nothing to do with scuba diving. The only thing that reminds even slightly of anything water-related, it is water boarding, as watching this is pure torture. The series is sobad I am surprised the UN has not banned it citing their human rights policies. \\n\\n\r\nThe \"story\" centers around this nu-youngster party crew where all women are fanservice figures and men even worse. These folks are so bland and boring that they can't have fun without alcohol and being naked, so they drink it and party and act in disgusting ways that mainly look like the combination redneck orgies and hipsters trying out psychedelic drugs.\\n\\n\r\nI am not exaggerating the least. Every episode of this series starts with a banner/disclaimer stating how it does not promote underage drinking even though that's the main content of the entire series. It's beyond me how gore, raping, bullying and other dark and edgy stuff is so appalling to so many anime fans, yet this fking thing is acceptable. Drunken trash is already nauseating to watch, and drunken trash teenagers even more hideous. That's the real fucked up shit right there. The assumably comedic content with its in-your-face fanservice and sexual content is highly similar to Prison School except the irony was removed so everyone is just a slut or manslut. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\\n\r\nOur cast is the worst part of the series. Iori's greatest merit is that he can appear in the series without wearing clothes. Chisa is your generic manhating mess who would be better fitting to Kuzu no Honkai than in any comedy series. Kouhei is the self-insert dude who is an otaku and does otaku stuff because he is otaku. Aina is so great no one even bothered to write her a biography. Azusa is this series progressive lesbian character who would be better off in Western industry and not in any anime. Kotobro is the best character because he doesn't have a personality so hating him is harder. Nanaka brings some more incest vibes because Chisa can't do everything on her own so that's cool. We also have a person named Shinji. If I forgot anyone, you can assume they also suck.\\n\\n\r\nProduction:\\n\\n\r\nThe art and animation go way below average medium quality. Not a single comedic scene stands out. Typical comedy effect are not used in any scenes. The voice acting is monotonous and bland. Nothing is pushed onward or polished. Perfect example of how bad everything in it is, is the very first comedy scene at 3 minutes mark into episode 01. This is your typical \"man walks into a bar\" gag, starting with mc wondering what type of people are behind  the door, opens the door and sees bunch of identical muscular boys playing janken and yelling some inaudible phrases (of course, being naked whilst doing so), followed by him getting on his knees cursing his life. I can think of at least 50 different ways on how this scene would have made me laugh, but I can't think of a single way how it would have left me with emptier expression. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\\n\r\nThere is nothing I can recommend less than Grand Blue. I'd hire a detective to find me where the fun in this series is supposed to be, but I am certain they would return without any leads.",

            "content": "(*Updated*) \r\nGrand Blue is an AMAZING MANGA and I highly recommend you guys to read the manga after you have watched episode 1 of the anime to get the voices in your head. Shifting away from the \"on how to watch\" (which is up to you), the adaptation is so far on point with the manga which makes me very happy! Within 4 episodes in, it looks like the format for each episode is going to cover 2 chapters of manga! This show is basically, If you like comedy such as Gintama, you will definitely love Grand Blue; a show about daily struggles of studentsduring their college life; a setting that is not often explored by anime.\\n\\n\r\nStory[8]; Without spoiling the story, the timeline is quite the same as Gintama's formatting their episodes. Not quite random, but random events that happens in unspecified, yet chronological timeline! That being said, Grand Blue's full of comedy including slapstick humor and exclusive college jokes that only college kids would understand! Perhaps a bit mature, but hell; Watch it! How would you experience anime without watching at least one episode huh? Do not skip on Grand Blue for sure!\\n\\n\r\nArt[8]; I mean with comedy genre of anime, the animation/art is sometimes replaced by how much you laugh, but the art is okay or good enough to an average anime viewer. Unless you are elitist... everyone knows that art does not correlate to quality/enjoyment of the anime such as Ping Pong the animation. The animators are trying their best to adapt art style from manga which it most part it does, yet people just like to nitpick on the smallest pixel. The Animation is NOWHERE NEAR BAD!\\n\\n\r\nSound[10]; Opening is very catchy and it gives out this \"dive vibe\" and the ending song has this \"closure vibe \" that, in my mind, represents the great laughter, joy, and sadness , waiting for the new episode patiently. Voice actors, in this show, must be mentioned because they have to put so much energy for so many scenes that requires: screaming out of lungs, playing serious in a stupid act, and playing the straight man of course. It's not easy to voice act, but they have some very familiar voice actors that fits very well with each character.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter[10]; Well, if you know your comedy with Gintama then you have heard the character type, the \"straight man\". Grand Blue basically formulates around a straight man with bunch of casts who are out of his/her \"norms\" that creates a ripple of unexpected events which are mainly comedic and i love it! And when you do such format you have to have some really original/funny/unique characters and ohh boy do they have it. Of course all of these characters are above the legal ages and attending college which makes these character more relatable to young adults such as me. You have the vast cast ranging from an Handsome stereotype who is an otaku, muscular alcoholics, the newcomer stereotypical MC that has high hopes on his new college life that ends up with the muscular alcoholics and starting to migrate to their new culture, and the cousin who hates the MC for being a dumbass for migrating to alcoholism, yet this is the few introducing characters in the anime; there will be much more awesome characters incoming later episodes that gives the show more color. The Characters interactions are the main seller of this show. Don't let other people tell you how the characters act in this show as dumb or stupid because, in my case, college students really do act similarly like the casts in Grand Blue! \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment[10]; This show is not for the weak or who do not get the college life... So it's not for everyone as the anime and manga's target audience are young adults or people who have experienced college. Of course outliers can enjoy this slapstick humor too. To give an example on how the anime represents the college life; a reference of different types of characters during an exam that have not studied for, showing their struggles within college classes which perfectly relates to students in real life college who failed or struggled with an exam(s) that professor made it absolutely impossible. There will be much more similar silly events around the theme of college life. All of those silly events are just comedic gold; ironically, very much like college! This show is already my most favorite anime of this year so far and deserve much more love. \\n\\n\r\nOverall[10]; Grand Blue is not for everyone, but it does deliver the college type of feel and I kinda skipped the part about diving in this review. Let's be honest.. this anime might look like about diving, but it's mostly focused on character interactions and how you should view your life as student in college. Animation are very nicely done and can be wonky at times, but that shouldn't really stop you from watching it. This show is a must try for this season! If you are a college student or you just love comedy, this show is for you!\\n\\n\r\nUpdated Opinion; I have been following the community opinion on the Anime adaptation vs the manga and they are some key notes to be considered: Age of characters have been changed for legal purposes, some of the atmosphere is not the same as in manga and some events got changed due to time constraints. With the release of the 4th episode; this episode has been proven me that the anime has done justice on adapting from the manga chapters 7-8! The characters are consistent just as in the manga. Cannot wait for the new episode! People who like to complain and consider themselves as \"Maestro Of Art Critique\", they are definitely watching the wrong anime because like I said; Grand Blue is not for the weak!",

            "content": "\"In Japan, the color blue signifies youth, a time of excitement and infinite possibilities\"\r\nHello everyone , this is my review of funniest show of this season and one of the best gag comedy i had ever seen in anime ..\r\nso Lets begin\r\nIntro:\r\nImagine what you expect when you going to college, we develop a lot of preconceptions about what it would be like i mean New places, new friends, maybe a new girlfriend. Go to some parties, maybe find somewhere I felt like I could really fit in and all that wonderful dreamy thought. Well our main protagonist Imagination is no different than an average studentwho just entering the college.\\n\\n\r\nAfter graduating high school, Iori moves to Izu, on the coast, to go to college for mechanical engineering. \u201cI\u2019ll put all my effort into having the best college life possible!\u201d he vows. \u201cI\u2019m going to meet cute girls, fall in love, and enjoy the pinnacle of youth with good friends!\u201d\\n\\n\r\nHe moves in with his uncle and, more importantly, his two beautiful cousins: motherly, long-haired Nanaka and tomboyish, short-haired Chisa. All of them work at the uncle\u2019s dive shop, the Grand Blue; unfortunately, so do Tokita and Kotobuki, macho dive bums who pressure Iori into joining the diving club even though he can\u2019t swim. Alas, Iori soon finds himself roped into their social circle, partying with a bunch of goofy jocks who just want to get naked and play all-male drinking games. Will Iori get to enjoy a cool campus life? Will he find love? Will the diving club ever actually get in the water? \\n\\n\r\nWell thats for the introduction part which sounds like an average college based anime \\n\r\nor IS IT!, so let examine in our further review.\\n\\n\r\nStory: (7/10)\\n\\n\r\nMost of the time we see gag anime fail to deliver a proper story line and mostly involved in delivering some random funny events and scenes.\\n\r\nWell Grand Blue is kind of done a decent job in constructing a story line. Sure we can say that its not a story based anime .However, Grand Blue does deserve credit in the sense that it doesn't completely devolve into comedy, as most events take place in a ocean setting, staying true to the foundation that it lay down. The Episodes are also loosely tied together, meaning that there is some degree of continuation. But in all we can say that its main purpose is to make audience laugh.\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt, Animation and sound:(9/10)\\n\\n\r\nArt is beautiful considering how they have utilize the beauty of locations including underwater and seasore and present it in a beautiful and artistic way. Animation is great, studio done a decent job in adapting manga considering manga artstyle is already top class we sure expect in the hands of a decent studio anime is pleasant to watch.\\n\r\nThere are some part i like to focus on which Grand Blue done a tremendous job that is adapting face expression with the scenes. Grand Blue Dreaming is a stunning treasure trove of reaction faces. With influences from hot-blooded fighting anime, horror movie framing, and direct references to other franchises, like this Great Teacher Onizuka and that Evil sarcastic Face which taken from Attack on Titans.\\n\r\nOP and ending is pleasant and beautiful as well as some underwater scenes are eyecatching.\\n\\n\r\nIt also done a great job in sound department including beautiful opening and ending sound. There are no characters who unnecessarily shouting everywhere and trying to make audience laugh .Voice actors done excellent job in providing tone which goes exceptionally well with the scene \\n\\n\r\nCharacters:(9/10)\\n\r\nCharacters are unique and excellent and each have there own funnier side perfectly well fitted for such gags Anime.\\n\r\nWe can see from absolute scumbags to a hot and weird otaku , from a shy tomboyish waifu material girl who has its own sadist side to a lewd Onee san including Airheads and some trouble some senpais.\\n\r\nGrand Blue has all to offer what is necessary for a gag anime, characters range from lovable bastards like club senpai Tokki and Bukki to absolute scumbags, with Iori somewhere in the middle. He has a veneer of respectability that gets shattered the moment he takes a sip of beer. Also our fellow dorks like good-looking but skeevy anime fan Kohei (\u201cWhy isn\u2019t there a club full of beautiful high school girls to be my harem?\u201d)\\n\r\nThe female character are more kind of average than you might expect from this particular strain of comedy, with the exception of Nanaka, who is pretty one note with the unpredictable and Lewd Azusa. Chisa and Aina for me is kind of okay serving as a balance in between all these crazy characters.\\n\\n\r\nSo Whats Lacking:\\n\r\nWell if you see the Manga, its clearly one of the best comedy manga ever made. For anime i feel it kind of fail to adapt the proper pacing of the Anime and how to give Focus on some particular scene. We can see same kind of thing with some famous anime like Food Wars (after 1st season) and Tokyo Ghoul. On some scenes and some part of the story it feel bit rushed which makes viewers who already familiar with manga kind of disappointed. Other than that i dont find anything which are lacklustre in the Anime.\\n\\n\r\nThe Bad:\\n\r\nThe other element that might not work for everyone is all the nudity and fanservice. The most explicit nudity actually comes from the boys in the club, who tend to strip when they get drunk.\\n\r\nThe women, however, in their skintight wetsuits, bikinis, or the occasional glimpse of underwear, are clearly supposed to be titillating.\\n\r\nWell i can say that its not for everyone who dont feel comfortable in such thing like nudity and drinkin\\n\\n\\n\r\nConclusion:\\n\\n\r\nGrand Blue is fundamentally a frat house farce in the vein of something like American Pie or The Hangover in anime version. Its comedy definitely has lot of consistency when it comes to make people laugh. If you want a show who you can watch with your friends with enjoyment and laugh this show deliver all the things you needed. \\n\r\nFunny events timing is impeccable, making great use of situations, and even manages to make repeating the same punchline funnier the second time.\\n\\n\r\nOverall its pretty good and satisfying show and definitely one of the best gag anime ever made also the funniest one but again you\u2019ll have to really love booze jokes, funny faces, and gags about guys being caught naked with little censorship marks obscuring their junk.\\n",

But lo and behold, he opens the doors to see..... NAKED MUSCULAR MEN. \r\nIt has a distinct art style that brings out more comedic effect at times, but the art is not anything ground-breaking, kind of normal and standard.\r\nThe music is okay, I actually really like the OP song, gives off modern EDM westerinized vibes. \r\nI love the characters, none of them are very annoying and all have theirown unique and funny quirks. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, I would say that this show is definitly worth a watch if you want something funny to watch this season.

In a full on comedy anime, a plot is probably one of the least important aspects. To me, a comedy anime is all about the enjoyable characters and overall entertainment. And Grand Blue has all of those.\r\nLike most comedy anime, it operates with a very basic story- a college freshman being all excited to have a great college life.\r\nHowever, it doesn't go as planned when he's forced to join a \"diving club\", in which the members drinkand strip more than dive (there still is diving I assure you). Yes, it's pretty ridiculous already, but it gets even better as the show progresses and more characters get introduced. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters are the life of any comedy anime. Without fun, fitting characters, a comedy anime just won't be the same. It doesn't matter to me if they seem slightly generic, as long as they show some personality and entertain.\\n\r\nGrand Blue has a good variety of different personalities which compliment each other perfectly to create hilarious exchanges. Whether it is a dumb, over the top MC, or an otaku \"ikemen\", or awkward virgin friends, or men (and women) who couldn't care less about getting drunk and stripping in public, Grand Blue has a good variety to keep the entertainment going.\\n\\n\r\nThe voice acting is also top notch, and paired with some incredible facial expressions, all the characters are funny in their own right. Honestly, the facial expressions are some of the most hilarious ones I've seen since Prison School. \\n\\n\r\nThere are many comedy anime out there which can have some funny episodes while the rest are a hit-and-miss. Grand Blue, however is very consistent in that regard. Honestly, comedy will always be a subjective genre. Grand Blue might not be for some, but those who enjoy a rather over-the-top comedy anime should definitely give this a shot.\\n",

            "content": "This is one of the most boring and unfunny shows that I've ever seen in my life.  \r\nOur main character moves into his uncle's diving shop, Grand Blue where he met almost all of the cast. I expected to find creative jokes and interesting characters but I was very disappointed. \r\nThe show barely try doing something new and becomes repetitive easily. The predominant jokes are: naked guys drinking, Kouhei and Iori fighting, forced misunderstanding and, to a lesser extent, Iori's friends harassing fellow virgin friends. I don't have any problems with this type of jokes (except the last one) but they are introduced somany times in a short time. Honestly, it's a little annoying. The worst part is that the show almost never try to have a cohesive pacing with the jokes.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters didn't help either. Along with the 95% of the jokes, they are generic and one-dimensional. Most of the girls (Azusa and Nanaka) are just fanservice figures while that the guys only exist for the sake of the naked joke (Shinji and Ryuujirou). The rest of them are more independent of the generic jokes but they're eclipsed by them. Chisa is a generic angry girl/cousin, Kouhei is the self-insert character, Iori changes his personality depending of the joke, and Aina, despite that falls in the category of shy girl, have some personality and she's the only decent character in the entire show. \\n\\n\r\nThe story is quite simple and linear. Is easy to follow.\\n\\n\r\nSurprisingly, Grand Blue has good moments about diving that were well handled by the studio but they barely appear and with the unfunny jokes in the middle is hardly enjoyable. \\n\\n\r\nThe animation is mostly good and the opening is amazing. On the other hand, OST is forgettable.\\n\\n\r\nSome people are saying that the manga is better but, here, I'm just talking about the anime version. I never understood why Grand Blue receives so much admiration. Basically, I was bored to death. If you are looking for a very good comedy, I recommend you to watch Asobi Asobase.\\n",

            "content": "\"This is a diving anime... Yes.. Grand Blue is indeed a diving anime only.\" - Typical Grand Blue audience.\r\nWhen you look at the comedy industry of anime, it is always topping-off the reviews, charts and everything. Why? Because either it has a good story with ton of great jokes, or the show is just very riduculous and have great humour. If you notice it, comedic anime are mostly in the school genre (specifically High School) which make sense because teenagers often goof up on school unlike adults who focuses on their life more. Then here we have Grand Blue, that is not a high schoolanime but college instead. Grand Blue is one of many comedy anime out there this Summer 2018 that offers us laughter that can relate to college students out there. And for some reason this anime offers diving (I guess) which I don't see pretty much often on anime (except swimming anime).\\n\\n\r\nStory:\\n\r\nGrand Blue's story is not really chronological and like I said on my other reviews on other comedy anime, it doesn't matter whether it is chronological or not as long as it stays on point to the humor and characters. We have here Kitahara, Iori who will move to his uncle's diving shop as his home in college. Seems normal isn't it? Thats where you are wrong. The diving shop have tons of ridiculous, weird and extreme practices including naked Rock-Paper-Scissors and drinking alcohol while your naked is COMPLETELY normal on this shop (Heck, even the owner which is Iori's uncle likes to get naked and used to it.).Then there's the university where he attends to which have variety of characters ranging from an otaku, crazy upperclassmen, charismatic boys from the tennis club and those typical friends you get who are all virgins. Grand Blue is a show where the MC is not really treated as an MC. Each character have unique comedic traits that can contribute to the story in whole. Whether the character is an otaku or not, they can make the story humorous alot. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nThe characters of Grand Blue is what makes Grand Blue one of the best comedy shows this season. If not maybe the best comedy this year as well. We have the main protagonists Kotegawa Chisa, who is a bit of a tsundere-type of girl and have so much love on diving. There's Kitahara Iori, who is the main attraction of all and probably a failure of a kind of college student. He is those characters that can adapt into any environment whether it is an environment full of titan-like men drinking alcohol or the under the sea environment. There's Imamura Kouhei who is the otaku of the diving club and the \"rival\" of Iori (There rivalry is actually very funny. Not those types of rivalry like Naruto and Sasuke.) and Yoshiwara Aina, who for some reason has the same attitude of Iori when he first entered the shop and she is probably the most normal one out of all the characters. This four for some reason are considered the main characters on MAL but in the anime, the other characters are almost treated as main ones as well. I say this because on every humour, its not only this four characters are contributing to it. The supporting ones holds the joke as well and thats what makes Grand Blue an anime that treats all the characters equally for the comedy and story.\\n\r\nFor example, the two naked titans Kotobuki Ryuujirou and Tokita Shinji are the two characters that have weird but funny sense of ways of drinking alcohol with friends. Hamaoka Azusa, who is the only girl character in the anime that likes getting along with the guys (and Mr. Alcohol) and sometimes she even gets to the enthusiasm of being naked (not completely). Also she loves both yaoi and yuri and this trait makes Iori and Azusa's relation to one another funny as well as Iori have to bear with it since he is not a fan of any of those two. Then, the sister of Chisa which is Kotegawa Nanaka, who have a big secret towards Chisa and possessiveness towards her. Not to mention the other characters like the friends of Iori and Kouhei at the university each gave way for more comedic scenes to the anime. That is why Grand Blue was funny as hell because their traits as well as some misunderstanding towards one another make it even more funny. They are all perfectly synchronize even though they are different characters.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nI can't stress out how the art and visuals of Grand Blue is stunning, funny and amazing at the same time. From the looks of their faces due to some scenes either shockness or anger, to the normal visual scenes and the underwater sea, Grand Blue tells you that this is not just a comedy show full of great humourous scenes but it also have eye-appealing scenes as well visuals of the characters and environment.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nIf you take a look of the openings of the anime that aired this Summer season, Grand Blue is the only comedy show plus not a sports anime that has such a good opening that reflects on summer (correct me if Im wrong here.) this season and seeing the opening with all the diving and the hidden wonders of the sea is just so pleasant and beautiful. Plus it is actually a click bait of an opening as the opening just reflected the diving parts of the anime but not the humors and drinking of it. The ending of the anime however reflects how absurd, weird and funny the anime is (opposite to the ending) where we saw Iori seeing into some Karaoke and after he finished the song the other 3 males and him gets naked. Pretty absurd right? I have no problems of the background music or anything that is related to the sound system throughout the episodes as well.\\n\\n\r\nOverall thoughts and Enjoyment:\\n\r\nAs you can see with my rating of this show, I totally enjoyed it. It is one of those anime this season that when you have a bad day or in a bad mood, just watch this show and you will be dying of laughter and releases your stress of anything. That's what makes comedy shows great in the anime industry and Grand Blue is one of it.\\n",

It is a show with a really awesome cast that all interact in different and funny ways with each other, making for some seriously hilarious jokes throughout the show. Seriously, I've almost died of laughter from this show many times. \r\nWhile Grand Blue is a comedy, its storytelling is also decent, as we learn how seriousdiving actually is from the supporting cast, and the beauty it can entail as well. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, Grand Blue is just a stellar anime and a perfect cleansing anime after a long day's work.",

            "content": "A phrase you hear a lot when it comes to comedies is \u201ccomedy is subjective\u201d and yes that is true but to some degree, but like any other art form in the whole world there is a way to do it well and a way to do it not so well. A good comedy will tend to use escalation gradually building up the events of the show while keeping a steady stream of the funnies and this is the one anime this year that does it the best. It manages to stay consistently funny but unlike other anime, its characters never stop the flow ofthe show to tell jokes. Grand Blue is the quintessential millennial anime\u2014which makes it a lot more relatable, especially if you have experienced the \u2018campus life\u2019 at college which heavily involves around parties, alcohol and living life to the fullest\u2014it can genuinely speak to anyone in its target demographic. Grand Blue is an animal house fraternity-style hijinks that draws the same vibes to the likes of the movie Superbad with recurring elements like running gags and character quirks.\\n\\n\r\nBased on Kenji Inoue and Kimitake Yoshioka's excellent on-going Manga, Grand Blue acts as a testament to anime's comedic potential because they are freed from the restrictions imposed by live-action series, anime has all the necessary tools in its medium to deliver some extraordinary reactions. After graduating high school, our main protagonist Iori Kitahara moves to Izu and enrols at the university there. He vows to put all his effort into having the best college life possible and wants to meet pretty girls, experience love, and making great memories with good friends! He moves in with his uncle and two cousins in Nanaka Kotegawa, and Chisa Kotegawa who are both pretty and Iori weirdly finds them attractive. Iori spends the vast majority of his time trying to convince them that he is not actually a pervert but most of Iori's pleas fall on deaf ears, the majority of the humour arises from Iori's earnest but misguided attempts to impress his cousins. He and his cousins work at the uncle\u2019s dive shop named \u2018Grand Blue.\u2019 But Iori is in for a rude awakening, Shinji Tokita and Ryuujirou Kotobuki, your classic meathead jocks pressure Iori into joining the diving club despite the fact that he cannot swim to save himself. He finds himself stuck in the middle of Tokita and Ryuujirou\u2019s circle of friends where partying, drinking-games and drunken-antics take centre stage. \\n\\n\r\nMisunderstandings are the name of the game, but Grand Blue consistently brings the house down with hilarious moments of slapstick and impeccable timing. For those who love Grand Blue's irreverent sense of humour, you can make the comparisons to series like Great Teacher Onizuka and Gintama in a way that they\u2019re truly experts at shocking viewers with a gut-busting reaction shot. The way Zero-G adapted the comedic scenes was masterful, especially the variety of references used for reaction faces and attire. You can see Great Teacher Onizuka and Attack on Titan-like facial expressions or the scene where Nanaka and Chisa are wearing suits from Neon Genesis Evangelion which adds a bit more punch to the gags. When a director such as Shinji Takamatsu on board who is widely praised for his work in Gintama, it comes to no surprise on how well its executed. The Opening and Ending are good but especially the latter, it feels like an extended scene to the episode, its just karaoke fun. Voice acting team did an exceptional job on the way the comedy was delivered and executed perfectly.\\n\\n\r\nLater in the series, it sinks in that Grand Blue is more or less satirizing the ambitious dreams alluded to in the title. Eventually, Lori learns the basic skills to diving, suggesting that the show leads directly to a more serious hobbyist direction. To get to that part you\u2019ll have to really enjoy lots of partying, plenty of booze jokes, funny expressions, and censorship marks covering the private parts of those caught butt-naked. Grand Blue is hilariously raunchy and ridiculously quotable. It's also a frighteningly realistic view of what 18-year-old high-school graduates are obsessed with\u2014sex, booze, parties and best friends. It offers many adult-themed jokes and has characters not only act like college students but talk, in the same manner, most of the dialogue is swear-laden-like. Its self-referential with its humour and does a great job of not making that aspect run its course, keeping the recurring elements fresh. So many humorous segments that have you laughing like you have a front-row seat to your favourite stand-up comedian.\\n\\n\r\nAs stated earlier, this show has a specific target demographic and there might be things that are not everyone\u2019s cup of tea like the explicit nudity and heavy fan service. There\u2019s also an incestuous thread from start to finish. Iori is attracted to his cousins but mainly Chisa, who\u2019s set up as his main love interest while her sibling Nanaka has a major sister complex. Although they go nowhere romantically the show is so saturated with incest jokes that you never take it seriously anyway. Grand Blue is rude, crude and partially nude, and one of the best comedies to come out in a long time. It's nostalgic in a way that takes you back to your more youthful days at the college campus and getting up the similar things portrayed in the show. Now we wait in anticipation for an announcement to experience yet another embarrassing dive into the campus life of Iori and his \u201cPeek-a-boo\u201d club members.\\n",

Characters are bunch of airheads with minimal worry about life. They drink they do stupid youth stuff. Studio done a good job? Characters and story overshadows their a bit better than decent job. \u0130 dont think it is easy make an anime about ocean, sea. Because wellearth is 3/4 water right :D. For sound opening song fits perfect. Voice actors are overshadowed and decent again imo. \u0130 wish that this anime continues like it is now and doesnt end like another anime with a meaningful close ending. \u0130t is just good as it is. At first place i dont understand why people wont give it 10. \u0130 know it is only 3 episodes off but all of those episodes just were amazing. \u0130 have never seen such an anime like this and none of them made me relax this much. Like ... this is not a fantasy world setting anime, this is not a loli filled slice of life, not a sports anime or some crazy shit anime or some ordinary thing. This is the most unique television production i have ever witnessed. Personally i declined kinda same situation but right now i am regretting.

            "content": "Coming from the amazing manga that made me laugh a lot, this anime doesn't reach its full potential. \r\nThis season wasn't going to be my favorite and was hoping that Grand Blue could save it all. However, when saw that the studio was Zero-G, I feared it to be a mediocre adaptation. \r\nThis studio has only created several shows and it still has yet to create a good one. Grand Blue could have been the adaptation that they were looking for, but they messed up pretty bad. \r\nStarting with the low budget art and animation, the first episode was a letdown. In comedy, animation canbe used to emphasize hysterical moments like in Nichijou. Lacking movement would create still frames and make the scene less attractive. Separate from the comedy, Grand Blue is about diving. It has the potential to create astounding scenes of the ocean, the marine life or the island, yet it did not surprise us with any beautiful scenery. Even at the moments where the character was in awe of the ocean, the art looked plain and didn't differentiate from its norm. \\n\\n\r\nTo add on, I especially do not like the white cloud effects that low-budget anime's use to reduce the amount of background shown for each shot. They could have used filtered-out photos and it would have looked better because of its detail.\\n\\n\r\nStory-wise, it follows the manga well but I've noticed that Chisa, the main heroine, has a slightly different personality from the manga. The anime makes her seem interested in Iori, instead of being indifferent to everything but diving. Anyone else noticed this?\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nHowever, the original work still stands strong and people watching this anime can expect a good laugh. If anyone becomes a fan of this series, check out the manga as well. You'll fall off your chair, laughing to tears. \\n",

            "content": "*spoiler free* \r\nI'm going to be completely honest-- there are far more reasons to dislike this show than to like it, in all honesty. But regardless, I find myself enjoying it much more than I honestly should.\r\nWhy?\r\nWell, it's just got this strange addictive quality that keeps me coming back to it. \r\nTo begin with, the story is pretty simple-- it's a comedic take on a college student and his party lifestyle. That's all there is to it. It's not special or even all that realistic, but it's somewhat more fresh and interested compared to the same old school anime we frequently get in this kindagenre. For that reason alone, it makes some of the 'problematic' stuff tolerable. There's the usual tsundere stuff and the romantic feelings that make no sense and the perverted crap and etc., etc., but it's just so lovable that it makes it hard to hate. \\n\\n\r\nFrom what I've seen so far, the art is breathtaking. All the characters and backgrounds are gorgeous, and the water is animated really, really well. It's just beautiful, enough said. \\n\\n\r\nThe opening is hard to skip, and this is coming from someone who usually watches an anime opening once or twice maximum-- usually the first episode and the last episode-- I rarely ever watch them otherwise. But the music is so much fun that I listen to it every time! The background music adds to the comedy and the closing is also pretty funny and makes me want to stay and finish it instead of moving on to something else as soon as the actual episode ends. \\n\\n\r\nIn my opinion, the characters aren't exactly phenomenal. The main character is the classic comedic mc... he's got nothing inherently special about him and is honestly flawed, perverted, has bad judgement, and does very, very stupid things most of the time-- but he's secretly got a hidden nice guy side that makes pretty much every chick fall in love with him. There's the classic tsundere, the classic hot girl, etc. etc. They're all very predictable but still entertaining enough to keep watching. Personally, I don't mind the harem style romances too much-- they can be pretty fun, especially since they have a lot less of the sexual assault situations that usually make up reverse harems. \\n\\n\r\nI honestly can't believe that I'm doing this, but I'm giving this anime an 8 as of now. My inner voice is outraged, but despite how predictable and problematic this anime is, I can't bring myself to not like it. In fact, I enjoy it all too much. \\n\\n\r\nI would recommend this if you: liked Baka and Test, like harems, like dumb main characters that everyone likes for some strange reason, like cute chicks crowding MCs, like college anime, like drinking/partying lifestyles\\n\\n\r\nI would NOT recommend this if you: like PC anime, want something deep, were expecting something actually about diving, wanted something sports-anime style, wanted some boy/boy tension, don't like harems, don't like tsunderes, don't like the classic dumb panty dropper mc\\n\\n\r\nHave a great day everyone! \\n",

It's like a lot of comedy shows, it's merely there to serve as the basis for jokes. Which is fine, we don't need some epic drama, or someinsanely serious story for a comedy. It's serviceable, non-offending. It does it's job. It can get quite a bit repetitive though, with the joke being basically\\n\\n\r\nIori and Kitahara don't wanna do a thing, usually involving alcohol -> their upperclassmen make them do the thing -> something bad happens due to the thing, usually because they're drunk\\n\\n\r\nNot the worst, but it's enough to not rate the story any higher.\\n\\n\r\nArt (5) - now we're getting to the first reason of why I don't like this anime that much. First part of this, the characters. The anime's character style is fine. Characters look nice, the exaggerated faces that people have aptly named Titan faces is still there, and is very well done. The character art is pretty solid, but my god, the animation. There are so many scenes in the show where it's just a still image, with the characters donning their titan faces, with nothing really happening but them talking, and some crazy graphic going on in the background. It's like the art director thought people wouldn't understand if something was a punchline unless they could make the punchline flashy, with Newgrounds level of animation. It's absolutely, and completely jarring, watching them walking and talking with decent animation, to these sudden jump cuts. \\n\\n\r\nSound (4) - just like art, there are parts of the sound that are well done, but then completely undone by something else. The voice acting in this show is pretty good, the VAs do a good enough job with these characters. The ending song is fun, and the opening is incredibly catchy. Despite all this praise, the sound is still a 4 for me. Why? Because literally everything else about the OST is so completely basic. Almost every scene that isn't a punchline has the same dumb track that's like nothing but a flute repetitively playing the same 5 or so notes. It's so completely uninspired, and they use it so much, except for those jump cuts I said earlier. Those suddenly have this crazy, and loud electric guitar that, like the crazy jump cut graphics, seem to be there to try and emphasize the punchlines way too much, but end up being way too distracting. This along with the stillness of these punchlines make them feel like they belong in some completely unknown, 7 minute short with a $6 budget that is always at the very bottom of an anime season preview, complete with low resolution images as a poster. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters (6) - they're fine, or fair according to the 6 rating here on MAL. They have their own typical archetypes, but are handled well enough that they don't seem generic. The biggest problem is the fact that these characters are completely tied to the comedy. The show bungles the comedy more often than not, and that adversely affects the characters. The lolicon otaku has jokes involving him being an otaku. When these jokes land then it's pretty easy to forgive how generic that sounds. If these jokes don't, then you just can't let it slide that easily. It's still not horrendous though. There's also a fair bit of subversion as well, which keeps the characters from being generic. The characters are serviceable.  \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (3) - the enjoyment of this anime is based on it's comedy, and this is what hurts me the most. \\n\\n\r\nComedic timing is something this anime bungles terribly. These punchlines are supposed to be funny when they're abrupt and sudden, yet they don't feel sudden or snappy enough to surprise us and catch us off guard, and they linger for too long. It's like a punchline that lasts for 10 seconds, even though you already got the entire gist of the punchline in 5. If the punchlines are clever enough then that amount of timing doesn't matter much, but these punchlines are not clever. \\n\\n\r\nEven just a couple of seconds can ruin a good joke. Imagine if the punchline of a joke is a character being slapped randomly, and with one of those good slaps that just sounds painful. In the right circumstance, the snappiness of the slap as a response can be funny. It won't be as funny if the character gets slapped, but the reaction face of the character being slapped lasts for 3 whole seconds. Doing that kills the abruptness of the punchline, which is something Grand Blue's comedy hinges on.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime is like a server, in charge bringing the food you ordered to you, except instead of bringing it to you, he brings it halfway, and you're expected to get up and go get it. It's not the absolute worst thing you'd have to do, but the fact that you have to meet him halfway already makes him worse than other potential waiters you could have gotten. You could have gone to a restaurant that instead of making you work for that product you ordered, could have just given you what you wanted. That's how I feel about Grand Blue. It's probably not the worst anime out there when it comes to it's comedic timing, but you need to meet it halfway way too much to get any ounce of enjoyment out of it, when you can instead watch other comedy anime that don't have these glaring issues. \\n\\n\r\nKeep it on your plan to watch list, and watch it if you absolutely have no comedy anime to watch, and are desperate for some more. If not, take a pass on this. There are better, more competently directed comedy out there",

Thus I had no previous interactions with this IP.\r\nThroughout the years and actual solid weeks of browsing MAL, I have come to the point where I can generally guess what the highest rated anime and manga are. People similar to me should have at least heard of the manga named Grand Blue.\r\nThe anime hasn't been out long but I wanted to say that I was pleasantly surprised by the certain vibeof the anime. The art and sound could be better, the characters are quite 2 dimensional and I feel as if the story won't really progress much but I don't think the goal of Grand Blue is to tell a revolutionary story. I think the goal of the anime is to deliver a pleasant experience through the scope of an esoteric view. So far the anime has made me laugh and enjoy the experience and every week I end up excited to watch another episode of this joyful anime. Would recommend to people who enjoy more easy to follow anime.",

            "content": "College life is a bit different from high school. For those who don\u2019t know, it\u2019s like venturing into a society where some people live by the rules and others makes them. To me, Grand Blue came as a show that explored a carefree life while mixing in adult humor, diving elements, and drinking shenanigans. It\u2019s one of those shows that is hard to not laugh your ass off once you realized what you\u2019re in for.\r\nBased on the manga written by Kenji Inoue, Grand Blue stands out more as a modern slice of life that adheres to a young adult cultural society. Here, we meet aguy named Iori Kithara who starts his new life as a college student on the Izu Peninsula. His place of residence happens to be a diving shop known as \u201cGrand Blue\u201d and thus where daily life adventure begins. Now, I should say right off the bat that a show like this relies on stereotypical humor with plenty of jokes in between. If you\u2019re not ready for that, just turn back now. \\n\\n\r\nGrand Blue\u2019s storytelling mainly chronicles the daily life adventures of Iori although plenty of other characters are featured aside him. The main cast consists of diving club, also known as the \u201cPeek-a-Boo\u201d. He meets others including his cousin Chisa, Nanaka, Kouhei, Azusa, Toshio, and Kotobuki. Among this group, the male cast seems more like they are in love with drinking more than diving. The first episode immediately sets off the humor with the nakedness and adult jokes from the very start as we meet the core members. That is to say, Iori himself also lacks common sense when he attends his first day at college while being half naked. Judging from just this impression, it should be easy to recognize that the show love to make fun of its characters. It uses stereotypes that makes fun of college life such as young adults drinking and partying. Then, there\u2019s meta-humor that plays on jokes with the nudity. It\u2019s also self-aware being that it never attempts to disguise its humor. Certain characters are very aware of their actions regardless of consequences and this often sets off the wrath of others such as Chisa.\\n\\n\r\nFor the main female cast, it consists of a colorful group with a diverse range of personalities. The most level-headed person in the show is Chisa who takes many things in life seriously. She also loves diving and geniuely enjoys the feelings of being in the azure ocean. She\u2019s like the anti-Peek-a-boo member in the show as she can\u2019t tolerate being embarrassed. Because of this, there\u2019s often a clash between her and Iori as the two gets into compromising positions. The end result is often Iori taking the blow and Chisa face palming herself. However, it\u2019s also noticeable that she does care about Iori especially during brief flashbacks before them. Often times, I guess you could say that she misses her childhood with him and reliving those moments brings a peace in her mind. Then, we have Nanaka who seems to play the role of an older sister type for the main cast although at the same time, she also has an unhealthy infatuation towards Chisa. It\u2019s the type of humor that makes fun of siblings but in a sarcastic way. Azusa is the senior student who behaves much more like the guys in the show. Her bisexuality is hinted at many times and often makes sexual jokes at others, especially Iori. Last but not least is Aina, a freshman who is much shyer compared to the others. She does go by another persona early in the series so watching her sometimes may remind you just how different her two personalities are.\\n\\n\r\nBetween the guys, a main selling point in the show is the character chemistry. Regardless whether you like it or not, there\u2019s an abundance amount of humor when the guys interact with each other and it often comes off as absurd humor. The most prominent is between Iori and Kouhei. They are often observant but says things that may be interpreted in the wrong way. They often get into trouble with the women in the show too given their actions that disregards common sense. The two also gets into many bickering moments. Early in the series, the series also makes fun of the guys with porn jokes. And let\u2019s not forget about the drinking. Pretty every male character in the series loves to drink whether it\u2019s alcohol, beer, vodka, wine, or whiskey. As you may expect from action that results in consequences, the guys behave like drunks while stripping naked and causing questionable scenes. The series pokes fun at this type of adult humor by covering their private body parts with black censored circles. It\u2019s the type of self-aware humor that you\u2019ll witness quite often.\\n\\n\r\nSo now what? Is this series just a giant ball of meaningless humor? Or is it something more deceptive that people misunderstands? To me, Grand Blue stands out as a show that deals with adult gimmicks and stereotypes but makes it into a humorous flick. It seems like a popcorn entertainment and you\u2019re not wrong if it feels like the story went nowhere in the end. However, the shows knows how it operates and inserts every joke with a clear intention. The guys in the series acts bold and behaves in ways that wild college students do. The girls are slightly mild but it doesn\u2019t detract them from getting into the party on occasions. There\u2019s a lot of running gags with the drinking jokes, nakedness, and misunderstandings. It\u2019s what the series uses to sell its humor. If you\u2019re in it for actual diving, there are some moments too with info dumps. Don\u2019t expect this like a relaxing slice of life as it\u2019s far too hyperactive to be considered as such though. Watch this for the pure entertainment and forget common logic. That way, you\u2019ll grow to love Grand Blue.\\n\\n\r\nZero-G has honestly been an unimpressive studio. Their lineup consists of shows that I hardly see anyone talks about these days (Battery, Dorei-kun the Animation, Dive!!). Their production quality is hardly stellar either. Thankfully, they managed to step up to the plate and capture the magic for this show. It deserved a glorious quality and got treated such way with the beach setting, aquatic ocean, and sunny atmosphere. Character designs also feels real with the cast looking like they are college students (although Aina sometimes makes me question this) Fan service is literally in every episode but they take the extreme during party scenes and drinking segments. Finally, I love the way characters reacts that pushes the envelope to the extreme. Iori and Kouhei are prime examples of this while others such as Chisa and Nanaka also have their own moments. Expressions of shock, anger, and confusion is shown right to your face in ridiculous ways. Thanks to the talented voice cast, it brings the best out of those moments. The OP song also adapts a playful feel to showcase the themes of the show. The ED theme song makes fun of pop culture such as karaoke that\u2019s so fun to sing along with.\\n\\n\r\nAs a fan of the manga, I think Grand Blue established itself as a self-aware humorous showstopper. Taking the risk of glorifying its humor made this show look like a joke at first glance. However, once you get sucked into Grand Blue\u2019s themes, you\u2019ll find love with this show. From the adult humor to the numerous character gags, it\u2019s an anime that plays with itself. It\u2019s a Summer sensation.",

            "content": "Every season of anime always has that one show. You know the one. From the start it receives constant praise and love by the masses, unrelenting in their desire to make their short-lived adoration known to any that will hear. For weeks it leads the figurative hype-train that has every seasonal watcher on board in anticipation to see where it ends up. The show you stay up late at night each week just to catch the latest episode on Kis-Crunchyroll.com. While every other show with potential may and probably will squander around the half-way point, this show \u2013 THIS SHOW \u2013 is the only oneto matter, for it holds the embodiment of why weeaboos traded their social life to solely watch Japanese cartoons.\\n\\n\r\nNewsflash: This ain\u2019t it chief.\\n\\n\r\nTo be honest, this season as a whole has been remarkably unremarkable given the obvious trends that take place in the anime community. Although it may not be so surprising given that the season prior was coined by many as \u2018The Greatest Season of Anime\u2019, even the most popular shows airing currently have made little more than a murmur throughout their runtime. Attack on Titan, Overlord, the \u201cfinal\u201d season of Gintama, all well-known series that have all fallen silent amongst the public. But when it comes to new series airing, Grand Blue had to have been a main attraction; based on one of the most popular manga serialized today that features Shinji Takamatsu as director \u2013 the same director for successful comedies School Rumble and Daily Lives of High School Boys. Yet\u2026 something\u2019s seriously off about this show, and since it seems to have slapped the tactfulness out of me, I\u2019m just gonna go ahead and say it: This show fucking blows. \\n\\n\r\nI was planning to say something along the lines of \u201cLet\u2019s dive into this\u201d, but whilst being the most clich\u00e9 cringe-inducing pun I could have possibly made, there\u2019s not very much at all to \u201cdive\u201d into here. Grand Blue follows 20-year-old Iori Kitahara who has moved to his uncle\u2019s seaside town for college, where he is almost immediately roped into joining a male-dominated diving club. But if you thought this show was about diving, it\u2019s a trap! Instead the club activities more or less revolve around drinking, stripping and getting hammered. Essentially, it is a comedy anime focused on the college life so a basic plot such as this is harmless so long as the comedy hits its mark. However, that simply is not the case. Instead Grand Blue comes off as an American frat house flick turned into a gag anime, except with nearly all the effort sucked out. \\n\\n\r\nNow I understand that comedy in general is heavily subjective so what personally may not land well with me could very well come off as a massive hit to someone else. Nevertheless, I have so many issues with how the show handles humour. One of the first instances of this come from the running joke where every other character tries tricking Iori into getting drunk. Conceptually, this does not strike me as humorous, but the ridiculous ways this is tried alongside dysmorphic character faces utilized certainly add to the punchline and made me laugh the first few times. But a cardinal problem with Grand Blue is that a joke which becomes par runs the risk of growing dull, and while using different scenarios can keep things fresh, Grand Blue instead decides to drive them into the ground as fast as possible. Sure, the joke earned a few chuckles the first couple times, but then they use it once more, and again, and again\u2026 and again. Numerous times the overabundance of these quips was akin to beating a dead horse, and if at that point it does not feel overdone then I just do not know what to say. Clearly Grand Blue is a comedy show that lends itself to multiple running gags throughout the 12 episodes, but the way they are used is what inevitably ceases the series to deliver the same results each time on viewers like myself. \\n\\n\r\nAnother issue with the comedy presented here more often than not is the timing. Timing is obviously a key factor for basically any form of comedy, especially with the kind of jokes Grand Blue exploits that rely heavily on the punchline. Yet here poor timing is so apparent that it comes off almost amateurish by the staff. Maybe this is a limitation when adapting the source material. I have not read the manga, but due to anime being\u2026 animated, it limits the way one can interpret a scene compared to a series of still pictures; the anime ends up much more restricting on the imagination. The punchlines themselves are also somewhat confusing at first if you had high expectations of Grand Blue without having read the manga. The series seems to treat comedy at a fairly lowbrow level where majority of the time punchlines were aimed between the more innocent characters being coerced or embarrassed by other club members. Sure, lowbrow humour can be funny and even I find it hilarious sometimes, but considering this is also a light-hearted comedy, makes Grand Blue\u2019s task of making someone like myself laugh incredulously difficult. What also works in their disfavour are the more heartfelt moments mainly centred around Iori gaining appreciation for diving as a whole. These moments COULD have been useful as far as getting better invested in his character, except there is one serious problem: he has no character. You should not expect much in the way of development or characterization presented as there are only a handful of character worth remembering just to remember the plot meanwhile everyone else, despite their own \u201cplot\u201d are flat as a pancake. Again, due to Grand Blue being primarily comedy, there is barely any expectations as far as the narrative or characters go, yet the show continues to spread itself thin that I, as a viewer, am left with barely anything to truly grasp onto. Maybe I\u2019m just an old fag.\\n\\n\r\nPerhaps the key problem I have with Grand Blue is not with the comedy or even the characters, but the subject matter. There has been an increasing amount of anime set in higher education as of late, each with their own take on a core aspect of college life. But before Grand Blue I had never been exposed to one that focuses primarily on the parts where the main characters get blasted off one\u2019s face, and after watching this, it really does makes sense why. As a student myself I can tell you with assurance that there is not much fun getting shit-faced and even then, it does not last long. To those reading this that have experienced a hangover probably understand this most and, perhaps more importantly, the after-effects. Headaches, drowsiness, poor concentration and nausea are just a mere few of the symptoms that coincidentally are also felt when watching these moments every week. One of the most common appraisals about Grand Blue is how relatable the show is. I\u2019m sorry but the main aspects that are relatable to real life here are not things that I would be celebrating as much and like those who have had poor hangovers, is something I would rather forget about. Although when it comes to alcohol in Grand Blue, there is nothing more depressing than seeing each episode open with a disclaimer about legal alcohol usage. Now, they were probably necessary to even have the series airing in the first place but way to present the exact opposite of comedy at the beginning of each episode. Of course nothing is mentioned about the nudity seemingly ever-present here; I see Japan has their priorities straight here.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of; yes, I am a straight cis-male. I\u2019m not ashamed. I have no interest in the male nudity displayed in Grand Blue, but holy hell do they have the least creative way of censoring dicks. As aforementioned I have not read the manga, so I do not know how scenes were drawn but it is such a lazy way of going about it, though it does match the effort that arguably went to the overall visuals of Grand Blue. It looks absolutely lacklustre. Below average animation for practically every scene. Poor designs, even for the male supporting cast (no homo). This is not a series to watch for its technical appeal, because there practically is none. However, I find this fact to somehow work in its favour as far as the entertainment goes. Seeing comedic scenes with laughable animation effects certainly has a charm to it; perhaps a \u201cso bad it\u2019s good\u201d quality, but not enough to warrant slogging through it all. Even fanservice for the male demographic was at a minimum. As far as the sound, both the soundtrack and voice acting are very forgettable. The opening and endings, whilst memorable, I personally found cringeworthy. Never will I not skip either if they ever happen to come up on a playlist. Just listen to these lyrics:\\n\\n\r\n\u266b\u266b Be passionate my friend\\n\r\nShine bright with the sun\\n\r\nDive into the blue sky\\n\r\nAnd let summer take it all \u266b\u266b\\n\\n\r\nAnd that is all there is to say about Grand Blue. It\u2019s clear that not many people will agree with my statements as it appears to be a strong fan-favourite of whatever is left of the community still interested in seasonal anime. If you like it then I\u2019m glad you enjoyed it, but there\u2019s probably better comedies this season. Watch them; I thought this sucked. Grand Blue was the equivalent of a grand disaster in my eyes and stands a reminder that \u201cin every age, in every place, the taste of weeaboos remain the same.\u201d I guess I\u2019m just not a fan of watching something akin to what the Fairy Tail guild would be like when knocked off their rocker. Anyways thank you to everyone who read my review. Be sure to leave a helpful if you liked-hell even if you disliked I\u2019ll still take a helpful! Leave a comment for what I should review next. 99% unlikely to actually do it but who knows. Au revoir.\\n",

The funny part is that the series itself has practically nothing to do with scuba diving. The only thing that reminds even slightly of anything water-related, it is water boarding, as watching this is pure torture. The series is sobad I am surprised the UN has not banned it citing their human rights policies. \\n\\n\r\nThe \"story\" centers around this nu-youngster party crew where all women are fanservice figures and men even worse. These folks are so bland and boring that they can't have fun without alcohol and being naked, so they drink it and party and act in disgusting ways that mainly look like the combination redneck orgies and hipsters trying out psychedelic drugs.\\n\\n\r\nI am not exaggerating the least. Every episode of this series starts with a banner/disclaimer stating how it does not promote underage drinking even though that's the main content of the entire series. It's beyond me how gore, raping, bullying and other dark and edgy stuff is so appalling to so many anime fans, yet this fking thing is acceptable. Drunken trash is already nauseating to watch, and drunken trash teenagers even more hideous. That's the real fucked up shit right there. The assumably comedic content with its in-your-face fanservice and sexual content is highly similar to Prison School except the irony was removed so everyone is just a slut or manslut. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\\n\r\nOur cast is the worst part of the series. Iori's greatest merit is that he can appear in the series without wearing clothes. Chisa is your generic manhating mess who would be better fitting to Kuzu no Honkai than in any comedy series. Kouhei is the self-insert dude who is an otaku and does otaku stuff because he is otaku. Aina is so great no one even bothered to write her a biography. Azusa is this series progressive lesbian character who would be better off in Western industry and not in any anime. Kotobro is the best character because he doesn't have a personality so hating him is harder. Nanaka brings some more incest vibes because Chisa can't do everything on her own so that's cool. We also have a person named Shinji. If I forgot anyone, you can assume they also suck.\\n\\n\r\nProduction:\\n\\n\r\nThe art and animation go way below average medium quality. Not a single comedic scene stands out. Typical comedy effect are not used in any scenes. The voice acting is monotonous and bland. Nothing is pushed onward or polished. Perfect example of how bad everything in it is, is the very first comedy scene at 3 minutes mark into episode 01. This is your typical \"man walks into a bar\" gag, starting with mc wondering what type of people are behind  the door, opens the door and sees bunch of identical muscular boys playing janken and yelling some inaudible phrases (of course, being naked whilst doing so), followed by him getting on his knees cursing his life. I can think of at least 50 different ways on how this scene would have made me laugh, but I can't think of a single way how it would have left me with emptier expression. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\\n\r\nThere is nothing I can recommend less than Grand Blue. I'd hire a detective to find me where the fun in this series is supposed to be, but I am certain they would return without any leads.",

            "content": "(*Updated*) \r\nGrand Blue is an AMAZING MANGA and I highly recommend you guys to read the manga after you have watched episode 1 of the anime to get the voices in your head. Shifting away from the \"on how to watch\" (which is up to you), the adaptation is so far on point with the manga which makes me very happy! Within 4 episodes in, it looks like the format for each episode is going to cover 2 chapters of manga! This show is basically, If you like comedy such as Gintama, you will definitely love Grand Blue; a show about daily struggles of studentsduring their college life; a setting that is not often explored by anime.\\n\\n\r\nStory[8]; Without spoiling the story, the timeline is quite the same as Gintama's formatting their episodes. Not quite random, but random events that happens in unspecified, yet chronological timeline! That being said, Grand Blue's full of comedy including slapstick humor and exclusive college jokes that only college kids would understand! Perhaps a bit mature, but hell; Watch it! How would you experience anime without watching at least one episode huh? Do not skip on Grand Blue for sure!\\n\\n\r\nArt[8]; I mean with comedy genre of anime, the animation/art is sometimes replaced by how much you laugh, but the art is okay or good enough to an average anime viewer. Unless you are elitist... everyone knows that art does not correlate to quality/enjoyment of the anime such as Ping Pong the animation. The animators are trying their best to adapt art style from manga which it most part it does, yet people just like to nitpick on the smallest pixel. The Animation is NOWHERE NEAR BAD!\\n\\n\r\nSound[10]; Opening is very catchy and it gives out this \"dive vibe\" and the ending song has this \"closure vibe \" that, in my mind, represents the great laughter, joy, and sadness , waiting for the new episode patiently. Voice actors, in this show, must be mentioned because they have to put so much energy for so many scenes that requires: screaming out of lungs, playing serious in a stupid act, and playing the straight man of course. It's not easy to voice act, but they have some very familiar voice actors that fits very well with each character.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter[10]; Well, if you know your comedy with Gintama then you have heard the character type, the \"straight man\". Grand Blue basically formulates around a straight man with bunch of casts who are out of his/her \"norms\" that creates a ripple of unexpected events which are mainly comedic and i love it! And when you do such format you have to have some really original/funny/unique characters and ohh boy do they have it. Of course all of these characters are above the legal ages and attending college which makes these character more relatable to young adults such as me. You have the vast cast ranging from an Handsome stereotype who is an otaku, muscular alcoholics, the newcomer stereotypical MC that has high hopes on his new college life that ends up with the muscular alcoholics and starting to migrate to their new culture, and the cousin who hates the MC for being a dumbass for migrating to alcoholism, yet this is the few introducing characters in the anime; there will be much more awesome characters incoming later episodes that gives the show more color. The Characters interactions are the main seller of this show. Don't let other people tell you how the characters act in this show as dumb or stupid because, in my case, college students really do act similarly like the casts in Grand Blue! \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment[10]; This show is not for the weak or who do not get the college life... So it's not for everyone as the anime and manga's target audience are young adults or people who have experienced college. Of course outliers can enjoy this slapstick humor too. To give an example on how the anime represents the college life; a reference of different types of characters during an exam that have not studied for, showing their struggles within college classes which perfectly relates to students in real life college who failed or struggled with an exam(s) that professor made it absolutely impossible. There will be much more similar silly events around the theme of college life. All of those silly events are just comedic gold; ironically, very much like college! This show is already my most favorite anime of this year so far and deserve much more love. \\n\\n\r\nOverall[10]; Grand Blue is not for everyone, but it does deliver the college type of feel and I kinda skipped the part about diving in this review. Let's be honest.. this anime might look like about diving, but it's mostly focused on character interactions and how you should view your life as student in college. Animation are very nicely done and can be wonky at times, but that shouldn't really stop you from watching it. This show is a must try for this season! If you are a college student or you just love comedy, this show is for you!\\n\\n\r\nUpdated Opinion; I have been following the community opinion on the Anime adaptation vs the manga and they are some key notes to be considered: Age of characters have been changed for legal purposes, some of the atmosphere is not the same as in manga and some events got changed due to time constraints. With the release of the 4th episode; this episode has been proven me that the anime has done justice on adapting from the manga chapters 7-8! The characters are consistent just as in the manga. Cannot wait for the new episode! People who like to complain and consider themselves as \"Maestro Of Art Critique\", they are definitely watching the wrong anime because like I said; Grand Blue is not for the weak!",

            "content": "\"In Japan, the color blue signifies youth, a time of excitement and infinite possibilities\"\r\nHello everyone , this is my review of funniest show of this season and one of the best gag comedy i had ever seen in anime ..\r\nso Lets begin\r\nIntro:\r\nImagine what you expect when you going to college, we develop a lot of preconceptions about what it would be like i mean New places, new friends, maybe a new girlfriend. Go to some parties, maybe find somewhere I felt like I could really fit in and all that wonderful dreamy thought. Well our main protagonist Imagination is no different than an average studentwho just entering the college.\\n\\n\r\nAfter graduating high school, Iori moves to Izu, on the coast, to go to college for mechanical engineering. \u201cI\u2019ll put all my effort into having the best college life possible!\u201d he vows. \u201cI\u2019m going to meet cute girls, fall in love, and enjoy the pinnacle of youth with good friends!\u201d\\n\\n\r\nHe moves in with his uncle and, more importantly, his two beautiful cousins: motherly, long-haired Nanaka and tomboyish, short-haired Chisa. All of them work at the uncle\u2019s dive shop, the Grand Blue; unfortunately, so do Tokita and Kotobuki, macho dive bums who pressure Iori into joining the diving club even though he can\u2019t swim. Alas, Iori soon finds himself roped into their social circle, partying with a bunch of goofy jocks who just want to get naked and play all-male drinking games. Will Iori get to enjoy a cool campus life? Will he find love? Will the diving club ever actually get in the water? \\n\\n\r\nWell thats for the introduction part which sounds like an average college based anime \\n\r\nor IS IT!, so let examine in our further review.\\n\\n\r\nStory: (7/10)\\n\\n\r\nMost of the time we see gag anime fail to deliver a proper story line and mostly involved in delivering some random funny events and scenes.\\n\r\nWell Grand Blue is kind of done a decent job in constructing a story line. Sure we can say that its not a story based anime .However, Grand Blue does deserve credit in the sense that it doesn't completely devolve into comedy, as most events take place in a ocean setting, staying true to the foundation that it lay down. The Episodes are also loosely tied together, meaning that there is some degree of continuation. But in all we can say that its main purpose is to make audience laugh.\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt, Animation and sound:(9/10)\\n\\n\r\nArt is beautiful considering how they have utilize the beauty of locations including underwater and seasore and present it in a beautiful and artistic way. Animation is great, studio done a decent job in adapting manga considering manga artstyle is already top class we sure expect in the hands of a decent studio anime is pleasant to watch.\\n\r\nThere are some part i like to focus on which Grand Blue done a tremendous job that is adapting face expression with the scenes. Grand Blue Dreaming is a stunning treasure trove of reaction faces. With influences from hot-blooded fighting anime, horror movie framing, and direct references to other franchises, like this Great Teacher Onizuka and that Evil sarcastic Face which taken from Attack on Titans.\\n\r\nOP and ending is pleasant and beautiful as well as some underwater scenes are eyecatching.\\n\\n\r\nIt also done a great job in sound department including beautiful opening and ending sound. There are no characters who unnecessarily shouting everywhere and trying to make audience laugh .Voice actors done excellent job in providing tone which goes exceptionally well with the scene \\n\\n\r\nCharacters:(9/10)\\n\r\nCharacters are unique and excellent and each have there own funnier side perfectly well fitted for such gags Anime.\\n\r\nWe can see from absolute scumbags to a hot and weird otaku , from a shy tomboyish waifu material girl who has its own sadist side to a lewd Onee san including Airheads and some trouble some senpais.\\n\r\nGrand Blue has all to offer what is necessary for a gag anime, characters range from lovable bastards like club senpai Tokki and Bukki to absolute scumbags, with Iori somewhere in the middle. He has a veneer of respectability that gets shattered the moment he takes a sip of beer. Also our fellow dorks like good-looking but skeevy anime fan Kohei (\u201cWhy isn\u2019t there a club full of beautiful high school girls to be my harem?\u201d)\\n\r\nThe female character are more kind of average than you might expect from this particular strain of comedy, with the exception of Nanaka, who is pretty one note with the unpredictable and Lewd Azusa. Chisa and Aina for me is kind of okay serving as a balance in between all these crazy characters.\\n\\n\r\nSo Whats Lacking:\\n\r\nWell if you see the Manga, its clearly one of the best comedy manga ever made. For anime i feel it kind of fail to adapt the proper pacing of the Anime and how to give Focus on some particular scene. We can see same kind of thing with some famous anime like Food Wars (after 1st season) and Tokyo Ghoul. On some scenes and some part of the story it feel bit rushed which makes viewers who already familiar with manga kind of disappointed. Other than that i dont find anything which are lacklustre in the Anime.\\n\\n\r\nThe Bad:\\n\r\nThe other element that might not work for everyone is all the nudity and fanservice. The most explicit nudity actually comes from the boys in the club, who tend to strip when they get drunk.\\n\r\nThe women, however, in their skintight wetsuits, bikinis, or the occasional glimpse of underwear, are clearly supposed to be titillating.\\n\r\nWell i can say that its not for everyone who dont feel comfortable in such thing like nudity and drinkin\\n\\n\\n\r\nConclusion:\\n\\n\r\nGrand Blue is fundamentally a frat house farce in the vein of something like American Pie or The Hangover in anime version. Its comedy definitely has lot of consistency when it comes to make people laugh. If you want a show who you can watch with your friends with enjoyment and laugh this show deliver all the things you needed. \\n\r\nFunny events timing is impeccable, making great use of situations, and even manages to make repeating the same punchline funnier the second time.\\n\\n\r\nOverall its pretty good and satisfying show and definitely one of the best gag anime ever made also the funniest one but again you\u2019ll have to really love booze jokes, funny faces, and gags about guys being caught naked with little censorship marks obscuring their junk.\\n",

NAKED MUSCULAR MEN. \r\nIt has a distinct art style that brings out more comedic effect at times, but the art is not anything ground-breaking, kind of normal and standard.\r\nThe music is okay, I actually really like the OP song, gives off modern EDM westerinized vibes. \r\nI love the characters, none of them are very annoying and all have theirown unique and funny quirks. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, I would say that this show is definitly worth a watch if you want something funny to watch this season.

In a full on comedy anime, a plot is probably one of the least important aspects. To me, a comedy anime is all about the enjoyable characters and overall entertainment. And Grand Blue has all of those.\r\nLike most comedy anime, it operates with a very basic story- a college freshman being all excited to have a great college life.\r\nHowever, it doesn't go as planned when he's forced to join a \"diving club\", in which the members drinkand strip more than dive (there still is diving I assure you). Yes, it's pretty ridiculous already, but it gets even better as the show progresses and more characters get introduced. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters are the life of any comedy anime. Without fun, fitting characters, a comedy anime just won't be the same. It doesn't matter to me if they seem slightly generic, as long as they show some personality and entertain.\\n\r\nGrand Blue has a good variety of different personalities which compliment each other perfectly to create hilarious exchanges. Whether it is a dumb, over the top MC, or an otaku \"ikemen\", or awkward virgin friends, or men (and women) who couldn't care less about getting drunk and stripping in public, Grand Blue has a good variety to keep the entertainment going.\\n\\n\r\nThe voice acting is also top notch, and paired with some incredible facial expressions, all the characters are funny in their own right. Honestly, the facial expressions are some of the most hilarious ones I've seen since Prison School. \\n\\n\r\nThere are many comedy anime out there which can have some funny episodes while the rest are a hit-and-miss. Grand Blue, however is very consistent in that regard. Honestly, comedy will always be a subjective genre. Grand Blue might not be for some, but those who enjoy a rather over-the-top comedy anime should definitely give this a shot.\\n",

            "content": "This is one of the most boring and unfunny shows that I've ever seen in my life.  \r\nOur main character moves into his uncle's diving shop, Grand Blue where he met almost all of the cast. I expected to find creative jokes and interesting characters but I was very disappointed. \r\nThe show barely try doing something new and becomes repetitive easily. The predominant jokes are: naked guys drinking, Kouhei and Iori fighting, forced misunderstanding and, to a lesser extent, Iori's friends harassing fellow virgin friends. I don't have any problems with this type of jokes (except the last one) but they are introduced somany times in a short time. Honestly, it's a little annoying. The worst part is that the show almost never try to have a cohesive pacing with the jokes.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters didn't help either. Along with the 95% of the jokes, they are generic and one-dimensional. Most of the girls (Azusa and Nanaka) are just fanservice figures while that the guys only exist for the sake of the naked joke (Shinji and Ryuujirou). The rest of them are more independent of the generic jokes but they're eclipsed by them. Chisa is a generic angry girl/cousin, Kouhei is the self-insert character, Iori changes his personality depending of the joke, and Aina, despite that falls in the category of shy girl, have some personality and she's the only decent character in the entire show. \\n\\n\r\nThe story is quite simple and linear. Is easy to follow.\\n\\n\r\nSurprisingly, Grand Blue has good moments about diving that were well handled by the studio but they barely appear and with the unfunny jokes in the middle is hardly enjoyable. \\n\\n\r\nThe animation is mostly good and the opening is amazing. On the other hand, OST is forgettable.\\n\\n\r\nSome people are saying that the manga is better but, here, I'm just talking about the anime version. I never understood why Grand Blue receives so much admiration. Basically, I was bored to death. If you are looking for a very good comedy, I recommend you to watch Asobi Asobase.\\n",

Repeating the same shit over and over again does not make it more funny.\r\nIt has no story/plot based on the 4 episodes I've seen so far\r\nFemales character wearing bikini is the only good thing about it so far. I hope Chisa get more screen time in future episodes than that idiotic maleMC\\n\\n\r\nOverall, the anime is mediocre at best so far. It is not so bad, but not good either. There is better comedy in this season Hataraku Saibou which is also an educational anime that teach you about cells and biology",

            "content": "\"This is a diving anime... Yes.. Grand Blue is indeed a diving anime only.\" - Typical Grand Blue audience.\r\nWhen you look at the comedy industry of anime, it is always topping-off the reviews, charts and everything. Why? Because either it has a good story with ton of great jokes, or the show is just very riduculous and have great humour. If you notice it, comedic anime are mostly in the school genre (specifically High School) which make sense because teenagers often goof up on school unlike adults who focuses on their life more. Then here we have Grand Blue, that is not a high schoolanime but college instead. Grand Blue is one of many comedy anime out there this Summer 2018 that offers us laughter that can relate to college students out there. And for some reason this anime offers diving (I guess) which I don't see pretty much often on anime (except swimming anime).\\n\\n\r\nStory:\\n\r\nGrand Blue's story is not really chronological and like I said on my other reviews on other comedy anime, it doesn't matter whether it is chronological or not as long as it stays on point to the humor and characters. We have here Kitahara, Iori who will move to his uncle's diving shop as his home in college. Seems normal isn't it? Thats where you are wrong. The diving shop have tons of ridiculous, weird and extreme practices including naked Rock-Paper-Scissors and drinking alcohol while your naked is COMPLETELY normal on this shop (Heck, even the owner which is Iori's uncle likes to get naked and used to it.).Then there's the university where he attends to which have variety of characters ranging from an otaku, crazy upperclassmen, charismatic boys from the tennis club and those typical friends you get who are all virgins. Grand Blue is a show where the MC is not really treated as an MC. Each character have unique comedic traits that can contribute to the story in whole. Whether the character is an otaku or not, they can make the story humorous alot. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nThe characters of Grand Blue is what makes Grand Blue one of the best comedy shows this season. If not maybe the best comedy this year as well. We have the main protagonists Kotegawa Chisa, who is a bit of a tsundere-type of girl and have so much love on diving. There's Kitahara Iori, who is the main attraction of all and probably a failure of a kind of college student. He is those characters that can adapt into any environment whether it is an environment full of titan-like men drinking alcohol or the under the sea environment. There's Imamura Kouhei who is the otaku of the diving club and the \"rival\" of Iori (There rivalry is actually very funny. Not those types of rivalry like Naruto and Sasuke.) and Yoshiwara Aina, who for some reason has the same attitude of Iori when he first entered the shop and she is probably the most normal one out of all the characters. This four for some reason are considered the main characters on MAL but in the anime, the other characters are almost treated as main ones as well. I say this because on every humour, its not only this four characters are contributing to it. The supporting ones holds the joke as well and thats what makes Grand Blue an anime that treats all the characters equally for the comedy and story.\\n\r\nFor example, the two naked titans Kotobuki Ryuujirou and Tokita Shinji are the two characters that have weird but funny sense of ways of drinking alcohol with friends. Hamaoka Azusa, who is the only girl character in the anime that likes getting along with the guys (and Mr. Alcohol) and sometimes she even gets to the enthusiasm of being naked (not completely). Also she loves both yaoi and yuri and this trait makes Iori and Azusa's relation to one another funny as well as Iori have to bear with it since he is not a fan of any of those two. Then, the sister of Chisa which is Kotegawa Nanaka, who have a big secret towards Chisa and possessiveness towards her. Not to mention the other characters like the friends of Iori and Kouhei at the university each gave way for more comedic scenes to the anime. That is why Grand Blue was funny as hell because their traits as well as some misunderstanding towards one another make it even more funny. They are all perfectly synchronize even though they are different characters.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nI can't stress out how the art and visuals of Grand Blue is stunning, funny and amazing at the same time. From the looks of their faces due to some scenes either shockness or anger, to the normal visual scenes and the underwater sea, Grand Blue tells you that this is not just a comedy show full of great humourous scenes but it also have eye-appealing scenes as well visuals of the characters and environment.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nIf you take a look of the openings of the anime that aired this Summer season, Grand Blue is the only comedy show plus not a sports anime that has such a good opening that reflects on summer (correct me if Im wrong here.) this season and seeing the opening with all the diving and the hidden wonders of the sea is just so pleasant and beautiful. Plus it is actually a click bait of an opening as the opening just reflected the diving parts of the anime but not the humors and drinking of it. The ending of the anime however reflects how absurd, weird and funny the anime is (opposite to the ending) where we saw Iori seeing into some Karaoke and after he finished the song the other 3 males and him gets naked. Pretty absurd right? I have no problems of the background music or anything that is related to the sound system throughout the episodes as well.\\n\\n\r\nOverall thoughts and Enjoyment:\\n\r\nAs you can see with my rating of this show, I totally enjoyed it. It is one of those anime this season that when you have a bad day or in a bad mood, just watch this show and you will be dying of laughter and releases your stress of anything. That's what makes comedy shows great in the anime industry and Grand Blue is one of it.\\n",

It is a show with a really awesome cast that all interact in different and funny ways with each other, making for some seriously hilarious jokes throughout the show. Seriously, I've almost died of laughter from this show many times. \r\nWhile Grand Blue is a comedy, its storytelling is also decent, as we learn how seriousdiving actually is from the supporting cast, and the beauty it can entail as well. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, Grand Blue is just a stellar anime and a perfect cleansing anime after a long day's work.",

            "content": "A phrase you hear a lot when it comes to comedies is \u201ccomedy is subjective\u201d and yes that is true but to some degree, but like any other art form in the whole world there is a way to do it well and a way to do it not so well. A good comedy will tend to use escalation gradually building up the events of the show while keeping a steady stream of the funnies and this is the one anime this year that does it the best. It manages to stay consistently funny but unlike other anime, its characters never stop the flow ofthe show to tell jokes. Grand Blue is the quintessential millennial anime\u2014which makes it a lot more relatable, especially if you have experienced the \u2018campus life\u2019 at college which heavily involves around parties, alcohol and living life to the fullest\u2014it can genuinely speak to anyone in its target demographic. Grand Blue is an animal house fraternity-style hijinks that draws the same vibes to the likes of the movie Superbad with recurring elements like running gags and character quirks.\\n\\n\r\nBased on Kenji Inoue and Kimitake Yoshioka's excellent on-going Manga, Grand Blue acts as a testament to anime's comedic potential because they are freed from the restrictions imposed by live-action series, anime has all the necessary tools in its medium to deliver some extraordinary reactions. After graduating high school, our main protagonist Iori Kitahara moves to Izu and enrols at the university there. He vows to put all his effort into having the best college life possible and wants to meet pretty girls, experience love, and making great memories with good friends! He moves in with his uncle and two cousins in Nanaka Kotegawa, and Chisa Kotegawa who are both pretty and Iori weirdly finds them attractive. Iori spends the vast majority of his time trying to convince them that he is not actually a pervert but most of Iori's pleas fall on deaf ears, the majority of the humour arises from Iori's earnest but misguided attempts to impress his cousins. He and his cousins work at the uncle\u2019s dive shop named \u2018Grand Blue.\u2019 But Iori is in for a rude awakening, Shinji Tokita and Ryuujirou Kotobuki, your classic meathead jocks pressure Iori into joining the diving club despite the fact that he cannot swim to save himself. He finds himself stuck in the middle of Tokita and Ryuujirou\u2019s circle of friends where partying, drinking-games and drunken-antics take centre stage. \\n\\n\r\nMisunderstandings are the name of the game, but Grand Blue consistently brings the house down with hilarious moments of slapstick and impeccable timing. For those who love Grand Blue's irreverent sense of humour, you can make the comparisons to series like Great Teacher Onizuka and Gintama in a way that they\u2019re truly experts at shocking viewers with a gut-busting reaction shot. The way Zero-G adapted the comedic scenes was masterful, especially the variety of references used for reaction faces and attire. You can see Great Teacher Onizuka and Attack on Titan-like facial expressions or the scene where Nanaka and Chisa are wearing suits from Neon Genesis Evangelion which adds a bit more punch to the gags. When a director such as Shinji Takamatsu on board who is widely praised for his work in Gintama, it comes to no surprise on how well its executed. The Opening and Ending are good but especially the latter, it feels like an extended scene to the episode, its just karaoke fun. Voice acting team did an exceptional job on the way the comedy was delivered and executed perfectly.\\n\\n\r\nLater in the series, it sinks in that Grand Blue is more or less satirizing the ambitious dreams alluded to in the title. Eventually, Lori learns the basic skills to diving, suggesting that the show leads directly to a more serious hobbyist direction. To get to that part you\u2019ll have to really enjoy lots of partying, plenty of booze jokes, funny expressions, and censorship marks covering the private parts of those caught butt-naked. Grand Blue is hilariously raunchy and ridiculously quotable. It's also a frighteningly realistic view of what 18-year-old high-school graduates are obsessed with\u2014sex, booze, parties and best friends. It offers many adult-themed jokes and has characters not only act like college students but talk, in the same manner, most of the dialogue is swear-laden-like. Its self-referential with its humour and does a great job of not making that aspect run its course, keeping the recurring elements fresh. So many humorous segments that have you laughing like you have a front-row seat to your favourite stand-up comedian.\\n\\n\r\nAs stated earlier, this show has a specific target demographic and there might be things that are not everyone\u2019s cup of tea like the explicit nudity and heavy fan service. There\u2019s also an incestuous thread from start to finish. Iori is attracted to his cousins but mainly Chisa, who\u2019s set up as his main love interest while her sibling Nanaka has a major sister complex. Although they go nowhere romantically the show is so saturated with incest jokes that you never take it seriously anyway. Grand Blue is rude, crude and partially nude, and one of the best comedies to come out in a long time. It's nostalgic in a way that takes you back to your more youthful days at the college campus and getting up the similar things portrayed in the show. Now we wait in anticipation for an announcement to experience yet another embarrassing dive into the campus life of Iori and his \u201cPeek-a-boo\u201d club members.\\n",

            "content": "Coming from the amazing manga that made me laugh a lot, this anime doesn't reach its full potential. \r\nThis season wasn't going to be my favorite and was hoping that Grand Blue could save it all. However, when saw that the studio was Zero-G, I feared it to be a mediocre adaptation. \r\nThis studio has only created several shows and it still has yet to create a good one. Grand Blue could have been the adaptation that they were looking for, but they messed up pretty bad. \r\nStarting with the low budget art and animation, the first episode was a letdown. In comedy, animation canbe used to emphasize hysterical moments like in Nichijou. Lacking movement would create still frames and make the scene less attractive. Separate from the comedy, Grand Blue is about diving. It has the potential to create astounding scenes of the ocean, the marine life or the island, yet it did not surprise us with any beautiful scenery. Even at the moments where the character was in awe of the ocean, the art looked plain and didn't differentiate from its norm. \\n\\n\r\nTo add on, I especially do not like the white cloud effects that low-budget anime's use to reduce the amount of background shown for each shot. They could have used filtered-out photos and it would have looked better because of its detail.\\n\\n\r\nStory-wise, it follows the manga well but I've noticed that Chisa, the main heroine, has a slightly different personality from the manga. The anime makes her seem interested in Iori, instead of being indifferent to everything but diving. Anyone else noticed this?\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nHowever, the original work still stands strong and people watching this anime can expect a good laugh. If anyone becomes a fan of this series, check out the manga as well. You'll fall off your chair, laughing to tears. \\n",

            "content": "*spoiler free* \r\nI'm going to be completely honest-- there are far more reasons to dislike this show than to like it, in all honesty. But regardless, I find myself enjoying it much more than I honestly should.\r\nWhy?\r\nWell, it's just got this strange addictive quality that keeps me coming back to it. \r\nTo begin with, the story is pretty simple-- it's a comedic take on a college student and his party lifestyle. That's all there is to it. It's not special or even all that realistic, but it's somewhat more fresh and interested compared to the same old school anime we frequently get in this kindagenre. For that reason alone, it makes some of the 'problematic' stuff tolerable. There's the usual tsundere stuff and the romantic feelings that make no sense and the perverted crap and etc., etc., but it's just so lovable that it makes it hard to hate. \\n\\n\r\nFrom what I've seen so far, the art is breathtaking. All the characters and backgrounds are gorgeous, and the water is animated really, really well. It's just beautiful, enough said. \\n\\n\r\nThe opening is hard to skip, and this is coming from someone who usually watches an anime opening once or twice maximum-- usually the first episode and the last episode-- I rarely ever watch them otherwise. But the music is so much fun that I listen to it every time! The background music adds to the comedy and the closing is also pretty funny and makes me want to stay and finish it instead of moving on to something else as soon as the actual episode ends. \\n\\n\r\nIn my opinion, the characters aren't exactly phenomenal. The main character is the classic comedic mc... he's got nothing inherently special about him and is honestly flawed, perverted, has bad judgement, and does very, very stupid things most of the time-- but he's secretly got a hidden nice guy side that makes pretty much every chick fall in love with him. There's the classic tsundere, the classic hot girl, etc. etc. They're all very predictable but still entertaining enough to keep watching. Personally, I don't mind the harem style romances too much-- they can be pretty fun, especially since they have a lot less of the sexual assault situations that usually make up reverse harems. \\n\\n\r\nI honestly can't believe that I'm doing this, but I'm giving this anime an 8 as of now. My inner voice is outraged, but despite how predictable and problematic this anime is, I can't bring myself to not like it. In fact, I enjoy it all too much. \\n\\n\r\nI would recommend this if you: liked Baka and Test, like harems, like dumb main characters that everyone likes for some strange reason, like cute chicks crowding MCs, like college anime, like drinking/partying lifestyles\\n\\n\r\nI would NOT recommend this if you: like PC anime, want something deep, were expecting something actually about diving, wanted something sports-anime style, wanted some boy/boy tension, don't like harems, don't like tsunderes, don't like the classic dumb panty dropper mc\\n\\n\r\nHave a great day everyone! \\n",

            "content": "I was so excited for this. I read and loved the manga. When I heard about this, I was so incredibly giddy, especially seeing it get a well known director who has worked on Gintama, and that made it clear to me this would be good.\r\n...but it's not. It suffers a lot from a ton of pitfalls many other comedy anime have fallen into.\r\nStory (7) - the story of Grand Blue is incredibly irrelevant to the show. It's like a lot of comedy shows, it's merely there to serve as the basis for jokes. Which is fine, we don't need some epic drama, or someinsanely serious story for a comedy. It's serviceable, non-offending. It does it's job. It can get quite a bit repetitive though, with the joke being basically\\n\\n\r\nIori and Kitahara don't wanna do a thing, usually involving alcohol -> their upperclassmen make them do the thing -> something bad happens due to the thing, usually because they're drunk\\n\\n\r\nNot the worst, but it's enough to not rate the story any higher.\\n\\n\r\nArt (5) - now we're getting to the first reason of why I don't like this anime that much. First part of this, the characters. The anime's character style is fine. Characters look nice, the exaggerated faces that people have aptly named Titan faces is still there, and is very well done. The character art is pretty solid, but my god, the animation. There are so many scenes in the show where it's just a still image, with the characters donning their titan faces, with nothing really happening but them talking, and some crazy graphic going on in the background. It's like the art director thought people wouldn't understand if something was a punchline unless they could make the punchline flashy, with Newgrounds level of animation. It's absolutely, and completely jarring, watching them walking and talking with decent animation, to these sudden jump cuts. \\n\\n\r\nSound (4) - just like art, there are parts of the sound that are well done, but then completely undone by something else. The voice acting in this show is pretty good, the VAs do a good enough job with these characters. The ending song is fun, and the opening is incredibly catchy. Despite all this praise, the sound is still a 4 for me. Why? Because literally everything else about the OST is so completely basic. Almost every scene that isn't a punchline has the same dumb track that's like nothing but a flute repetitively playing the same 5 or so notes. It's so completely uninspired, and they use it so much, except for those jump cuts I said earlier. Those suddenly have this crazy, and loud electric guitar that, like the crazy jump cut graphics, seem to be there to try and emphasize the punchlines way too much, but end up being way too distracting. This along with the stillness of these punchlines make them feel like they belong in some completely unknown, 7 minute short with a $6 budget that is always at the very bottom of an anime season preview, complete with low resolution images as a poster. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters (6) - they're fine, or fair according to the 6 rating here on MAL. They have their own typical archetypes, but are handled well enough that they don't seem generic. The biggest problem is the fact that these characters are completely tied to the comedy. The show bungles the comedy more often than not, and that adversely affects the characters. The lolicon otaku has jokes involving him being an otaku. When these jokes land then it's pretty easy to forgive how generic that sounds. If these jokes don't, then you just can't let it slide that easily. It's still not horrendous though. There's also a fair bit of subversion as well, which keeps the characters from being generic. The characters are serviceable.  \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (3) - the enjoyment of this anime is based on it's comedy, and this is what hurts me the most. \\n\\n\r\nComedic timing is something this anime bungles terribly. These punchlines are supposed to be funny when they're abrupt and sudden, yet they don't feel sudden or snappy enough to surprise us and catch us off guard, and they linger for too long. It's like a punchline that lasts for 10 seconds, even though you already got the entire gist of the punchline in 5. If the punchlines are clever enough then that amount of timing doesn't matter much, but these punchlines are not clever. \\n\\n\r\nEven just a couple of seconds can ruin a good joke. Imagine if the punchline of a joke is a character being slapped randomly, and with one of those good slaps that just sounds painful. In the right circumstance, the snappiness of the slap as a response can be funny. It won't be as funny if the character gets slapped, but the reaction face of the character being slapped lasts for 3 whole seconds. Doing that kills the abruptness of the punchline, which is something Grand Blue's comedy hinges on.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime is like a server, in charge bringing the food you ordered to you, except instead of bringing it to you, he brings it halfway, and you're expected to get up and go get it. It's not the absolute worst thing you'd have to do, but the fact that you have to meet him halfway already makes him worse than other potential waiters you could have gotten. You could have gone to a restaurant that instead of making you work for that product you ordered, could have just given you what you wanted. That's how I feel about Grand Blue. It's probably not the worst anime out there when it comes to it's comedic timing, but you need to meet it halfway way too much to get any ounce of enjoyment out of it, when you can instead watch other comedy anime that don't have these glaring issues. \\n\\n\r\nKeep it on your plan to watch list, and watch it if you absolutely have no comedy anime to watch, and are desperate for some more. If not, take a pass on this. There are better, more competently directed comedy out there",

Thus I had no previous interactions with this IP.\r\nThroughout the years and actual solid weeks of browsing MAL, I have come to the point where I can generally guess what the highest rated anime and manga are. People similar to me should have at least heard of the manga named Grand Blue.\r\nThe anime hasn't been out long but I wanted to say that I was pleasantly surprised by the certain vibeof the anime. The art and sound could be better, the characters are quite 2 dimensional and I feel as if the story won't really progress much but I don't think the goal of Grand Blue is to tell a revolutionary story. I think the goal of the anime is to deliver a pleasant experience through the scope of an esoteric view. So far the anime has made me laugh and enjoy the experience and every week I end up excited to watch another episode of this joyful anime. Would recommend to people who enjoy more easy to follow anime.",

            "content": "Grand Blue\u00a0is a Zero-G comedic anime from last year. I can't speak to the quality of their work in general since I only found thirteen titles listed for them and haven't seen any of them. It's based off of a manga by Inoue Kenji. Well, I like a lot of slice of life comedies so this may be relevant to my interests. Let's take a look.\u00a0\r\nStory:\r\nOur protagonist is Kitahara Iori. A young man who moves into his Uncle's place while attending college. Once there, he's immediately marked by the diving club, which is made up largely of drunken morons who can't keep their clothes on.They coerce him into joining, sensing a kindred spirit. The series basically covers Iori's exploits and club activities.\u00a0\\n\\n\r\nLet's start with the massive, gaping issue with the series. It isn't funny. For the vast majority of it, we just watch these drunken idiots act like drunken idiots. It's like watching that group you always avoided at University very closely and that's just annoying. There's a reason you avoid the intellectual shrimps who just want to party in a loud, obnoxious fashion. Another thing the series seems to find absolutely hilarious is giving the characters stupid looking, exaggerated features. Which kind of contributes to the generally annoying atmosphere. Then we have the humour that centers around Nanaka wanting to sex up her sister. It's like the worst part of Yuru Yuri, except the rest of the humour is on par with it.\u00a0\\n\\n\r\nActually, any time this series touches on the idea of romance it's horrible in some way. Whether it's Iori getting caught being pervy towards one of his cousins, the aforementioned sister complex, the group of incels or the bisexual fan-service girl.\u00a0\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\\n\r\nAnother big problem with the series as a whole is that the characters are all horrible. You pretty much hate 95% of them within minutes of them showing up and they don't even have the defence of being well written characters. They're very shallow. Unfortunately, they're shallow in a way that makes them incredibly unbearable.\u00a0\\n\\n\r\nNow, I'm not saying you need characters who are amicable for a comedy to work. The BBC's\u00a0Black Adder serves as proof positive that you can have characters who are terrible people in a comedy and make it work really well. But that series has the benefit of clever writing and the writers made the titular character a charming rogue in every series save one. That factor, coupled with the cunning behind his actions does make him both interesting and funny. This series doesn't have any cleverness or charm to speak of. Which just makes the awful characters a slog to deal with.\u00a0\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\\n\r\nThis is the one element where I can give the series some credit. The underwater scenes where we don't have insipid dialogue, shite facial expressions or any garbage character interactions to deal with can look very nice. If this series were just the seven or eight minutes of underwater scenery, I could enjoy it somewhat.\u00a0\\n\\n\r\nOf course, it does have issues with really stupid looking facial expressions popping up constantly and the characters randomly taking off their clothes because Inoue apparently finds nudity to be the funniest thing of all time.\u00a0\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\\n\r\nWhile Grand Blue does have some talented voice actors, it's also one of those series where they aren't allowed to have good performances. The dialogue is so over-exaggerated and the characters are so devoid of anything resembling complexity that it becomes nearly as annoying to listen to as it is to watch. The music is, at least, only sub-par.\u00a0\\n\\n\r\nHo-yay:\\n\\n\r\nWe have Nanaka with her romantic feelings towards her own sister. We also have Azusa, who is openly bisexual. The series also loves to make jokes in poor taste about people mistaking Iori for having romantic feelings towards his otaku friend.\u00a0\\n\\n\r\nAreas of Improvement:\\n\\n\r\nHaving clever jokes instead of loud, obnoxious unfunny ones.\u00a0\\n\r\nThere is literally no benefit to the nudity, just have your characters keep their clothes on.\u00a0\\n\r\nJust say no to the incest. At best, it's cringey and mildly unpleasant. At worst, it's fecking terrible.\u00a0\\n\\n\r\nFinal Thoughts:\\n\\n\r\nThis is easily among the worst comedies I've ever seen. It tries to force humour out of being loud and obnoxious but, ultimately, all that does is make it loud and obnoxious. You hate the characters pretty much within minutes of them showing up. The actors are wasted since you could just replace their lines with a crying baby and it would only be mildly more annoying. Ultimately, it's just an unpleasant, horribly written and devoid of humour work. I'm giving it a 2/10 and it only gets that high of a score because of the nice underwater scenery. If you really find drunken idiots charming, it may be the series for you. Otherwise, I'd suggest staying away from it.\u00a0",

            "content": "Grand Blue is an anime about nude dudes drinking booze. \r\n.\r\n.\r\n.\r\nOh yeah, and there\u2019s some diving and other stuff too\u2026yep.\r\nSo right after this anime finished airing, I decided to start binge watching it because I had nothing more productive to do with my life, and I fully expected to get bored and move on to something else after a few episodes. But I didn\u2019t. I just couldn\u2019t stop watching it. And a few hours later, I found myself having completed the anime with a big, stupid grin plastered across my face. And there\u2019s one major reason for this.\r\nGrand Blue made me laugh my ass off.It\u2019s as simple as that. Now let\u2019s DIVE into why (Don\u2019t worry, there are more cringy diving related puns to come).\\n\\n\r\nOn the SURFACE, this doesn\u2019t even look like an anime that I would enjoy at all. I only started watching it because of the high score the manga has. I personally find watching animated shows about athletic events (like diving) to be boring. I prefer an anime to have a story with creativity and DEPTH that actually goes somewhere. And above all else, I\u2019d like to avoid having a bunch of naked men frolic drunkenly across my screen. Yeah, that\u2019s just not my thing. Grand Blue has all of these undesirable factors, yet I actually ended up not giving a crap, because the show was still able to be incredibly enjoyable and funny even with, and in some ways thanks to, all of these elements. And you know what? I have to give it props for getting me to like it so much.\\n\\n\r\nSo let\u2019s DIVE straight to the point. Every single episode is hilarious. I can\u2019t stress enough how important this is considering how hard it is for me to find comedy anime that have this effect on me. And the best part is that it never gets old. Yes, a lot of the gags, primarily the men getting naked and then getting drunk, are used in every episode, but for me, they retained their charm throughout. And there was always some new comedic element that happened in every episode which kept the comedy fresh and fun. One minute the characters would be playing a hilarious game of tennis, and the next they\u2019d be failing to be bar tenders at a bar where the manager thinks they\u2019re gay. No matter what the situation, I found myself constantly laughing. And despite how basic this sounds, good comedy can really go a long way in making a show good. Especially when it\u2019s, you know, actually supposed to be a comedy anime. Of course, what really kept it all together was the cast.\\n\\n\r\nUnlike the ocean that they dive in, these characters aren\u2019t that DEEP. But it\u2019s been scientifically proven that you don\u2019t actually need a tragic backstory and depression to be a good character. Just check the study done by The Institute of Weebology. It shows some really revealing stuff. Anyway, Iori, the protagonist, is a really fun character. I knew I would like him right away when he first opened the door to the diving shop in the beginning of episode one. He may be an idiot at times, but he\u2019s just, well, funny. Whether he\u2019s getting drunk, getting naked, being a pervert, arguing with Kouhei, or anything else, it was just a joy to watch him. \\n\\n\r\nThe other characters also all add their own charm to the show. Chisa\u2019s somewhat of a tsundere who has trouble expressing her feelings, but is super adorable when she does. Yeah, I can totally understand why Iori\u2019s friends were super jealous over him living with Chisa. Kouhei is an otaku who has some of the most hilarious moments in the anime, and his chemistry with Iori is amazing. Aina actually got a bit of character development, which was honestly refreshing to see. Azusa is a bi girl who likes drinking and doesn\u2019t mind getting undressed in front of dudes. Yeah, she seems like a fun person to be around. Nanaka has a little sister fetish, and the big upperclassmen dudes Shinji and Ryuujirou love to get naked. And what do they all have in common? \\n\\n\r\nA love for beer- er, I mean, a love for diving\u2026because this is a diving anime\u2026Though in all seriousness, when the anime actually does get to diving, it does a great job in describing everything that goes into the activity. \\n\\n\r\nWell, that\u2019s basically it. I know this review didn\u2019t really get into any specifics, but I don\u2019t think a detailed analysis of this anime is really necessary. The DIVING force of this anime truly is it\u2019s masterful usage of comedic elements. Of course, comedy is subjective, and if the comedy of Grand Blue isn\u2019t your style, then you probably won\u2019t like it. But remember, when it comes to me, I didn\u2019t think this anime would be for me at all. \\n\\n\r\nBut it was still able to win me over in the end.",

            "content": "Sometimes there comes a show that so excellently and eloquently subverts the tropes of an entire genre of anime, and does so in a mere 5 episodes. Yes, chaps we're talking about grand blue. The anime centred around a bunch of drunk bozos chronicling their escapades in trying to get into their cousin's trousers. Grand blue is at heart a comedy anime wrapped up in a slice of life setting but it is so much more than that. Grand blue, as I alluded to earlier actively makes fun of the genre it comes from. Poking fun at Otakus, waifus, husbandos and the tiresome theme ofdistasteful incest in anime. Right from the beginning, the show makes it clear to us that the setting is comical, by juxtaposing our protagonist's dreams of women filled college life, with a large man's bare penis. This makes it clear to us, the viewer that this anime is not going to be what we dreamed of, and it is this expression of our own thought process through the characters that make this anime so brilliant. From layering jokes slowly to the sky as the viewer and the main character both begin to piece what is happening before our eyes together, to the silly nonsensical reactions of our dramatic cast of characters, they are made from the ground up to replicate the viewer's internal thoughts as their tropes are shattered before them in a hilarious inferno of comedy. As the show has not yet concluded I cannot fully rate it upon all of its merits so, as the series stands I will give it a placeholder 6/10 as there is no ending and admittedly a lack of structure to the story.",

            "content": "Grand Blue - looking for a sport genre anime, it was no coincidence that I came across this anime that explicitly mentions one of the most beautiful hobbies and sports as part of the story line, namely diving. Since I had not read the manga yet, I did not know what to expect. It is not a good sign if the Kanji are not at the beginning of the review, if you like the anime and hope to find an echo chamber you will be as disappointed, as I am by this anime.\r\nStory: only a tool, no depth, a pretext or an excuse to stringcomedy elements together (3/10)\\n\r\nTo study mechanical engineering at the University of Izu, Kitahara Iori returns to a coastal town in Shizuoka Prefecture after 10 years.  His uncle runs a dive shop where Iori wants to stay. But don't expect a serious show about diving! \\n\\n\r\n*The description of the characters may include spoilers, so first watch the anime.*\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: clich\u00e9d as it couldn't be worse (4/10)\\n\r\nIn fact, it's hard to spoil anything by describing the characters, as they are so stereotypical that you've already seen them in a lot of anime and, unfortunately, even better.\\n\r\nKitahara Iori:\\n\r\nThe protagonist of the series, a newcomer who can not swim and is afraid of water. He is admitted to the diving club \"Peak a Boo\" (PAB) against his will. This could be a great story part as the other members of the club try to eliminate his fear of the sea. In most cases, however, it ends with a pointless comedy of booze party and nudity. A rather unsympathetic and weak MC, shortly before the end of the series, there is something like a character development, but too late to perceive it as an attenuation.\\n\r\nKotegawa, Chisa :\\n\r\nChisa is the same age as Iori and has known him since childhood. She is a down-to-earth and conscientious person, to whom the hobby fits well. The fact that she always looks at Iori with a little contempt when he gets completely drunk again, is a good expression for the fact that diving is a marvelous, but also very dangerous hobby, which can only be enjoy if you can rely on your dive partner. This is indispensable in dangerous situations. Admirable, that she gave him a piece of her mind about it. May the fun society see her as a party pooper with an average appearance, but that makes her the most tangible and realistic of the entire clique.\\n\r\nNanaka Kotegawa:\\n\r\nShe is the older sister of Chisa, a very good diver and chief instructor during the dives. She is a very pretty woman and with a consistently friendly nature, she is a real dream girl. Too bad that she has only eyes for her little sister and so strong that it is a real siscon. This is also used for the comedy, but so exaggerated that it is rather unpleasant.\\n\r\nKouhei Imamura:\\n\r\nHe acts as a rival character to Iori. He looks good, but has the completely unrealistic notions of a hardcore Otaku and that's why, despite his good looks, he can not find a girlfriend among his fellow students. His obsessive devotion to a well-known voice actress changes slightly when he meets Chisa. His fetish is also used several times for comedy but the only remarkable scene is, when the girls are buy diving utilities and try on some special diving suits that look like from the anime Neon Genesis Evangelion (the white = Rei Ayanami; the red = Asuka Langley Soryu). To be honest, I could even understand him. *cheeky grin*\\n\r\nRyuujirou Kotobuki & Shinji Tokita \\n\r\nThey are both final year`s students and members of the PAB. They are the senpai for the newcomers, so for Iori and Kouhei. Unfortunately, the seriousness rarely comes into play, rather the two encourage drinking bouts. The two students are very different in appearance, Tokita is dark-haired and very muscular and Kotobuki is blond, also muscular, but with a different defined muscle structure. But in the way they behave or better, misbehave, they are birds of a feather. In their defense,  it should be added that the little they teach about diving is correct.\\n\r\nAzusa Hamaoka:\\n\r\nShe is also a senior student, but at a women's university. She is also a member of the PAB and is not far behind Shinji and Ryuujirou in terms of drinking. She is very sexy and knows how to use it. On the other hand, she has a lascivious and playful but very feminine style, since she is also honest and direct, she often knocks her interlocutor out of his stride. To top it all off, she is bisexual and finds both Shinji and Nanaka attractive.\\n\\n\r\n*spoiler alert end *\\n\\n\r\nVisuals: medium quality, inspired moments aren`t well presented enough (4/10)\\n\r\nThe art is only slightly above the average and rather of medium quality. The saddest thing is that the actually very beautiful underwater world was presented with only a little more effort. Although these scenes are probably among the best of the anime, this is unfortunately no compliment. The \\n\r\nThe animation is sufficient to convey the emotions and scenes correctly, but it is no more than standard. On the other hand, the comic-art-style, though popular and similarly presented by the manga, is aggressive and perceived quickly as exaggerated in the anime. The first few times it's fun, but the constant repetition throughout the whole anime, in the same aggressive and harsh way, makes it just seem repulsive at the end. Usually this style fits the genre but unfortunately it's over the top here.\\n\\n\r\nSounds: BGM generic, OP nice (5/10)\\n\r\nThe BGM is not bad, the only aspect that shows at least some effort to do something good. I didn't perceive the BGM to be extraordinary, but also not disturbing or inappropriate.\\n\r\nThe 1. OP \"Grand Blue\" by Sh\u014dnan no Kaze is cheerful and has what it takes to be a catchy tune.\\n\r\nThe 1. ED, I don't like the song \"Konpeki no al Fine\" by Izu no Kaze, but both the vocals and the animation make it clear what you can expect in the next episode. If you find the ED funny, you can continue with the next episode.\\n\r\nThe 2. ED, \u201eKonpeki no Al Fine: Mizuki Kaya by Mizuki Nana is the same title as the first ED and was only used for episode 11. As last ED was again, the first OP \"Grand Blue\" by Sh\u014dnan no Kaze \"used.\\n\r\nThe voice actors were not really bad, but not very good either. Nevertheless, I particularly liked the following voices: Tokita, Shinji spoken by Yasumoto, Hiroki; Kotegawa, Chisa spoken by Anzai, Chika as well as Hamaoka, Azusa spoken by Yukinari, Toa. Yukinari-san, in the voice role, has adopted a gentle, feminine note that goes very well with the cheeky, sexy Azusa. \\n\r\nThe sound effects were overall fitting, the dialogue directing had even some very clever ideas that were unfortunately lost in the nonsense comedy.\\n\\n\r\nMeanwhile I have read a few chapters, the manga is more bearable, but not really better. Even if you're not interested in the sport itself and love comedy, I can not recommend this show because it is predictable, rough, loud and aggressively stupid.The comedy is a guilty pleasure that destroys even the few inspired moments of the shows. All in all, unfortunately, I have to say it was not worth it.\\n\\n\\n\r\nThanks for reading.",

            "content": "Let this open the floodgates to more college and drinking oriented anime.\r\nGrand Blue is an adaptation of the critically acclaimed manga of the same name serialized in the good! Afternoon magazine. It tells a tale about a young \"20-year old\" college student looking forward to a fresh start after enduring three years at an all boys high school. Little does he know that everything that can go wrong in his college life, will go wrong.\r\nSince I'm writing this review as a manga enthusiast, the jokes didn't hit me as hard as it could have since I'm technically experiencing them for a second time. But evenso, many of the scenes were still hilarious and wonderfully directed to emphasize the humor captured in the manga. I didn't expect any less from Shinji Takamatsu, an experienced director that has done Danshi Koukousei no Nichijou and Gintama. Many pages that I've re-read over and over again still got me laughing because of how well done the comedy was. I'm sure that, if I didn't read the manga beforehand, I would've rated this show a 10/10 like I did with the manga. \\n\\n\r\nBefore reading Grand Blue, my experiences with anime comedies were mainly derived from romantic comedy shenanigans that heavily abuse the typical anime tropes you pick up quickly when you first get into this medium. Not to say that I don't love this type of humor because I do, but there were very few comedies that I've experienced that tries to deviate from your typical fanservicey romantic comedy type jokes such as Nichijou and Hataraku Maou-sama!\\n\\n\r\nGrand Blue is the type of comedy that takes another step forwards towards expanding the boundaries to what could be considered a successful comedy. It was very risky creating a comedy targeted towards young adult men that was focused towards heavy drinking and positive college experiences, a characteristic that tends to be less popular among the otaku community. But even so, Kenji Inoue decided to say \"Fuck it, I'm going to write a manga that parodies frat culture and I don't care if it's not going to be popular among the magazine's audience\". And boy did that pay off.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, the courage to take these such risks itself isn't what makes comedy good. No, the setting only attracts viewers that don't have previous knowledge of the franchise. The reason why Grand Blue is phenomenal is how easy it is to develop emotional attachments to the characters even though it's not supposed to be taken seriously.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are by far, the best part of Grand Blue. There is not a single character that I don't like in the show. Every character feels like it has a purpose, and nothing feels like it's left out. If comedy could be critiqued with plot holes, then you'll never find a single plot hole in Grand Blue.\\n\\n\r\nThe gags are wonderfully well relatable settings that exaggerate the possibility of things going wrong. Every terrible experience, every hard lesson that you may have learned in college will make you laugh it all off once you view these characters' experiences. Everything in the show goes so wrong that you'll start to understand \"Hey, maybe getting the short end of the stick is what makes so life exciting and the climb more worthwhile\". It's the heartwarming down-to-earth comedy that makes it so relatable.\\n\\n\r\nEvery gag in the story is never wasted. Every misunderstanding in the story always carries over. Characters are all so easily recognizable by their personalities that you know what is going to happen. A lot of people say that if the comedy is predictable, then it's mediocre. But I feel like if the characters are so distinguishable enough that you can predict what will happen based on they previous experiences and personalities, then it becomes the best kind of predictable.\\n\\n\r\nI can understand why not everybody will enjoy the humor in this show, however. Comedy is subjective, and in my experience, comedy isn't funny if I cannot relate to the events and experiences portrayed in the show. If you genuinely don't like it because you detest the vibes that the events give you, then by all means don't continue to watch it. If Grand Blue doesn't capture your heart in the first few episodes, then please just drop it because you won't enjoy the rest of it. You will know if you love this show right from the get-go.\\n\\n\r\nThe only reason why I can't give this show a perfect score is because Zero-G has room for improvement and although it looks solid, I believe Grand Blue is a comedy that deserves production values on the scale that studios like Kyoto Animation have. But for now, I can settle with just having an anime alone as again, Takamastu still did an incredible job with bringing a manga comedy to life.",

            "content": "Sorry Grand Blue, you took 2nd place (behind Asobi Asobase) for comedy this season, but you're still a great show to watch, bar none!\r\nGrand Blue wasn't one of the shows I'm intending to watch from the get-go, but its comedy presents the significant change and pace of time with \"How I Live My College Life\". Add to that the insane number of recommendations that the manga counterpart was more than amazing, I just couldn't resist the anime adaptation by Zero-G, and it definitely doesn't quiver at its shots and the single most-handedly important aspect: To not take itself too seriously. Oh, and the aforementioned warningbefore every episode, because this is a drinking anime too.\\n\\n\r\nThe setting for Grand Blue is pretty much the same format as how Amanchu! has had going for it: the (scuba) diving aspect, with how Gintama has had their comedic episodic formats before. Mesh both series together, and you get the college life humour-esque of a funny bones series. But if you start to think that Grand Blue is all about diving, you're in for a hard-pressed fall, because it ain't so in the first place!\\n\\n\r\nImagine this: You are starting a new life, you want to learn a new passion, but when you get there, everything is nuts and bolts jokerish-status significant of a rowdy circus, you immediately back out! But, something about it grows on you and you start to love it despite the insane gags that are shoved right up your A-hole. Some mature and WTF-moment comedy ensues, and once you know it, you're already in for the ride. How amazing is that!?\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are what gives life to mindless and endless amount of idiosyncrasies of many screws that are funnily screwed loose. The veterans Shinji, Ryuujirou, Azuna and Nanaka, all of them have quite the expertise on scuba diving...and not to mention, their own \"fragrant\" charm, with the men running around and doing things naked (oh God that was so funny) and the sexy charm of the ladies, with their ever so tempting bodies that set the main male MCs (especially Iori) heart ablaze.\\n\\n\r\nAnd in comes the juniors: Iori, Kouhei, Aina and Chisa (reason on that in a while). Iori and Kouhei are truly the definition of yaoi stuff, just due to how much as they care for each other, they BURN and get rekt together (with their friendzoned friends of single-getting-hitched relationships) in the bestest fashion possible, always trying to find a way out when that way didn't promise much for them, but at least you guys tried (I like that!). Aina, or Cakey, as per the incredibly cheap but creepy-as-molasses makeup turn out to be, joins the Grand Blue club to witness her love blossom for Iori, and in the meantime, the seniors and both men spoil her imaginary prowess with tainted oblique circles of their private parts (kinda wished that censorship didn't exist!). Chisa, like veteran, like junior. Her diving skills no one can match, but her heart is like a fleeting moment (always for Iori, and she DID stole his limelight moment). An unfortunate character who has to content with not only being the only girl in the all-guys course (whatever it is), but her tsundere-ness is the weak link as these emotions go unanswered (but we all know HAHA).\\n\\n\r\nFor such an awesome manga adaptation, Zero-G really dinged it hands down while playing its hands cleverly. The only outlier would be the areas that doesn't look or feel polished, such as the diving scenes, but hey, I can live with it as the comedic SoL moments is what really breathes life and the art and animation in all its glory is not outcasted nor disappointing here. The weird moments where guys go naked, to the one-to-one perfection of the face expressions of hurt, S&M aesthetics and the like that always breaks the laughter puns, piece by piece. Especially the close-up scenes of fanservice galore *hehe...*\\n\\n\r\nThe music is IMO what represents the series well, going into it for the very first time didn't feel like a chore in comparison as opposed to just subverting the show from the get go. The OP which coincidentally share the same name as said title, was great to the point where the introduction felt very welcoming and representing the summer season (hey, it's Summer too!). If you thought that you were done from the comedic moments in the episodes, the ED pulls out a hearthstone as an object of affinity and insanity. Overall, a great choice of music that's pure enjoyment.\\n\\n\r\nIt's hard to believe that Grand Blue was lead by one person alone: well-famed director Shinji Takamatsu, who is the creator of awesome comedy series such as the No. 1 comedy fan-favourite Gintama and one of my favourite school rom-coms, School Rumble. Personally, he lead as overall director, sound director and scriptwriter, and his talents are truly unmatched. Yes, the manga by Kenji Inoue (Baka to Test) is splendid, but Takamatsu's Gintama magic hand just adds onto the overall well-positive experience.\\n\\n\r\nOut of all the comedy we could have this season (Chio-chan, Asobi Asobase and this series), Grand Blue will be the one that most can recognize and relate to, due to the realism that you're basically living what is known as the best moment of your life: College. Where you can do stuff that not even your parents can oppose you to doing, so as long as it's beneficial to your \"healthy and fun\" being. Overall I can recommend Grand Blue to everyone despite the demographic difference, because it either brings you back or forward (from where you are now) to how your college life is or will be: Purely all for fun.",

            "content": "Going to be honest... this show is my largest disappointment of the Summer 2018 season. Not because it's awful, but because the manga was so much better. This anime is fun, lively, and looks reasonably pretty, but unfortunately, it does something completely inferior to the source material, the timing of it's jokes.\r\nThe structure of a manga just lends itself better to the style of comedy than the anime. The pacing is just better and allows for the jokes to land more quickly and not painfully drag out. While this anime keeps the same jokes with relatively one-to-one recreations, this direct adaption approach didn't keep manyof them well structured. A lot of them still work, just not as well.\\n\\n\r\nAlong with this, the art may look reasonably good, however, the roughness and the nature of panels support the incredible expressions so much better. Many of the expressions are still good, but they lack the sharpness and extreme levels of the original.\\n\\n\r\nAll out, what makes Grand Blue a disappointment in my eyes, is the fact that it doesn't hold up to the source material. My philosophy is that if a piece of media isn't improved through adaption, it shouldn't be adapted at all.",

            "content": "Grand Blue: the Strip Rock-Paper-Scissors and Alcoholism show.\r\nIt is a show about diving, in the same way School Days is a romance. The diving element takes second place to the show\u2019s main genres: slice of life and comedy. Which, in itself, isn\u2019t necessarily a bad thing. \r\nSlice of life shows can be great. They can be relaxing, heart-warming, and funny. They can make you laugh or cry. Or, they can make you cringe.\r\nThis show falls most definitely into the latter category. And a perfect example of this lies in its characters, an aspect that normally makes or breaks slice-of-life shows. \r\nFirst off: Two bodybuilder lookalikeswho do very little in the show besides encourage the MCs to drink themselves silly, get naked at every opportunity, and all around just be negative influences. I think they\u2019re meant to be \u2018manly\u2019 characters but the only \u2013 and I mean the only time we ever see them getting serious is when they talk about diving. The rest of the time they consume massive quantities of mixed drinks (as well as encouraging/forcing others to do the same) and show very little respect for anyone. They think nothing of humiliating someone if it\u2019s to raise money for their precious diving club (which must have been shown at least ONCE in the anime by now).\\n\\n\r\nI\u2019m trying to think of more to say about them and I can\u2019t. They\u2019re good at tennis? They\u2019re essentially the musclebound, brain-dead stereotypical college guys we\u2019re all embarrassed to be around unless we\u2019re wasted. Maybe some people watching this will be reminded (fondly, or not so fondly) of their own college/uni days. Either way, although I found watching them enjoyable, it was only because sometimes I just need to watch something ridiculously cringey. \\n\\n\r\nTake away majority of the nudity, decrease the drinking (yes, there still needs to be drinking but not 3 drinking sessions per ep), and add a few more scenes where they show off their diving expertise. Then these two would have actually gone from being comic characters to being decent, slightly fleshed-out characters.\\n\\n\r\nIori, the MC\u2026where do I begin? \\n\r\nSpineless? He\u2019ll back down when confronted with anyone angry but it\u2019s not quite what I\u2019m looking for. Reckless? He\u2019s definitely that but without the confidence needed to be properly reckless. Pathetic? Well, he grovels on the floor often enough, gives in when confronted with any sort of peer pressure, and frequently embarrasses himself by making offensive remarks to others.  \\n\\n\r\nThe only time he\u2019s \u2018confident\u2019 is when he\u2019s been egged on by his \u2018friends\u2019, or when making objectifying comments to his cousin (who, by the way, he seems to fancy) - and that might just be mistaking idiocy for confidence. \\n\\n\r\nThe sad part is that when he\u2019s by himself he actually seems to be quite a decent human being. He\u2019s the type of person that is ruined by bad friends, and his ruin is shown clearly in the anime. He literally goes from being the new guy to being the creepy laughingstock of the university in one episode, after his \u2018friends\u2019 deliver him to the entrance passed out drunk and wearing nothing but a pair of boxers.\\n\\n\r\nThe only real thing, the only thing that makes him partway relatable is his struggle when it comes to swimming and diving. He starts off by being afraid of the water, but actually faces his fears and becomes a better person for it. \\n\\n\r\nThis is in no small part due to Nanaka and Chisa, two of the female leads of the show. Nanaka can be disposed of easily as she is completely one-dimensional from the beginning. Iori\u2019s sweet, kind cousin who\u2019s also in love with her sister (to the extent of acting like a yandere over her). She appears randomly, makes some nice comments, helps people out with things and then disappears again. Exploring her background a little, or even her relationship with her sister would have helped give her more depth, but no. Maybe next season.\\n\\n\r\nChisa is a far more interesting character. She\u2019s just as kind in her own way, but will not suffer fools gladly. At some points she feels like the only sane character in the series. She despises some of the guys\u2019 more vulgar actions, and has no patience for Iori\u2019s ill-timed and ill-humoured comments. But somehow, even miraculously, she realises that he\u2019s not intrinsically a bad person. Immature yes, but a person with his own struggles and fears. She helps him a lot, both when he\u2019s looking and when he isn\u2019t. Plus, she\u2019s adorable.\\n\\n\r\nIori\u2019s best friend is\u2026pitiful. Yep, that\u2019s probably the best way to describe him. He\u2019s almost exactly a carbon copy of Iori but with an added anime obsession. Perhaps he does have slightly more sense, but no matter how much he protests he always ends up joining in with Iori\u2019s idiotic schemes and mistakes. The two of them argue frequently, which is fun to watch initially, but soon becomes as boring as it is repetitive. He doesn\u2019t seem to have any character development either, besides learning how to drink an entire bucket of vodka in one. It\u2019s development\u2026of a sort.\\n\\n\r\nAina, or \u2018cakey\u2019 is the unusual one of the cast, and actually fairly likeable. She has some character development too, which I\u2019m not going to go into as that would spoil at least one ep. I will say though, the eps with her in were the ones I enjoyed the most. Plus, she\u2019s kind of relatable, in that \u2018weird but not downright loony\u2019 way. Someone needs to give her a make-up tutorial though.\\n\\n\r\nPurple haired girl is a fun character to watch. There has to be at least one girl who\u2019s as crazy as all the boys, right? To prove that strong, independent, alcoholic women with no inhibitions do exist. Oh, and she\u2019s loud. Raucous laughter echoes wherever she goes. But despite all that, she\u2019s a kind, loyal friend, the type you don\u2019t want to hang with all the time but you\u2019re glad for when push comes to shove, because you know she\u2019s got your back. You can also tell her all the stuff you can\u2019t share with anyone else. And she won\u2019t spill it (unless it\u2019s for a laugh, then you\u2019re on your own). She brings a lot of life to the cast (which is basically a good thing), and does provide the setup for a fair few awkward situations. \\n\\n\r\nSo there you have the cast. There\u2019s not much to say about the rest. \\n\\n\r\nArt? I\u2019m no judge. Lots of incredibly creepy facial expressions though \u2013 they border on caricatures a lot of the time. \\n\\n\r\nMusic? I really enjoyed the music, and found myself singing along to the op more than once. Thumbs up for that. \u201cBe passionate, my friends,\u201d and all.\\n\\n\r\nPlot? See above. Oh and there\u2019s a bit of diving thrown in.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: Now, of course lots of people will enjoy this show. I did myself, in parts. But will anyone enjoy it because it\u2019s a deep meaningful show? Of course not. It\u2019s the type of show people come to laugh at. It\u2019s the type of immature humour that can be completely hit or miss. \\n\\n\r\nIt is not a good show. But it\u2019s a funny show, in its own way. \\n\\n\r\nAs I mentioned earlier, sometimes you just need to watch something ridiculous for the fun of it. If brainless fun, with a high dose of cringe, is what you\u2019re looking for, you\u2019ll enjoy this one. \\n",

After watching it I can say that it's funny but not as funny as Prison School. The show has a very simple story, about a young man who wants to have the perfect college life, but gets into some weird shit. The art is amazing IMO, and the ocean and beaches and stuff look beautiful. The sound is just normal sound, but I really like the intro song. The characters are well thought out. The enjoyment is pretty good, but sometimes it does get a littlebit boring. Overall it's a very cute anime and it's nice to just watch and chill. I hope for a second season.",

Based on the picture I thought it would be a typical school romance taking place in a coastal city along with the usual slapstick comedy and other cliches that we have been used to. But I never ever expected this to be one of the funniest comedies I have watched in a long time.\r\nThe characters are hilarious, the comedy is top-notch and it is such an enjoyable watch that will give you a great time and summer vibes! All the characters are likeable and have their own \"intricacies\" and peculiarities, which enhancesthe comedy part even more!\\n\\n\r\nThe plot is nothing special and does not really lead anywhere. It is mostly supportive and acts as a foothold for the comedy, as a channel through which the comedy flows. However, it is presented in such an amusing way that will keep you entertained throughout the duration of the series. The animation is visually pleasing. The music is good and enhances the intensity of the comedy scenes. The opening song is very memorable and catchy and I ended up never skipping it whenever I was starting a new episode. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, a very relaxing story that will give you a great time watching it, big laughs and it is very possible that you might relate to it if you like drinking parties! It will also \"broaden your perspective\" by introducing alternative ways that a simple game like Rock, Scissors and Paper can be played... ...you will understand very soon what I mean after you start watching it...!!!\\n\\n\r\nA great comedy and a must see!",

The art is really entertaining (i really like comedy with OVERDETAILED face, it makes the comedy even good) thats the good part, but not all of it is that good. For me thestory is kinda bland. It confuse me on what part the story want to focus to, is it the comedy? the club? the relationship? idk, i know the story is not all, but because the story is not all, at least focus on something. Well at least the comedy is good i almost always laugh on every episode because of it. And watching iori and kouhei bonding is fun too, but i still can't accept it end just like that, it just feels too hanging and bland.\\n\\n\r\nI know that the point of this anime is showing a heavy comedy while showing us how beautiful is our world (sea) is. But IMO there are two ways to do a heavy comedy.\\n\r\nOne is do the heavy comedy with light story,\\n\r\nand the other one is do the heavy comedy along with the heavy story.\\n\\n\r\nI feel that Grand Blue doesn't choose either of them, making it so unbalanced. The gap between the story and the comedy is big, making it kinda feels weird when the anime actually tells what's the story about.\\n\\n\r\nAfter watching it, all i can say is not every anime is for everyone.\\n\r\nIts an anime for you that searching anime with heavy comedy and light story. \\n\\n",

            "content": "Okay! So, I know we guys have a lot of preferences when it comes to anime some of us like Harem, Romace, Drama, Action, Horror, Psychological etc., And sometimes Comedy. We have our own opinion on the matter, depending on how an Anime connect to us. So here is my un-biased opinion or review on this one because i am an anime lover no matter the genre is.\r\nHonestly before i began the series i had my doubts, I was thinking weither this anime be any good, so i didn't get my hopes up on this one, but, to my surprise after watching the first epi got hooked!\\n\\n\r\nStory: Its about the life of a freshman going to college for the 1st time and he is really excited, just like me back then, to make it more exciting he's going to school far away from home, whoooo sounds more fun! You can do everything you want, so he started living with his uncle along with some weird people, or should i say \"Bad Influences?\" \ud83d\ude02 Along with his 2 beautiful fanservice female cousins (its moderate so we good). He was forced to join their club \"Diving Peek a Boo Club\" and turns out his unlce's house is where the club members meet, because, its a Rental Diving Store called the Grand Blue (yeah it's the name of the anime) to make the long story short, he got influenced met some odd new people along the way, and he got wasted till the end \ud83d\ude02. \\n\\n\r\nThe story has no serious plot more like a Sitcom (forgot the other term, Slice of life?) type of anime. The story talks about college life, we all experienced it in some way, or some weird and funny way, so this anime has a bit of connection to me personally, made me think back while i was in college and how crazy we are back then, you know parties and stuff, its a part of life or should i say the part where you lose your virginity \ud83d\ude02. Hey no regrets! \ud83d\ude02 You made a irreversible decision \ud83d\ude02. So that's the gist of it. For me it was good and refreshing i like it! It's crazy and fun to watch. 8/10\\n\\n\r\nArt: hmmmm.. art is in moderate level, I noticed they focused more in making the characters to look more appealing. It's 8/10\\n\\n\r\nSound: feels like i'm driving a convertable feeling the ocean breeze on my cheeks while fading away on the sunset. 8/10.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: They are funny all of them has some characteristics that make them cute and funny. Again there is no serious plot so there is no major character developments put it in mind that this is comedy. I laughed all the way through so. 8/10.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Did I or did I not enjoy this? Well i laughed at every episode so hell yeah! I was hoping for more actually. 10/10.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: it was worth the binge! I did not regret watching this, it was fun it was new, a little bit of mature! So i don't recommend this for youngsters so don't destroy your life yet! \ud83d\ude02 Some puns and scenes here are dangerous to your health. I would give it an 8/10. If you wanna have a blast of real comedy though, you better watch Gintama! \ud83d\ude02 So there it is! Sayonara!",

            "content": "*updated review\r\nI score based on enjoyment, and not on \"the music here was inappropriate\" and \"the characters weren't relatable enough\". Obviously, those things do factor into enjoyment but I dont score each individual factor and bust out the calculator for an average score. Regardless, I will talk about the story art sound etc. too, however briefly.\r\nStory-9\r\nThe story is pretty basic, which isn't a bad thing at all. Its a pretty linear and easy to follow story and it fits the premise of the Anime. As a comedy, the settings and events that take place perfectly set up the jokes and such. \r\nArt- 8\r\nThe art isgood, animation is a bit choppy, but the titan faces, scenery, and characters in general are well drawn. \\n\\n\r\nSound-9\\n\r\nThe OP and ED is great and the music doesn't feel out of place anywhere. A large variety of music and sounds too, so songs don't feel overused or repetitive. The voice actors initially seemed mediocre but they grew on me more and more as the story progressed.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter-10\\n\r\nThis is a purely comedy based anime, and the characters are made perfectly for it. They all have their little traits and whatnot that make them unique, although their style is pretty normal. By the end of the show, all the characters are well developed, unique, and especially lovable in their own ways. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment-9\\n\r\nOnly thing that matters, obviously everything above factors into enjoyment. As a comedy, this anime meets pretty much every requirement. The only thing I do believe needs work on is the pacing in the first few episodes. I don't, however, blame them for this as the source material is so joke-packed that itd be hard for anyone to adapt (Zero-g actually does a great job adapting most of the jokes, it just feels rushed at times). The pacing definitely got better afterwards, which made it more enjoyable.  \\n\\n\r\nCool, thats about it. The overall score is the same as the Enjoyment score and I hope it gets another season, as the manga is pretty far ahead and stays consistently good. Definitely a good and worth while comedy to watch. \\n\\n",

            "content": "What is comedy to you? Is it a bunch of naked guys drinking like there's no tomorrow? Grand Blue is not your anime if that is what you're looking for. This is a show about diving.\r\nI've never read the manga, but I'll assume it's similar and explains how diving works. With that being said, Grand Blue is great at showcasing the beautiful landscape of the beach and the ocean, the exceptional personalities of the cast, and most of all... the wonderful joy of youth. The motivating opening gives you an uplifting and summer vibe that, if you were watching it while it was airing, makesyou want to dance and enjoy the summer to its fullest extent. Honestly, watching Grand Blue during any other season just takes its charm away. It's summer. Enjoy it while watching this show.\\n\\n\r\nMuch of its comedy is comprised of arguments and booze, which make up a huge portion of the anime. But don't stress. Remember. This is about diving. But because Grand Blue also wants to gives us other things, the comedy is just a bonus, you know? The characters are funny. Maybe not funny to others, but I found them hilarious. In terms of entertainment, Asobi Asobase takes the cake, but when it comes to the whole vibe, Grand Blue is king. Despite the fact that it isn't actually what it's supposed to be, it's still an anime that truly fits this season. The animation is stunning. Yeah, the faces, I know, the ridiculous facial expressions. But the look of the Grand Blue shop is just... dazzling. The scenery of the ocean, the beaches, the shops, the places, it's all eye-candy for me. I loved the bright and sunny depiction of these locations.\\n\\n\r\nNow back to the comedy. Not everyone likes it. Not everyone will enjoy it. I'm pretty sure most viewers have read the manga and are (probably) disappointed with what they got. As for me? I liked it. It was good. Nothing remarkable. It was just... good. I'm satisfied with what I got.",

Now when it come to the sound category, the one that has the most impact here was Cakey's monologue when we see her scream, shout or rant, Iori and Kohei's monologue did add to the impact when they're duking out and it can be considered as a big plus to this anime's comedy genre, so at this point I really have no more words to say to this Outstanding anime, cu'z basically this could be considered watching something that can be the best thing that has happened to your life and damn someone if they think that this is a worst anime , when a lotta funny was in this anime,so given that I have nothing more to say, here is waht I say about this anime's ratings:\\n\\n\r\nStory-Outstanding 10: I was funny and that's as good as it gets. especially when this anime's theme was more on a group of guys having a ball and getting wasted. \\n\\n\r\nArt- Very Good 8: The facial expression, yes the facial expression, it basically adds to the comedic aspect. \\n\\n\r\nSound-Very Good 8: For Cakey's voice when she is disappointed and disgusted, Iori and Kohie when they're fighting.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter-Very Good 8: For the quirkiness of the characters around here when them guys go wild and naked......and just forget the diving.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment- Very Good 8: Totally not boring and some thing you can rewatch.\\n\\n\r\nOverall- Outstanding 10: Kudos to original creator \tInoue, Kenji and kudos to Studio Zero-G , and If this will have a 2nd season the YEAH LET THE PARTY START!!!!!!!!!!!!!!   \\n\\n",

When I commented as such, someone replied, cryptically: \"It's good, but I wouldn't say it's about diving.\" I had no idea what this meant, but I dove right in when I found out I was already paying for Amazon Prime and didn't even know it. SPOILER FREE though I just finished ep 3 so I don't think I could if I wanted to\r\nStory: 7/10. Not too much of a story, just a boy heading into college with all thelofty, lusty ambitions of the classic 18 year old. There's a general flow to the eps that make logical sense as they indoctrinate Iori into the club. The comedic timing is great, and I was laughing hard at this show. Last show to make me crack up was Blend S, but this is even better. A bit too much on the fanservice, but it's more dongs than tits tbh. Besides, who needs a beach ep when the whole show is in swim suits??\\n\\n\r\nArt: 10/10. Maybe it's just the current generation of anime, but I love the art here. It's crisp, and the nature visuals are striking. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 8/10. I like the OP and ED a lot. I don't notice the rest of the OST but since it's not intrusive I find that to be a plus, given that the show is a laidback comedy and not a drama or action show.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 9/10. They're all good so far. They all have strengths and weaknesses and mesh well with each other. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10. I'm not too big on comedy anime but I wanted to see this one, thinking it would be like the underwater version of Yuru Camp. I was wrong, but I'm glad I was. This show is a knee slapper. Don't listen to that spoiler-sport who gave it a 1/10. He's just a sour Sally. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9/10. I recommend this show for all these reasons. I'm hesitant to give it a 10 since only 5 eps are out now, but it's worth at least a look. You'll know by the first episode if you'll like it or not, so what's 20 mins of your time anyways?",

I looked forward to it and when it finally aired, I watched it. Cool, so it was good? Sadly,no.\\n\\n\r\nThis is a pretty late review as quite some time has passed since then, but better late than never, I guess.\\n\\n\r\nThere's way too much wrong with this anime.\\n\\n\r\nFor starters, although I've always heard of how funny Grand Blue is, I didn't find the anime to be funny at all. It made me chuckle a couple of times and that's it. Now, I don't watch slice of life anime for the comedy. I enjoy that particular genre of anime for the characters. I don't demand slice of life/comedy anime to make me laugh myself to death. Characters that are up to my liking is all I want and that's what entertains me. So why am I talking about Grand Blue's humor if it's not what I watch slice of life anime for? That's because Grand Blue is one of the least funny comedy anime I've ever seen.\\n\r\nI understand that humor is entirely subjective, but the way this show does humor is just horrible.\\n\r\nGrand Blue's gags are predictable and repetitive. I'll describe some of their gags and jokes. There's that one gag where the male characters take off their clothes, so that they're either left with their underwear or just plain nude, and every other character who sees them gets either triggered, disgusted or surprised. That's not funny. Then there's the gag where Iori and Kouhei get tricked into getting drunk. That's also not funny. They think that by using the same unfunny gags every single episode, which become predictable, that they will eventually become funny. They never did.\\n\\n\r\nThen we have the one time gags, like the one I'll be describing:\\n\r\nThe characters are at a bar. Iori and Kouhei decide to try their hands at being bartenders.\\n\r\nAina: \"All right, I'll have a screwdriver!\" (The name of a cocktail. Yeah, weird name.)\\n\r\nIori: \"A screwdriver...\"\\n\r\nKouhei: \"I got it.\"\\n\r\nMe: Thinking. \"Let me guess, they are going to put a screwdriver into her glass and offer it to her?\\n\r\nIori and Kouhei: They do exactly what I thought they would.\\n\r\nAina: \"Hold on...\" and then she starts screaming at them.\\n\r\nMe: Gives no reaction whatsoever.\\n\r\n. . . How exactly is that funny? It's predictable and just plain stupid. Predictable jokes aren't funny. And yes, I'm aware that comedies are nothing without stupid characters doing stupid things, but in order for it to work, it has to be the right kind of stupid. Grand Blue doesn't have the right kind of stupid. Most of its humor is predictable, repetitive and not funny. Grand Blue only managed to make me chuckle twice. The part where everyone screws over Iori when they tried to help Chisa win the beauty contest and the part where Iori and his friends decide to screw over one of their friends who's about to get laid. That's all.\\n\\n\r\nNow I'll talk about why I like slice of life anime. The characters. Characters either make or break a good slice of life anime. Grand Blue's characters don't just break the anime. They shatter it. Halfway through the show, I genuinely started thinking to myself when exactly would Grand Blue's characters give me literally anything that would make me like them. Spoiler, they never gave me anything. Grand Blue's cast of characters is one of the worst I've ever seen.\\n\\n\r\nFirst we have Iori, the main character. He just moved to his uncle's scuba diving shop and his life as a university freshman has begun. He gets roped into joining the diving club and takes Kouhei with him. Where did his character go wrong? Well, for starters, he had no character to begin with. You heard it right. The main character has no character. How could I possibly like him? Then we have Kouhei. He's an otaku and that's all there is to him. He and Iori have a scumbag friend relationship, but sadly, it's not any good. Both of their characters are just not interesting or relatable.\\n\\n\r\nTokita and Kotobuki are two muscular, alcohol loving idiots who rope Iori into joining their diving club. They both sucked. Both of them are a part of a repetitive unfunny nude gag and that seems to be the only reason they exist, because the show doesn't give them anything that would make the viewer like them. Also, when it comes to anything diving related, their characters perform a shocking 180 degrees and all of a sudden, they are both knowledgeable and responsible individuals. Diving can be dangerous, after all. If an old lady saw the duo when they were out diving, she would be thinking something like this: \"Oh, my. These young men are so responsible and mature. If only more youngsters were like them.\" But if she saw how the duo behave at their drinking parties, she'd get a hearth attack out of pure shock.\\n\\n\r\nGrand Blue's other characters aren't anything worthy of praise either.\\n\r\nChisa Kotegawa is Iori's cousin. She hates men, mostly Iori, and loves diving. She appears to be quite cute, but has a lackluster personality. Nanaka is her older sister who loves her to the point it becomes weird and degenerate. Azusa is a bisexual airhead. Iori and Kouhei's friends are also uninteresting. All of them are simply bitter virgin friends. Everyone I just described has a lackluster personality.\\n\\n\r\nAina is the character I disliked the least. She actually manages to stand out, but that's not exactly worthy of praise, because who wouldn't stand out when surrounded by such a garbage cast of characters. She's shy and actually entertaining, but they could have done much more with her.\\n\\n\r\nI understand that Grand Blue's manga probably does the humor better than its anime, since most of the time, the source material is the superior of the two, but what about these horrible characters? What, are the manga's readers too busy laughing their asses off to realize that the characters are all terrible? Not likely.\\n\\n\r\nI don't find Nichijou to be funny, but at least its characters are fine. Grand Blue isn't funny and its characters are bad.\\n\\n\r\nGrand Blue is also filled with fan service. I'm not against fan service, as long as the show has other redeeming qualities, but Grand Blue sucks.\\n\\n\r\nThe art and animation are both solid, but characters having ugly facial expressions for the sole purpose of comedy, which I have mentioned multiple times isn't funny at all, just doesn't sit right with me. The anime's nudity is censored with black circles. Kind of weird.\\n\\n\r\n~ Overall, Grand Blue didn't live up to my expectations.",

Great characters. Art style during comedic moments (eg:bleeding nose!!).\r\nThings i disliked:\r\nNot quite a new story. Predictable outcomes. \r\nIf u are here for an underwater anime...this is not it. Well diving is a sub-plot but the main objective is comedy and drinking!! If u want an anime to just chill, this is it. It deliverswhat it promises-laughs.\\n\r\nI would recommend to watch a dark anime and then come here so that your mind will become refreshed to watch another dark anime!(that's just my personal opinion though)\\n",

I am a 19 year old college student. Most of my friends are currently playing varsity sports and much of times that we hangout it can be somewhat similar to what the anime is showing. Due to that ifrequently pause the anime and laugh comparing the anime characters with some of my friends, it can be pretty enjoyable. But overall im sure that even if you cant neccesarily relate to the anime you'll still find yourself laughing.",

            "content": "Twenty year old Iori Kitahara is about to start his new college life. Excited to make the most of his youth he decides to move in with his uncle who happens to run a scuba diving store named \"Grand Blue\" nearby. Living together with him were his beautiful cousins Chisa and Nanaka Kotegawa. All seems well until he enters the store and finds a gang of macho guys partying naked and drinking. Amongst them, Shinji Tokita and Ryuujirou Kotobuki turn out to be instructors at the store and also go to the same university. Hearing that he was a new fresher to the uni heends up relunctantly getting dragged into their Diving Club \"Peek-a-boo\" club activities. Unfortunately, the club was still lacking members on fresher's day and Iori ends up dragging a classmate along too, Kouhei Imamura, a handsome guy who catches the attention of many women except his open Otaku way of life ends up keeping everyone away from him. As the new semester begins, the odd mix of personalities ends up leading to a variety of weird and awkward situations.\\n\\n\r\nThis show revolves around the college life of characters with quirky personalities that leads to some funny or odd interactions during their everyday lives. You've got a bunch of guys that enjoy drinking and being naked while the girls around them treat it as the norm. Nanaka doesn't mind them that way around in the store but she has a sister complex and gets sexually obssessed with anything Chisa has body contact with. Then you've got Tokita and Ryuujirou's friend Azusa from the all women university who happens to be bisexual, energetic and very open minded. The list goes on... The only people that seem to be normal is Chisa who does her best to ignore it all but that doesn't stop her from being dragged into their activities since they're always around. Iori always ends up with the short end of the stick as he becomes friends with the weird bunch and ends up with all sorts of misunderstandings pinned on him.\\n\\n\r\nSometimes it feels like the jokes are stretching it a bit - a lot of times they don't stray far from macho guys drinking and getting naked or running around in their underwear. However, the jokes do get a bit more interesting in the second half of the show. It also has its rare more serious slice-of-life moments when it's not being silly and fooling around so that the growing Grand Blue gang end up watching out for each other.\\n\\n\r\nThere's no shortage of fan service scenes. Character designs are aesthetically pleasing although their angry serious expressions remind me of Attack on Titan. You'll see the girls in swimsuits quite often since it's a scuba diving club... and the naked macho guys. I don't think there's a single episode where the guys don't strip naked or are at least half naked - it's the norm for the guys. And where there's alcohol involved in any story there's usually sex too and the show isn't afraid to make a joke of out it either. Certain scenes can be... brutal. As for the music, I didn't find anything that stood out other than the odd karaoke style ending theme although, the OP \"Grand Blue\" fits in with the stereotype image of summer - blue skies, blazing sun and going all out with passion.\\n\\n\r\nIt's a weird lively summery, slice-of-life comedy show full of nudity aimed at the young male adult audience, with the odd serious moments that barely touches on scuba diving. It's all about drinking and partying nude - your whole summer YOLO attitude. At least after watching this you'll be a bit more knowledgeable about scuba diving if you weren't already and know what an \"Old Man\" or \"Hamasaki's Wife\" can mean in Okinawa.",

            "content": "Grand Blue was not under my radar eventhough a lot of people had already talked and discussed about it considering how well known it is throughout the community because my first impressions told me that it was going to be another generic slice of life anime. However,once i gave it a 2nd change, that is when all of my point of view completely changed. and here is why : \r\n1. Story (7)\r\nwell there is not much of a story considering that it is still belong to the slice of life category but to summarize the things that you are going to expect from here onwards,it all started when an adult teen named Iori Kitahara went off to his uncle's diving shop in order to prepare for his college life but that was when he encountered the local Diving Club, at first you would probably had thought that its going to be just a normal diving club but turns out it consist of full of buff men who spend more time drinking, partying, and stripping naked than actually diving instead, now that's a plot twist! Anyhow, he also met her cute cousin who was then unfortunately had a wrong first impression about Iori and thus beging Iori's journey with the rest of the crew of the diving club.\\n\\n\r\n2. Art (9)\\n\\n\r\nthe visuals are absolutely top notch.Probably some of the best ive seen in recent memories and quite an achievement for a comedic anime like this.  all of the character's expression and superb animation really does bring the whole setting to life especially when the whole team when off diving in the ocean along with its breathtaking and crystal clear open waters. Although, character's overreacting facial animations are just cherry on top but they are being overused quite a lot that it can sometimes become stail but overall, fantastic visuals and animation indeed. \\n\\n\r\n3. Sound (8)\\n\\n\r\nfor this category, i feel like the seiyuus did a splendid job playing the roles of the characters. the voices actually blended really well with the character's personalities. if im going to spell out even more, their voice acting might be on par as gintama's character voice acting with all of those overreacting moments which is something very great indeed. as for the music, its your typical and standard slice of life background music without anything noticable but its decent for its own. \\n\\n\\n\r\n4. Characters (9)\\n\\n\r\n in my honest opinion, i really like the interactions between the characters. every single one of them had their own style of doing things and unique relationships. for instance, Iori Kitahara and his otaku weirdo friend, Kohei who was tricked to enter the diving club have probably one of the best chemistry in all history of comedic anime. whatever they did from blowing up antics to getting themselves into trouble, they always made me laugh. the same goes to the side characters notably Azusa, she is not one of those kind of \"generic women tropes\" you can see why if you watch the anime. However,the only character that i dislike are Ryuijiro and Shinji aka the \"drunken duo\"  not in the sense of pure hate its just that their roles most of the time are just getting drunk and strip naked. i do admit that they can be pretty serious sometimes especially when it comes to diving lessons but forcing iori and kohei to join their alcohol party is something that i really dont like from them eventhough those 2 had grown accustomed with drinking alchohol. \\n\\n\r\n5. enjoyment/personal opinion (9)\\n\\n\r\nat first when i first found out that the anime is mostly about university students doing crazy stuffs like getting drunk and having a naked party i was turned off by the concept since the cover title literally tells the audience that its going to be an anime about diving. well fortunately it did provided us 3 episodes about diving and im really glad that the characters took it seriously. After i finished the anime, it turned out to be actually great! i was entertained with all of the hilarous moments from it and this is coming from a guy who dont usually watch slice of life anime. if you want to look for comedic anime that doesnt use the cliche tropes and wouldnt mind with all of the over drinking and getting naked stuffs then you should give it a try. \\n\\n\r\n6. overall (9)\\n\\n",

I'd read the manga first and thought it was hilarious and high quality and in particular thought the facial expressions were funny and really added to a punchline or a comedic back and forth. The anime doesn't disappoint either and has good music and the same funny jokes and gags which usually involve stripping down which I found original. There are also the standard but always good misunderstanding humor. The anime lacks any real substance story or character wise and the jokes themselves can feel somewhat safe orbasic but it's still a fun show that manages to be funny which is no small feat in a culture that seems to have eschewed or replaced comedy with ecchi and moe.",

For a show about diving there is very little of it but it hardly matters, the show is gut busting hilarious. And it's refreshing to have the members in college.\r\nART 7: The underwater scenes are average. It doesn't look breathtakingly beautiful as the characters state. But above land the art hold up well and the some of the faces are remarkable, kind of like whatkonosuba was like\\n\\n\r\nSOUND 7: Nice OP. The VA is good. The background score is okay\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER 9: Amazing. They all stand out in terms of personality and their antics are something to look forward to\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT 10: Damn, this show is hilarious. I have had to pause episodes becuase i was laughing so much\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL: Comedy of the season for me. Highly recommend it",

Some better than others obviously, but all of them had me rolling more than a few times. This show had me hooked from the word go, ngl. From the first episode until the finale credits I was enthralled, this show is without a doubt one of the best anime comedies I've ever seen. It's really good. This show is something else. Gonna be high up for AOTY in my book. \r\nThe characters were so much fun. Everyone at Peek A Boo was such ablast to see. Iori was an awesome lead whom I connected to more than I expected I would. He's actually a genuinely good guy, who also knows how to cut loose and have fun when the time calls for it, and sometimes even when it doesn't, haha. Him and Kohei are such bros, I love their constant bickering and \"fighting\", great friends all around. Of course the ladies of the show were awesome too, Chisa is a great tsundere and I wuv her, Aina was a sweety who made me laugh a ton, Azusa is a sexy minx who has a good heart too, and of course the siscon Nanaka was great. The club elders were awesome too. I don't think there'd a single character I hated or even mildly disliked. They were all great in some way. \\n\\n\r\nThe strength of this show for me was absolutely it's writing and comedic timing. It was just about perfect. Everything clicked with the comedy really. I laughed more here than I have any other anime comedy I think. Every episode was so good with that. From oolong tea to vegetables up butts, it was hilarious to see every week. It's hard to describe comedy in a bubble but Damn this one had me rolling way too many times to count or get across as well at it deserves. Overall I loved this show, that's no surprise really though. Been gushing about it every week. It's amazing really. Easy giving it this score.\\n\\n\r\n10/10.",

            "content": "As the season is coming to its end, I do have to say that Grand Blue is by far my No.1 most hyped Anime for this season. Not only because it's funny and all, but, also it orientated around university lifestyle which rarely seen in anime. The amount of humour and laughter were outstandingly narrated, and yes, adapted well with the manga in my opinion (though, fewer swear words than the manga). \r\nHere is my breakdown: \r\nStory (9/10) - My I rated so highly, well, it reflects what's life like at university, and I can reflect it since I experience it all too. The storylinewas adapted accordingly to the manga which I enjoyed the most. Despite some cutout scenes from the manga, the show never stopped to entertain me on a Friday night. \\n\\n\r\nArt (9/10) - The underwater diving was beautifully animated, but, the standout animation was the characters design. I fell in love with the animation since the first episode, and damn they looked glamorous. \\n\\n\r\nSound (8/10) - Amazing background music was played to suit the atmosphere of the scene, and not to mention the music to fits the seaside environment. Did I suggest that the opening was quite liva loca!!   \\n\\n\r\nCharacter (8/10) - Some characters can be a bit disappointing, but overall, the characters in the diving club were the key highlights to what makes the show spark. The amount of humour elicits at each scene's captivated my love for this show even more. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (10/10) - When I rank it my best show for this season it has to be the level of enjoyment evoked at each episode. But it's mostly down to the level of alcoholism and jokes integrated into this show gave me the happiness I needed. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, I gave it 9/10, as it also made it to my top 10 favourite anime of all time. Now I hope for a season 2 to carry on this ridiculous storyline of university life.",

Within 4 episodes in, it looks like the format for each episode is going to cover 2 chapters of manga!

It would be strange to try to compare it to anything else, however, the show decides that it also wants to be about diving and college life and it gets really muddled when trying to review it. (I\u2019ll try to do the best that I can)\r\nStory: 7\r\nI\u2019m gonna have to give the story a 7.\r\nComedy-wise, this shows has a very strong similarity to Prison School with its HIGHLY detailed reaction faces. I really can\u2019t over exaggerate how comedic andshadowed each and every reaction is, and that it\u2019s strongest feature. In terms of an actual story, it\u2019s average considering it\u2019s a comedy anime but actually teaches the viewer a thing or two every once and awhile. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 8\\n\r\nHIGHLY ALMOST CRIMINALLY detailed reactions\u2026 but unpolished messes when it comes to regular expressions. \\n\\n\r\nI don\u2019t even want to KNOW how long it took to draw most of those reactions it's simply amazing 10 out of 10. HOWEVER, everything is average, nothing too good and sometimes it dips down to disgusting in certain scenes. You really can\u2019t tell too much since 90% of the show is reaction scenes but holy shit.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 7 (EDIT)\\n\r\nIdk\u2026 I want to give it a higher score but it\u2019s so forgettable I don\u2019t even have anything to give it besides... Mediocre. That being said, the opening for this show is AMAZING and deserves an extra two stars simply for its existence. \\n\\n\r\n Characters: 6\\n\r\nPrison school \\n\\n\r\nThe main character is literally an older version of Kiyoshi Fujino who\u2019s prepared to strip down to his underwear subconsciously. The show has a weird effect where the less relevant the character is, the more interesting they become.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10\\n\r\nEven with all these flaws, it\u2019s still one of my favorite comedy anime\\n\\n\r\nDon\u2019t get me wrong, however, this show is FAR from a masterpiece. In all honesty, it\u2019s not a show that you HAVE to take at face value or else your experience with it will be shitty. \\n\\n\r\nOverall\u2026: 7\\n\\n\r\nI wanted to give it a 6 but because of how many times it made me laugh out loud, It\u2019s better than Prison school, at least. \\n\\n\r\nEDIT: gonna have to pull a fast one and raise the overall to a nine for the simple reason that I have NEVER laughed at a show as many times as I laughed at Grand Blue...

The story is about everything you shouldn't do, but probably should do while you are 'young' (of mind). \r\nThe story is about a freshman college gent who moves to a new townand is assigned to live with this uncle. His uncle happens to own basically a fraternity clubhouse for scuba diving (and drinking). Little did this gentleman know what he was walking into... Yet, he learns and masters the art of shoondickyfoo. I made that word up to describe the amount of blarg that this guy lives through and thus learns to create upon this world.

It induced in me a nostalgia for a youth I never had, a yearning for a beauty I\u2019ve never seen, and most importantly, it was one of the most enjoyable animes I have seen in a long time. It is perhaps telling that I am writing my first ever review about this show. \r\nPlot 8/10\r\nSuperficially speaking there isn\u2019t much plot. If anything, I would say it is more like a sitcom situated roughly along the lines of a story. Every episode is interesting in its ownway. This is not to say there is no character development. On the contrary, there is plenty, and unlike some animes that stretch character development to the boundaries of ad nauseam, Grand Blue exercises great subtlety in fleshing out the characters. \\n\\n\r\nArt 10/10 \\n\r\nIt would be a great pity if an anime with diving as its main theme and with 3 episodes set on a tropical island under starry skies and surrounded by sparkling blue seas should succumb to unworthy art. Well, you will be heartened to know that Grand Blue most certainly does not fail in this aspect. The detail of the art is worth mentioning too. With the exception of the motif of censoring, every detail is constructed brilliantly. TL;DR the art is great. \\n\\n\r\nScript 10/10\\n\r\nI\u2019m one for dialogue and I believe Grand Blue has the whole range of captivating dialogue. \\n\\n\r\nAll in all, do give Grand Blue a watch if you haven\u2019t. I admit the premise didn\u2019t really interest me at the start and for the longest of times I left it to rot at the back of my mind. But god I am thankful I gave it a chance. I might even go and learn diving. \\n\r\n*a cautionary note: Having watched it I can\u2019t actually say this anime is about diving though. I think it is more about drinking. On a side note I would love to try Spirytus. \\n",

            "content": "I wasn't sure what to make of this anime... on the one hand, its humor was rather amusing; on the other, the plot, or lack thereof, caused a gap for the story to become simultaneously enjoyable and substantial. \r\nWe follow a young man, Iori, who wanted to start his college life in an exciting way, by moving to his uncle's town and plunging himself into an unfamiliar environment. Instead of following the plan he set out for himself, he was forced to join the diving club, and in turn, dragged another Freshman with him. At the beginning, Iori was very resistant to joining and wasagainst certain \"quirky practices,\" for lack of a better term to avoid spoilers. \\n\\n\r\nHowever, before anything else could happen, Iori ended up going with the flow, as if there was nothing wrong in the first place. This happens time and time again throughout the series - a problem will present itself and instead of there being a resolution, another character will push for something else or a silly event will happen, so that we forget about the initial concern.\\n\\n\r\nThe appeal is certainly there, as we've all probably been in situations that caused us to come out of our comfort zone. Also, who does not want to \"make most of their youth?\"  But unfortunately, there is no true conflict and the characters have no real personalities; they are stand-ins for random cliches we experience. Since we, the audience, can relate, this produces a guise of a good story. There were even some hints at romance, but there was nothing really significant to back up that movement in the narrative. \\n\\n\r\nWhat's more is that the anime is supposedly about Iori and the diving club, however, any real diving (barely any was even done, if I may add) only happened at the tail end of the season. We also get lured into this whole idea of being in a college org, being invited into a new family that celebrates the same hobby, but several of these characters had no value added and were not even necessary. I think Free! had even more swimming and conflict resolution/character development.\\n\\n\r\nThe episodes air more time about getting wasted and cursing celibacy. I usually try not to mind fan service, but the series milked the \"we're all virgins and are hungry to get some\" too much. I admit that many of the scenes were funny, but there were those that were borderline disrespectful. \\n\\n\r\nThough real content may not exactly have been there, I ended up rating higher than expected because of the value for comedy. Again, many times, it was at the boundary of being disturbing, but I did have many guffaws from of the ridiculousness of it all. \\n\\n\r\nWhat they lack in story matter, they make up for in creativity, silliness, and entertainment. The show presented a mixture of slapstick, farcical, hyperbolic, and even blue humor, so that the audience would not get satiated. I thoroughly enjoyed laughing myself off at the, albeit 2D (as they lack depth and dimension), characters. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, this anime may not be for you if you're looking for a good story, but should mindless fun be your fancy, you may thoroughly enjoy Grand Blue.",

And this was a great move, because it led to an anime that was simply hilarious in its execution.\r\nI will say, there wasn't much worthwhile out of the story, but that isn't always a bad thing.  With no need to remember every character (I still can't distinguish between the regularly shown male club members) means you can really jump into the series at just about any point and still enjoy it.  \r\nIfyou're looking for a complex, deep, meaningful story... go to a different show.  If you find the actions of blackout drunk people to be hilarious... come on in and give this show a watch.",

Anatomy and proportions were...both normal and interesting lol. The main duo, the MC and his otaku buddy, were normal. The girls too, they were about normal for a male targeted anime. The girls in this show had pretty crazy proportions and figures. Curves, all at least double-D, flawless faces, etc. I don't dislike sexualized female characters too much. It fit into the vibe of this show so I mostly overlooked it. This show was meant as a show to relax and let loose to me. So I thought to just enjoy both the hilariouscomedy and the pretty girls. The scenery was nice. There was some nice showcasing of nature: the world under the surface, the wildlife, everything. The faces and mannerisms of the characters are so unique, unique as in really awesome and different; the idea of using distorted anatomy and faces isn't new, but this show did it damn well. The art in general was crisp, clean, and really nice to look at. \\n\\n\r\nAnimation: 7/10 It was fluid. The animation quality was about average. There weren't any noticeable shortcuts or places where they skimped out. The animation was an average-good. Nothing really to point out that was bad.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 9/10 The characters along with the artstyle and interesting scenarios are what really made this show what it is. The characters never made a moment boring. The characters made this show so enjoyable that episodes seemed to fly by. I wouldn't say well written, but these characters were very much so well done. They didn't need complex back stories or personalities. It was their general dynamics with one another to the scenarios they were in are what made them so great. The character designs weren't too interesting except for the pretty-boy otaku. That was pretty unconventional: the first introduction to him where it pans down to his anime shirt...that was hilarious. \\n\\n\r\nPlot: 7/10 It's a show about diving...I mean...uhh...THIS IS A WORK OF FICTION. UNDERAGE DRINKING IS STRONGLY PROHIBITED AND ILLEGAL. SCENES INVOLVING ALCOHOL WITH FORCEFUL CONSUMPTION AND SHAMEFUL ACTS ARE NOT ENCOURAGED. PLEASE VIEW THIS AS A COMEDY. FURTHERMORE, ALL CHARACTERS APPEARING IN THIS WORK ARE OF LEGAL AGE. \\n\\n\r\nDevelopment: 7/10 Drinking.\\n\\n\r\nMusic: 6/10 The OP is super catchy. The ED was meh. The bgm was nice but unmemorable. Soundboard was used nicely in the comedy. No real sound design.\\n\\n\r\nConclusion: 6/10 Open-ended ending for the future of fun. Motivated me enough to pick up the manga. No questions were really there to be answered with the conclusion so there isn't much complexity to this conclusion. It was a standard ending. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8/10 This was great. It's shows like these that motivate me to continue my hobby of watching anime no matter how bad the slumps get. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

I don't actually know how well this anime did in japan, andi doubt they care that much about its popularity in the west, but if we could please have a season 2 it would make my anime year. \\n\\n\r\nThis anime isnt great for its story, it's great for the way it makes you feel.",

            "content": "This is the type of show that has a type of humor that won\u2019t resonate with everyone but if you enjoy it, you will end up loving it. \r\nFor me, this show checks off all the right boxes to be something in the great category. It has some great humor accompanied by over the top facial reactions but that\u2019s not all, it has some (read few) serious moments that bring things back down to Earth. \r\nI can say with certainty my sides exploded from laughter more than a few times during the course of this show. But it\u2019s not just the humor or faces thatmake this a great show. The actual plot of diving, and when they do get in the ocean, take it from just being humorous to having a purpose. It gives it a level of depth (pun intended) that i find hard to see in some comedies like Prison School for example. \\n\\n\r\nAs for the characters, all of their quirks made things interesting and it meant that every interaction was going to be enjoyable even if it was a 1 on 1 talk. Chisa, to me, felt like one of the best characters because she keeps the entire series grounded and from going off on too big a tangent when Iori or Kouhei get into shenanigans. The other characters also didn\u2019t feel like background noise, they made contributions and very minor characters like a bar owner used time to really bring out some humor. Again, it has a great balance. \\n\\n\r\nOf course this anime has flaws, it by no means is a 10. I felt the adaptation rushed or fumbled the ball on some of the jokes compared to the manga. One joke with a truck needed an explanation and will leave you confused unless you have read the manga or know road laws. I also found issue with the pace at times but they wanted to stretch time between jokes to keep things grounded so it\u2019s not exactly a flaw but more a nitpick. \\n\\n\r\nNow I\u2019ve said a lot about how this show is humorous as any review will, but also grounded. The show captures what people picture sometimes as a crazy college life. I can\u2019t recommend this show enough to everyone although I know it\u2019s not for everyone. Kind of like diving to be honest. \\n\\n\r\n9/10 One of the funniest things ever",

There is hardly any diving in this whole anime most of the time it is just them drinking and stripping. Imo I think it deserves the school life genre cause most of the time we are at their college or seeing them throwing parties to get drunk.\r\n The characters of this anime are not divided into too much.

            "content": "Watching this anime is one of the things I eagerly look forward to every week. Its a great stress reliever and I plan on reading the manga as soon as the last episode airs next week. I hear its more funnier than the anime which I understand since they have to fit so much in 24 minutes in the anime. But I would be sad if the anime doesn't get a season 2 since most animes don't really get a season 2 and stop at 12 episodes. This anime especially considering how funny it is, is very deserving of season 2. Hope that happens.This anime is easily the best comedy anime of 2018 imo. XD\ufeff",
