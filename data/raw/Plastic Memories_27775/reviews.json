            "content": "When I first started watching Plastic Memories back in April I was immediately very impressed by it because the first episode was simply amazing. It forecasted an original anime with beautiful artwork, an ambient atmosphere, likeable characters and a lot of tragic drama. At the time, I really thought that it would become the next hidden gem, and the biggest surprise of the season.\r\nAs it turned out however, Plastic Memories instead ended up being one of the most misleading anime I've seen in quite some time. Unlike what the opening seemed to imply, in reality the show is mostly a cute and light-hearted slice oflife comedy with quite a lot of romance in it. Now this doesn't mean the anime turned out poorly in the end, quite the opposite in fact, but it never reached the level that I thought it would have reached in the beginning.\\n\\n\r\nThe story takes place in a future world where humanoid androids are a common part of human society. The androids, named \"Giftias\", are fully equipped with human emotions, and help their respective human owners however possible. But the Giftias have very limited lifespans, and thus they need to be taken out of commission before too long. Enter Tsukasa, an 18-year-old boy whom is offered a position at the SAI Corporation; a group responsible for retrieving Giftias who are approaching the ends of their lifespans, and eventually scrap them. Right next to him, we have his fellow co-worker: the incredibly cute and loveable Isla, who is actually a Giftia herself despite her position. The two of them form a team by order of their boss, and they consequently start working together, socializing together, and of course fall in love with each other.\\n\\n\r\nThis is how Plastic Memories suddenly becomes something totally different from what it originally promised to be. Despite the premise, the anime is in fact not about the retrieval of various Giftias, nor is it about the SAI Corporation itself or any of the other people working there. Plastic Memories is about Tsukasa, and it is about Isla. That is all. And honestly, that's totally fine in and of itself because they make up one of the cutest couples I've seen in ages, and watching their awkward romance is surprisingly enjoyable no matter how much you see of it. But for a lot of people, this was nothing more than wasted potential because the cool and interesting premise of the story itself is heavily neglected in the process. For everyone who wanted to see a melancholic story about the tragedy of having to say goodbye to your loved ones and how they deal with it... you're probably going to be left disappointed, because Plastic Memories doesn't actually focus very much on that at all other than right at the very beginning. The only character the show ever really emphasizes this point for is Isla herself as her lifespan is of course also very limited due to being a Giftia, but for everyone else... not very much.\\n\\n\r\nHowever if you can get past the fact that the show is more or less in disguise and try to see it for what it actually is (in other words a romantic slice of life story), then suddenly Plastic Memories is a very enjoyable anime again. Why? Because it actually has *proper romantic development*. Quite a lot of it in fact. This is not the kind of show which ends with a confession in the final episode and nothing more; no, there are actually things happening from very early on in a romantic sense, which is something that is unfortunately very rare in today's anime. Especially seeing Plastic Memories airing in the same season as Nisekoi was pretty amusing to me; they're like night and day in comparison as far romantic progression goes.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Plastic Memories is an anime which you will probably be given a very different impression of depending on your expectations on it. Is it a good anime? Yes, but it's a completely different anime from what you're most likely anticipating when you start watching it. That doesn't make it a bad show per se, but it feels a bit like false marketing. It's up to each and every viewer to do their best at adapting to what the anime has to offer.\\n\\n\r\nIf you're looking for a deeply touching and emotional melodrama like Clannad: After Story or Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso, then sorry to say but you're looking in the wrong place. But for a cute yet beautiful story about young love, it's hard to find a better example than Plastic Memories.",

            "content": "Human/technology integration has always been a fascinating topic to me. Just thinking of humanity's next leap towards further development being aided by biomechanical intervention could cause even the cynical-minded to wax philosophical. It's a topic that's inspired countless debate and discussion for many; redefining the idea of what it means to be human with the continuously blurred line between man and machine. And what better way to view this delicate balancing act than by seeing it unfold through the guise of a romance. It's an interesting \"what if\" scenario, that, to those who share my fascination with the subject, could find many interesting facets onexploring that very idea. \\n\r\nCan such a nebulous idea of \"true love\" be found with a man-made being? Where do we draw the line between augmented reality and primal attraction? Many different forms of media have tried to tackle this intriguing concept; from movies like 2013's \"Her\" and 2015's \"Ex Machina,\" to novels like Jonathan Lethem's \"As She Climbed Across the Table.\" There are even a few anime titles that tackled this subject as well, such as Eve No Jikan, Armitage III, Chobits and many others. When this topic is done right, it can be a highly rewarding experience, leaving the viewer with something to wrap their heads around.\\n\r\nSo when I sat down to watch Plastic Memories, a show that had the right ingredients to make something truly thought provoking, just flush this potential down the toilet, for what essentially was forced melodrama... let's just say I wasn't a happy camper when everything was said and done. Under normal circumstances, I would categorize shows with Plastic Memories's setup as a bait-and-switch, but from the way it was presented, it never seemed to care about, or even acknowledge the ideas it could have implemented. What we have here instead was a cookie cutter rom-com that was oblivious to its own potential.\\n\\n\r\nSo no, I didn't get what I wanted, but does that render the rom-com that took its place bad?... Unfortunately yes, it does. It's a show that forces a catch-22 on the audience with an inevitable conclusion spurred on by contrived logistics. It suffered from heavy-handed manipulation at the cost of proper buildup and engagement, which was made all the more noticeable when you take into consideration the setting the show presents everything in. \\n\r\nIn the future, sentient androids known as \"Giftias\" has become incorporated into everyday society. However, like everything else that has a beginning, so too does the Giftias have a limited lifespan as well, with about a decade or so of functionality before they are decommissioned, resulting in their memories being erased (which is the android's equivalency of death). This, of course, becomes the core focus of the show, as we're introduced to our protagonist Tsukasa, a human, who finds himself involved with one of these Giftias named Isla. And from there onward, the show chronicles their daily interaction and growing relationship. And as you would guess, it becomes a tale of a fleeting would-be romance with only one possible outcome.\\n\\n\r\nWhen trying to present a romance, there must be proper interaction between the main love interests in order to sell their position as lovers. We as viewers need to see this bond slowly form, see the chemistry that they share, and the mannerisms that they portray when expressing themselves to each other. To get down to brass tacks, we as viewers need to be convinced of their validity as a couple for it to feel organic. If this isn't handled properly, it can cause the relationship and development to feel forced or manipulated. This is Plastic Memories 1st noticeable blunder. It tries to build this chemistry on a premise that just screams victimizing; with a character predestined to be terminated from an expiration date, a protagonist that makes no visible effort in repealing the outcome, and a romance bound to go nowhere because of it. It isn't bittersweet nor is it heart-wrenching since the reason these androids expire is contrived and contradictory to the world setting presented. How may you ask? Well, let's explore the ill-defined logic the show tries to spoon feed us.\\n\\n\r\nWe're made to believe that this show takes place in a future where the creation and distribution of androids are a fairly commonplace occurrence. In other words, it's an advance society that's leagues ahead of us in terms of technological breakthrough and scientific advancement. But at the same time, the show wants us to believe that they have no methods of storing or switching memory from one device to another. And I shouldn't have to spell it out but do you see how this nonsensical explanation doesn't work? A society advance enough to have androids with empathy, but not advance enough to store memory or transfer it? So if you own a USB flash drive, then congrats, you've officially surpassed this society's current intellect. And that is just the tip of the iceberg when talking about this show's implausible setting. Later on, we find out that after an android passes its expiration date and isn't decommissioned, they take on a savage state, becoming dangerously violent against humans, escalating to the point of murder  (in other words, they go ape-shit). Which begs the question, why in the hell would anyone endorse a machine that can go \"Terminator\" on citizens when they lose their memory? It's unfathomable to think any governing body with a modicum of common sense would allow such a hazardous time bomb to be integrated into society. There was even an episode dedicated to showing how such a terrible downside could reek havoc, or even worse, be exploited as a weapon, but like the setting it's a part of, it was never explored beyond that. It was simply brought up and never mentioned again by the next episode just so they could allow for more rom-com moments to continue undisturbed. Just look out for the 'Psycho-Pass' episode, you'll know it when you see it. \\n\\n\r\nTsukasa and Isla both work at the same job, and it's also the place they 1st make contact with each other. From what you can easily read in the synopsis, they both work for the Terminal Service Department: a subdivision of the larger company responsible for the distribution and recall of androids. They're tasked with retrieving androids that are approaching their expected expiration date from their owners. This, of course, brings up yet another question; why is the task of retrieving androids so primitive and counterproductive? Like I've stated, these androids are like ticking time bombs with the added bonus of being empathetic. You would think something as important as this would be tasked to a more organized unit, but what we're introduced to instead is a motley crew of quirky characters that only share one personality trait and act so outlandish that entrusting them with such a task is almost ludicrous. It's like handing police duty over to the circus. It's like the creators were dead-set on an end goal and didn't care how little sense it made getting there. On a whole, the sci-fi elements of this show were never explored or utilized. It was simply used for flavoring, and it quickly became apparent that they didn't care about common sense when they duct-taped the narrative and setting together.\\n\\n\r\nThe relationship was also diminished by the fact that 3/4ths of the show's run-time were dedicated to slapstick comedy and silly misunderstandings. Half of it was wasted away where it could have been used to develop the relationship between the characters, which was made even worse given the short episode count the show was already working with. While I'm not the biggest fan of shows like Clannad or Toradora, I at least acknowledge that it did this aspect correctly. It utilized its run-time by building the relationship between the characters, either by their direct contact with each other or the indirect result of their influence on each other. It allowed us as an audience to grow attached to their interaction and relationship.\\n\\n\r\nMost of the characters, like I've already stated, are just a range of archetypes. From your tsunderes to your beta-male, they all follow one-note traits and won't be remembered for anything else. This also applies to our two main characters. Tsukasa is as generic as a protagonist can get, ripped right out of the pages of clich\u00e9-land. You've seen his type many times before, and to be quite frank about it, he's indistinguishable from the lot of them. Isla is yet another Rei Ayanami clone, completely packaged with the silver hair, red eyes, and the signature porcelain complexion. Dull, monotone and devoid of personality, the only good thing I can say about her is that she truly acts like an android. Outside of the main cast, we're occasionally introduced to androids and their masters that the team has to retrieve. But they're introduction is done more so for forced \"feels\" than for actual world building. Just toss in a sappy backstory and an unavoidable conclusion and it really becomes more annoying than anything. \\n\\n\r\nAnd really, that's the main problem with this show in a nutshell: it's constantly trying to get the audience to care but doesn't seem to have any idea how to do so without coming across as fake. It's a show that forcefully tugs at your heart strings while thinking that people will easily be duped into falling for it. It thinks that simply playing melancholic music and animating tear ducts is more than enough to fool viewers, while forgetting that genuine character investment is what allows the audience to sympathize with hardships. And who knows, maybe this falsehood would fool some into buying the creator's snake oil. There are certainly viewers out there willing to suspend their disbelief, regardless of the amount of mental gymnastics required to do so. But for those well-versed enough to see past the smoke and mirrors, it's a detracting quality that causes the show and its conflict to implode on itself. \\n\\n\r\nThe art and animation for Plastic Memories were above average and made the whole experience better than it would have been without it. It was bright, vivid and used a broad range of color palettes to convey whatever mood or tone they were going for. While it felt overdone at times, there were moments where it truly shined and help to sell the scene at hand; most notably the show's finale episodes and epilog. While the art and animation served their purpose, the character designs were a hit or miss. On one hand, a few had distinct features about them, but a lot were also cookie-cutter in a bad way as well. It helps to better personify their characteristics, but when they lack dimension and personality, it made them feel like carbon copies of other characters in the same vein as them. There was also moments where the show paid direct homage to Evangelion with certain scenes and shot compositions, which, while being a fun little tribute, didn't serve any purpose whatsoever. At best, they were Easter eggs for those that caught on to them. \\n\r\nThe soundtrack was a mixture of pop and electronica flavoring. It was \"fluffy\" during the comedic bits and took on a more somber tone during the show's more \"emotional\" moments. While there weren't any noteworthy tracks, it was fine and served its purpose. Average but effective. The opening and ending themes were both fine and easy listens. Nothing that might stick with you but catchy and worked in unison with the show.\\n\\n\r\nLike most titles of this nature, my problem doesn't stem from what it's trying to do, my problem comes from how poorly it goes about attempting it. If a show is aiming to get me as a viewer, emotionally invested, I expect it to do so in a manner that doesn't distract from its target intent. If I'm duped and fall for it, despite my better knowledge of its intent, I will credit it for its efforts. However, if I'm viewing the show and have to signal the \"bullshit\" flag every other minute, then as far as I'm concerned, that anime failed at its job. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 4/10\\n\\n\r\nMy enjoyment of Plastic Memories was intermittent at best, but for the most part, the show was a face-palming experience. Because of the sloppy portrayal of its themes and forced melodrama, there was no engagement to speak of. The ending was decent, but the journey to said ending was buffoonish at best and can't be overlooked. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 4/10\\n\\n\r\nPlastic Memories was an uninspired and underwhelming experience. It had the opportunity to craft a decent romance, or even better, a good sci-fi tale, but it did neither and ended up falling short of the mark. While some might find it touching, I simply couldn't buy into the dilemma for the reasons I've stated. If you decide to watch this show, do so with low expectations, for whatever it tried to do, have been done to a much higher and better degree somewhere else.",

            "content": "**SPOILER FREE REVIEW**\r\nWhile Plastic Memories had the potential to be a unique and intelligent show, it instead managed to encompass all of the things that ruin dramas and cause them to fail every time. Forced plot devices that make no sense? Check. Inopportune comedy that ruins the show\u2019s tone? Check. Shallow characters defined entirely by their archetypes or tragic backstories? Check. While this anime showed flashes of good ideas and has its moments, its poor execution dooms it to be lost among the sea of poorly written, mediocre emotion porn.\r\nSynopsis: In the near future, technology has allowed for the invention humanoid-like robots known as \u201cgiftias\u201d,who look, talk, feel, and emote exactly like actual humans do. The catch is that they can only operate for a little over a decade before they must be shut down, resulting in the loss of all their memories. The story follows Tsukasa, a human, and his relationship with Isla, a giftia.\\n\\n\r\nThe biggest and most obvious problems with this anime stem from its forced and melodramatic plot devices that range from just plain stupid to cringeworthy. For example, when Tsukasa and Isla first become partners at work, we are suddenly told that this means they have no choice but to live together! Because that makes total sense and is definitely not a lazy plot device to provide a setup for bonding and slice of life shenanigans! The other one that sticks out is the big \u201creveal\u201d they make about what happens to giftias if they aren\u2019t properly retrieved, which defies all notions of common sense and even basic science. That\u2019s especially bad given that this show has a science-fiction setting for some reason. In fact\u2026 was there ANY reason for there to be robots in the first place? Literally the only difference between a human and a giftia is that giftias lose their memories after a certain period of time, so now that I think about it, that makes the entire sci-fi setting and concept of giftias in general completely pointless and nothing more than yet another contrived plot device for drama\u2019s sake. They certainly didn\u2019t explore any sort of difference between the two life forms; it\u2019s very much an accepted fact that giftias are equal to humans, so why was everyone not just regular people to begin with? Was there no other scenario they could come with that incorporated death-like elements, like, y\u2019know, DEATH? It\u2019s this kind of thing that makes the show very difficult to take seriously.\\n\\n\r\nThere are other major issues with the show\u2019s plot, namely how laughably predictable it is. You can LITERALLY guess every major plot point of the entire show by the end of the first episode, and I\u2019m not exaggerating, because I literally did. I just kept waiting and waiting for something that I didn\u2019t see coming a mile away to happen, and with the exception of a single contrived plot device which I already mentioned (a plot device that doesn\u2019t even lead to anything\u2026), it simply never does. Now, one thing that I will give the show credit for is that is has some genuinely sweet moments. The final stretch of the show made me feel something, at least. However, then it just sort of\u2026 ends. And it ends, like, EXACTLY how you would expect it to. I guess what I\u2019m trying to get at here is that it left me with a feeling of \u201cSo what?\u201d I mean, you told one of the most obvious and straightforward stories I\u2019ve ever seen, so much so that I could have stopped watching after a single episode and gotten the gist of it, so what did you put into your show that justified the time it took to watch another 12 episodes? Were there any meaningful themes? No. Did the characters learn anything or change in any meaningful way? No. So why would anyone EVER want to watch the entirety of this show? *Sigh, I don\u2019t know if this is making sense. Let\u2019s just move on:\\n\\n\r\nThe last aspect of the plot that really bothered me was the random comedy that completely ruined the show\u2019s tone by being interspersed throughout parts that are supposed to be serious. To give an example, the first episode of this show really hooked me. At the very end of the episode, there was a well-executed and genuinely emotional scene that was actually getting to me. I\u2019m the kind of person who almost never gets legitimately emotional when watching a TV show, but this one scene was just hitting all the right notes for me. By the time it was over, I thought we had an extremely promising show on our hands. Now, guess what this beautiful, emotional scenario was immediately followed by: \u2026A BATHROOM JOKE. That\u2019s right. No relevance, no context. They just decided to throw in a random bathroom joke and ended the episode on a ridiculous note instead of a serious and powerful one. That, to me, is a decent microcosm of the entire show. Every time you might be about to get invested in a serious scene, WHAM! Random, generic, slice-of-life comedy comes out of nowhere and blindsides the plot. It\u2019s just a disastrous display of a lack of tonal understanding and, ergo, bad writing. \\n\\n\r\nI think the real thing that would have saved Plastic Memories for me was if the characters were given any form of depth whatsoever. Tsukasa, our protagonist, is a cardboard cutout straight from the generic, beta, male protagonists factory. My god, there was, nothing, NOTHING unique about him. I don\u2019t think I\u2019m alone in the sediment that I don\u2019t care about other people\u2019s relationships if I don\u2019t know them, and I certainly didn\u2019t feel like I knew Tsukasa, so how am I supposed to give a damn about him and Isla\u2019s relationship? Speaking of Isla, talk about yet another shallow character. I put her squarely in the mary-sue category, given that she is an idealization of a pure, innocent, kawaii waifu with no real flaws whatsoever. Can she be funny at times? Sure. Does that mean I at all cared about her? No. As for the side characters? Boring. Bland. Generic. They are all basic stereotypes with nothing to distinguish them. I know they attempt to give a few of the side characters a backstory, but the backstories don\u2019t actually accomplish anything other than just being sad. They do absolutely nothing to add a dimension to the character they are attached to and none of them are given any form of a story arc. I\u2019ve seen casts like this a million times. The characters, to me, might be the biggest reason the show failed. I might have been able to overlook all the previously mentioned problems with the plot if this show actually gave me a reason to care about the couple of Tsukasa and Isla, but they simply don\u2019t.\\n\\n\r\nPretty much the only thing I can definitively say I liked about Plastic Memories was the animation. It\u2019s pretty fluid, but what really got me was the cinematography and shot composition. Besides the number of Evangelion references they threw in, there were a lot of well thought out and extremely well directed scenes that actually succeeded in conveying information and emotion without words. That\u2019s VERY difficult for a show to do, so kudos for that. The settings were always detailed and full of bright colors as well. The world looked really cool, which is part of the reason I wanted them to actually tell me something about it. Like, literally anything would have been nice. Instead, the writing is so barebones that it could have taken place pretty much anywhere else, and that brings us full circle, doesn\u2019t it?\\n\\n\r\nI wanted to like Plastic Memories. Really, I did. It didn\u2019t have to be some complex, philosophical inquiry into the definition of humanity and how it differs from artificial intelligence (which is the kind of show that many expected it to be); I would have been totally content with it just being a drama if they actually gave me a reason to care about its characters. If they didn\u2019t ruin every moment they ever created with inopportune comedy. If they didn\u2019t make the plot so damn predictable. If their plot devices weren\u2019t so incredibly contrived. There were simply too many major problems to overlook, and that forces me to make the sad conclusion that Plastic Memories is a massive missed opportunity for what could have been a really enjoyable original anime. It lacked direction and coherent writing on all fronts, and I cannot recommend it to anybody.",

These exist for the purpose of human interaction and wish fulfillment, targeting those in need of company of some sort. After around 9 years,Giftias can no longer function and they must be shut down, terminating their memories. The story mainly revolves around 18 year old Tsukasa Mizugaki, a human, who along with a Giftia named Isla, joins the SAI Corporation and is placed in the division in charge of retrieving the Giftias. \\n\\n\r\nGiftia\u2019s that fail to be retrieved will eventually expire and turn into a wild savage machine which they label as \u201cWanderer\u201d. If technology has advanced so far that they can create artificial humans, there would be no reason why there should a 9 year limit, nor why they haven\u2019t made any attempt to increase it like an extra memory card or something? The show never bothers to go into and explain that. It\u2019s only clear that 9 years\u2019 time the androids that they hand out will go hostile and attack anything in site. Good writing. They should implement cloud storage to expand the memory space, as increasing the limit would yield a huge profit margin for companies with proper marketing strategies. Even just transferring memories from one robot to another should be possible, they are machines after all. We have this technology now, it\u2019s unthinkable to imagine that we couldn\u2019t utilize it in the future. There is no reason to suspend this belief for this ridiculous premise. I can\u2019t even fathom why they would distribute androids that could possibly attack people in the first place. And despite all of these complications, the show just chooses to just stick to the romantic comedy aspects the entire time which makes the sci-fi elements meaningless.\\n\\n\r\nThe series focuses on the relationship between Tsukasa and Isla, so at first glance it seems like it will delve into the ethics of Giftia and human interaction. However, terrible execution renders this attempt at a moral irrelevant, as any point they were trying to make was invalidated by the constant tone shifts and forced drama that was impossible to empathize with. \\n\\n\r\nWhen I first had started Plastic Memories, the first episode presented all of these themes and ideas about cherishing memories; but it had a flaw that most dramas suffer from, poorly timed humor where it doesn\u2019t belong. There was a sad moment when they had to retrieve a loli Giftia from her grandmother; it was supposed to be a sad moment but I couldn\u2019t take it seriously because the sad tone was abruptly shifted to an out of place comedy routine. The drama is laughable and becomes out of place when scenes before and afterwards are inserted with poorly timed comedy. In fact the tone shifts are a common recurrence that continues for the rest of the show.\\n\r\nIn episode 3, Tsukasa moves in with his work partner Isla and wants to grow closer to her, attempting various methods to get Isla to open up, which leaves us with a wasted episode of rinse and repeat clich\u00e9 slapstick humor. A majority of the episodes consisted of these dumb comedy skits; whenever something serious is happening, the very next scene presents a gag that kills the tension. All that is achieved in this case is a lot wasted episodes. Instead of spending time building and developing an atmosphere for empathy to establish a justifiable drama, we instead get a 60/40 split of slapstick comedy and forced drama. The theme of cherishing memories that the show tries to present is lost in translation due to rubbish execution. \\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS\\n\r\nThe characters were bland and dull archetypes, including the beta protagonist who exists for the purpose of self-insertion and whose only notable traits include being \u201cnice\u201d and a pushover. the  typical Kanade rip-off who undergoes the standard kuudere \u201cdevelopment\u201d, the textbook tsundere, the drunkard, the dumb blonde bombshell, the nonchalant ladies\u2019 man, and the prepubescent boy who you\u2019ve never sexualized, not even once. This is a cast of unoriginal characters with no depth and minimal development that we will instantly forget about. Since the characters are archetypes it makes it difficult to provide empathy towards them. \\n\\n\r\nANIMATION\\n\r\nArt and animation did a fairly good job. The original character designs were done by okiura, the one responsible for the art and character designs for IS: Infinite Stratos. Although the designs themselves aren\u2019t anything too special, looking at Michiru reminds me a lot of Asuka from the Evangelion series. The animation itself did a good job, it was consistent and it never had a massive dip in quality.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND\\n\r\nFor the sound it was fitting, the OST itself had a couple tracks I found to be lovely. The opening and ending theme are pretty good, they\u2019re fitting for the show. They\u2019re catchy and memorable, nothing amazing but I did like them.  \\n\\n\r\nOVERALL\\n\r\nPlastic Memories was something I honestly thought had potential. I really wanted to like it. I was even pretty satisfied with the first episode despite the flaws it had toward the end. Overtime though I just couldn\u2019t ignore the fact that these flaws kept reoccurring throughout the show. At least the ending wasn\u2019t bullshit, but it was exactly what was expected making it predictable from episode one. I would be lying if I said I never enjoyed myself, but I found myself to be bothered more and more if anything. It had good ideas but it didn\u2019t mean anything and the premise was ruined because the execution was abysmal. The show\u2019s theme exploration was weak and the humor killed any of the attempted drama. If you want to watch something that is similar but is actually good then just check out Eve no Jikan instead.\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Have you ever seen an anime with a premise so uninspired and lacking in imagination that you know it's doomed for failure before it even gets a chance to show off? However, because you're an anime fan who finds it pointless to just watch stuff you like, you continue on out of sheer curiosity regarding how badly it'll be handled, only to realize you underestimated the depths a man can take to stretch said weak premise out in order to fit a full-series length? That's pretty much how I watch practically 90% of the anime I keep up with on a regular basis, and PlasticMemories happens to be one of said percentage.\\n\\n\r\nYes, trying to demand ambition from Dogakobo is like begging a grizzly bear to save you from hitmen despite the fact that he's a fucking corpse because you thought poisoning his berry patch would have been a funny to make on Facebook (you monster), so I wasn't too surprised that the show turned out as inane as it did. But whilst I've yet to meet a colleague who disagreed with me, the semi-good reaction this show has been getting from the overall community is more baffling than an Australian politician's general incompetence at being human. I know a lot of anime fans love \u201cfeels\u201d and all, which makes these sort of shows both easy and difficult to criticize. Because whilst it\u2019s easy to say what doesn\u2019t work about \u2018em, said method of storytelling is ultimately a style, the same way all music and humor is a style at the end of the day. It either works for you or it doesn\u2019t, making any criticism you dish out being rendered ultimately pointless by the fact that your brain and childhood just isn\u2019t hardwired to get it.\\n\\n\r\nThe thing is though, even by those incredibly irrational standards, Plastic Memories is pretty damn awful right down to the very concept. In some distant future exists humanoid androids called \u201cGifita\u201d who only have a fixed lifespan of ten years, because any longer than that and they become more rabid than a pack of raccoons after being sprayed by a skunk. Just before said lifespan expires, they are retrieved by a group of \"Retrievers\" in order to be put to sleep, basically making them futuristic dogs except with the ability to talk and act out your pedophilic tendencies towards if you so choose. Except the show isn't really even about how dog retrieval life is like. It's about the actual partings and what they mean to people, with most of said story being told through an office worker and his \"actually dog\" partner. Reminds me of that awful era when Dogakobo was releasing visual novel adaptations that had decent premises on paper and proceeded to ignore \u2018em completely in favor of either two things: shallow melodramatic shit and shallow melodramatic shit with poorly animated fight scenes.\\n\\n\r\nIncidentally, the office workers in this anime look pretty damn young, don't they? I'm not expecting a huge growth spurt or anything after you leave high school, but the younger characters all look and act like the kouhai of the middle schoolers in Evangelion whilst the older ones are pretty much the grown-up Evangelion characters with some of the blandest designs you'll ever see. It would have been an improvement to just have them all wear black face.\\n\\n\r\nThe anime is written by Naotaka Hayashi, whose previous works were about taking high-concept sci-fi and proceeding to just throw it in the background whilst focusing on characterization that's basically just putting a bunch of nerd tropes together and giving them one gimmick that's not even all that important to the story half the time. But if those semicolon adaptations are the equivalent of a romance film starring Ryan O'Neal, Plastic Memories is the direct-to-video sequel that was never made because it was too stupid for the world to see. And it\u2019s not just because I find the show overly manipulative. In fact, I think detractors in general overuse that criticism, never taking into consideration why and how something can even be considered overly manipulative in the first place. You can\u2019t just say \u201cI hate manipulation\u201d because as I myself keep saying, ALL drama is manipulative. Even Mufasa\u2019s death in The Lion King is manipulative, and it\u2019s still considered by many to be one of the best achievements in western animation to this day. \\n\\n\r\nBut whilst it wasn\u2019t the only reason why said scene was powerful for most people, at the end of the day, you can\u2019t deny that The Lion King in general is a big film with grand ambitions beyond an annoying Jonathan Taylor-Thomas character crying over his dead daddy. Plastic Memories, on the other hand, is literally all about some bland guy we don\u2019t even learn anything about getting sad about the fact that his dog is dying. Except in order to increase the manipulation, said dog is actually a small moe girl. I don\u2019t claim to be an expert of the genre, but practically every single story about a dog from Old Yeller to that Silverfang anime from the 80s has always been sad, because they always involve parting with \u2018em and...well...is there any way to spin a happy tale out of that? What matters is how you use said tragedy from representing growth to...erm...representing growth, and Plastic Memories doesn\u2019t even do that.\\n\\n\r\nBy the end of this incredibly padded story - because someone thought that repeating the same toothless joke up to three times an episode at minimum and a random incident involving some black market dealers that\u2019s never brought up again counts as a legitimate way to achieve a one-cour length from this - you know nothing new about anything. Only the main couple is important in the grand scheme of things, and they never grow up from where they started - something they were in dire need of because they have less maturity than a middle school kid who believes that Santa Claus is real and looks like Elmo from Sesame Street. There\u2019s an ambiguous closing scene involving a Giftia whose face isn\u2019t shown after a short time-skip following the final climax. And no matter how you spin it, said scene doesn\u2019t make any sense whatsoever. \\n\\n\r\nIf the Giftia\u2019s body is whose I think it is, that would ruin whatever character journey you can wring out of the main. And if it\u2019s not, then what exactly is the dude going to apply in regards to this new being? The show refuses to accomplish more than the very basics of what you can achieve with visual novel-style writing and tragedy stories in general to the point that I\u2019m practically convinced at this point that Naotaka Hayashi is less of a real person and more of an auto-generating machine when someone wants to release a VN-style anime. Bland nice guy schmuck? Check. Little moe love interest who can\u2019t take care of herself? Check. Tsundere who not-so-secretly helps the couple whilst desiring \u201cbland nice guy\u201d cock? Check. Potentially interesting world buried under banal personal problems? Check. Reminding us that Evangelion exists? Every anime does that these days, but check anyways.\\n\\n\r\nAs a result, no one from the creators to the actual characters this show is supposed to be centered on seem to be into anything, and that\u2019s pretty much why Plastic Memories fails. Even if you ignore the cardboard stereotypes, the cloying melodrama, the flat visuals, and forgettable music, this show just doesn\u2019t accomplish anything it sets out to do at all. The decision to set the anime in a futuristic worlds adds nothing to the story, the working environment adds nothing to the characters, and whatever moral I\u2019m supposed to get out of the story is buried under a lot of crappy cliches. Even Dreamworks\u2019 movies have made their agendas clear underneath their crappy pop-culture referencing and animation hiccups. And when you have less going for you than Bee Movie and Shrek 3...well then I\u2019ve got no more words to waste on you. You sad, pity party-seeking loser.",

            "content": "Watching Plastic Memories is like taking a science class. I don\u2019t why but my professor used to assign these experiments for us to do and when we finish, he always asked what we learned. Plastic Memories has this experimental feel when it takes its story in a sci-fi direction with a utopia-like setting. In a place (I assume a fictional alternate Japan) where robotics has made advancements to a point where we humans rely on them, there\u2019s all sorts of possibilities. \r\nDirected by Yoshiyuki Fujiwara with Naotaka Hayashi writing the script, Plastic Memories is an original anime not based off any material. There\u2019s a plusfor this as it will leave the audience to expect the unexpected. Also, it\u2019s studio Dogakobo\u2019s first original work. Recently they have been involved in some slice of life anime series that may or may not left an impression. Nonetheless, Plastic Memories combines element of sci-fi, drama, and slice of life to craft this futuristic story \u2013 one where humans and robots co-exist as a sort of experiment.\\n\\n\r\nA lot needs to be learned from the very few episodes. In fact, I think the first episode is one of the most important one of the series as it establishes many mechanics that carries their purpose throughout the whole duration. First, we have Giftia, a term to describe biological androids with capability to interact, understand, and function with humans. They even have emotional appeals to as seen constantly throughout the show. What makes this setup interesting is that they have a mind of their own rather than being just a mere program. Another interesting and more important element is that Gifitias have limited lifespans. According to the series, they can live up to approximately 81920 (9 years and 3 months). So when thinking about this, it can be made for a fact that the show spells out relationships that are doomed to end. What I find interesting about this addition is that the experiences the show tries to deliver will make more impact. And in a way, that\u2019s something to think about.\\n\\n\r\nAnyone who has seen Chobits or a show about human-robot relationships may be familiar with this premise. The main male protagonist Tsukasa Mizugaki becomes involved with SAI Corporation, a place where Gifitias are designed and made. His job is to actually retrieve Gifitias that are near the end of their lifespan. I guess what happens next could be fate or something but he is partnered with Isla, a Gifitia who is supposed to be \u201cexperienced\u201d in doing the task. Little did we know\u2026\\n\\n\r\nIn essence, Plastic Memories offers a little bit of everything except for giant robot wars or an android rebellion. No, what I find this series attractive in a few ways is how it handles each episode to add a little bit more and more to what it started off. Every episode shows development for our characters. In particular, Tsukasa and Isla\u2019s relationship is a core element that seems to push forward the story. From the beginning, they are not particular close. Tsukasa is a newbie so he lacks experience while Isla herself also doesn\u2019t seem to be skillful at retrieving Gifitias. So what do we have now? An unbalanced pair? Somewhat like that but there\u2019s also an odd connection between the two. The pair has one human and one android capable of interacting in human-like behaviors. They are not programmed to act like zombies but instead actually has genuine emotions. In general, we see this throughout the story from a variety of perspectives. Especially in some of the later episodes, there are cases where Gifitias and their partners refuses to surrender themselves despite knowing that an everlasting relationship is non-existent. So when it comes to Tsukasa and Isla, it\u2019s also obvious that one day, their relationship will cease to exist. That brings back to what I mentioned before as the show tests their relationship each episode. It\u2019s kind of like an experiment where both characters learns about each other and perhaps even themselves. \\n\\n\r\nWhile Tsukasa and Isla are the main focus of the show, there\u2019s also other characters that play meaningful roles. Michiru, another employee and superior of Isla, brings into the show a harsher reality of their jobs. In essence, her past shows that violence and requisition also becomes part of their society when Gifitas are forcefully terminated when due time comes. In one of the mid-season episodes, it breaks down the barriers of lightheartedness and shows a darker side of their society. Then, there are other characters such as Zack, Kazuki, Yasutaka, among others. While their roles aren\u2019t as significant as the main leads, they do also bring in a mixture of drama and comedy into the series. \\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of comedy, I have to say that Plastic Memories is a hit or miss. From the beginning, it can be pleasing especially with some of the jokes and dialogues between the main characters. Then, it gets repetitive. I mean repetitive as in the same type of recycled themes that you may find in harem-esque shows. While this series isn\u2019t a harem, there are times when it resorts to similar antics. Also, timing is a key and only on occasions do I find some of the comedy appropriate as the series progresses. In short, a middling entertainment is how I can describe the comedy. On the other hand, there\u2019s appreciation and effort given to the drama elements. Hints of romance are also evident while we see how much Tsukasa and Isla\u2019s relationship develops. And while this isn\u2019t a rom-com shoujo, there are moments that feels like so that\u2019s nicely paced and well-acted. Otherwise, this isn\u2019t at a level that will get so complex where you\u2019ll spill your popcorn. The story itself also has a rather strange pacing at times. Sometimes, the standalone episodes feels little more than a waste of time while other others has a distinctive way of story building. Neither are a major impact to the overall series in general though.\\n\\n\r\nHonestly, the artwork feels smooth. It works because of its charming visual feat and texture the studio puts into the character designs. The watercolor-like atmosphere also paints and communicates its point across; to get let the audience feel the portrayal of its setting. In fact, the setting of the series itself has credible artwork with its futuristic architecture, machinery, and of course the Gafitia. While there\u2019s nothing special to say about Tsukasa, his partner Isla does have a few peculiar characteristics. Her expressions of a hybrid stoic/emotional/cluelessness can get the audience to be quite curious of her. Other characters also shows a good amount of texture with their design. It\u2019s interesting to see how the Gafitia resemble so much like humans in physical design despite knowing that they have limited lifespans, far less than our own.\\n\\n\r\nMusic has a stronger appeal to a show like this. It\u2019s important to match the atmosphere to create a sensation and I think the show nailed it with its OST. Yokoyama Masaru (Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso, Joshiraku) composes of the music which delivers its purpose \u2013 creating a feel of sensation. I also have to give some credit to the voice actors and actresses for portraying the characters. It\u2019s not always easy to play the role of a non-human character but Isla in particular has a voice that feels welcoming to this show. Similarly, the OP and ED theme songs are coordinated with a smooth delicacy and bits of charm.\\n\\n\r\nIn retrospect, Plastic Memories has a feeling of sensitivity behind it. It told a human story about a biological android and how Isla adapted and learned from a human. There are times when it can make you genuinely feel moved by its storytelling while other times are easily forgettable. I think most of that applies to the recurring jokes for the latter as this series\u2019 comedy really feels lackluster. The romance itself, while innocent and charming, suffers from pacing. You\u2019ll also have to keep an eye on the lookout for a lot of the mechanics that makes this series possible. However, this show does represent a cutting edge of sci-fi fiction with a good dose of slice of life. Life is just seriously full of surprises at times.",

            "content": "If the memories you made while living faded after death, would you rather have not lived at all? Or would you cherish those memories to the very end? \r\nPlastic Memories is a show that, while looking mediocre and somewhat generic on the surface, is willing to tackle some pretty heavy themes.\r\nWARNING: This review will contain minor spoilers. Please keep in mind that it is difficult to write a wholesome review without revealing some of what happens. \r\nStory- 9\r\nThe story can be considered as something that you're going to end up seeing a lot. Set in the future, Plastic Memories follows the protagonist, Tsukasa Mizugaki, who,due to circumstances, was not given the chance to enter college. As a result, he ends up getting a job retrieving Giftia. Giftia being a special type of Android loaded with a synthetic soul that display almost all the traits a living human does. You've almost definitely heard something resembling this plot before, although this show does it better, due to one plot point. The Giftia have an extremely limited lifespan of roughly 9 years and 4 months. And after that lifespan reaches 0 hours, the Giftia loses all personality and memories.\\n\r\nHere is where the the protagonist and his job step in. The job of Terminal Service, where Tsukasa is employed, is to retrieve those Giftia before their expiration date, as well as terminating the program and memories planted into that Giftia. This is where those heavy themes come into play. \"Our job... Is tearing memories apart.\"\\n\\n\r\nArt- 10\\n\r\nThe way you judge the art all comes down to opinion. Plastic Memories has a definite style to the art as well as the general feel of the show. The way they went about animating captures the sci-fi aspect almost perfectly. Character movements are smooth and fluid, and the backgrounds are absolutely amazing. At some points, when characters are talking, the shading/background color will change to some other, vibrant color.\\n\r\nWhile it comes down to opinion, the art of this show is one of my favorites, and most likely will be for a long while.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters- 9\\n\r\nWhile only listed as a sci-fi show, Plastic Memories is also a slice of life, with a good dose of romance as well. Tsukasa is paired up with Isla, a Giftia nearing the end of her life span.\\n\r\nWhile Tsukasa has his own problems, and Isla attempts to come to terms with her gradual loss of functionality, they go about their job, retrieving Giftia- after understanding the feelings of the owner.\\n\\n\r\n This is where the show really shines. The side characters, or the owners of the Giftia marked for retrieval. Giftia display almost, if not all, the emotions a human does. Love, fear, hate, regret. After living with an Android like that for nine years, how attached would you be? Would you love that Android? Would you hate to let it go? Would you hate it for imitating a human? Would you regret making memories with it, only to have them torn apart?\\n\r\nThese are the heavy themes I was talking about. Almost all of the side characters are wonderfully developed, whether they are someone who refuses to let their Giftia be retrieved, or someone who hates their Giftia, calling her a liar.\\n\\n\r\nAnd let's not forget the romance aspect of the show.\\n\r\nTsukasa, as the official partner of Isla, the Giftia, is also her recognized owner.\\n\r\nVery quickly these two come to fall in love with each other. But in comes another one of these heavy themes.\\n\r\nIf you had a month left to live, would you accept the feeling of the person you loved glad to make as many memories as possible?\\n\r\nOr would you not want to hurt them in only a month's time?\\n\r\nLike I said, this is a slice of life show. While being a cute and fluffy romance, extremely heavy themes are present.\\n\\n\r\nSound- 8\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is able to capture the happy yet sad atmosphere of the show.\\n\r\nI really can't say much about the OP and ED, except that they fit the tone of the show. (Except I love the way they animated the ending.)\\n\r\nOne thing I noticed only after rewatching the show, is that the end of the opening, Isla seems to change her reaction as the show and the relationship between her and Tsukasa progresses. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment- 10\\n\r\nI love this show. It's also the only anime that almost made me cry. And I've watched Angel Beats, Clannad, and other shows that people claim made them bawl.\\n\r\nThe ending is just so damn sad.\\n\\n\r\nOverall- 9\\n\r\nKeep in mind this review is completely opinion-based, and if you disagree with me scoring it a 9, that's completely fine with me. Maybe I'm looking at the show too deeply, or I'm just a sucker for romances that develop like this, but I can honestly say that this is probably one of my favorite anime of all time. That might seem like a bold opinion, but hey, that's what it is. An opinion.\\n\r\nAnyways, I'd recommend this show to anyone who's looking for a decent romance, as this is one of the better ones that I personally have seen recently, and I'd recommend it to just about anyone who's looking for a good show.\\n\r\nHave a good day, MAL~",

            "content": "\"There's one thing about this job you need to remember: doing this job never feels rewarding.\" -Isla\r\nWell thanks for that, Isla. Sometimes that's the reviewer's life too.\r\nOnto Plastic Memories-\r\nThe Good Stuff:\r\nSound and Voice Acting: 7\r\nSo, we've got some super veterans like the awesome Megumi Toyoguchi (Revy, Black Lagoon, Winry, FMA/B) as the underutilized, but funny psycho boss, Kazuki. Sora Amamiya (Touka, Tokyo Ghoul) also heads up as Isla, and does a good job playing the airhead, naive character. There's also Mr. \"Screw The Rules\" Seto Kaiba himself, Kenjirou Tsuda. The OST is a bit underwhelming, and during some key moments is actually silent. Very forgettable.\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe Aight Stuff:\\n\\n\r\nArtwork and Animation: 5\\n\\n\r\nPretty plain, run of the mill animation. Nothing flashy, nothing outstanding, just does what it does. You've got the different characters you can tell apart by their hair color, and pretty much everyone else fades to the background in shades of brown and gray. Chibi faces, blue with shock, and all kinds of blushing are here, and teasing the girl with big boobs, if that kind of stuff appeals to you.\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe Rest (Rest in RIP, more like):\\n\\n\r\nStory and Characters: 2, 1\\n\\n\r\nI'm going to be frank- Plastic Memories is a case of false advertising. Oh but the fanboys will cry foul with how \"feelsy\" and \"sad\" it is. Yeah, it's \"feelsy\" and heartfelt if you're a complete sap sucker. Anime fans seem to be drawn to this nebulous and utterly trite idea of \"feels\" over and over in these pathetically thin \"tragic love stories\", and for no good reason. It's turning into a genre of its own, this recycled tugging-at-heartstrings narrative- so much to the point where we're literally watching the same kid and his dog die every week, with a slightly different coat of paint. If I want to watch that crap, I'll go to the Hallmark channel, dang. This show is grasping at straws for a romance narrative after starting out onto the path of what seemed to be an interesting psychological show. \\n\\n\r\nYou see, the Plastic Memories fans have conveniently forgotten how terribly paced and off topic the first several episodes are compared to what it transitions to later in the show. In the beginning, Plastic Memories was dropping lines like \"Ripping apart memories is our job\" and \"Having happy and beautiful memories won't always bring you salvation. The more beautiful a memory is, the more painful it can become\". That's some dark and heavy shit. That's not romcom material. \\n\\n\r\nFurthermore, the plot was asking questions of itself like, \"what happens to these androids when they're retired?\" and \"why is it that science only allows for them to have this limited lifespan?\" which are never addressed. \\n\\n\r\nIt's this taste of a psychological narrative about loss and the meaning of kinship and companionship that I thought this show was going to be about that interested me in it in the first place. If I were to infer what the story was about by the synopsis provided by MAL, I would not conclude that this was a story about loss and coping, along with maybe some action and a touch of comedy, mostly serious stuff. I never make note of the tags that shows are listed by, because they're irrelevant anyway, but Plastic Memories takes the irrelevance cake- it has one tag: Sci-Fi. Well Ho-lee crap, tell me something I don't know. \\n\\n\r\nKind of like the title implies, Plastic Memories has an identity crisis going on. \\n\\n\r\n-----\\n\\n\r\nThe Giftias (the androids central to the show) are imprinted with varying personalities. One of the ones retrieved (the universe term for being disposed of when their predetermined lifespan runes out) was a bodyguard for a Mafia man, another was a child for a parent, one a parent to an orphan, and all sorts of other familial relations. The effect of the loss of what's effectively a close family member is touched upon early, but dumped in favor of yet another teen romance show.\\n\\n\r\nWhile this could be a great setup for \"is it human love that we require, or a sense of companionship?\" or another existential theme about \"are the androids capable of their own thought?\" but no. They even touch on a deep political and sociological subject of \"since the Giftias are owned, can they even become people?\"\\n\\n\r\nNo, Plastic Memories is too heavy handed in exposition for that. Rather than leaving it up to the audience to decide, they just lay it all out there. Despite the completely arbitrary \"Made For TV\u2122\" drama of a 10 year life span, it's explained that Giftia owners have the option to re-use the body of the Giftia when it's retired, and they can even REPLANT THE SAME PERSONALITY inside of it! There are murmurings of \"Can the Giftias remember anything from their past incarnations?\" But this is quickly dropped in favor of \"OMG HOW SAD THE GIFTIAS ARE THIS POOR TIME BOMB OF FEELINGS WHAT DO YOU DOOOOO!?\" \\n\\n\r\n-----\\n\\n\r\nSo, despite the fact that you're hit with what you know to be end of the show in the first two episodes, and the solution is also already given... the authors decide to change gears to this melodramatic sob fest filled with tsundere side chick, overbearing people trying to live Tsukasa's life for him, and a general clusterf*ck of slice of life and cheap romance. \\n\\n\r\nYou can't even blame these plot holes on a crappy adaptation, because Plastic Memories is a WHOLLY ORIGINAL anime! The writers at Doga Kobo started off with a passable concept, and then passed the pen to somebody who just got done reading some garbage ass, written with an 8 year old's concept of love Twilight fanfic, and then tried desperately to plagiarize it while drunk! \\n\\n\r\n-----\\n\\n\r\nThe characters, much like the story, fit the title perfectly. Plastic. Fake. Artificial. Phony. \\n\\n\r\nWhat's perhaps the most damning part of how fake this show is, is that we're shown through Isla's words and actions that she, as a Giftia, has NO EMPATHY. (For the vocabulary challenged among us, empathy is being able to UNDERSTAND emotions, not feel sorry for someone- which is sympathy.) {Have sympathy for people who suffered through this show, but empathize that you understand their anger and frustration.}\\n\r\nThat's right- Giftias can't understand human being's emotions. They MANUFACTURE their own \"\"\"Plastic Feelings\"\"\"\", emotions and moods and project that outwardly. Kazuki herself explains what the feeling of regret is to Isla in episode 10, on top of how many times we see \"love\" and \"sadness\" explained to the Giftias. \\n\\n\r\nSo my question to the plot and writers is now, \"why the hell should anyone in the show {much less a viewer} even care about Giftias being taken away when their lives end?\" Sure, something that's been a staple in your life for 10 years being excised one day could hurt, but they're not humans. They're basically just glorified pets. Doga Kobo makes NO attempt at trying to make the Giftias more human, particularly because the other Giftias in the show are even more robotic than Isla is! Guess what? The best part is that they replace the Giftia's personality with a new one, for FREE! Who's to say that Isla's body isn't someone else's long gone child or girlfriend?? \\n\\n\r\nMake some new memories, Tsukasa, preferably with a real person this time. They have OKCupid in this world, right? (Also, wtf happened to nepotism in the future?)\\n\r\nTsukasa Mizugaki: \\n\r\nAge: 19\\n\r\nSex: No\\n\r\nLocation: Terminal Service (lol not the hospital morgue, but I want to kill myself)\\n\r\nInterests: crushing on robots, being a sappy, bumbling idiot, having no sense of social cues, and ignoring the advances of real women in favor of robots.\\n\r\nLooking For: A clumsy girl who refuses to talk to me and/or a hot and cold spicy redhead.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall and Recommendation: 3\\n\\n\r\nIf you want a really generic SOL romcom that starts like crap and ends with THA FEELS (or inversely, an interesting premise of a psychological show that goes Hindenburg after about 4 episodes)... Knock yourself out. \\n\\n\r\nDrop me a line for whenever you feel that fanboy rage building up after reading this one- I look forward to it.\\n",

            "content": "Plastic Memories is a show that very few people will be able to fully understand, emphasize with, and appreciate. It is a story about love, family, memories, loss, but most of all, it is a story about smiling through pain and understanding yourself.\r\nThe story is nothing amazing, as this is very much a character focused sci-fi love story with some light comedy touches. Many have complained about how the comedy takes away from the tone of the series, and while I can see that, you do have to appreciate how through the comedy, you see more about the characters than ever before. For example, inepisode three, Tsukasa Mizugaki and Isla start living together. Isla won't talk to Tsukasa, so Tsukasa does everything in his power to make Isla talk to him. While this is very much a comedic episode, it highlights two things: 1: How Isla is so disconnected from everything in her life and the world, and 2: Tsukasa's love for Isla. This is something people often forget about when criticizing this show. Another brilliant thing this comedy does for you on rewatches is to highlight the sadness of the show after you learn more about Isla.\\n\\n\r\nThe art and music of this show are also fantastic. The art design looks absolutely beautiful, with gorgeous lighting and environments, and the music often shakes you to the core. \\n\\n\r\nAnd then there's the ending scene. This is the most I've ever cried watching a form of medium... ever. Nothing even comes close. You can see the shows I've seen on my list.\\n\\n\r\nI mentioned before how very few people will, essentially, understand this anime. And this is it: It's because you can't really empathize with the characters of this show unless you are a specific type of person. I can't really go into more detail unless you've seen the show to the end. Just know this: this show is among the best I've ever seen.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, this show made me cry, smile, laugh, glare, and through it all, I was feeling such a storm of emotion and connection very few anime (or mediums) strive to create. I can't recommend this show enough.\\n\\n\r\nEdit: Okay, so I know saying some pretty pretentious stuff here, but going any more in-depth here will spoil the series. Just trust me on that.",

            "content": "This is my first review. I tried my best to keep this as spoiler-free as possible. I felt compelled to write this because Pla-Memo is my favourite anime and I found it underrated, and the current reviews are also degrading its reputation. I watched Pla-Memo for the first time 3 months ago and after re-watching now I decided to write this review, I haven't changed my mind that this is my overall favourite anime.\r\nStory: 10/10. First of all, the anime perfectly complies with its genres stated. The drama is really great, one can feel it even in the very first episode. Later on, the romancebecomes also astonishingly remarkable. And of course the plot itself is Sci-Fi as the anime is being held in some future where the \"Giftias\" become fashionable. I found many people disliking the idea of the \"Robot-human\", yes it is over-powered and may be dangerous,  but Giftias do have many advantages. Most importantly, Pla-Memo is different from any other drama anime, it is unique, the idea of giftias itself differentiates it from the mainstream drama like characters simply dying for instance. The plot is outstanding. There is also a very wide variety of events happening in merely 13 episodes, I was surprised the first time I completed the series. The first half of the season mainly focuses on introducing you to the life of the characters and their job at SAI Terminal Service. After this comes the more intense romance part, I found it just flawless. After watching the last episode you'll get me. Of course there were also comedy components in each episode.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9/10. There is not a great range of music but quality is definitely present. The opening theme and ending theme have great potential of bringing tears after you completed the series. You can even notice slight changes after each episode if you watch closely. Of course as it is a drama, there are so many sad songs, they fit superbly though. The other sounds are also very well-organised; you can get chills, there are screams, cries, laughter, but very co-ordinated balance.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10/10. Isla and Tsukasa are in the spotlight for the anime. Isla is one of my favourite characters, she is a short and clumsy giftia but has human feelings. Her past is extremely riveting, and how it is revealed throughout the anime and how her character gradually changes is so satisfying to watch. Tsukasa is not really a superlative character but he is very considerate, he greatly cares for his partner. Besides the two leading characters, we have the duo of Michiru and Zack, if one has read the manga beforehand, the presence of these two fellows can be even more entertaining while watching the anime. Michiru, the classic tsundere, and Zack casually making fun of her is so fun to watch. I also liked all the other members of their circle, Yasutaka is here for the comedy, Sherry for the seriousness, Constance is a very nice guy... and Kazuki actually plays an exceptionally important role, both in guiding the main protagonists to do their job smoothly as well as in buttressing their personal relationship. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10. The first time I completed this anime was in one-sitting of about 4 hours (from 8pm to past-midnight more precisely). It was extraordinarily emotional, \"the feels\" were real ! I felt the \"depression feeling\" that I rarely get after watching a drama (until now, only Pla-Memo and Clannad: After-Story made me feel so, comparingly, Angel Beats, AnoHana and Your Lie in April are nothing, thats my opinion). You even realise some very true stuff about life itself, I can relate, for example, like Isla's quote: \"Having happy and beautiful memories don't always bring you salvation. The more beautiful a memory is, the more painful it can become.\" That was deep. Yet, until now I did not come across any anime as beautiful as Pla-Memo, certainly that is my own idea, but all of this review is to encourage those who haven't checked the anime yet to go and watch it. However, if you do not wanna cry or get depressed, I may recommend you NOT to try this. Pla-Memo is a passionate drama, I privately love drama/romance genres like this (though this anime is distinctively special). Still, I am not saying that you are forced to cry while watching this, its all about opinions, but it is a fact that the emotions are greatly present and if you are a romantic-drama fan, it is definitely worth the try!\\n\\n\r\nOverall 10/10",

            "content": "So now that Spring season basically ended, it's time to review anime. Plastic Memories is an anime by Aniplex about this Corporation that is known for taking back these robots with human emotions called \"Giftia\" once it is time to take them back.\r\nBefore we get right into Plastic Memories, I would like point out something about Aniplex. \r\nAniplex is known for working on Angels Beats and Anohana. Just by me mentioning those two, you pretty much know what to expect from Plastic Memories.\r\n I thought Angel Beats was alright, but it's praised for having such a sad ending and many tragic moments. I found theshow to lack character development and the pacing was awfully rushed. It would've been a great show if it took its time to present the story in a better way and if the show was 24 episodes. Worst of all, I didn't find it to be really all that sad.\\n\r\nI can't say much about Anohana; I watched 3 episodes and it's now on-hold, but for what I've heard, it has \\n\r\n\"The saddest animu ending evaaa!!\"\\n\r\nFor what I watched in those 3 episodes, it felt like nothing was really happening and it was all just a build up to a sad ending. \\n\r\nAnd now we have Plastic Memories, which is being called the \"saddest animu of this year!!\" \\n\r\nWhere do I stand with this\\n\r\njudgement? Well...\\n\\n\r\nPlastic Memories wasn't good, it was pretty bland. The first episode was actually pretty good, I was very interested in the story and the concept it presented. Though, the characters looked extremely generic and boring, they weren't too bad in the first episode. But then the show took this really weird direction, for some reason. \\n\\n\r\nPlastic Memories has only one tag and that tag is \"Sci-fi.\" I can understand if this was the tag for the first episode and maybe the second, but everything after it isn't a sci-fi at all. It's a complete RomCom that has some sci-fi elements from time to time, but nothing to call the whole show just a \"sci-fi\" anime. \\n\r\nThe story is actually pretty interesting and something I wanted to see play out well, but it was never focused on it. It all just feels like the show had a great direction, but then an idiot changed the script. Episode 3 is the start of this series starting to build this RomCom and drifting away from the plot we were supposed to be focusing on. Lots of stuff are introduced throughout the series when it tries to go back to the actual plot, but they barely explain it and it ends up leaving a few plot holes. I think Plastic Memories should've balanced the plot with the romance instead of just ignoring the plot entirely, just to focus on the very generic and boring romance. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters were all dull and none of them felt like real people. If the show is not gonna focus on the plot much, then they need great characters to keep the show going. Unfortunately, this was a complete waste. The dialog in the show was very standard and made the humans feels like robots more than the actual robots. The characters are utterly bland and are flatter than a 4 year-old's ass. \\n\\n\r\nIsla is one of the Giftia's that is working with our male main character, Tsukasa. Isla is simply a loli and there isn't much to say about her. She's the typical shy girl that slowly opens up to the main character. She's not well developed and she's not interesting at all.\\n\\n\r\nTsukasa is super generic, bland and just very uninteresting. He's the nice main character that is very shy. You never really care for him and I never found myself liking his character at all. I didn't hate him, I was just not invested in his character. \\n\\n\r\nThe other characters simply feel like plot devices to get our main characters together before the ending. Also, most of them are characters you would expect in a generic RomCom, like the typical Tsundere. The whole show is just one build up to the ending, that you can predict after watching 2 or 3 episodes. Everything that happens can be predicted easily, not only because it's very easy to spot and they make it extremely noticeable, but also, because it has been done to death already. It's not unique in any way and has nothing new going for it. Now, I'm not saying that you have to be completely original and not do something that has been done before, but at least give it a new spin instead of making me watch the same show I've watched before. I mention this because some people would bring up that making something original these days is very hard, and I completely agree, but making the exact same show with very little change to it is kinda lazy. I mean, Plastic Memories tried to do something new with the plot, but it never focused on it well after the first 2 episodes.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation was pretty standard Romantic Comedy kind of animation. Nothing really stands out and it never impressed me, it was just pretty average. The soundtrack is not really worth mentioning. It's alright, the OP is good and the ED is good, but the score is pretty average. The character designs were completely generic. The thing that bothered me so much about them, is that the mains looked exactly like the mains in Absolute Duo, which I just wanna forget about by now. \\n\\n\r\nThe comedic episode in Plastic Memories never felt like they belonged in the show. Especially just little moments in the show where they just make a very out of placed joke, that wasn't really funny at all. Like, yeah, that is completely subjective, you might find it hilarious, but you're supposed to know when to place the comedy. You're not supposed to place comedy seconds after a very serious and dramatic scene. It's very unbalanced and it ruins every sense of emotion behind it. It's like a bipolar person wrote the script at times, and said, \"Well, fuck this guy, let's kill off everyone and now, for a very well placed joke to make everyone feel better.\"\\n\r\nIt just ends up reminding me of the comedy in Your Lie in April. Only that in Your Lie in April, the comedy is sometimes delivered in a good moment, but Plastic Memories has no idea when it's time for a good moment.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Plastic Memories is a huge disappointment for people that liked the first episode like I did. The whole thing is a build up to the ending, which actually wasn't bad, but the journey to get to that ending kinda was. I would be lying if I said I wasn't entertained while watching it, but it's mostly because I had nothing else to do. Now, I'm aware that some people will enjoy this show, and that's not a bad thing. I'm only saying how I feel about this anime, and if you're a person that would be bothered by the things I mentioned in my review, then I would suggest you skip this one. I'm pretty sure that most of us can agree that this had potential to be better, and I'm gonna give Plastic Memories a 4/10.\\n\\n\r\n\ud83d\udea8\ud83d\udea8\ud83d\udea8Spoiler Section\ud83d\udea8\ud83d\udea8\ud83d\udea8\\n\r\nThis is gonna be a quick spoiler section for the ending. If you don't want the ending spoiled, then please skip this, if you already watched the show or you don't plan on watching it, then keep reading.\\n\\n\r\nWhy the fuck didn't Tsukasa do anything about Isla at the end of the show? If you don't know, Isla basically dies or they simply take her back. But I mean, Tsukasa didn't try to somehow save her? She's not dead, she's just sleeping forever. There was so much potential to be had with this anime, but the writers didn't care. After the credits of the last episode, we see Tsukasa coming back months after to work with this new person. Exactly when that happened, it reminded me of the ending for Angel Beats. \\n\r\nReally, Aniplex? No fucking creativity at all? \\n\r\n\"Oh, it's supposed to be sad, because she dies.\"\\n\r\nThe only thing that died was the potential for an anime that could've been alright. \\n\r\n\ud83d\udea8\ud83d\udea8\ud83d\udea8 End of Spoilers \ud83d\udea8\ud83d\udea8\ud83d\udea8\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

Its quite simple, Plastic Memories hit me so hard in the feels I couldn't stop thinking about it for days. I loved the relationship between the two leads, It seemed so real and genuine to me. Their romance was a natural progression that felt satisfying and heartwarming, it was the most human relationship I've seen in anime so far. It really got me good. Would recommend to anyone looking for this kind of thing, it's a slow burner.\r\nAlso, in my opinion, I feel its best not to binge this one. Take your timewith it, like one or two episodes a day, I think this helps build a familiarity between you and the characters, making the impact of the ending more powerful.",

            "content": "Ok, this is my very first review so do not expect too much of it.\r\nPlastic Memories is a Drama, Comedy, Romance and Sci-fi style of anime.\r\nBasically, there are robots named \"giftias\" that helps people domestically, or for others reasons. They have an operating period and as soon as this deadline ends, they start loosing its memory and end up becoming threats to people, so they have to be collected, but this time is about of nine years, more than enough time to develop a good relationship with your giftia, and that's the main purpose of the anime.\r\nOn the issue of drama, it can be avery dramatic anime, when you anxiously want to know what will happen in the next episode. The comedy is good, but is not the strongest point in the anime, it was a good point to create an affection with the characters, but as I said, it's not the strongest point of the anime. About the romance, there's that one typical problem faced by the protagonists in almost every romance anime, where they are concerned about frivolous things and end up taking many time to develop a relationship because of theirs shyness and other trivial reasons.\\n\\n\r\nHere are my grades:\\n\r\nStory (9/10): For me the story is very good and with a good focus, it wanted to demonstrate that even having little time to create good memories to someone, it's better than have not created any. In the beggining, this anime presented all the plot and in my opinion the story became a little predictable, I mean, it became easy to know what would happen throughout the course of the anime, not as much as turning que anime less enjoyable, but that is a small negative point.\\n\\n\r\nArt (10/10): The art of anime is very beautiful as well as most anime coming out, nothing important to say here.\\n\\n\r\nSound (10/10): As far as openings, sound effects and OST's are very well made and give pleasure to my ears, on openings and endings, I think it is something extremely important for an anime, and they pleased me a lot.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter (9/10): There are several characters that have very different personalities, are typical characters of anime, but hefty well, everyone has their defects and their abilities.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment(9/10): I have to admit that sometimes I felt very anxious to see the next episode, but there were also times when I had almost no desire to watch it, but the anime itself is very pleasurable to watch and so this grade is nine.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: (10/10): I think the anime is really a masterpiece, the end is great and full of feelings, many people criticize the end saying it was very predictable and obvious, but in my opinion was a realistic end and so unexpected.\\n\\n\r\n-POSSIBLE DANGER OF SPOILER-\\n\r\nThe end of the anime is very criticized, because they say it was obvious and predictable, but the truth is that what was expected was to be a final in which everything would be fine and they would be happy in the end by some miracle, what would be technically impossible, so I do not think that was obvious and much less predictable, was a great, realistic and perfect end, Isla was happy and so was Tsukasa, they made what they wanted to do and Isla could rest in peace.",

            "content": "Memories are the thing that we all impact us in different ways.  Pleasant memories give us a feeling of warmth and comfort.  Traumatic memories give us sadness and despair.  And the memories of people that have long disappeared are the ones that cause us to have both kinds all at once.  So when you lose the ones you cherish so much, how exactly would you react?  Here, a review of Plastic Memories, an anime that deals with such a hard question with relative success.\r\nStory (7.33/10): Plastic Memories, or Plamemo in the shorthanded version of the name, features a technologically advancedworld.  In this world, the corporation known as SAI Corp. have developed an android called a Giftia, that is so much like a human, that the two are almost indiscernible from one another.  However, unlike humans, Giftias have one major flaw, they can only function for a maximum of 81,920 hours (roughly 9.3 years) until their programming starts to fail and they become corrupt and unable to function.  (Although, I'm not really sure how specific we are here when it comes to indiscernible.  Not quite sure if an android is capable of certain bodily functions like waste disposal or reproduction, because apparently the only real difference they have from humans is their lifespan.)  As a result, a branch of the SAI Corp. called the Terminal Service goes and retrieves the Giftias that have their lives almost expired.  Here, we follow the story of our main protagonist Tsukasa, as he starts his job in the terminal service, where he meets a Giftia known as Isla.\\n\\n\r\nQuite simply, the entire runtime of the anime revolves around Tsukasa and the job of the Terminal Service, where our main protagonists Tsukasa and Isla go around the city and pick up Giftias that are almost expiring.  However, that isn't all that the story has to offer.  In addition to the retrieval stories where the show focuses on the lives and the memories that the characters witness as they retrieve the spent Giftias, it also puts a lot of time into Isla and her backstory since Isla is a veteran member of the Terminal service group.  The issue with this is that there's an imbalance between these two, with the majority of the story focusing on Isla rather than the retrievals that was shown at the beginning to midway of the story.  Personally, I would've preferred the stories about other Giftias more so than seeing an episode about Isla since a good chunk of those episodes that focus on Isla don't really have much impact in the long run.  This is mostly due to the fact that the show spends essentially its second half on one character rather than side stories that could have had as good if not greater impact.  \\n\\n\r\nIn addition, the show has a bit of a comedic issue with it.  A lot of the time, Plamemo has a lot of more serious moments, tackling the issue of memories of other people and the morality of ripping away these people apart from one another, only leaving the memories behind as its main point.  But it also has a lot of plot points that serve to be more comedic, some haha moments.  This creates an issue because a lot of the comedy feels misplaced and completely out of left field.  It doesn't really meld with the current situation as well as one might think, and it, in several instances, killed the mood that was going on.  \\n\\n\r\nAnother problem I found was that the plot itself was actually rather predictable.  We have an object that has limited lifespan, and we have the main heroine who is that kind of object.  (I'll give you three guesses.)  As such, the impact that the series had really didn't show all that much.  There were moments which I felt in the series were really good and not that predictable, but those were the episodes and story points that focused on other Giftia, not Isla.  Also, the show kind of turned table as to what kind of show it was towards the end, turning into more of a rom-com, so that was also a slight issue.  \\n\\n\r\nIn the end though, I really didn't have a sense of satisfaction with the way Plamemo ended.  It was a very anticlimactic ending and it just sort of...ends.  Personally, I would've liked to have a little bit more drama or a little more something because everything just went far too smoothly, making me doubt that it was going to, only to see that it was actually going to end the way I thought it.  \\n\\n\r\nOverall, I felt that Plamemo had a very good direction that it was going in, but took a different route.  The comedy felt out of place at times, the show was fairly predictable, and it didn't really stick with one direction to go towards, rather, going towards two directions in which both felt somewhat unsatisfying in the end.  Regardless, with the areas of the plot that focused more on the side character stories, I felt like the show really excelled in that regard and brought the theme of memories and how they affect us forward in a great way.\\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+ Great character side stories\\n\r\n+ Good expressiveness of themes\\n\r\n-  Plot was predictable \\n\r\n-  Show went two directions, resulting in unsatisfying storyline\\n\r\n-  Comedy felt misplaced a lot and clashed with story\\n\\n\r\nCharacters (7.10/10): Characters in Plamemo are separated into three categories, the main characters, the terminal service characters, and the retrieval characters, each with their own plus and minuses to be had.\\n\\n\r\nLet's start with our main protagonist, Tsukasa.  Tsukasa as a new employee of the Terminal Service is shown in a fish out of water style, where he has zero clue as to what he's supposed to do and has to learn from the people already working there in order to properly do his job.  As the series goes along, Tsukasa starts to gain a bit of character development, connecting and understanding with the people that he takes Giftias away from, even going to the extent of apologizing for what he has to do out of sympathy.  While that's good and all, a lot of the time I feel like Tsukasa's really just an afterthought on account of the show focusing more on Isla and having Tsukasa rely on her for any semblance of character development.  Because the series doesn't actually focus on Tsukasa specifically most of the time, the amount of development he gets doesn't really go much in depth as I would've liked, and as a result, has some points that really feel a bit unnatural.  (Cue end of episode 8.)  \\n\\n\r\nAnd then, there's Isla.  Isla as the main female protagonist in this series is a Giftia who hasn't been out in the field retrieving other Giftias on account of some events in the past.  At first, she's shown to be very robotic, acting almost like an android rather than a person.  But as the show goes on, we are revealed as to why she acts the way she does and we start to see the relationship between the two blossom, which actually does put some positive feeling back into the series.  But the problem I have with this is the fact that the show doesn't really use the time between the characters as proficiently as it could've.  Several scenes, and even episodes are devoted for these two characters, but doesn't actually have much of an impact, resulting in wasted time.  I wish the show didn't begin focusing on strictly Isla till the very end, because like that, the show gets a progressional feel of character as you weave in points of character development through every episode.\\n\\n\r\nAnd then, the side cast.  As I had mentioned before, the side cast for Plamemo is separated into two groups, the Terminal Service, and the other families with Giftias ready for retrieval.  When it comes to the latter, that's when I feel like the show really shines because we have these connections between these Giftias and these people that our main characters have to break, leading to some dramatic and well-written scenes and moments.  It really ties into the show's central theme of memories and how they affect us, which is why I believe the show would've done better if it spent most of its time in that regard.  It's a case of \"you won't remember their names, but you will remember their stories\", which is something about Plamemo that I really like.  As for the terminal service people, they're really for the most part, comedic fodder.  There are several characters within this group that do have plot significance, like Kazuki, but for the most part, they're really just there to either move some part of the plot along, or create comedic moments.  I say this because a lot of them are pretty one-note.  (Aka, Michiru with her tsundere personality, Eru, who's pretty much just a pervert, the Terminal Service chief who sort of just complains about his family problems, and Yatsuka who basically just tries to hook Tsukasa up with girls.  Zack's teasing personality is great though.)\\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+ Retrieval targets are great characters\\n\r\n+ Main character development is decent\\n\r\n- Main MC development felt like a bit of an afterthought\\n\r\n-  Terminal Service crew mostly felt like comedic fodder\\n\\n\r\nArt and Sound (8.28/10 and 7.45/10): The art for Plamemo was created by Doga Kobo, an animations studio that's been known to do a very specific style of animation involving a very light color palette and their signature adorable, pupiless eyes.  Similarly, Plamemo has the same kind of artstyle that feature more of a neon palette of colors, with all of the scenery and characters exhibiting a very bright look to them.  The show itself does look good, but it doesn't really scream to me that it's very outstanding for the most part.  Still though, there are some moments where I feel like the art really does go into these great looking scenes which is always a nice plus.  \\n\\n\r\nIn terms of sound, Plamemo showcases a very wishful and pleasant sounding OP which I personally feel is one of the better OP's in Spring 2015.  It's a very calming song that really sings to the ideas of losing the ones whose memories you have while also having a very hopeful and mystical vibe to it, which brings it to be a decently memorable track to listen to.  As for the ED, the ED just feels a bit generic, with the song being a happy-go-lucky sounding song that I feel doesn't really have much of an impact or is all that impressive.  Good sounding, but it's not really all that memorable.\\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+ Great moments in art in the show\\n\r\n+ Good OP\\n\r\n-  Bit of a lackluster ED\\n\\n\r\nPersonal Enjoyment (7.01/10): When I first watched Plamemo in the beginning, I initially related it to Chobits, seeing as how both shows talk about the result of a super advanced android in the world where we see the effects that said android have on the state of the world overall, as seen with both shows utilizing stories of characters impacted by the androids.  But as I continued watching Plamemo, I was a bit confused as to why the show changed focus and eventually, I found it to be a bit boring, since the information that was given in the beginning had already written out its ending.\\n\\n\r\nDid I like this show?\\n\\n\r\nI in fact did enjoy this show to an extent.  As I have stated before, the parts where the show features stories of other Giftias and their lifespans were really I felt were the high point of the show.  They really related to the theme of the show fantastically, and I felt like the show itself was at its best when those stories were being told.  I also really liked the character Zack.  He teases everyone, and it's funny to see him tease the characters and see him just give an expression of him just not caring about the situation.  His comedy I think was the best.\\n\\n\r\nWhat didn't I like about this show?\\n\\n\r\nThe biggest thing that I didn't like about this anime was the fact that the show focused on Isla way too early.  The show flip flops with its plot focus, going from a random Giftia, to Isla, back to another Giftia, then back to Isla again before fixating itself on Isla for the rest of the show.  Personally, I felt like this broke up the flow of the show because while the show finished up one thing, it changed its tone completely before switching again, making it a bit of a weird watch because it was hard to tell whether the show was going to focus on one thing or the other.  The lack of development for the main characters also bothered me because I felt like the show should've put a bit more into Tsukasa given how he's not really all that well explained in the series and how he mostly relies on Isla to have any semblance of  character development.  I was also not really fond of the fact that the show ended up turning into a rom-com because it felt a bit sudden that it just completely changed.  \\n\\n\r\nWould I recommend this show?\\n\\n\r\nWhile Plamemo isn't entirely perfect, the show itself still does talk about the themes of memories and their impact to people which is well written in some parts of the show.  It has some issues with the way it wants to structure itself, but it still is a good watch to one that enjoys a story of drama and loss.  (Though personally, I feel like the show is less sad than people actually make it out to be.)\\n\\n\r\nOverall Score: 7.42/10",

The concept of androids with a limited lifespan is interesting, and the way that they leave theending up to interpretation were definitely some of the best parts, but to keep from spoilers I'm leaving this part here.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 10\\n\r\nThe art is gorgeous in this anime, the scenery itself is so nice to look at, and the character design is great. The facial expressions are definitely the high point, as they look extremely human without being uncanny.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10\\n\r\nThe OST is a great addition to an already good show, even though there is a very small selection of music, they do so much with it that it's astounding. The voice actors all do extremely well at their roles. I can't say too much here as I'm not one to pay much attention to sound, but I can say that is was amazing for what I did hear.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10\\n\r\nEvery character in Plastic Memories is great in some way or another, the characters that need development get development, and the others that don't are there as a foil for our main characters. My personal favorite character is Zack, who's both extremely adult and childish at the same time. Every character has something, and you'll more than likely find a favorite.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10\\n\r\nIt's a fun show to watch, it knows how to do everything it wants to do, and is generally an amazing anime. A common comparison that is brought up is Shigatsu, which is another great anime, but Plastic Memories does everything that Shigatsu did, but better. Shigatsu was melodramatic, but Plastic Memories was just dramatic. Shigatsu had horribly timed comedy, but Plastic Memories uses comedy to show the ups and downs of everything in the universe of the anime.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 10\\n\r\nYou know, it's kind of funny, for an anime about androids, Plastic Memories is the most human anime I've seen in a while, it shows the ups and downs of a relationship, and really delves into some really deep things. If you know what you're getting into, you're gonna really enjoy Plastic Memories.",

            "content": "I had high hopes for anime with this idea, but seeing how things are going its not looking good.\r\nthe company that our main character is working for is completely incompetent and would never work in real life what so ever. My case in point is their lack of a manual, a lack of a tour and explanation of their product and how things work to the new employes.\r\nI can forgive the main character for not knowing anything about the giftia but for a company to not even have a manual for its new employes to read and find out how the giftia function and whatis expected of both the human and giftia, on top of all this the company failed to notify the office that the main character will be working with so they did not have a partner for him.\\n\\n\r\nNow on to the poor guys coworkers, who mind you are not any better then the higher ups. They fail to tell him that his partner has only so many hours of run time left and that is why she is messing up so much, as a matter of fact they seem to all be rather bland character just there to be in the background and do nothing but provide the info our main character needs when the plot demands it to be so.\\n\r\nThis gives the whole show a rather scripted feel and I have no incentive to find out anything more about the world or the characters because of it, speaking of scripted.\\n\r\nIt seems non of the people who buy Giftia know that those things have a 9 year and 4 month running time, if this is another poor choice of the company or just scripted to add more \"emotion\" to the other wise bland show. I do not know which it is but both are just as bad.\\n\\n\r\none good thing it has is its sound and art, the art really matches the little feeling there is and all the feelings you do get are from the sound which matches very nicely.\\n\r\nI would recomand this to any storyboard writer to know what not to do but that is about it.",

            "content": "If you have a companion that you can only be with for 9 years, supposing that you and him/her will be very close and be best friends, or even more than that, what will you do? Will you give up entirely? Will you cherish each moment with him/her? How about if his/her lifespan is only a mere 83.3333333 days left? Will you still make friends with him/her? Maybe take him/her into a relationship?\r\nHow about if I tell you that is the setting of the anime Plastic Memories? Although I am sure you already know that if you've read the sypnosis, but...\r\nI was in rest ofwatching anime for at least 2 months when I come to know this. What made me watch this series is from a classmate's recommendation. I accepted his recommendation because at that time, I was finding for something sad. I don't know why but that's that. He said it was sad, so I played along and found another masterpiece made by the anime industry.\\n\\n\r\nThe story centers around Tsukasa, a man who failed in his work applications and started working in a company whose task is to retrieve Giftias, cyborgs who are the nearest imitations of human life (except reproduction. What a boring life they must lead. Joke.) and delete all data from them in order not to have complications. They bleed, they eat, they have emotions and have distinct personalities which makes them difficult to distinguish whether one is a Giftia or Homo sapiens.\\n\\n\r\nThere he meets Isla, his Giftia partner. That would be the start of series' story. \\n\\n\r\nThe story was quite tear-jerking fpr its dramatic scenes. Lots of events where some lost their beloved Giftias, which are certainly something to relate about, something that cannot be gotten over so easily. The story was purely outstanding, even though there is an obvious cliffhanger at the end. T-there a-are a-a-also some *hic* comedic rou-routines situated wi-wi-within, which makes it more sad in the end. Please give a me tissue. I-I'm c-crying over here. *hic*\\n\\n\r\nThe art utilized along with the character designs were purely amazing to my eyes, examples are the Giftia retrieving scenes and \"THAT\" scene in the last episode. I also found the portrayal of technologies and somehow, battles to be truly stunning. Well executed. Not lacking and never had a surplus. Just perfect.\\n\\n\r\nThe character designs are also perfect to consider. Especially that tsundere orange-haired woman, her Giftia partner, our main character and last but not the least, Isla herself who had one of the most pulchritudinous designs ever made in history (in my opinion, my biases and my thoughts) of anime. I don't know why I'm saying this, but nevermind that and move on to the next part.\\n\\n\r\nThe music and OSTs in this anime was also something that cannot be gotten over so easily. Especially its two themes: \"Ring of Fortune\" and \"Asayake no Starmine.\" The latter was so good that I use it for alarms so that I wake up immediately. The OSTs situated in the anime was also great that it was used and blended perfectly upon the events currently happening in the story.\\n\\n\r\nNow with the characters.\\n\\n\r\nThey each have distinct personalities, whether if they are humans or Giftia. Again, there is s jolly yellow-haired boy, a tsundere, a kuudere shirogami (white hair) and our main character. Each of them is unique in their own way and gradually develops as the story progresses. In other words, they are so well-made that they are some ones I cannot get over so easily. I might be saying this for a while now, but they are truly outstanding in my own accord.\\n\\n\r\nI also enjoyed my time spent watching Plastic Memories. What I got was mixed emotions: happiness, sadness, enjoyment and utter satisfaction. The scenes were so great! Need I say more?\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I would say Plastic Memories is one more masterpiece created by the anime industry. Great visuals, a great story, though I kind of need a second season in order to answer my questions. Great characters, great music, and excellent overall. I'd recommend this for someone who likes romances yet ends up as a tragedy.\\n\\n\r\nNow, if your life was already predetermined...what will you do? Will you accept it? Or find ways in order to defy it? Me? I don't have an idea.\\n",

            "content": "Plastic Memories, a romcom drama that despite not being the saddest anime to date, left me closer to tears than any other anime, and I've seen big tear jerkers like Clannad AS. The reason why is simple: while it is a Sci-Fi anime, the unfairness of reality is also expressed, and it's something that I really connect with. It's not just the heartwrenching job of the Terminal Services, specializing in \"ripping apart memories\", but the question, \"If you knew you were going to die soon, what would you do?\"\r\nPlastic Memories takes the feel train for a different ride. While most dramas give you a ticketright before the train leaves, Plastic Memories makes you preorder the ticket way in advance. While some would say, \"I know what's going to happen, thus I won't be sad at all! What a bad drama!\", I believe that sometimes knowing the outcome makes every action before that outcome twice as impactful. It takes guts doing something knowing that it will hurt you in the end, yet that's what Plastic Memories is all about. It's about living life to the fullest, cause most people in the real world won't know when their lives will end.\\n\\n\r\nRemember now, I'm not an anime reviewer. I'm not even that serious of a watcher. I'm a casual, and as a casual, I believe all anime (correction: most anime) have good points and are worth watching. If an anime makes you laugh, cry, or whatever at any point, then it was #worf. Plastic Memories did that, and A LOT. There are a lot of funny moments, a lot of sad moments, and a lot of the times they are back to back. \\n\r\nPros:\\n\r\n- Characters are extremely likable in my opinion. \\n\r\n- Feels train hits often and hits hard.\\n\r\n- Art is really nice, although it isn't really anything special.\\n\r\n- Although the OST isn't special either, there are moments when the songs really hit you. Also, sometimes they make the silence deafening, which is cool.\\n\r\n- Isla makes the most hilarious faces.\\n\r\n- Interactions between characters are sweet.\\n\r\nCons:\\n\r\n- Some characters could be developed more.\\n\r\n- Could have been stretched to a 24 episode show.\\n\r\n- This anime isn't exactly \"remarkably special and unique.\"\\n\\n\r\nStory: 9\\n\r\nI adored this story. Doesn't matter if it isn't the most dramatic or unique story, I loved it. Every story has its flaws, and this one is no exception. But the way the characters develop together is heart warming and it really left an impact on me. If a story changes your life, even just by a little bit, it's a good story. Despite my love for the story, there are parts where I am not fond of, particularly how fast the two main character's relationship developed seemed a little forced, but I ain't complaining.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9\\n\r\nWhile it's nothing unique like Shaft Studio stuff, or extremely fancy and detailed like the Fate series, it still gives a warm feeling. The art style resembles the art of Engaged to the Unidentified, which is a personal favorite of mine. Isla is adorable, Zack's facial expressions are hilarious, and visually this anime is awesome.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 7\\n\r\nNot much of an OST, but the OP is one of my all time favorites. I'm a songwriter, and after learning the OP on the piano, I must say it's a well written piece. The chord progressions are nice and the key changes between C minor and F minor are pretty creative. The voice actors did a pretty good job.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10\\n\r\nIsla is definitely one of my all time favorite characters in anime. Her outlook on life and her confident yet clumsy attitude makes her extremely likable, but despite how she looks, she isn't innocent. She's just living her life to the fullest, and I found that inspiring. All the other characters were amazing as well, filling their roles perfectly. The main character also goes through a lot of development with Isla.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10\\n\r\nI watched this show at an emotional time of my life, at which point the message that this anime tells you was extremely relatable too. As a result, I ended up loving this anime more than me if I watched it at some other point in my life. Doesn't matter, got hit by a train.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9\\n\r\nNot many shows can make me feel such extremes, in both happiness and sadness. Angel Beats comes close, but not quite as much.\\n\\n\r\nI hope one day you'll be reunited with the one you cherish.\\n",

            "content": "Since this series ended, I want to give my full thoughts on Plastic Memories. A series that many would like, or, despise. Despite the flaws in the show I found at least some meaning behind the show and that it\u2019s telling us something so we can all remember wisely. But take a note that this opinion is my own, so if you disagree with me then it\u2019s fine. We all agree, we all disagree, this is how the anime community works.\r\nStory: 6/10\r\nFor starters, let me give you a brief summary of the story. The setting its in a futuristic setting where these Giftias exist, wherethey are assigned to different people, however they have a time limit of 9 years, and after that expires, they are retrieved by the Terminal Service. It had a nice premise, where these characters with the giftias do not want to give up and they do not want to lose them. It\u2019s something that happens in our every day lives. Apparently this comes to play. Our main character Tsukasa, works in this Terminal Service Company with another Giftia called Isla. The story revolves not only on the central point of the story, it also concentrates on the relationship between our two characters. My only issue with this is that they firstly took most of the half the time to concentrate on their relationship, which kind of leaves the whole central point of the story (where our characters retrieve the Giftias) aside at least for a little bit. But at the same time the relationship between them turns something bigger after a while. But I wish they could balance both of these things so we can at least have somethings on around. But the build up on their relationship was fine.\\n\\n\r\nAnother issue would be one of the specific anime leaving some plot holes, but its kind of minor if you ask me. The story at least its decent and it shows a little message to everyone of us as well.\\n\\n\r\nArt/Animation: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nThis might be the strongest point of the anime series. This series was made by none other than Doga Kobo, the studio behind the series such as Mikagura Gakuen and Gekkan Shoujo Nozaki-kun. As always they impress me with the art looking colorful, atmospheric, along with the CGI Cars looking well done. The scenarios of the series looks at least detailed and gives at least a flow with the series. As for the character designs for at the very least they look nice.\\n\\n\r\nSound/Music: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nFor the sound/music department, at the very least they make a good job in here as well, and specifically with the music, the OST is very good personally. From tension towards the most emotional moments of the episodes. There\u2019s this one song that I really like from the series where one person was singing, its beautiful.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nLet\u2019s talk about the characters for a little bit.\\n\\n\r\nTsukasa being our main male protagonist, got at the very least a good relationship with Isla, he\u2019s a character that would not let go of someone precious to him, and along the way he learns a lot of stuff about the Giftias and learns how to move on at the end of the show.\\n\\n\r\nIsla, our female protagonist got one of the best developments in the anime series. She\u2019s starts out in the start anti-social and shy. She gets a backstory where we understand why she turned this way, and she then after a while develops into another person, that is capable of accepting others once again and become more social.\\n\\n\r\nMichiru is one of those archetype tsundere characters, but she got backstory as well where we understand why she\u2019s worried about the wanderers situation in one of the episodes. This makes me like her character for a bit and as the time passed I liked her a bit more, but not enough to say she\u2019s incredible. She does participate in the series and supports the characters, the very least I can say here.\\n\\n\r\nKazuki, one of the female characters that was a former partner of Isla, actually develops as well, she learns from this show her mistakes that she did in the past 3 years ago, and learned how valuable life is, and supported Isla afterwards and helped her to become the old self again. She learned that separating someone from another is not the answer, because it\u2019ll hurt even more.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the other characters they haven\u2019t got development but they are very entertaining to see them interact to one another.\\n\\n\r\nPersonal Enjoyment: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nAlthough with these flaws I still like the show for what it is. Heart warming, sweet, emotional, comical, other things I can name of. But I actually wanted the show to expand more on the world and the wanderer company, but this was satisfying the least.\\n\\n\r\nFinal Veredict: 7.2/10\\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s a series that even with the flaws, its still enjoyable to watch. I would recommend this to anyone who is either a fan of Chobits or likes heart warming and/or emotional ones.",

            "content": "When I first started watching Plastic Memories back in April I was immediately very impressed by it because the first episode was simply amazing. It forecasted an original anime with beautiful artwork, an ambient atmosphere, likeable characters and a lot of tragic drama. At the time, I really thought that it would become the next hidden gem, and the biggest surprise of the season.\r\nAs it turned out however, Plastic Memories instead ended up being one of the most misleading anime I've seen in quite some time. Unlike what the opening seemed to imply, in reality the show is mostly a cute and light-hearted slice oflife comedy with quite a lot of romance in it. Now this doesn't mean the anime turned out poorly in the end, quite the opposite in fact, but it never reached the level that I thought it would have reached in the beginning.\\n\\n\r\nThe story takes place in a future world where humanoid androids are a common part of human society. The androids, named \"Giftias\", are fully equipped with human emotions, and help their respective human owners however possible. But the Giftias have very limited lifespans, and thus they need to be taken out of commission before too long. Enter Tsukasa, an 18-year-old boy whom is offered a position at the SAI Corporation; a group responsible for retrieving Giftias who are approaching the ends of their lifespans, and eventually scrap them. Right next to him, we have his fellow co-worker: the incredibly cute and loveable Isla, who is actually a Giftia herself despite her position. The two of them form a team by order of their boss, and they consequently start working together, socializing together, and of course fall in love with each other.\\n\\n\r\nThis is how Plastic Memories suddenly becomes something totally different from what it originally promised to be. Despite the premise, the anime is in fact not about the retrieval of various Giftias, nor is it about the SAI Corporation itself or any of the other people working there. Plastic Memories is about Tsukasa, and it is about Isla. That is all. And honestly, that's totally fine in and of itself because they make up one of the cutest couples I've seen in ages, and watching their awkward romance is surprisingly enjoyable no matter how much you see of it. But for a lot of people, this was nothing more than wasted potential because the cool and interesting premise of the story itself is heavily neglected in the process. For everyone who wanted to see a melancholic story about the tragedy of having to say goodbye to your loved ones and how they deal with it... you're probably going to be left disappointed, because Plastic Memories doesn't actually focus very much on that at all other than right at the very beginning. The only character the show ever really emphasizes this point for is Isla herself as her lifespan is of course also very limited due to being a Giftia, but for everyone else... not very much.\\n\\n\r\nHowever if you can get past the fact that the show is more or less in disguise and try to see it for what it actually is (in other words a romantic slice of life story), then suddenly Plastic Memories is a very enjoyable anime again. Why? Because it actually has *proper romantic development*. Quite a lot of it in fact. This is not the kind of show which ends with a confession in the final episode and nothing more; no, there are actually things happening from very early on in a romantic sense, which is something that is unfortunately very rare in today's anime. Especially seeing Plastic Memories airing in the same season as Nisekoi was pretty amusing to me; they're like night and day in comparison as far romantic progression goes.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Plastic Memories is an anime which you will probably be given a very different impression of depending on your expectations on it. Is it a good anime? Yes, but it's a completely different anime from what you're most likely anticipating when you start watching it. That doesn't make it a bad show per se, but it feels a bit like false marketing. It's up to each and every viewer to do their best at adapting to what the anime has to offer.\\n\\n\r\nIf you're looking for a deeply touching and emotional melodrama like Clannad: After Story or Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso, then sorry to say but you're looking in the wrong place. But for a cute yet beautiful story about young love, it's hard to find a better example than Plastic Memories.",

            "content": "Human/technology integration has always been a fascinating topic to me. Just thinking of humanity's next leap towards further development being aided by biomechanical intervention could cause even the cynical-minded to wax philosophical. It's a topic that's inspired countless debate and discussion for many; redefining the idea of what it means to be human with the continuously blurred line between man and machine. And what better way to view this delicate balancing act than by seeing it unfold through the guise of a romance. It's an interesting \"what if\" scenario, that, to those who share my fascination with the subject, could find many interesting facets onexploring that very idea. \\n\r\nCan such a nebulous idea of \"true love\" be found with a man-made being? Where do we draw the line between augmented reality and primal attraction? Many different forms of media have tried to tackle this intriguing concept; from movies like 2013's \"Her\" and 2015's \"Ex Machina,\" to novels like Jonathan Lethem's \"As She Climbed Across the Table.\" There are even a few anime titles that tackled this subject as well, such as Eve No Jikan, Armitage III, Chobits and many others. When this topic is done right, it can be a highly rewarding experience, leaving the viewer with something to wrap their heads around.\\n\r\nSo when I sat down to watch Plastic Memories, a show that had the right ingredients to make something truly thought provoking, just flush this potential down the toilet, for what essentially was forced melodrama... let's just say I wasn't a happy camper when everything was said and done. Under normal circumstances, I would categorize shows with Plastic Memories's setup as a bait-and-switch, but from the way it was presented, it never seemed to care about, or even acknowledge the ideas it could have implemented. What we have here instead was a cookie cutter rom-com that was oblivious to its own potential.\\n\\n\r\nSo no, I didn't get what I wanted, but does that render the rom-com that took its place bad?... Unfortunately yes, it does. It's a show that forces a catch-22 on the audience with an inevitable conclusion spurred on by contrived logistics. It suffered from heavy-handed manipulation at the cost of proper buildup and engagement, which was made all the more noticeable when you take into consideration the setting the show presents everything in. \\n\r\nIn the future, sentient androids known as \"Giftias\" has become incorporated into everyday society. However, like everything else that has a beginning, so too does the Giftias have a limited lifespan as well, with about a decade or so of functionality before they are decommissioned, resulting in their memories being erased (which is the android's equivalency of death). This, of course, becomes the core focus of the show, as we're introduced to our protagonist Tsukasa, a human, who finds himself involved with one of these Giftias named Isla. And from there onward, the show chronicles their daily interaction and growing relationship. And as you would guess, it becomes a tale of a fleeting would-be romance with only one possible outcome.\\n\\n\r\nWhen trying to present a romance, there must be proper interaction between the main love interests in order to sell their position as lovers. We as viewers need to see this bond slowly form, see the chemistry that they share, and the mannerisms that they portray when expressing themselves to each other. To get down to brass tacks, we as viewers need to be convinced of their validity as a couple for it to feel organic. If this isn't handled properly, it can cause the relationship and development to feel forced or manipulated. This is Plastic Memories 1st noticeable blunder. It tries to build this chemistry on a premise that just screams victimizing; with a character predestined to be terminated from an expiration date, a protagonist that makes no visible effort in repealing the outcome, and a romance bound to go nowhere because of it. It isn't bittersweet nor is it heart-wrenching since the reason these androids expire is contrived and contradictory to the world setting presented. How may you ask? Well, let's explore the ill-defined logic the show tries to spoon feed us.\\n\\n\r\nWe're made to believe that this show takes place in a future where the creation and distribution of androids are a fairly commonplace occurrence. In other words, it's an advance society that's leagues ahead of us in terms of technological breakthrough and scientific advancement. But at the same time, the show wants us to believe that they have no methods of storing or switching memory from one device to another. And I shouldn't have to spell it out but do you see how this nonsensical explanation doesn't work? A society advance enough to have androids with empathy, but not advance enough to store memory or transfer it? So if you own a USB flash drive, then congrats, you've officially surpassed this society's current intellect. And that is just the tip of the iceberg when talking about this show's implausible setting. Later on, we find out that after an android passes its expiration date and isn't decommissioned, they take on a savage state, becoming dangerously violent against humans, escalating to the point of murder  (in other words, they go ape-shit). Which begs the question, why in the hell would anyone endorse a machine that can go \"Terminator\" on citizens when they lose their memory? It's unfathomable to think any governing body with a modicum of common sense would allow such a hazardous time bomb to be integrated into society. There was even an episode dedicated to showing how such a terrible downside could reek havoc, or even worse, be exploited as a weapon, but like the setting it's a part of, it was never explored beyond that. It was simply brought up and never mentioned again by the next episode just so they could allow for more rom-com moments to continue undisturbed. Just look out for the 'Psycho-Pass' episode, you'll know it when you see it. \\n\\n\r\nTsukasa and Isla both work at the same job, and it's also the place they 1st make contact with each other. From what you can easily read in the synopsis, they both work for the Terminal Service Department: a subdivision of the larger company responsible for the distribution and recall of androids. They're tasked with retrieving androids that are approaching their expected expiration date from their owners. This, of course, brings up yet another question; why is the task of retrieving androids so primitive and counterproductive? Like I've stated, these androids are like ticking time bombs with the added bonus of being empathetic. You would think something as important as this would be tasked to a more organized unit, but what we're introduced to instead is a motley crew of quirky characters that only share one personality trait and act so outlandish that entrusting them with such a task is almost ludicrous. It's like handing police duty over to the circus. It's like the creators were dead-set on an end goal and didn't care how little sense it made getting there. On a whole, the sci-fi elements of this show were never explored or utilized. It was simply used for flavoring, and it quickly became apparent that they didn't care about common sense when they duct-taped the narrative and setting together.\\n\\n\r\nThe relationship was also diminished by the fact that 3/4ths of the show's run-time were dedicated to slapstick comedy and silly misunderstandings. Half of it was wasted away where it could have been used to develop the relationship between the characters, which was made even worse given the short episode count the show was already working with. While I'm not the biggest fan of shows like Clannad or Toradora, I at least acknowledge that it did this aspect correctly. It utilized its run-time by building the relationship between the characters, either by their direct contact with each other or the indirect result of their influence on each other. It allowed us as an audience to grow attached to their interaction and relationship.\\n\\n\r\nMost of the characters, like I've already stated, are just a range of archetypes. From your tsunderes to your beta-male, they all follow one-note traits and won't be remembered for anything else. This also applies to our two main characters. Tsukasa is as generic as a protagonist can get, ripped right out of the pages of clich\u00e9-land. You've seen his type many times before, and to be quite frank about it, he's indistinguishable from the lot of them. Isla is yet another Rei Ayanami clone, completely packaged with the silver hair, red eyes, and the signature porcelain complexion. Dull, monotone and devoid of personality, the only good thing I can say about her is that she truly acts like an android. Outside of the main cast, we're occasionally introduced to androids and their masters that the team has to retrieve. But they're introduction is done more so for forced \"feels\" than for actual world building. Just toss in a sappy backstory and an unavoidable conclusion and it really becomes more annoying than anything. \\n\\n\r\nAnd really, that's the main problem with this show in a nutshell: it's constantly trying to get the audience to care but doesn't seem to have any idea how to do so without coming across as fake. It's a show that forcefully tugs at your heart strings while thinking that people will easily be duped into falling for it. It thinks that simply playing melancholic music and animating tear ducts is more than enough to fool viewers, while forgetting that genuine character investment is what allows the audience to sympathize with hardships. And who knows, maybe this falsehood would fool some into buying the creator's snake oil. There are certainly viewers out there willing to suspend their disbelief, regardless of the amount of mental gymnastics required to do so. But for those well-versed enough to see past the smoke and mirrors, it's a detracting quality that causes the show and its conflict to implode on itself. \\n\\n\r\nThe art and animation for Plastic Memories were above average and made the whole experience better than it would have been without it. It was bright, vivid and used a broad range of color palettes to convey whatever mood or tone they were going for. While it felt overdone at times, there were moments where it truly shined and help to sell the scene at hand; most notably the show's finale episodes and epilog. While the art and animation served their purpose, the character designs were a hit or miss. On one hand, a few had distinct features about them, but a lot were also cookie-cutter in a bad way as well. It helps to better personify their characteristics, but when they lack dimension and personality, it made them feel like carbon copies of other characters in the same vein as them. There was also moments where the show paid direct homage to Evangelion with certain scenes and shot compositions, which, while being a fun little tribute, didn't serve any purpose whatsoever. At best, they were Easter eggs for those that caught on to them. \\n\r\nThe soundtrack was a mixture of pop and electronica flavoring. It was \"fluffy\" during the comedic bits and took on a more somber tone during the show's more \"emotional\" moments. While there weren't any noteworthy tracks, it was fine and served its purpose. Average but effective. The opening and ending themes were both fine and easy listens. Nothing that might stick with you but catchy and worked in unison with the show.\\n\\n\r\nLike most titles of this nature, my problem doesn't stem from what it's trying to do, my problem comes from how poorly it goes about attempting it. If a show is aiming to get me as a viewer, emotionally invested, I expect it to do so in a manner that doesn't distract from its target intent. If I'm duped and fall for it, despite my better knowledge of its intent, I will credit it for its efforts. However, if I'm viewing the show and have to signal the \"bullshit\" flag every other minute, then as far as I'm concerned, that anime failed at its job. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 4/10\\n\\n\r\nMy enjoyment of Plastic Memories was intermittent at best, but for the most part, the show was a face-palming experience. Because of the sloppy portrayal of its themes and forced melodrama, there was no engagement to speak of. The ending was decent, but the journey to said ending was buffoonish at best and can't be overlooked. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 4/10\\n\\n\r\nPlastic Memories was an uninspired and underwhelming experience. It had the opportunity to craft a decent romance, or even better, a good sci-fi tale, but it did neither and ended up falling short of the mark. While some might find it touching, I simply couldn't buy into the dilemma for the reasons I've stated. If you decide to watch this show, do so with low expectations, for whatever it tried to do, have been done to a much higher and better degree somewhere else.",

            "content": "**SPOILER FREE REVIEW**\r\nWhile Plastic Memories had the potential to be a unique and intelligent show, it instead managed to encompass all of the things that ruin dramas and cause them to fail every time. Forced plot devices that make no sense? Check. Inopportune comedy that ruins the show\u2019s tone? Check. Shallow characters defined entirely by their archetypes or tragic backstories? Check. While this anime showed flashes of good ideas and has its moments, its poor execution dooms it to be lost among the sea of poorly written, mediocre emotion porn.\r\nSynopsis: In the near future, technology has allowed for the invention humanoid-like robots known as \u201cgiftias\u201d,who look, talk, feel, and emote exactly like actual humans do. The catch is that they can only operate for a little over a decade before they must be shut down, resulting in the loss of all their memories. The story follows Tsukasa, a human, and his relationship with Isla, a giftia.\\n\\n\r\nThe biggest and most obvious problems with this anime stem from its forced and melodramatic plot devices that range from just plain stupid to cringeworthy. For example, when Tsukasa and Isla first become partners at work, we are suddenly told that this means they have no choice but to live together! Because that makes total sense and is definitely not a lazy plot device to provide a setup for bonding and slice of life shenanigans! The other one that sticks out is the big \u201creveal\u201d they make about what happens to giftias if they aren\u2019t properly retrieved, which defies all notions of common sense and even basic science. That\u2019s especially bad given that this show has a science-fiction setting for some reason. In fact\u2026 was there ANY reason for there to be robots in the first place? Literally the only difference between a human and a giftia is that giftias lose their memories after a certain period of time, so now that I think about it, that makes the entire sci-fi setting and concept of giftias in general completely pointless and nothing more than yet another contrived plot device for drama\u2019s sake. They certainly didn\u2019t explore any sort of difference between the two life forms; it\u2019s very much an accepted fact that giftias are equal to humans, so why was everyone not just regular people to begin with? Was there no other scenario they could come with that incorporated death-like elements, like, y\u2019know, DEATH? It\u2019s this kind of thing that makes the show very difficult to take seriously.\\n\\n\r\nThere are other major issues with the show\u2019s plot, namely how laughably predictable it is. You can LITERALLY guess every major plot point of the entire show by the end of the first episode, and I\u2019m not exaggerating, because I literally did. I just kept waiting and waiting for something that I didn\u2019t see coming a mile away to happen, and with the exception of a single contrived plot device which I already mentioned (a plot device that doesn\u2019t even lead to anything\u2026), it simply never does. Now, one thing that I will give the show credit for is that is has some genuinely sweet moments. The final stretch of the show made me feel something, at least. However, then it just sort of\u2026 ends. And it ends, like, EXACTLY how you would expect it to. I guess what I\u2019m trying to get at here is that it left me with a feeling of \u201cSo what?\u201d I mean, you told one of the most obvious and straightforward stories I\u2019ve ever seen, so much so that I could have stopped watching after a single episode and gotten the gist of it, so what did you put into your show that justified the time it took to watch another 12 episodes? Were there any meaningful themes? No. Did the characters learn anything or change in any meaningful way? No. So why would anyone EVER want to watch the entirety of this show? *Sigh, I don\u2019t know if this is making sense. Let\u2019s just move on:\\n\\n\r\nThe last aspect of the plot that really bothered me was the random comedy that completely ruined the show\u2019s tone by being interspersed throughout parts that are supposed to be serious. To give an example, the first episode of this show really hooked me. At the very end of the episode, there was a well-executed and genuinely emotional scene that was actually getting to me. I\u2019m the kind of person who almost never gets legitimately emotional when watching a TV show, but this one scene was just hitting all the right notes for me. By the time it was over, I thought we had an extremely promising show on our hands. Now, guess what this beautiful, emotional scenario was immediately followed by: \u2026A BATHROOM JOKE. That\u2019s right. No relevance, no context. They just decided to throw in a random bathroom joke and ended the episode on a ridiculous note instead of a serious and powerful one. That, to me, is a decent microcosm of the entire show. Every time you might be about to get invested in a serious scene, WHAM! Random, generic, slice-of-life comedy comes out of nowhere and blindsides the plot. It\u2019s just a disastrous display of a lack of tonal understanding and, ergo, bad writing. \\n\\n\r\nI think the real thing that would have saved Plastic Memories for me was if the characters were given any form of depth whatsoever. Tsukasa, our protagonist, is a cardboard cutout straight from the generic, beta, male protagonists factory. My god, there was, nothing, NOTHING unique about him. I don\u2019t think I\u2019m alone in the sediment that I don\u2019t care about other people\u2019s relationships if I don\u2019t know them, and I certainly didn\u2019t feel like I knew Tsukasa, so how am I supposed to give a damn about him and Isla\u2019s relationship? Speaking of Isla, talk about yet another shallow character. I put her squarely in the mary-sue category, given that she is an idealization of a pure, innocent, kawaii waifu with no real flaws whatsoever. Can she be funny at times? Sure. Does that mean I at all cared about her? No. As for the side characters? Boring. Bland. Generic. They are all basic stereotypes with nothing to distinguish them. I know they attempt to give a few of the side characters a backstory, but the backstories don\u2019t actually accomplish anything other than just being sad. They do absolutely nothing to add a dimension to the character they are attached to and none of them are given any form of a story arc. I\u2019ve seen casts like this a million times. The characters, to me, might be the biggest reason the show failed. I might have been able to overlook all the previously mentioned problems with the plot if this show actually gave me a reason to care about the couple of Tsukasa and Isla, but they simply don\u2019t.\\n\\n\r\nPretty much the only thing I can definitively say I liked about Plastic Memories was the animation. It\u2019s pretty fluid, but what really got me was the cinematography and shot composition. Besides the number of Evangelion references they threw in, there were a lot of well thought out and extremely well directed scenes that actually succeeded in conveying information and emotion without words. That\u2019s VERY difficult for a show to do, so kudos for that. The settings were always detailed and full of bright colors as well. The world looked really cool, which is part of the reason I wanted them to actually tell me something about it. Like, literally anything would have been nice. Instead, the writing is so barebones that it could have taken place pretty much anywhere else, and that brings us full circle, doesn\u2019t it?\\n\\n\r\nI wanted to like Plastic Memories. Really, I did. It didn\u2019t have to be some complex, philosophical inquiry into the definition of humanity and how it differs from artificial intelligence (which is the kind of show that many expected it to be); I would have been totally content with it just being a drama if they actually gave me a reason to care about its characters. If they didn\u2019t ruin every moment they ever created with inopportune comedy. If they didn\u2019t make the plot so damn predictable. If their plot devices weren\u2019t so incredibly contrived. There were simply too many major problems to overlook, and that forces me to make the sad conclusion that Plastic Memories is a massive missed opportunity for what could have been a really enjoyable original anime. It lacked direction and coherent writing on all fronts, and I cannot recommend it to anybody.",

            "content": "The story written by the author who made Steins;Gate, but if you were expecting a well written story look elsewhere. Conversely, if you\u2019re a fan of forced melodrama and rapid tone changing, or enjoy unoriginal characters and are interested in seeing another Kanade clone feel free to waste your time on this.\r\nSTORY\r\n\u2018Plastic Memories\u2019 takes place in the future where technology has advanced to the point where androids labeled as \u2018Giftias\u2019 exist and are capable of implementing human thought, emotion and memories. These exist for the purpose of human interaction and wish fulfillment, targeting those in need of company of some sort. After around 9 years,Giftias can no longer function and they must be shut down, terminating their memories. The story mainly revolves around 18 year old Tsukasa Mizugaki, a human, who along with a Giftia named Isla, joins the SAI Corporation and is placed in the division in charge of retrieving the Giftias. \\n\\n\r\nGiftia\u2019s that fail to be retrieved will eventually expire and turn into a wild savage machine which they label as \u201cWanderer\u201d. If technology has advanced so far that they can create artificial humans, there would be no reason why there should a 9 year limit, nor why they haven\u2019t made any attempt to increase it like an extra memory card or something? The show never bothers to go into and explain that. It\u2019s only clear that 9 years\u2019 time the androids that they hand out will go hostile and attack anything in site. Good writing. They should implement cloud storage to expand the memory space, as increasing the limit would yield a huge profit margin for companies with proper marketing strategies. Even just transferring memories from one robot to another should be possible, they are machines after all. We have this technology now, it\u2019s unthinkable to imagine that we couldn\u2019t utilize it in the future. There is no reason to suspend this belief for this ridiculous premise. I can\u2019t even fathom why they would distribute androids that could possibly attack people in the first place. And despite all of these complications, the show just chooses to just stick to the romantic comedy aspects the entire time which makes the sci-fi elements meaningless.\\n\\n\r\nThe series focuses on the relationship between Tsukasa and Isla, so at first glance it seems like it will delve into the ethics of Giftia and human interaction. However, terrible execution renders this attempt at a moral irrelevant, as any point they were trying to make was invalidated by the constant tone shifts and forced drama that was impossible to empathize with. \\n\\n\r\nWhen I first had started Plastic Memories, the first episode presented all of these themes and ideas about cherishing memories; but it had a flaw that most dramas suffer from, poorly timed humor where it doesn\u2019t belong. There was a sad moment when they had to retrieve a loli Giftia from her grandmother; it was supposed to be a sad moment but I couldn\u2019t take it seriously because the sad tone was abruptly shifted to an out of place comedy routine. The drama is laughable and becomes out of place when scenes before and afterwards are inserted with poorly timed comedy. In fact the tone shifts are a common recurrence that continues for the rest of the show.\\n\r\nIn episode 3, Tsukasa moves in with his work partner Isla and wants to grow closer to her, attempting various methods to get Isla to open up, which leaves us with a wasted episode of rinse and repeat clich\u00e9 slapstick humor. A majority of the episodes consisted of these dumb comedy skits; whenever something serious is happening, the very next scene presents a gag that kills the tension. All that is achieved in this case is a lot wasted episodes. Instead of spending time building and developing an atmosphere for empathy to establish a justifiable drama, we instead get a 60/40 split of slapstick comedy and forced drama. The theme of cherishing memories that the show tries to present is lost in translation due to rubbish execution. \\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS\\n\r\nThe characters were bland and dull archetypes, including the beta protagonist who exists for the purpose of self-insertion and whose only notable traits include being \u201cnice\u201d and a pushover. the  typical Kanade rip-off who undergoes the standard kuudere \u201cdevelopment\u201d, the textbook tsundere, the drunkard, the dumb blonde bombshell, the nonchalant ladies\u2019 man, and the prepubescent boy who you\u2019ve never sexualized, not even once. This is a cast of unoriginal characters with no depth and minimal development that we will instantly forget about. Since the characters are archetypes it makes it difficult to provide empathy towards them. \\n\\n\r\nANIMATION\\n\r\nArt and animation did a fairly good job. The original character designs were done by okiura, the one responsible for the art and character designs for IS: Infinite Stratos. Although the designs themselves aren\u2019t anything too special, looking at Michiru reminds me a lot of Asuka from the Evangelion series. The animation itself did a good job, it was consistent and it never had a massive dip in quality.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND\\n\r\nFor the sound it was fitting, the OST itself had a couple tracks I found to be lovely. The opening and ending theme are pretty good, they\u2019re fitting for the show. They\u2019re catchy and memorable, nothing amazing but I did like them.  \\n\\n\r\nOVERALL\\n\r\nPlastic Memories was something I honestly thought had potential. I really wanted to like it. I was even pretty satisfied with the first episode despite the flaws it had toward the end. Overtime though I just couldn\u2019t ignore the fact that these flaws kept reoccurring throughout the show. At least the ending wasn\u2019t bullshit, but it was exactly what was expected making it predictable from episode one. I would be lying if I said I never enjoyed myself, but I found myself to be bothered more and more if anything. It had good ideas but it didn\u2019t mean anything and the premise was ruined because the execution was abysmal. The show\u2019s theme exploration was weak and the humor killed any of the attempted drama. If you want to watch something that is similar but is actually good then just check out Eve no Jikan instead.\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Have you ever seen an anime with a premise so uninspired and lacking in imagination that you know it's doomed for failure before it even gets a chance to show off? However, because you're an anime fan who finds it pointless to just watch stuff you like, you continue on out of sheer curiosity regarding how badly it'll be handled, only to realize you underestimated the depths a man can take to stretch said weak premise out in order to fit a full-series length? That's pretty much how I watch practically 90% of the anime I keep up with on a regular basis, and PlasticMemories happens to be one of said percentage.\\n\\n\r\nYes, trying to demand ambition from Dogakobo is like begging a grizzly bear to save you from hitmen despite the fact that he's a fucking corpse because you thought poisoning his berry patch would have been a funny to make on Facebook (you monster), so I wasn't too surprised that the show turned out as inane as it did. But whilst I've yet to meet a colleague who disagreed with me, the semi-good reaction this show has been getting from the overall community is more baffling than an Australian politician's general incompetence at being human. I know a lot of anime fans love \u201cfeels\u201d and all, which makes these sort of shows both easy and difficult to criticize. Because whilst it\u2019s easy to say what doesn\u2019t work about \u2018em, said method of storytelling is ultimately a style, the same way all music and humor is a style at the end of the day. It either works for you or it doesn\u2019t, making any criticism you dish out being rendered ultimately pointless by the fact that your brain and childhood just isn\u2019t hardwired to get it.\\n\\n\r\nThe thing is though, even by those incredibly irrational standards, Plastic Memories is pretty damn awful right down to the very concept. In some distant future exists humanoid androids called \u201cGifita\u201d who only have a fixed lifespan of ten years, because any longer than that and they become more rabid than a pack of raccoons after being sprayed by a skunk. Just before said lifespan expires, they are retrieved by a group of \"Retrievers\" in order to be put to sleep, basically making them futuristic dogs except with the ability to talk and act out your pedophilic tendencies towards if you so choose. Except the show isn't really even about how dog retrieval life is like. It's about the actual partings and what they mean to people, with most of said story being told through an office worker and his \"actually dog\" partner. Reminds me of that awful era when Dogakobo was releasing visual novel adaptations that had decent premises on paper and proceeded to ignore \u2018em completely in favor of either two things: shallow melodramatic shit and shallow melodramatic shit with poorly animated fight scenes.\\n\\n\r\nIncidentally, the office workers in this anime look pretty damn young, don't they? I'm not expecting a huge growth spurt or anything after you leave high school, but the younger characters all look and act like the kouhai of the middle schoolers in Evangelion whilst the older ones are pretty much the grown-up Evangelion characters with some of the blandest designs you'll ever see. It would have been an improvement to just have them all wear black face.\\n\\n\r\nThe anime is written by Naotaka Hayashi, whose previous works were about taking high-concept sci-fi and proceeding to just throw it in the background whilst focusing on characterization that's basically just putting a bunch of nerd tropes together and giving them one gimmick that's not even all that important to the story half the time. But if those semicolon adaptations are the equivalent of a romance film starring Ryan O'Neal, Plastic Memories is the direct-to-video sequel that was never made because it was too stupid for the world to see. And it\u2019s not just because I find the show overly manipulative. In fact, I think detractors in general overuse that criticism, never taking into consideration why and how something can even be considered overly manipulative in the first place. You can\u2019t just say \u201cI hate manipulation\u201d because as I myself keep saying, ALL drama is manipulative. Even Mufasa\u2019s death in The Lion King is manipulative, and it\u2019s still considered by many to be one of the best achievements in western animation to this day. \\n\\n\r\nBut whilst it wasn\u2019t the only reason why said scene was powerful for most people, at the end of the day, you can\u2019t deny that The Lion King in general is a big film with grand ambitions beyond an annoying Jonathan Taylor-Thomas character crying over his dead daddy. Plastic Memories, on the other hand, is literally all about some bland guy we don\u2019t even learn anything about getting sad about the fact that his dog is dying. Except in order to increase the manipulation, said dog is actually a small moe girl. I don\u2019t claim to be an expert of the genre, but practically every single story about a dog from Old Yeller to that Silverfang anime from the 80s has always been sad, because they always involve parting with \u2018em and...well...is there any way to spin a happy tale out of that? What matters is how you use said tragedy from representing growth to...erm...representing growth, and Plastic Memories doesn\u2019t even do that.\\n\\n\r\nBy the end of this incredibly padded story - because someone thought that repeating the same toothless joke up to three times an episode at minimum and a random incident involving some black market dealers that\u2019s never brought up again counts as a legitimate way to achieve a one-cour length from this - you know nothing new about anything. Only the main couple is important in the grand scheme of things, and they never grow up from where they started - something they were in dire need of because they have less maturity than a middle school kid who believes that Santa Claus is real and looks like Elmo from Sesame Street. There\u2019s an ambiguous closing scene involving a Giftia whose face isn\u2019t shown after a short time-skip following the final climax. And no matter how you spin it, said scene doesn\u2019t make any sense whatsoever. \\n\\n\r\nIf the Giftia\u2019s body is whose I think it is, that would ruin whatever character journey you can wring out of the main. And if it\u2019s not, then what exactly is the dude going to apply in regards to this new being? The show refuses to accomplish more than the very basics of what you can achieve with visual novel-style writing and tragedy stories in general to the point that I\u2019m practically convinced at this point that Naotaka Hayashi is less of a real person and more of an auto-generating machine when someone wants to release a VN-style anime. Bland nice guy schmuck? Check. Little moe love interest who can\u2019t take care of herself? Check. Tsundere who not-so-secretly helps the couple whilst desiring \u201cbland nice guy\u201d cock? Check. Potentially interesting world buried under banal personal problems? Check. Reminding us that Evangelion exists? Every anime does that these days, but check anyways.\\n\\n\r\nAs a result, no one from the creators to the actual characters this show is supposed to be centered on seem to be into anything, and that\u2019s pretty much why Plastic Memories fails. Even if you ignore the cardboard stereotypes, the cloying melodrama, the flat visuals, and forgettable music, this show just doesn\u2019t accomplish anything it sets out to do at all. The decision to set the anime in a futuristic worlds adds nothing to the story, the working environment adds nothing to the characters, and whatever moral I\u2019m supposed to get out of the story is buried under a lot of crappy cliches. Even Dreamworks\u2019 movies have made their agendas clear underneath their crappy pop-culture referencing and animation hiccups. And when you have less going for you than Bee Movie and Shrek 3...well then I\u2019ve got no more words to waste on you. You sad, pity party-seeking loser.",

            "content": "Watching Plastic Memories is like taking a science class. I don\u2019t why but my professor used to assign these experiments for us to do and when we finish, he always asked what we learned. Plastic Memories has this experimental feel when it takes its story in a sci-fi direction with a utopia-like setting. In a place (I assume a fictional alternate Japan) where robotics has made advancements to a point where we humans rely on them, there\u2019s all sorts of possibilities. \r\nDirected by Yoshiyuki Fujiwara with Naotaka Hayashi writing the script, Plastic Memories is an original anime not based off any material. There\u2019s a plusfor this as it will leave the audience to expect the unexpected. Also, it\u2019s studio Dogakobo\u2019s first original work. Recently they have been involved in some slice of life anime series that may or may not left an impression. Nonetheless, Plastic Memories combines element of sci-fi, drama, and slice of life to craft this futuristic story \u2013 one where humans and robots co-exist as a sort of experiment.\\n\\n\r\nA lot needs to be learned from the very few episodes. In fact, I think the first episode is one of the most important one of the series as it establishes many mechanics that carries their purpose throughout the whole duration. First, we have Giftia, a term to describe biological androids with capability to interact, understand, and function with humans. They even have emotional appeals to as seen constantly throughout the show. What makes this setup interesting is that they have a mind of their own rather than being just a mere program. Another interesting and more important element is that Gifitias have limited lifespans. According to the series, they can live up to approximately 81920 (9 years and 3 months). So when thinking about this, it can be made for a fact that the show spells out relationships that are doomed to end. What I find interesting about this addition is that the experiences the show tries to deliver will make more impact. And in a way, that\u2019s something to think about.\\n\\n\r\nAnyone who has seen Chobits or a show about human-robot relationships may be familiar with this premise. The main male protagonist Tsukasa Mizugaki becomes involved with SAI Corporation, a place where Gifitias are designed and made. His job is to actually retrieve Gifitias that are near the end of their lifespan. I guess what happens next could be fate or something but he is partnered with Isla, a Gifitia who is supposed to be \u201cexperienced\u201d in doing the task. Little did we know\u2026\\n\\n\r\nIn essence, Plastic Memories offers a little bit of everything except for giant robot wars or an android rebellion. No, what I find this series attractive in a few ways is how it handles each episode to add a little bit more and more to what it started off. Every episode shows development for our characters. In particular, Tsukasa and Isla\u2019s relationship is a core element that seems to push forward the story. From the beginning, they are not particular close. Tsukasa is a newbie so he lacks experience while Isla herself also doesn\u2019t seem to be skillful at retrieving Gifitias. So what do we have now? An unbalanced pair? Somewhat like that but there\u2019s also an odd connection between the two. The pair has one human and one android capable of interacting in human-like behaviors. They are not programmed to act like zombies but instead actually has genuine emotions. In general, we see this throughout the story from a variety of perspectives. Especially in some of the later episodes, there are cases where Gifitias and their partners refuses to surrender themselves despite knowing that an everlasting relationship is non-existent. So when it comes to Tsukasa and Isla, it\u2019s also obvious that one day, their relationship will cease to exist. That brings back to what I mentioned before as the show tests their relationship each episode. It\u2019s kind of like an experiment where both characters learns about each other and perhaps even themselves. \\n\\n\r\nWhile Tsukasa and Isla are the main focus of the show, there\u2019s also other characters that play meaningful roles. Michiru, another employee and superior of Isla, brings into the show a harsher reality of their jobs. In essence, her past shows that violence and requisition also becomes part of their society when Gifitas are forcefully terminated when due time comes. In one of the mid-season episodes, it breaks down the barriers of lightheartedness and shows a darker side of their society. Then, there are other characters such as Zack, Kazuki, Yasutaka, among others. While their roles aren\u2019t as significant as the main leads, they do also bring in a mixture of drama and comedy into the series. \\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of comedy, I have to say that Plastic Memories is a hit or miss. From the beginning, it can be pleasing especially with some of the jokes and dialogues between the main characters. Then, it gets repetitive. I mean repetitive as in the same type of recycled themes that you may find in harem-esque shows. While this series isn\u2019t a harem, there are times when it resorts to similar antics. Also, timing is a key and only on occasions do I find some of the comedy appropriate as the series progresses. In short, a middling entertainment is how I can describe the comedy. On the other hand, there\u2019s appreciation and effort given to the drama elements. Hints of romance are also evident while we see how much Tsukasa and Isla\u2019s relationship develops. And while this isn\u2019t a rom-com shoujo, there are moments that feels like so that\u2019s nicely paced and well-acted. Otherwise, this isn\u2019t at a level that will get so complex where you\u2019ll spill your popcorn. The story itself also has a rather strange pacing at times. Sometimes, the standalone episodes feels little more than a waste of time while other others has a distinctive way of story building. Neither are a major impact to the overall series in general though.\\n\\n\r\nHonestly, the artwork feels smooth. It works because of its charming visual feat and texture the studio puts into the character designs. The watercolor-like atmosphere also paints and communicates its point across; to get let the audience feel the portrayal of its setting. In fact, the setting of the series itself has credible artwork with its futuristic architecture, machinery, and of course the Gafitia. While there\u2019s nothing special to say about Tsukasa, his partner Isla does have a few peculiar characteristics. Her expressions of a hybrid stoic/emotional/cluelessness can get the audience to be quite curious of her. Other characters also shows a good amount of texture with their design. It\u2019s interesting to see how the Gafitia resemble so much like humans in physical design despite knowing that they have limited lifespans, far less than our own.\\n\\n\r\nMusic has a stronger appeal to a show like this. It\u2019s important to match the atmosphere to create a sensation and I think the show nailed it with its OST. Yokoyama Masaru (Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso, Joshiraku) composes of the music which delivers its purpose \u2013 creating a feel of sensation. I also have to give some credit to the voice actors and actresses for portraying the characters. It\u2019s not always easy to play the role of a non-human character but Isla in particular has a voice that feels welcoming to this show. Similarly, the OP and ED theme songs are coordinated with a smooth delicacy and bits of charm.\\n\\n\r\nIn retrospect, Plastic Memories has a feeling of sensitivity behind it. It told a human story about a biological android and how Isla adapted and learned from a human. There are times when it can make you genuinely feel moved by its storytelling while other times are easily forgettable. I think most of that applies to the recurring jokes for the latter as this series\u2019 comedy really feels lackluster. The romance itself, while innocent and charming, suffers from pacing. You\u2019ll also have to keep an eye on the lookout for a lot of the mechanics that makes this series possible. However, this show does represent a cutting edge of sci-fi fiction with a good dose of slice of life. Life is just seriously full of surprises at times.",

            "content": "If the memories you made while living faded after death, would you rather have not lived at all? Or would you cherish those memories to the very end? \r\nPlastic Memories is a show that, while looking mediocre and somewhat generic on the surface, is willing to tackle some pretty heavy themes.\r\nWARNING: This review will contain minor spoilers. Please keep in mind that it is difficult to write a wholesome review without revealing some of what happens. \r\nStory- 9\r\nThe story can be considered as something that you're going to end up seeing a lot. Set in the future, Plastic Memories follows the protagonist, Tsukasa Mizugaki, who,due to circumstances, was not given the chance to enter college. As a result, he ends up getting a job retrieving Giftia. Giftia being a special type of Android loaded with a synthetic soul that display almost all the traits a living human does. You've almost definitely heard something resembling this plot before, although this show does it better, due to one plot point. The Giftia have an extremely limited lifespan of roughly 9 years and 4 months. And after that lifespan reaches 0 hours, the Giftia loses all personality and memories.\\n\r\nHere is where the the protagonist and his job step in. The job of Terminal Service, where Tsukasa is employed, is to retrieve those Giftia before their expiration date, as well as terminating the program and memories planted into that Giftia. This is where those heavy themes come into play. \"Our job... Is tearing memories apart.\"\\n\\n\r\nArt- 10\\n\r\nThe way you judge the art all comes down to opinion. Plastic Memories has a definite style to the art as well as the general feel of the show. The way they went about animating captures the sci-fi aspect almost perfectly. Character movements are smooth and fluid, and the backgrounds are absolutely amazing. At some points, when characters are talking, the shading/background color will change to some other, vibrant color.\\n\r\nWhile it comes down to opinion, the art of this show is one of my favorites, and most likely will be for a long while.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters- 9\\n\r\nWhile only listed as a sci-fi show, Plastic Memories is also a slice of life, with a good dose of romance as well. Tsukasa is paired up with Isla, a Giftia nearing the end of her life span.\\n\r\nWhile Tsukasa has his own problems, and Isla attempts to come to terms with her gradual loss of functionality, they go about their job, retrieving Giftia- after understanding the feelings of the owner.\\n\\n\r\n This is where the show really shines. The side characters, or the owners of the Giftia marked for retrieval. Giftia display almost, if not all, the emotions a human does. Love, fear, hate, regret. After living with an Android like that for nine years, how attached would you be? Would you love that Android? Would you hate to let it go? Would you hate it for imitating a human? Would you regret making memories with it, only to have them torn apart?\\n\r\nThese are the heavy themes I was talking about. Almost all of the side characters are wonderfully developed, whether they are someone who refuses to let their Giftia be retrieved, or someone who hates their Giftia, calling her a liar.\\n\\n\r\nAnd let's not forget the romance aspect of the show.\\n\r\nTsukasa, as the official partner of Isla, the Giftia, is also her recognized owner.\\n\r\nVery quickly these two come to fall in love with each other. But in comes another one of these heavy themes.\\n\r\nIf you had a month left to live, would you accept the feeling of the person you loved glad to make as many memories as possible?\\n\r\nOr would you not want to hurt them in only a month's time?\\n\r\nLike I said, this is a slice of life show. While being a cute and fluffy romance, extremely heavy themes are present.\\n\\n\r\nSound- 8\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is able to capture the happy yet sad atmosphere of the show.\\n\r\nI really can't say much about the OP and ED, except that they fit the tone of the show. (Except I love the way they animated the ending.)\\n\r\nOne thing I noticed only after rewatching the show, is that the end of the opening, Isla seems to change her reaction as the show and the relationship between her and Tsukasa progresses. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment- 10\\n\r\nI love this show. It's also the only anime that almost made me cry. And I've watched Angel Beats, Clannad, and other shows that people claim made them bawl.\\n\r\nThe ending is just so damn sad.\\n\\n\r\nOverall- 9\\n\r\nKeep in mind this review is completely opinion-based, and if you disagree with me scoring it a 9, that's completely fine with me. Maybe I'm looking at the show too deeply, or I'm just a sucker for romances that develop like this, but I can honestly say that this is probably one of my favorite anime of all time. That might seem like a bold opinion, but hey, that's what it is. An opinion.\\n\r\nAnyways, I'd recommend this show to anyone who's looking for a decent romance, as this is one of the better ones that I personally have seen recently, and I'd recommend it to just about anyone who's looking for a good show.\\n\r\nHave a good day, MAL~",

            "content": "\"There's one thing about this job you need to remember: doing this job never feels rewarding.\" -Isla\r\nWell thanks for that, Isla. Sometimes that's the reviewer's life too.\r\nOnto Plastic Memories-\r\nThe Good Stuff:\r\nSound and Voice Acting: 7\r\nSo, we've got some super veterans like the awesome Megumi Toyoguchi (Revy, Black Lagoon, Winry, FMA/B) as the underutilized, but funny psycho boss, Kazuki. Sora Amamiya (Touka, Tokyo Ghoul) also heads up as Isla, and does a good job playing the airhead, naive character. There's also Mr. \"Screw The Rules\" Seto Kaiba himself, Kenjirou Tsuda. The OST is a bit underwhelming, and during some key moments is actually silent. Very forgettable.\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe Aight Stuff:\\n\\n\r\nArtwork and Animation: 5\\n\\n\r\nPretty plain, run of the mill animation. Nothing flashy, nothing outstanding, just does what it does. You've got the different characters you can tell apart by their hair color, and pretty much everyone else fades to the background in shades of brown and gray. Chibi faces, blue with shock, and all kinds of blushing are here, and teasing the girl with big boobs, if that kind of stuff appeals to you.\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe Rest (Rest in RIP, more like):\\n\\n\r\nStory and Characters: 2, 1\\n\\n\r\nI'm going to be frank- Plastic Memories is a case of false advertising. Oh but the fanboys will cry foul with how \"feelsy\" and \"sad\" it is. Yeah, it's \"feelsy\" and heartfelt if you're a complete sap sucker. Anime fans seem to be drawn to this nebulous and utterly trite idea of \"feels\" over and over in these pathetically thin \"tragic love stories\", and for no good reason. It's turning into a genre of its own, this recycled tugging-at-heartstrings narrative- so much to the point where we're literally watching the same kid and his dog die every week, with a slightly different coat of paint. If I want to watch that crap, I'll go to the Hallmark channel, dang. This show is grasping at straws for a romance narrative after starting out onto the path of what seemed to be an interesting psychological show. \\n\\n\r\nYou see, the Plastic Memories fans have conveniently forgotten how terribly paced and off topic the first several episodes are compared to what it transitions to later in the show. In the beginning, Plastic Memories was dropping lines like \"Ripping apart memories is our job\" and \"Having happy and beautiful memories won't always bring you salvation. The more beautiful a memory is, the more painful it can become\". That's some dark and heavy shit. That's not romcom material. \\n\\n\r\nFurthermore, the plot was asking questions of itself like, \"what happens to these androids when they're retired?\" and \"why is it that science only allows for them to have this limited lifespan?\" which are never addressed. \\n\\n\r\nIt's this taste of a psychological narrative about loss and the meaning of kinship and companionship that I thought this show was going to be about that interested me in it in the first place. If I were to infer what the story was about by the synopsis provided by MAL, I would not conclude that this was a story about loss and coping, along with maybe some action and a touch of comedy, mostly serious stuff. I never make note of the tags that shows are listed by, because they're irrelevant anyway, but Plastic Memories takes the irrelevance cake- it has one tag: Sci-Fi. Well Ho-lee crap, tell me something I don't know. \\n\\n\r\nKind of like the title implies, Plastic Memories has an identity crisis going on. \\n\\n\r\n-----\\n\\n\r\nThe Giftias (the androids central to the show) are imprinted with varying personalities. One of the ones retrieved (the universe term for being disposed of when their predetermined lifespan runes out) was a bodyguard for a Mafia man, another was a child for a parent, one a parent to an orphan, and all sorts of other familial relations. The effect of the loss of what's effectively a close family member is touched upon early, but dumped in favor of yet another teen romance show.\\n\\n\r\nWhile this could be a great setup for \"is it human love that we require, or a sense of companionship?\" or another existential theme about \"are the androids capable of their own thought?\" but no. They even touch on a deep political and sociological subject of \"since the Giftias are owned, can they even become people?\"\\n\\n\r\nNo, Plastic Memories is too heavy handed in exposition for that. Rather than leaving it up to the audience to decide, they just lay it all out there. Despite the completely arbitrary \"Made For TV\u2122\" drama of a 10 year life span, it's explained that Giftia owners have the option to re-use the body of the Giftia when it's retired, and they can even REPLANT THE SAME PERSONALITY inside of it! There are murmurings of \"Can the Giftias remember anything from their past incarnations?\" But this is quickly dropped in favor of \"OMG HOW SAD THE GIFTIAS ARE THIS POOR TIME BOMB OF FEELINGS WHAT DO YOU DOOOOO!?\" \\n\\n\r\n-----\\n\\n\r\nSo, despite the fact that you're hit with what you know to be end of the show in the first two episodes, and the solution is also already given... the authors decide to change gears to this melodramatic sob fest filled with tsundere side chick, overbearing people trying to live Tsukasa's life for him, and a general clusterf*ck of slice of life and cheap romance. \\n\\n\r\nYou can't even blame these plot holes on a crappy adaptation, because Plastic Memories is a WHOLLY ORIGINAL anime! The writers at Doga Kobo started off with a passable concept, and then passed the pen to somebody who just got done reading some garbage ass, written with an 8 year old's concept of love Twilight fanfic, and then tried desperately to plagiarize it while drunk! \\n\\n\r\n-----\\n\\n\r\nThe characters, much like the story, fit the title perfectly. Plastic. Fake. Artificial. Phony. \\n\\n\r\nWhat's perhaps the most damning part of how fake this show is, is that we're shown through Isla's words and actions that she, as a Giftia, has NO EMPATHY. (For the vocabulary challenged among us, empathy is being able to UNDERSTAND emotions, not feel sorry for someone- which is sympathy.) {Have sympathy for people who suffered through this show, but empathize that you understand their anger and frustration.}\\n\r\nThat's right- Giftias can't understand human being's emotions. They MANUFACTURE their own \"\"\"Plastic Feelings\"\"\"\", emotions and moods and project that outwardly. Kazuki herself explains what the feeling of regret is to Isla in episode 10, on top of how many times we see \"love\" and \"sadness\" explained to the Giftias. \\n\\n\r\nSo my question to the plot and writers is now, \"why the hell should anyone in the show {much less a viewer} even care about Giftias being taken away when their lives end?\" Sure, something that's been a staple in your life for 10 years being excised one day could hurt, but they're not humans. They're basically just glorified pets. Doga Kobo makes NO attempt at trying to make the Giftias more human, particularly because the other Giftias in the show are even more robotic than Isla is! Guess what? The best part is that they replace the Giftia's personality with a new one, for FREE! Who's to say that Isla's body isn't someone else's long gone child or girlfriend?? \\n\\n\r\nMake some new memories, Tsukasa, preferably with a real person this time. They have OKCupid in this world, right? (Also, wtf happened to nepotism in the future?)\\n\r\nTsukasa Mizugaki: \\n\r\nAge: 19\\n\r\nSex: No\\n\r\nLocation: Terminal Service (lol not the hospital morgue, but I want to kill myself)\\n\r\nInterests: crushing on robots, being a sappy, bumbling idiot, having no sense of social cues, and ignoring the advances of real women in favor of robots.\\n\r\nLooking For: A clumsy girl who refuses to talk to me and/or a hot and cold spicy redhead.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall and Recommendation: 3\\n\\n\r\nIf you want a really generic SOL romcom that starts like crap and ends with THA FEELS (or inversely, an interesting premise of a psychological show that goes Hindenburg after about 4 episodes)... Knock yourself out. \\n\\n\r\nDrop me a line for whenever you feel that fanboy rage building up after reading this one- I look forward to it.\\n",

            "content": "Plastic Memories is a show that very few people will be able to fully understand, emphasize with, and appreciate. It is a story about love, family, memories, loss, but most of all, it is a story about smiling through pain and understanding yourself.\r\nThe story is nothing amazing, as this is very much a character focused sci-fi love story with some light comedy touches. Many have complained about how the comedy takes away from the tone of the series, and while I can see that, you do have to appreciate how through the comedy, you see more about the characters than ever before. For example, inepisode three, Tsukasa Mizugaki and Isla start living together. Isla won't talk to Tsukasa, so Tsukasa does everything in his power to make Isla talk to him. While this is very much a comedic episode, it highlights two things: 1: How Isla is so disconnected from everything in her life and the world, and 2: Tsukasa's love for Isla. This is something people often forget about when criticizing this show. Another brilliant thing this comedy does for you on rewatches is to highlight the sadness of the show after you learn more about Isla.\\n\\n\r\nThe art and music of this show are also fantastic. The art design looks absolutely beautiful, with gorgeous lighting and environments, and the music often shakes you to the core. \\n\\n\r\nAnd then there's the ending scene. This is the most I've ever cried watching a form of medium... ever. Nothing even comes close. You can see the shows I've seen on my list.\\n\\n\r\nI mentioned before how very few people will, essentially, understand this anime. And this is it: It's because you can't really empathize with the characters of this show unless you are a specific type of person. I can't really go into more detail unless you've seen the show to the end. Just know this: this show is among the best I've ever seen.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, this show made me cry, smile, laugh, glare, and through it all, I was feeling such a storm of emotion and connection very few anime (or mediums) strive to create. I can't recommend this show enough.\\n\\n\r\nEdit: Okay, so I know saying some pretty pretentious stuff here, but going any more in-depth here will spoil the series. Just trust me on that.",

            "content": "This is my first review. I tried my best to keep this as spoiler-free as possible. I felt compelled to write this because Pla-Memo is my favourite anime and I found it underrated, and the current reviews are also degrading its reputation. I watched Pla-Memo for the first time 3 months ago and after re-watching now I decided to write this review, I haven't changed my mind that this is my overall favourite anime.\r\nStory: 10/10. First of all, the anime perfectly complies with its genres stated. The drama is really great, one can feel it even in the very first episode. Later on, the romancebecomes also astonishingly remarkable. And of course the plot itself is Sci-Fi as the anime is being held in some future where the \"Giftias\" become fashionable. I found many people disliking the idea of the \"Robot-human\", yes it is over-powered and may be dangerous,  but Giftias do have many advantages. Most importantly, Pla-Memo is different from any other drama anime, it is unique, the idea of giftias itself differentiates it from the mainstream drama like characters simply dying for instance. The plot is outstanding. There is also a very wide variety of events happening in merely 13 episodes, I was surprised the first time I completed the series. The first half of the season mainly focuses on introducing you to the life of the characters and their job at SAI Terminal Service. After this comes the more intense romance part, I found it just flawless. After watching the last episode you'll get me. Of course there were also comedy components in each episode.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9/10. There is not a great range of music but quality is definitely present. The opening theme and ending theme have great potential of bringing tears after you completed the series. You can even notice slight changes after each episode if you watch closely. Of course as it is a drama, there are so many sad songs, they fit superbly though. The other sounds are also very well-organised; you can get chills, there are screams, cries, laughter, but very co-ordinated balance.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10/10. Isla and Tsukasa are in the spotlight for the anime. Isla is one of my favourite characters, she is a short and clumsy giftia but has human feelings. Her past is extremely riveting, and how it is revealed throughout the anime and how her character gradually changes is so satisfying to watch. Tsukasa is not really a superlative character but he is very considerate, he greatly cares for his partner. Besides the two leading characters, we have the duo of Michiru and Zack, if one has read the manga beforehand, the presence of these two fellows can be even more entertaining while watching the anime. Michiru, the classic tsundere, and Zack casually making fun of her is so fun to watch. I also liked all the other members of their circle, Yasutaka is here for the comedy, Sherry for the seriousness, Constance is a very nice guy... and Kazuki actually plays an exceptionally important role, both in guiding the main protagonists to do their job smoothly as well as in buttressing their personal relationship. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10. The first time I completed this anime was in one-sitting of about 4 hours (from 8pm to past-midnight more precisely). It was extraordinarily emotional, \"the feels\" were real ! I felt the \"depression feeling\" that I rarely get after watching a drama (until now, only Pla-Memo and Clannad: After-Story made me feel so, comparingly, Angel Beats, AnoHana and Your Lie in April are nothing, thats my opinion). You even realise some very true stuff about life itself, I can relate, for example, like Isla's quote: \"Having happy and beautiful memories don't always bring you salvation. The more beautiful a memory is, the more painful it can become.\" That was deep. Yet, until now I did not come across any anime as beautiful as Pla-Memo, certainly that is my own idea, but all of this review is to encourage those who haven't checked the anime yet to go and watch it. However, if you do not wanna cry or get depressed, I may recommend you NOT to try this. Pla-Memo is a passionate drama, I privately love drama/romance genres like this (though this anime is distinctively special). Still, I am not saying that you are forced to cry while watching this, its all about opinions, but it is a fact that the emotions are greatly present and if you are a romantic-drama fan, it is definitely worth the try!\\n\\n\r\nOverall 10/10",

            "content": "So now that Spring season basically ended, it's time to review anime. Plastic Memories is an anime by Aniplex about this Corporation that is known for taking back these robots with human emotions called \"Giftia\" once it is time to take them back.\r\nBefore we get right into Plastic Memories, I would like point out something about Aniplex. \r\nAniplex is known for working on Angels Beats and Anohana. Just by me mentioning those two, you pretty much know what to expect from Plastic Memories.\r\n I thought Angel Beats was alright, but it's praised for having such a sad ending and many tragic moments. I found theshow to lack character development and the pacing was awfully rushed. It would've been a great show if it took its time to present the story in a better way and if the show was 24 episodes. Worst of all, I didn't find it to be really all that sad.\\n\r\nI can't say much about Anohana; I watched 3 episodes and it's now on-hold, but for what I've heard, it has \\n\r\n\"The saddest animu ending evaaa!!\"\\n\r\nFor what I watched in those 3 episodes, it felt like nothing was really happening and it was all just a build up to a sad ending. \\n\r\nAnd now we have Plastic Memories, which is being called the \"saddest animu of this year!!\" \\n\r\nWhere do I stand with this\\n\r\njudgement? Well...\\n\\n\r\nPlastic Memories wasn't good, it was pretty bland. The first episode was actually pretty good, I was very interested in the story and the concept it presented. Though, the characters looked extremely generic and boring, they weren't too bad in the first episode. But then the show took this really weird direction, for some reason. \\n\\n\r\nPlastic Memories has only one tag and that tag is \"Sci-fi.\" I can understand if this was the tag for the first episode and maybe the second, but everything after it isn't a sci-fi at all. It's a complete RomCom that has some sci-fi elements from time to time, but nothing to call the whole show just a \"sci-fi\" anime. \\n\r\nThe story is actually pretty interesting and something I wanted to see play out well, but it was never focused on it. It all just feels like the show had a great direction, but then an idiot changed the script. Episode 3 is the start of this series starting to build this RomCom and drifting away from the plot we were supposed to be focusing on. Lots of stuff are introduced throughout the series when it tries to go back to the actual plot, but they barely explain it and it ends up leaving a few plot holes. I think Plastic Memories should've balanced the plot with the romance instead of just ignoring the plot entirely, just to focus on the very generic and boring romance. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters were all dull and none of them felt like real people. If the show is not gonna focus on the plot much, then they need great characters to keep the show going. Unfortunately, this was a complete waste. The dialog in the show was very standard and made the humans feels like robots more than the actual robots. The characters are utterly bland and are flatter than a 4 year-old's ass. \\n\\n\r\nIsla is one of the Giftia's that is working with our male main character, Tsukasa. Isla is simply a loli and there isn't much to say about her. She's the typical shy girl that slowly opens up to the main character. She's not well developed and she's not interesting at all.\\n\\n\r\nTsukasa is super generic, bland and just very uninteresting. He's the nice main character that is very shy. You never really care for him and I never found myself liking his character at all. I didn't hate him, I was just not invested in his character. \\n\\n\r\nThe other characters simply feel like plot devices to get our main characters together before the ending. Also, most of them are characters you would expect in a generic RomCom, like the typical Tsundere. The whole show is just one build up to the ending, that you can predict after watching 2 or 3 episodes. Everything that happens can be predicted easily, not only because it's very easy to spot and they make it extremely noticeable, but also, because it has been done to death already. It's not unique in any way and has nothing new going for it. Now, I'm not saying that you have to be completely original and not do something that has been done before, but at least give it a new spin instead of making me watch the same show I've watched before. I mention this because some people would bring up that making something original these days is very hard, and I completely agree, but making the exact same show with very little change to it is kinda lazy. I mean, Plastic Memories tried to do something new with the plot, but it never focused on it well after the first 2 episodes.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation was pretty standard Romantic Comedy kind of animation. Nothing really stands out and it never impressed me, it was just pretty average. The soundtrack is not really worth mentioning. It's alright, the OP is good and the ED is good, but the score is pretty average. The character designs were completely generic. The thing that bothered me so much about them, is that the mains looked exactly like the mains in Absolute Duo, which I just wanna forget about by now. \\n\\n\r\nThe comedic episode in Plastic Memories never felt like they belonged in the show. Especially just little moments in the show where they just make a very out of placed joke, that wasn't really funny at all. Like, yeah, that is completely subjective, you might find it hilarious, but you're supposed to know when to place the comedy. You're not supposed to place comedy seconds after a very serious and dramatic scene. It's very unbalanced and it ruins every sense of emotion behind it. It's like a bipolar person wrote the script at times, and said, \"Well, fuck this guy, let's kill off everyone and now, for a very well placed joke to make everyone feel better.\"\\n\r\nIt just ends up reminding me of the comedy in Your Lie in April. Only that in Your Lie in April, the comedy is sometimes delivered in a good moment, but Plastic Memories has no idea when it's time for a good moment.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Plastic Memories is a huge disappointment for people that liked the first episode like I did. The whole thing is a build up to the ending, which actually wasn't bad, but the journey to get to that ending kinda was. I would be lying if I said I wasn't entertained while watching it, but it's mostly because I had nothing else to do. Now, I'm aware that some people will enjoy this show, and that's not a bad thing. I'm only saying how I feel about this anime, and if you're a person that would be bothered by the things I mentioned in my review, then I would suggest you skip this one. I'm pretty sure that most of us can agree that this had potential to be better, and I'm gonna give Plastic Memories a 4/10.\\n\\n\r\n\ud83d\udea8\ud83d\udea8\ud83d\udea8Spoiler Section\ud83d\udea8\ud83d\udea8\ud83d\udea8\\n\r\nThis is gonna be a quick spoiler section for the ending. If you don't want the ending spoiled, then please skip this, if you already watched the show or you don't plan on watching it, then keep reading.\\n\\n\r\nWhy the fuck didn't Tsukasa do anything about Isla at the end of the show? If you don't know, Isla basically dies or they simply take her back. But I mean, Tsukasa didn't try to somehow save her? She's not dead, she's just sleeping forever. There was so much potential to be had with this anime, but the writers didn't care. After the credits of the last episode, we see Tsukasa coming back months after to work with this new person. Exactly when that happened, it reminded me of the ending for Angel Beats. \\n\r\nReally, Aniplex? No fucking creativity at all? \\n\r\n\"Oh, it's supposed to be sad, because she dies.\"\\n\r\nThe only thing that died was the potential for an anime that could've been alright. \\n\r\n\ud83d\udea8\ud83d\udea8\ud83d\udea8 End of Spoilers \ud83d\udea8\ud83d\udea8\ud83d\udea8\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

Its quite simple, Plastic Memories hit me so hard in the feels I couldn't stop thinking about it for days. I loved the relationship between the two leads, It seemed so real and genuine to me. Their romance was a natural progression that felt satisfying and heartwarming, it was the most human relationship I've seen in anime so far. It really got me good. Would recommend to anyone looking for this kind of thing, it's a slow burner.\r\nAlso, in my opinion, I feel its best not to binge this one. Take your timewith it, like one or two episodes a day, I think this helps build a familiarity between you and the characters, making the impact of the ending more powerful.",

They have an operating period and as soon as this deadline ends, they start loosing its memory and end up becoming threats to people, so they have to be collected, but this time is about of nine years, more than enough time to develop a good relationship with your giftia, and that's the main purpose of the anime.\r\nOn the issue of drama, it can be avery dramatic anime, when you anxiously want to know what will happen in the next episode. The comedy is good, but is not the strongest point in the anime, it was a good point to create an affection with the characters, but as I said, it's not the strongest point of the anime. About the romance, there's that one typical problem faced by the protagonists in almost every romance anime, where they are concerned about frivolous things and end up taking many time to develop a relationship because of theirs shyness and other trivial reasons.\\n\\n\r\nHere are my grades:\\n\r\nStory (9/10): For me the story is very good and with a good focus, it wanted to demonstrate that even having little time to create good memories to someone, it's better than have not created any. In the beggining, this anime presented all the plot and in my opinion the story became a little predictable, I mean, it became easy to know what would happen throughout the course of the anime, not as much as turning que anime less enjoyable, but that is a small negative point.\\n\\n\r\nArt (10/10): The art of anime is very beautiful as well as most anime coming out, nothing important to say here.\\n\\n\r\nSound (10/10): As far as openings, sound effects and OST's are very well made and give pleasure to my ears, on openings and endings, I think it is something extremely important for an anime, and they pleased me a lot.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter (9/10): There are several characters that have very different personalities, are typical characters of anime, but hefty well, everyone has their defects and their abilities.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment(9/10): I have to admit that sometimes I felt very anxious to see the next episode, but there were also times when I had almost no desire to watch it, but the anime itself is very pleasurable to watch and so this grade is nine.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: (10/10): I think the anime is really a masterpiece, the end is great and full of feelings, many people criticize the end saying it was very predictable and obvious, but in my opinion was a realistic end and so unexpected.\\n\\n\r\n-POSSIBLE DANGER OF SPOILER-\\n\r\nThe end of the anime is very criticized, because they say it was obvious and predictable, but the truth is that what was expected was to be a final in which everything would be fine and they would be happy in the end by some miracle, what would be technically impossible, so I do not think that was obvious and much less predictable, was a great, realistic and perfect end, Isla was happy and so was Tsukasa, they made what they wanted to do and Isla could rest in peace.",

            "content": "Memories are the thing that we all impact us in different ways.  Pleasant memories give us a feeling of warmth and comfort.  Traumatic memories give us sadness and despair.  And the memories of people that have long disappeared are the ones that cause us to have both kinds all at once.  So when you lose the ones you cherish so much, how exactly would you react?  Here, a review of Plastic Memories, an anime that deals with such a hard question with relative success.\r\nStory (7.33/10): Plastic Memories, or Plamemo in the shorthanded version of the name, features a technologically advancedworld.  In this world, the corporation known as SAI Corp. have developed an android called a Giftia, that is so much like a human, that the two are almost indiscernible from one another.  However, unlike humans, Giftias have one major flaw, they can only function for a maximum of 81,920 hours (roughly 9.3 years) until their programming starts to fail and they become corrupt and unable to function.  (Although, I'm not really sure how specific we are here when it comes to indiscernible.  Not quite sure if an android is capable of certain bodily functions like waste disposal or reproduction, because apparently the only real difference they have from humans is their lifespan.)  As a result, a branch of the SAI Corp. called the Terminal Service goes and retrieves the Giftias that have their lives almost expired.  Here, we follow the story of our main protagonist Tsukasa, as he starts his job in the terminal service, where he meets a Giftia known as Isla.\\n\\n\r\nQuite simply, the entire runtime of the anime revolves around Tsukasa and the job of the Terminal Service, where our main protagonists Tsukasa and Isla go around the city and pick up Giftias that are almost expiring.  However, that isn't all that the story has to offer.  In addition to the retrieval stories where the show focuses on the lives and the memories that the characters witness as they retrieve the spent Giftias, it also puts a lot of time into Isla and her backstory since Isla is a veteran member of the Terminal service group.  The issue with this is that there's an imbalance between these two, with the majority of the story focusing on Isla rather than the retrievals that was shown at the beginning to midway of the story.  Personally, I would've preferred the stories about other Giftias more so than seeing an episode about Isla since a good chunk of those episodes that focus on Isla don't really have much impact in the long run.  This is mostly due to the fact that the show spends essentially its second half on one character rather than side stories that could have had as good if not greater impact.  \\n\\n\r\nIn addition, the show has a bit of a comedic issue with it.  A lot of the time, Plamemo has a lot of more serious moments, tackling the issue of memories of other people and the morality of ripping away these people apart from one another, only leaving the memories behind as its main point.  But it also has a lot of plot points that serve to be more comedic, some haha moments.  This creates an issue because a lot of the comedy feels misplaced and completely out of left field.  It doesn't really meld with the current situation as well as one might think, and it, in several instances, killed the mood that was going on.  \\n\\n\r\nAnother problem I found was that the plot itself was actually rather predictable.  We have an object that has limited lifespan, and we have the main heroine who is that kind of object.  (I'll give you three guesses.)  As such, the impact that the series had really didn't show all that much.  There were moments which I felt in the series were really good and not that predictable, but those were the episodes and story points that focused on other Giftia, not Isla.  Also, the show kind of turned table as to what kind of show it was towards the end, turning into more of a rom-com, so that was also a slight issue.  \\n\\n\r\nIn the end though, I really didn't have a sense of satisfaction with the way Plamemo ended.  It was a very anticlimactic ending and it just sort of...ends.  Personally, I would've liked to have a little bit more drama or a little more something because everything just went far too smoothly, making me doubt that it was going to, only to see that it was actually going to end the way I thought it.  \\n\\n\r\nOverall, I felt that Plamemo had a very good direction that it was going in, but took a different route.  The comedy felt out of place at times, the show was fairly predictable, and it didn't really stick with one direction to go towards, rather, going towards two directions in which both felt somewhat unsatisfying in the end.  Regardless, with the areas of the plot that focused more on the side character stories, I felt like the show really excelled in that regard and brought the theme of memories and how they affect us forward in a great way.\\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+ Great character side stories\\n\r\n+ Good expressiveness of themes\\n\r\n-  Plot was predictable \\n\r\n-  Show went two directions, resulting in unsatisfying storyline\\n\r\n-  Comedy felt misplaced a lot and clashed with story\\n\\n\r\nCharacters (7.10/10): Characters in Plamemo are separated into three categories, the main characters, the terminal service characters, and the retrieval characters, each with their own plus and minuses to be had.\\n\\n\r\nLet's start with our main protagonist, Tsukasa.  Tsukasa as a new employee of the Terminal Service is shown in a fish out of water style, where he has zero clue as to what he's supposed to do and has to learn from the people already working there in order to properly do his job.  As the series goes along, Tsukasa starts to gain a bit of character development, connecting and understanding with the people that he takes Giftias away from, even going to the extent of apologizing for what he has to do out of sympathy.  While that's good and all, a lot of the time I feel like Tsukasa's really just an afterthought on account of the show focusing more on Isla and having Tsukasa rely on her for any semblance of character development.  Because the series doesn't actually focus on Tsukasa specifically most of the time, the amount of development he gets doesn't really go much in depth as I would've liked, and as a result, has some points that really feel a bit unnatural.  (Cue end of episode 8.)  \\n\\n\r\nAnd then, there's Isla.  Isla as the main female protagonist in this series is a Giftia who hasn't been out in the field retrieving other Giftias on account of some events in the past.  At first, she's shown to be very robotic, acting almost like an android rather than a person.  But as the show goes on, we are revealed as to why she acts the way she does and we start to see the relationship between the two blossom, which actually does put some positive feeling back into the series.  But the problem I have with this is the fact that the show doesn't really use the time between the characters as proficiently as it could've.  Several scenes, and even episodes are devoted for these two characters, but doesn't actually have much of an impact, resulting in wasted time.  I wish the show didn't begin focusing on strictly Isla till the very end, because like that, the show gets a progressional feel of character as you weave in points of character development through every episode.\\n\\n\r\nAnd then, the side cast.  As I had mentioned before, the side cast for Plamemo is separated into two groups, the Terminal Service, and the other families with Giftias ready for retrieval.  When it comes to the latter, that's when I feel like the show really shines because we have these connections between these Giftias and these people that our main characters have to break, leading to some dramatic and well-written scenes and moments.  It really ties into the show's central theme of memories and how they affect us, which is why I believe the show would've done better if it spent most of its time in that regard.  It's a case of \"you won't remember their names, but you will remember their stories\", which is something about Plamemo that I really like.  As for the terminal service people, they're really for the most part, comedic fodder.  There are several characters within this group that do have plot significance, like Kazuki, but for the most part, they're really just there to either move some part of the plot along, or create comedic moments.  I say this because a lot of them are pretty one-note.  (Aka, Michiru with her tsundere personality, Eru, who's pretty much just a pervert, the Terminal Service chief who sort of just complains about his family problems, and Yatsuka who basically just tries to hook Tsukasa up with girls.  Zack's teasing personality is great though.)\\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+ Retrieval targets are great characters\\n\r\n+ Main character development is decent\\n\r\n- Main MC development felt like a bit of an afterthought\\n\r\n-  Terminal Service crew mostly felt like comedic fodder\\n\\n\r\nArt and Sound (8.28/10 and 7.45/10): The art for Plamemo was created by Doga Kobo, an animations studio that's been known to do a very specific style of animation involving a very light color palette and their signature adorable, pupiless eyes.  Similarly, Plamemo has the same kind of artstyle that feature more of a neon palette of colors, with all of the scenery and characters exhibiting a very bright look to them.  The show itself does look good, but it doesn't really scream to me that it's very outstanding for the most part.  Still though, there are some moments where I feel like the art really does go into these great looking scenes which is always a nice plus.  \\n\\n\r\nIn terms of sound, Plamemo showcases a very wishful and pleasant sounding OP which I personally feel is one of the better OP's in Spring 2015.  It's a very calming song that really sings to the ideas of losing the ones whose memories you have while also having a very hopeful and mystical vibe to it, which brings it to be a decently memorable track to listen to.  As for the ED, the ED just feels a bit generic, with the song being a happy-go-lucky sounding song that I feel doesn't really have much of an impact or is all that impressive.  Good sounding, but it's not really all that memorable.\\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+ Great moments in art in the show\\n\r\n+ Good OP\\n\r\n-  Bit of a lackluster ED\\n\\n\r\nPersonal Enjoyment (7.01/10): When I first watched Plamemo in the beginning, I initially related it to Chobits, seeing as how both shows talk about the result of a super advanced android in the world where we see the effects that said android have on the state of the world overall, as seen with both shows utilizing stories of characters impacted by the androids.  But as I continued watching Plamemo, I was a bit confused as to why the show changed focus and eventually, I found it to be a bit boring, since the information that was given in the beginning had already written out its ending.\\n\\n\r\nDid I like this show?\\n\\n\r\nI in fact did enjoy this show to an extent.  As I have stated before, the parts where the show features stories of other Giftias and their lifespans were really I felt were the high point of the show.  They really related to the theme of the show fantastically, and I felt like the show itself was at its best when those stories were being told.  I also really liked the character Zack.  He teases everyone, and it's funny to see him tease the characters and see him just give an expression of him just not caring about the situation.  His comedy I think was the best.\\n\\n\r\nWhat didn't I like about this show?\\n\\n\r\nThe biggest thing that I didn't like about this anime was the fact that the show focused on Isla way too early.  The show flip flops with its plot focus, going from a random Giftia, to Isla, back to another Giftia, then back to Isla again before fixating itself on Isla for the rest of the show.  Personally, I felt like this broke up the flow of the show because while the show finished up one thing, it changed its tone completely before switching again, making it a bit of a weird watch because it was hard to tell whether the show was going to focus on one thing or the other.  The lack of development for the main characters also bothered me because I felt like the show should've put a bit more into Tsukasa given how he's not really all that well explained in the series and how he mostly relies on Isla to have any semblance of  character development.  I was also not really fond of the fact that the show ended up turning into a rom-com because it felt a bit sudden that it just completely changed.  \\n\\n\r\nWould I recommend this show?\\n\\n\r\nWhile Plamemo isn't entirely perfect, the show itself still does talk about the themes of memories and their impact to people which is well written in some parts of the show.  It has some issues with the way it wants to structure itself, but it still is a good watch to one that enjoys a story of drama and loss.  (Though personally, I feel like the show is less sad than people actually make it out to be.)\\n\\n\r\nOverall Score: 7.42/10",

The concept of androids with a limited lifespan is interesting, and the way that they leave theending up to interpretation were definitely some of the best parts, but to keep from spoilers I'm leaving this part here.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 10\\n\r\nThe art is gorgeous in this anime, the scenery itself is so nice to look at, and the character design is great. The facial expressions are definitely the high point, as they look extremely human without being uncanny.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10\\n\r\nThe OST is a great addition to an already good show, even though there is a very small selection of music, they do so much with it that it's astounding. The voice actors all do extremely well at their roles. I can't say too much here as I'm not one to pay much attention to sound, but I can say that is was amazing for what I did hear.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10\\n\r\nEvery character in Plastic Memories is great in some way or another, the characters that need development get development, and the others that don't are there as a foil for our main characters. My personal favorite character is Zack, who's both extremely adult and childish at the same time. Every character has something, and you'll more than likely find a favorite.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10\\n\r\nIt's a fun show to watch, it knows how to do everything it wants to do, and is generally an amazing anime. A common comparison that is brought up is Shigatsu, which is another great anime, but Plastic Memories does everything that Shigatsu did, but better. Shigatsu was melodramatic, but Plastic Memories was just dramatic. Shigatsu had horribly timed comedy, but Plastic Memories uses comedy to show the ups and downs of everything in the universe of the anime.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 10\\n\r\nYou know, it's kind of funny, for an anime about androids, Plastic Memories is the most human anime I've seen in a while, it shows the ups and downs of a relationship, and really delves into some really deep things. If you know what you're getting into, you're gonna really enjoy Plastic Memories.",

My case in point is their lack of a manual, a lack of a tour and explanation of their product and how things work to the new employes.\r\nI can forgive the main character for not knowing anything about the giftia but for a company to not even have a manual for its new employes to read and find out how the giftia function and whatis expected of both the human and giftia, on top of all this the company failed to notify the office that the main character will be working with so they did not have a partner for him.\\n\\n\r\nNow on to the poor guys coworkers, who mind you are not any better then the higher ups. They fail to tell him that his partner has only so many hours of run time left and that is why she is messing up so much, as a matter of fact they seem to all be rather bland character just there to be in the background and do nothing but provide the info our main character needs when the plot demands it to be so.\\n\r\nThis gives the whole show a rather scripted feel and I have no incentive to find out anything more about the world or the characters because of it, speaking of scripted.\\n\r\nIt seems non of the people who buy Giftia know that those things have a 9 year and 4 month running time, if this is another poor choice of the company or just scripted to add more \"emotion\" to the other wise bland show. I do not know which it is but both are just as bad.\\n\\n\r\none good thing it has is its sound and art, the art really matches the little feeling there is and all the feelings you do get are from the sound which matches very nicely.\\n\r\nI would recomand this to any storyboard writer to know what not to do but that is about it.",

Although I am sure you already know that if you've read the sypnosis, but...\r\nI was in rest ofwatching anime for at least 2 months when I come to know this. What made me watch this series is from a classmate's recommendation. I accepted his recommendation because at that time, I was finding for something sad. I don't know why but that's that. He said it was sad, so I played along and found another masterpiece made by the anime industry.\\n\\n\r\nThe story centers around Tsukasa, a man who failed in his work applications and started working in a company whose task is to retrieve Giftias, cyborgs who are the nearest imitations of human life (except reproduction. What a boring life they must lead. Joke.) and delete all data from them in order not to have complications. They bleed, they eat, they have emotions and have distinct personalities which makes them difficult to distinguish whether one is a Giftia or Homo sapiens.\\n\\n\r\nThere he meets Isla, his Giftia partner. That would be the start of series' story. \\n\\n\r\nThe story was quite tear-jerking fpr its dramatic scenes. Lots of events where some lost their beloved Giftias, which are certainly something to relate about, something that cannot be gotten over so easily. The story was purely outstanding, even though there is an obvious cliffhanger at the end. T-there a-are a-a-also some *hic* comedic rou-routines situated wi-wi-within, which makes it more sad in the end. Please give a me tissue. I-I'm c-crying over here. *hic*\\n\\n\r\nThe art utilized along with the character designs were purely amazing to my eyes, examples are the Giftia retrieving scenes and \"THAT\" scene in the last episode. I also found the portrayal of technologies and somehow, battles to be truly stunning. Well executed. Not lacking and never had a surplus. Just perfect.\\n\\n\r\nThe character designs are also perfect to consider. Especially that tsundere orange-haired woman, her Giftia partner, our main character and last but not the least, Isla herself who had one of the most pulchritudinous designs ever made in history (in my opinion, my biases and my thoughts) of anime. I don't know why I'm saying this, but nevermind that and move on to the next part.\\n\\n\r\nThe music and OSTs in this anime was also something that cannot be gotten over so easily. Especially its two themes: \"Ring of Fortune\" and \"Asayake no Starmine.\" The latter was so good that I use it for alarms so that I wake up immediately. The OSTs situated in the anime was also great that it was used and blended perfectly upon the events currently happening in the story.\\n\\n\r\nNow with the characters.\\n\\n\r\nThey each have distinct personalities, whether if they are humans or Giftia. Again, there is s jolly yellow-haired boy, a tsundere, a kuudere shirogami (white hair) and our main character. Each of them is unique in their own way and gradually develops as the story progresses. In other words, they are so well-made that they are some ones I cannot get over so easily. I might be saying this for a while now, but they are truly outstanding in my own accord.\\n\\n\r\nI also enjoyed my time spent watching Plastic Memories. What I got was mixed emotions: happiness, sadness, enjoyment and utter satisfaction. The scenes were so great! Need I say more?\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I would say Plastic Memories is one more masterpiece created by the anime industry. Great visuals, a great story, though I kind of need a second season in order to answer my questions. Great characters, great music, and excellent overall. I'd recommend this for someone who likes romances yet ends up as a tragedy.\\n\\n\r\nNow, if your life was already predetermined...what will you do? Will you accept it? Or find ways in order to defy it? Me? I don't have an idea.\\n",

            "content": "Plastic Memories, a romcom drama that despite not being the saddest anime to date, left me closer to tears than any other anime, and I've seen big tear jerkers like Clannad AS. The reason why is simple: while it is a Sci-Fi anime, the unfairness of reality is also expressed, and it's something that I really connect with. It's not just the heartwrenching job of the Terminal Services, specializing in \"ripping apart memories\", but the question, \"If you knew you were going to die soon, what would you do?\"\r\nPlastic Memories takes the feel train for a different ride. While most dramas give you a ticketright before the train leaves, Plastic Memories makes you preorder the ticket way in advance. While some would say, \"I know what's going to happen, thus I won't be sad at all! What a bad drama!\", I believe that sometimes knowing the outcome makes every action before that outcome twice as impactful. It takes guts doing something knowing that it will hurt you in the end, yet that's what Plastic Memories is all about. It's about living life to the fullest, cause most people in the real world won't know when their lives will end.\\n\\n\r\nRemember now, I'm not an anime reviewer. I'm not even that serious of a watcher. I'm a casual, and as a casual, I believe all anime (correction: most anime) have good points and are worth watching. If an anime makes you laugh, cry, or whatever at any point, then it was #worf. Plastic Memories did that, and A LOT. There are a lot of funny moments, a lot of sad moments, and a lot of the times they are back to back. \\n\r\nPros:\\n\r\n- Characters are extremely likable in my opinion. \\n\r\n- Feels train hits often and hits hard.\\n\r\n- Art is really nice, although it isn't really anything special.\\n\r\n- Although the OST isn't special either, there are moments when the songs really hit you. Also, sometimes they make the silence deafening, which is cool.\\n\r\n- Isla makes the most hilarious faces.\\n\r\n- Interactions between characters are sweet.\\n\r\nCons:\\n\r\n- Some characters could be developed more.\\n\r\n- Could have been stretched to a 24 episode show.\\n\r\n- This anime isn't exactly \"remarkably special and unique.\"\\n\\n\r\nStory: 9\\n\r\nI adored this story. Doesn't matter if it isn't the most dramatic or unique story, I loved it. Every story has its flaws, and this one is no exception. But the way the characters develop together is heart warming and it really left an impact on me. If a story changes your life, even just by a little bit, it's a good story. Despite my love for the story, there are parts where I am not fond of, particularly how fast the two main character's relationship developed seemed a little forced, but I ain't complaining.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9\\n\r\nWhile it's nothing unique like Shaft Studio stuff, or extremely fancy and detailed like the Fate series, it still gives a warm feeling. The art style resembles the art of Engaged to the Unidentified, which is a personal favorite of mine. Isla is adorable, Zack's facial expressions are hilarious, and visually this anime is awesome.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 7\\n\r\nNot much of an OST, but the OP is one of my all time favorites. I'm a songwriter, and after learning the OP on the piano, I must say it's a well written piece. The chord progressions are nice and the key changes between C minor and F minor are pretty creative. The voice actors did a pretty good job.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10\\n\r\nIsla is definitely one of my all time favorite characters in anime. Her outlook on life and her confident yet clumsy attitude makes her extremely likable, but despite how she looks, she isn't innocent. She's just living her life to the fullest, and I found that inspiring. All the other characters were amazing as well, filling their roles perfectly. The main character also goes through a lot of development with Isla.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10\\n\r\nI watched this show at an emotional time of my life, at which point the message that this anime tells you was extremely relatable too. As a result, I ended up loving this anime more than me if I watched it at some other point in my life. Doesn't matter, got hit by a train.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9\\n\r\nNot many shows can make me feel such extremes, in both happiness and sadness. Angel Beats comes close, but not quite as much.\\n\\n\r\nI hope one day you'll be reunited with the one you cherish.\\n",

            "content": "Since this series ended, I want to give my full thoughts on Plastic Memories. A series that many would like, or, despise. Despite the flaws in the show I found at least some meaning behind the show and that it\u2019s telling us something so we can all remember wisely. But take a note that this opinion is my own, so if you disagree with me then it\u2019s fine. We all agree, we all disagree, this is how the anime community works.\r\nStory: 6/10\r\nFor starters, let me give you a brief summary of the story. The setting its in a futuristic setting where these Giftias exist, wherethey are assigned to different people, however they have a time limit of 9 years, and after that expires, they are retrieved by the Terminal Service. It had a nice premise, where these characters with the giftias do not want to give up and they do not want to lose them. It\u2019s something that happens in our every day lives. Apparently this comes to play. Our main character Tsukasa, works in this Terminal Service Company with another Giftia called Isla. The story revolves not only on the central point of the story, it also concentrates on the relationship between our two characters. My only issue with this is that they firstly took most of the half the time to concentrate on their relationship, which kind of leaves the whole central point of the story (where our characters retrieve the Giftias) aside at least for a little bit. But at the same time the relationship between them turns something bigger after a while. But I wish they could balance both of these things so we can at least have somethings on around. But the build up on their relationship was fine.\\n\\n\r\nAnother issue would be one of the specific anime leaving some plot holes, but its kind of minor if you ask me. The story at least its decent and it shows a little message to everyone of us as well.\\n\\n\r\nArt/Animation: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nThis might be the strongest point of the anime series. This series was made by none other than Doga Kobo, the studio behind the series such as Mikagura Gakuen and Gekkan Shoujo Nozaki-kun. As always they impress me with the art looking colorful, atmospheric, along with the CGI Cars looking well done. The scenarios of the series looks at least detailed and gives at least a flow with the series. As for the character designs for at the very least they look nice.\\n\\n\r\nSound/Music: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nFor the sound/music department, at the very least they make a good job in here as well, and specifically with the music, the OST is very good personally. From tension towards the most emotional moments of the episodes. There\u2019s this one song that I really like from the series where one person was singing, its beautiful.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nLet\u2019s talk about the characters for a little bit.\\n\\n\r\nTsukasa being our main male protagonist, got at the very least a good relationship with Isla, he\u2019s a character that would not let go of someone precious to him, and along the way he learns a lot of stuff about the Giftias and learns how to move on at the end of the show.\\n\\n\r\nIsla, our female protagonist got one of the best developments in the anime series. She\u2019s starts out in the start anti-social and shy. She gets a backstory where we understand why she turned this way, and she then after a while develops into another person, that is capable of accepting others once again and become more social.\\n\\n\r\nMichiru is one of those archetype tsundere characters, but she got backstory as well where we understand why she\u2019s worried about the wanderers situation in one of the episodes. This makes me like her character for a bit and as the time passed I liked her a bit more, but not enough to say she\u2019s incredible. She does participate in the series and supports the characters, the very least I can say here.\\n\\n\r\nKazuki, one of the female characters that was a former partner of Isla, actually develops as well, she learns from this show her mistakes that she did in the past 3 years ago, and learned how valuable life is, and supported Isla afterwards and helped her to become the old self again. She learned that separating someone from another is not the answer, because it\u2019ll hurt even more.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the other characters they haven\u2019t got development but they are very entertaining to see them interact to one another.\\n\\n\r\nPersonal Enjoyment: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nAlthough with these flaws I still like the show for what it is. Heart warming, sweet, emotional, comical, other things I can name of. But I actually wanted the show to expand more on the world and the wanderer company, but this was satisfying the least.\\n\\n\r\nFinal Veredict: 7.2/10\\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s a series that even with the flaws, its still enjoyable to watch. I would recommend this to anyone who is either a fan of Chobits or likes heart warming and/or emotional ones.",

            "content": "Often times, anime becomes an effective outlet for limitless fictional worlds, ones that reach out far beyond the norm to accurately portray the original vision of the worlds' creators. Often times, these worlds suffer from being too complicated, too busy and too cluttered with the many ideas that have no place in a twelve or thirteen episode run. Often times, these twelve or thirteen episodes are the cause to many, many headaches of mine.\r\nAnd yet, Plastic Memories has me missing those headaches, the ones spawned from such an expansive world, because this is something Plastic Memories has failed to explore.\r\nWhile the anime provides an interestingbase concept and characters that are lovable on perhaps a surface level, it leaves much to be desired in that there are many existential questions left unexplored as they are deemed out of place in Plastic Memories' established rom-com genre.\\n\\n\r\nMuch like Chobits, Plastic Memories has the appeal of human/robot couple, but unlike Chobits, the pairing has almost nothing at stake. \\n\r\nDuring our thirteen episodes, we witness the awkward romance of Tsukasa and his robotic love interest, Isla, and throughout their narrative, nothing is pitted against them besides Isla's expiration date--an interesting aspect of the story that rarely comes up, replaced instead by a heap of filler episodes. In fact, besides this expiration date, the world of Plastic Memories has little to no conflict in it.\\n\r\nIt's frustrating to watch, because there is a towering amount of set-up for a touching narrative on loss and acceptance, and that is never fully explored! There is set-up for some sort of commentary on humanity, and that isn't even touched on! \\n\r\nI find it a crime for a show to contain the same romantic dynamic of Chobits and fly so far from the meager philosophical commentary that Chobits provides. I find it a crime for a world to contain robots heavily integrated in society and not explore that aspect at all.\\n\\n\r\nTo continue down the path of minuscule fictional exploration, the characters in Plastic Memories are incredibly underdeveloped.\\n\r\n The show is more concerned with providing the cliches present in every rom-com than it is with differentiating itself from the other members of the genre. We know very little about Tsukasa, Isla and the many side characters, in favor of simple misunderstandings and the cookie-cutter tsundere yelling about something that hardly matters.\\n\r\nWe are told things about Tsukasa and are expected to simply accept these aspects of his character, without so much as a flashback to back it up, making it very hard to sympathize with him. In fact, we get more background for the tsundere, Michiru, who receives more attention in terms of fleshing out the character than Isla, who is supposed to be the focus of the show.\\n\r\nAs a result, the cast is very one note and forgettable, often tragically struggling to make the viewers care.\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately, I don't care.\\n\\n\r\nWhen I was first introduced to the series, I was prepared to be emotionally torn to pieces by Isla's death looming over her; I was prepared for each new episode to be more painful than the last, for the tragedy of the series to be dragged out until the very last episode when mortality came to claim its eventual prize.\\n\r\nI was prepared, and instead I got romantic filler. Episode after episode features Tsukasa getting embarrassed about something new, with maybe a minute or two of screen time dedicated to the actual plot. Three episodes before the finale is a filler, and as a result, everything afterwards seems rushed and out of place. \\n\r\nThe whole tone of the show can't decide whether it wants to be depressing or silly, and while I have seen other series where both are juggled successfully, Plastic Memories is not one of them.\\n\\n\r\nTo conclude, as a romantic comedy, Plastic Memories has all the essentials to carry it through from episode one to episode thirteen.\\n\r\nAs a new, memorable and touching story, as a tragedy about a girl with so little time left, it has nothing.\\n\\n\r\nSimilar to a sandwich missing everything except the bread, Plastic Memories leaves me unsatisfied.",

            "content": "Am I supposed to cry at this show? I sure as hell didn't. It's not that I'm heartless or anything. I've cried watching other dramatic animes too but the show tried too hard to be dramatic. \r\n(There will be some SPOILERS in my review)\r\n[Story]: (4/10) (SPOILERS)\r\nPlastic Memories takes place in a world where humans have created artificial souls and bodies. These beings are called Giftia and they are indistinguishable from humans. Tsukasa, an 18 year old who failed his college entrance exams has been offered a position at the renowned SAI corporation by his father's business friend. At this point, Tsukasa has been ordered towork with Isla, a female Gifita who has never been given other responsibilities besides serving tea.  \\n\\n\r\nThe story, in my opinion, is an utter piece of crap. The show has an interesting concept and could have gone a different route but the execution is horrible. Just by watching the first episode, you already know what this show is going to be about. They're tearing up the relationship between the Giftia and a human being once \"that\" time comes and they can't really do anything about it(Hehe, not exactly). Am I supposed to cry at this point? This is the biggest problem. The show tried too hard to be dramatic without exploring some of the plot points. Ever wonder why some dramatic shows managed to make me cry? Because they're done well and executed well. The show also became a romantic drama. I wasn't even expecting romance in this show. I was expecting the show to explore the Giftia's and the breakups between the Giftia's and the Humans like what the first episode did.\\n\\n\r\nThe show also didn't answer some of my questions that I have for the Gifitas. Why are people buying the Giftias? What's up with the 9 year time limit? Why did they design it in the first place? What's the purpose? \\n\r\nI don't even know why people are buying Giftia's if they know that they're going to be separated after 9 years. These people are just asking for their hearts to be broken. \\n\\n\r\nHmm...the ending. One word. Predictable. Once you knew that Tsukasa is going to be dating Isla then you know that at some point, he's going to retrieve her. The events leading up to the ending, which is their romance, was so good. I actually enjoyed the romance between Tsukasa and Isla. However, the ending just blew it. It sucks donkey ass. \\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\r\n[Art/Animation]: (9/10)\\n\r\nThis is the year 2015 and the animation should be great. I don't tolerate animation that looks like it's made from the year 2012 or before. At least, the show managed to make a great animation. The animation looks great, the lighting also looks great and the environments are detailed. The character designs are good but could have been better and the character's facial expressions are spot on. \\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\r\n[Sound]: (7/10)\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is ok but nothing too great or special. The background theme (mostly the emotional themes) is ok and it fits with the scene that's playing on the screen. None of that really matters because majority of my score for this category comes from the OP and ED theme songs. The OP theme song is one of the most misleading song's I've ever seen. I was expecting the show to make my cry but failed to do so. The ED theme song is decent. Not bad but not great either. The VA sounds great to me but that doesn't matter either. \\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\r\n[Character]: (7/10)\\n\r\nAhh, the characters. I can't believe I enjoyed the characters more than I enjoyed the story. I mean, shouldn't it be the other way around? I'm not saying the characters were masterpiece but they were decent and I still enjoyed them. \\n\r\nThe characters are.....let's say.....they're generic and they're not original. Tsukasa is your typical nice MC guy. What's up with this kinds of MC? I've seen his kind before and it is getting annoying. Isla is a Giftia, a nice girl who is shy but eventually opens up her feelings towards Tsukasa. What do you call them? Kuudere? Michiro, a girl who has been working on SAI for a long time and does not like amateurs like Tsukasa. Michiro is a tsundere who stayed on her tsun tsun side for the entirety of the show. Kazuki is an alcoholic girl who has always watched over Isla and even protected her for about 6 years before she called of the partnership. Yasutaka is a slacker and also an alcoholic. Yep, they're pretty generic. I've seen these tropes before. \\n\\n\r\nThe reason why I liked the characters is the interaction between these characters and, of course, the romance between Tsukasa and Isla. The story may be bad but you can't deny that the relationship between Tsukasa and Isla is great. Hell, the relationship development between these 2 are great too. I admit, the development was kind of rushed but considering that this is a 13 episode series, I gotta give the rushed relationship development a pass. \\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\r\n[Enjoyment]: (7/10)\\n\r\nLike I said above, the story is an utter piece of crap and the ending is one of the worst I've seen but I still kind of enjoyed the show. The comedy is what prevented me from rating this show below 5. If it wasn't for the comedy then this show would have been a 3 or a 4. \\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\r\n[OVERALL]: (7/10)\\n\r\nSome people might say that this is one of the anime that was created by Satan himself because of how bad it is. To me, the show is decent. It's not a masterpiece and it's not an utter garbage either. If you can get past the crappy story or the over-dramatic crap that they spew at you then you might like this show. However, if you're looking for an anime with a great story or a great dramatic shows like Clannad then don't bother watching this show. \\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nPros:\\n\r\n+Great Animation\\n\r\n+Good Soundtrack\\n\r\n+Decent Characters\\n\r\n+Great Romance between Tsukasa and Isla\\n\r\n+Funny moments\\n\\n\r\nCons:\\n\r\n-Story is poor\\n\r\n-Generic Characters\\n\r\n-Overdramatic moments\\n\r\n-Crappy Ending\\n\\n",

            "content": "Plastic Memories: A misunderstood genius of 2015.\r\nThe key to appreciating this beautiful story is to realize that this is one of the few anime that draws heavily on the Japanese philosophical concept \"Mono no aware\", which can sometimes be considered a rare genre of its own. Entire books have been written on this ideology, but it can be shortened to the belief that the fact wonderful things come to an end actually increases the value of those things. The reality that life is a temporary gift is in fact one of the things that makes life so special. That the Androids in Plastic Memories arecalled \"GIFTias\" is no mere coincidence. \\n\\n\r\nThe entire point of this show is a celebration of life and death through the Buddist concept of Anicca, or impermanence. The romance and characters that exist in it are simply a way to showcase this, and the result is a fine crafted emotional roller coaster. Plastic Memories accomplishes this task by making it clear very early on that giftias have an expiration date that cannot be avoided. By doing this, it makes the audience aware of the transient nature of what would otherwise be seen as a somewhat generic romcom. To really understand this show, you must watch every scene and every moment without forgetting the fact that Isla will soon be gone, as this is precisely what the author is trying to convey. The shows futuristic, \"Ghost in the Shell - light edition\" setting greatly helps this. By using androids with souls, Plastic Memories allows the characters who are about to be deactivated remain solvent until their final moment which causes the moment of their passing to be experienced in full. \\n\\n\r\nThe only real downside of this show is that the budget isn't what it deserved. Animation is nothing special, and effects are quite limited. It isn't bad artistic quality, it just isn't any better than the average shows of 2015. This is a show you watch for character and story, not eye candy. There is really only one episode where Plastic Memories takes on the feeling of a cyberpunk action flick, and it's over quite quickly.\\n\\n\r\nPlastic Memories doesn't construct a plot by accident. The first few episodes exist to show you the transient nature of giftias through secondary episodic characters, and then building on this knowledge it then puts on a romantic tale between the main characters in order to get the audience to feel the same way. The result is one of the better bittersweet tales the world of anime has to offer.",

            "content": "Before I review this series I would like to make a couple of things clear. I gave this show a 10 so allow me to explain something.\r\n1. 10/10 does not mean perfect, as it says on the site it says masterpiece. Masterpiece and perfect/flawless are not the sme thing. I do not believe in perfect shows or perfection in general.\r\n2. All my ratings are based PURELY on enjoyment value. So even if I see something critically flawed if I'm enjoying the show enough I can simply overlook it.\r\nNow, with that out the way let's talk about \"Plastic Memories\" \r\nPlastic Memories is a truly beautiful show(I'm not just talking about art and animation although it is stunning) jut because of how it's done. At first glance the story is a standard slice of life show with a small sci-fy twist. Whilst this is true and even the ending is predictable as hell. (I could see it coming since episode 2) It all comes down to execution which is done brilliantly here. Just because of the way they did the show it is a masterpiece. The characters are all likeable and most of them truly grow over time. The comedy is well done and most of the jokes were very funny, only they got a little repetitive over time. The ending (whilst predictable) is extremely satisfying and complete. I hae never cried as much as I did after watching this show. I was still upset the next morning. In fact for whatever reason the next morning I didn't watch any anim because a voice in the back of my head said: \"If I watch something now then I'm being disrespectful to Plastic Memories!\" It's a feeling I get very rarely ater watching a show and if that isn't a sign of a masterpiece I don't know what is! \\n\\n\r\nTherefore \"Plastic Memories\" gets a 10/10 as well as a full recommendation from me.\\n\\n\r\n-Prorogon\\n\\n\r\nPS: Grab some tissues before watching this series",

            "content": "Plastic Memories was a series that seemed unsure of what it wanted to be. On the one end, it had a unique premise on paper in its focus on a retrieval service tasked with taking back androids called Giftias from their owners before their operational time is up and exploring the moral implications that come into play with both the retrievers being forced to drive apart a Giftia and their human owner, and how the various human owners have to come to terms with saying good bye to a Giftia they became close with. On the other end, we get a romantic dramedy played upwith a milquetoast male lead becoming attracted to the cute-looking Giftia girl who is among the retrieval agents that he takes up a job with. The series mixes focus between both these premises as male lead Tsukasa tries bonding with the Giftia girl in question named Isla and becomes familiar with the varying challenges that come with being part of the Giftia retrieval unit, which I found myself not really enjoying.\\n\\n\r\nMy issues with the romance angle that Plastic Memories attempts to milk has to do with my lack of interest in the two as a possible couple. Tsukasa is a bit bland for the series male lead with his idealistic and milquetoast character and while I didn't mind some aspects to Isla's character involving the Giftia retrieval premise, being clumsy and just as milquetoast as Tsukasa played more into traditional romantic comedy titles that I've grown to despise in recent years due to their superficial attempts to force comedy into the romance played out between the lead couple in question. Many of the retrieval workers are also rather bland with their characters as they mostly exist for comedic gags and to push along the relationship between our two leads.\\n\\n\r\nThe elements of Giftia retrieval explored within Plastic Memories were my main draw to the series and saved it from complete mediocrity for me. The series explores a number of the cases that the retrieval agency get into as the human owners have varying reactions and situations to dealing with parting with their Giftia with some having to learn to cope with moving on from the loss of a companion and others having come to come to terms with the developments. One episode also explores what would happen if Giftias are not retrieved before their operation time is up, making for the most suspenseful moment within the series. This element ties into Isla's character as the years she has been tasked with retrieving Giftia and her operational time running low have taken their toll on her mentally as such where she tries distancing herself from others and questions if her job is only to sever bonds with others. The series would have had plenty of potential at exploring the moral implications of the retrieval service and how one could believably cope with bonding with someone you know has more limited time than a human's natural life span to bond with. Instead though, the series opted to devote more of its time toward Isla and Tsukasa's developing relationship as it would get prominent focus by later in the show's second half, whom aren't exactly the best couple I could care for.\\n\\n\r\nAs it is, Plastic Memories was a series that had a premise with a good number of directions it could have gone with the Giftia retrieval service. Instead, the series opted to become yet another typical rom-com title with a milquetoast pairing that I couldn't find myself getting behind due to how cliched both members of the pair were. Your mileage may vary on how well you warm up to it with the differing premises it offers up.",

            "content": "If there ever was an anime that was meant to teach and in a way prepare you for what it feels like to say goodbye to a loved one, boys and girls its Plastic Dreams.\r\nI mean it was obvious here that we\u2019ll be getting a sad anime, just watch 6 seconds into the OP seeing Isla with the song Ring of Fortune playing and I already want to regret not stopping it right there. Save myself from the dreaded final episodes\u2019 cryfest and the impending depression carrying till the next few days. Even though that is exactly what ended up happening however minus the gut-wrenchingdepression because this anime did an exceptional job of preparing you for it... to not be so deadly.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is about Tsukasa and Isla. Isla is a Giftia, an immensely advance android created by Sion Artificial Intelligence Corporation that are human-like in every way but are limited to only a 9 year lifespan because due to limitations, it's memory system deteriorates. Tsukasa on the other hand is an ordinary human being who was lucky enough to get a job at Terminal Station, which falls under the Sion Artificial Intelligence Corporation where Isla is stationed at. From here it's really quite simply where the plot goes, the two become partners and eventually things kick off between them. \\n\\n\r\nI feel like I can\u2019t say anything more than that due to spoilers however I can give you a tip when watching. There will come a time through the anime where stopping it feels like the best thing for you to do, only because everything will seem perfect the way it is and you believe you have the power to pretend that the anime ends here. I had a run in with this a few times in a few episodes. I'm constantly telling myself just stop where I am because everyone is doing well and they all are happy, for me to stay happy too, I should just stop it here. Well don\u2019t because you will miss out on a lot of good yet painful memories.\\n\\n\r\nOverall I\u2019m pretty sure there a quite a few more suitable anime more fitting for what I've said right at the beginning of my review, however I really enjoyed what the creators did with the human and A.I relationship theme. I like the fact that Giftias are treated as human rather than mere machines and that there wasn't any conflicting parties who are against Giftias which would've cause a bit more drama for our main characters. Even being rather light in terms of that, it was still a very enjoyable anime, worth the watch and worth the tears. \\n",

            "content": "'If my lifespan was predetermined, I wonder how I'd handle that?' This is the first question Tsukasa Mizugaki asks himself (and the audience) in Plastic Memories, an anime where androids known as Giftia's, who only have a lifespan of 81920 hours, live together with humans.\r\nStory: 8/10\r\nThe story starts with Tsukasa Mizugaki, who after failing his college entrance exams, manages to get a job at the SAI corporation, which invented the androids with human emotions known as Giftia's. The premise of this anime is quite original and sets up for a story with some good themes. The anime follows Tsukasa as he gets partnered with theGiftia Isla, as he learns the ins and outs of working at Terminal Service One of the SAI corporation, a terminal which retrieves Giftia's who are almost at their maximum lifespan of 81920 hours. This story sets up for some interesting themes like the theme of how to live your life with a limited lifespan or the theme of how to deal with androids who look like humans and have human like emotions. Some of the characters in the anime do not see them in a human-like way for example and only sees them as tools, while others find that a cruel idea and treat them like they treat humans. The story leaves some questions though, like 'Why do the Giftia's only have a lifespan of 81920 hours?' or 'Do the Giftia's have souls like humans? And if not, could you not save their memories in a computer?'. However, the different themes the story tells more than make up for some unexplained events in the anime in my opinion.\\n\\n\r\nArt and animation: 8/10\\n\r\nThe art and animation of the anime seem to be very well done and look pretty beautiful. The overall character designs also look to be pretty well made. The animation mostly stands out in the colourful backgrounds the anime has created and the many different character expressions used in the anime. You can clearly see how the different characters are feeling at a certain moment. Adding to this that the character expressions of Isla also keep changing in the opening, depending on how she is feeling in a certain episode.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8/10\\n\r\nThe overall soundtracks used in the anime are used very well for each different scene. The opening theme and the ending theme used in the anime probably stand out the most to me, as they really set the mood for the anime and fit very well. The voice actors do a pretty good job voicing the different characters, especially voicing their emotions. Overall the sound in the anime is very good.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 8/10\\n\r\nThe characters in the anime can be a bit one dimensional at times, but their overall chemistry is very interesting to watch. Tsukasa Mizugaki is a pretty bland main character, with a personality summed up as willing to help others a lot and willing to learn a lot more. He does not have a lot of character development throughout the show except that he gets more experience in his job and life lessons. Isla is a far more interesting character, as she is a Giftia with a bit of an identity crisis. She sometimes thinks it would be better to not have emotions at all if you have a limited lifespan seen in the quote 'Having happy and beautiful memories won't always bring you salvation. The more beautiful a memory is, the more painful it can become.' She actually has quite some character development throughout the series and changes a lot compared to how she is at the beginning. The side characters are pretty one dimensional at times, but do have a nice chemistry. For example, Michiru Kinushima is the classic tsundere, but her Giftia partner Zack is very down to earth and teases her a lot about her tsundere attitude. The atmosphere at the Terminal Service One is also very nice, because of the characters.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9/10\\n\r\nOverall, the anime was very enjoyable to me. It was very enjoyable to see the different characters interacting with each other, as the partners in Terminal Service One really seemed to connect well. It also had some interesting and sometimes thought provoking themes. The premise of the anime was also quite unique and interesting to me. The romantic relationship in the anime was also pretty interesting to see evolve. The comedy sometimes was a hit or miss though. Overall it was a  very enjoyable anime to watch for me.\\n\\n\r\nBonus Categories: 8,33/10\\n\r\n---\\n\r\nComedy: 7/10\\n\r\nThe comedy overall was pretty well done, although there unfortunately were some moments where the comedy would be a hit or a miss for me. Especially in episode 3 it seemed like they went a bit too far on the comedy aspect of things, which made it a bit less funny. However, the comedy fortunately was pretty good in the other episodes.\\n\\n\r\nTragedy: 9/10\\n\r\nLike the premise indicates, this anime has a multitude of tragic events in it. The SAI corporation retrieves Giftia's who have a lot of memories with their owners and their owners often do not want to give up their Giftia, even though they know that their emotions cannot be kept for much longer. This makes for multiple emotional moments. If you are a person who gets emotional pretty quickly, this anime could let you cry multiple times.\\n\\n\r\nRomance: 9/10\\n\r\nIf you want to watch an anime with romance which actually develops, this is a very good anime to watch. The development in the romantic relationship starts slowly but gradually, making for a more realistic development in the romance.\\n\r\n---\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8/10 (8,22/10)\\n\r\nPlastic Memories is a very good anime overall. It has a quite unique and interesting premise, making for a story with some very interesting and good themes. The characters, although pretty one dimensional at times, had some great chemistry and made for a good atmosphere in the anime. It also had a combination of comedic, tragic moments and a romantic relationship that actually developed, which was pretty great. All and all it was a very good and enjoyable anime to watch.",

            "content": "Plastic Memories\u00a0is one of those shows where you know that the ending's gonna be sad, but yet you watch it anyways because you want to know what happens before that sad ending happens. But along the way, you get too attached to characters, so then you just feel depressed when you finish the show.\r\nOne of the first things the show tells you is that a Giftia's life span is only about 9 years and 4 months. So immediately, you know that Isla, who is a Giftia, is gonna die, but you can't do anything about it, so you just watch.\u00a0\r\nThere wasn't really any plot tothis show, but it more focused around the relationship between Tsukasa and Isla, as well as the character development of Isla herself. The idea of the Giftia's, however, was very interesting to witness as it was a main component to this anime. In the future, a big company created these Giftias that look and act exactly like humans do. But their lifespan is just under a decade due to the fact that their softwares decay.\u00a0\\n\\n\r\nIt's fascinating to see that this could be a possible future to our world, but even more so that we would create androids to live like normal people. The anime acknowledge the controversy in this as well, pointing out the fact that some looked at these Giftias as actual people and others considered them as just plain machines. Throughout the anime, it explores the possibilities of the roles these Giftias could take and it's really interesting to see this as a side topic to the main plot.\\n\\n\r\nPlot 8/10 - The plot was very simple, following some dramatic scenes, but mostly just surrounding the every day events of Tsukasa and Isla. Many of the episodes were very sweet and sad, seeing the retrieval of these androids, but it was great seeing how society had advanced and how the androids had their place in life.\u00a0\\n\\n\r\nCharacters 9/10 - Many of the characters were one dimensional, but by the end of the show, we have seen them develop and transform into something much more. Especially in Isla's case, we see her transition from a quiet, withdrawn person, to someone who is more cheerful and outgoing. Her personality was my favourite, but we also saw some of the other characters change as the story progressed as well.\u00a0\\n\\n\r\nArt 10/10 - The art was stunning and vibrant. They used a lot of bright colours and images that reflected the mood and tone of the piece. It was enjoyable to watch and I loved all the expressions and emotions of the characters that were shown.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 9/10 - Though not a lot happened, it was great following around the main characters as they found themselves and each other. It was a sweet romance, though sad, and I loved every part of the show. I'd recommend this to anyone who enjoys romance.",

            "content": "For my third review, I decided to go down the romance route. Plastic Memories aired in the Spring season of 2015 and surprised many with it's heart-wrenching tale of romance.\r\nStory:\r\nFirst and foremost, those going in to this anime expecting an epic sci-fi revolving around androids are going to come out the other side disappointed. The anime is a drama romance through and through. I'd recommend something like 'Ergo Proxy' or 'Psycho Pass' to fit the aforementioned criteria if that's what you're looking for.\r\nAs I said before, Plastic Memories is a sci-fi drama romance set in the far off future. In this world, robots called Giftia'sare manufactured to serve as place holders for loved ones. It's not a unique concept, and I've seen it be done before (the Steven Spielberg movie 'A.I. Artificial Intelligence' comes to mind), but where Plastic Memories excels is in it's tragic romance.\\n\r\nInstead of focusing on world building or explaining the lore behind the alternate future we're given, Plastic Memories focuses on it's romantic development between the two main characters. And it surprisingly works. It's very rare for a one cour anime to pull off a touching romance, so I applaud Plastic Memories for it's ability to do so.\\n\\n\r\nWe're shown the world from the eyes of Tsukasa Mizugaki, an 18 year old college drop-out who is offered a position in the Terminal Service Department of the SAI Corporation, the company that created and now manufacture the Giftia. Tsukasa's department's job is to reclaim Giftia from the families of those who purchased them before they expire. Expiration for a Giftia means their artificial consciousness goes haywire and corrupts, sending them into a state of frenzy. Imagine Wall-E turning into the Terminator. We're then introduced to a fellow employee of Tsukasa's called Isla, who happens to be a Giftia, and he falls in love. I'm not entirely sure how Giftia have been allowed into public release given they have such a dangerous flaw to them, but I digress.\\n\r\nThe story follows Tsukasa and Isla as they go out reclaiming Giftia from their families. It's a formula that stops from going stale due to the different ways they go about doing it and the difficulties the job comes with.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nOverall the anime was well drawn, with some specific scenes looking gorgeous. The world looked very nice and you could see the futuristic settings in everything from the clothes to the technology used.\\n\r\nHowever, the colours felt too saturated at times and that would sometimes distract me from what was being said. I feel as if Plastic Memories would have benefited from a more subdued palette. Ultimately though, the art was a fine catalyst for the story and it did it's job fine.\\n\r\nI have to give praise to the animators of the first episode in particular though - as the animation was absolutely breathtaking.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nThis was probably my favourite part of the anime. The sound direction was spectacular. One thing I loved was the way they'd ditch music from a scene completely so we'd focus entirely on the speech. It added a dramatical punch that I feel wouldn't have been there had a quiet melody been inserted into the background. It was a risky move, but it paid of well.\\n\r\nThe voice acting was fine, with Sora Amamiya doing a good job with Isla's shy character and Yasuaki Takumi managing to eventually bring me to tears with his sublime performance as Tsukasa.\\n\r\nThe opening was absolutely gorgeous, and I'd recommend that you listen to the song in it's entirety - as it truly is beautiful.\\n\r\nThe ending served it's purpose, but didn't really bring anything to the experience.\\n\r\nMasaki Tsuchiya did a spectacular job as sound director on this anime, and I'm excited to see what he does next.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nThis is probably Plastic Memories biggest flaw.\\n\r\nIt took me a good half of the anime for me to care about the two protagonists, Isla and Tsukasa, and I never once cared for any of the side characters. By the end you love them and their tragic relationship, but I can only think that if less time had been focused on the bland support the anime would have come out for the better.\\n\r\nThough as I said, I genuinely did end up caring about Isla and Tsukasa. It just took a bit longer than it should have, but that might just be me.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nI'm going to be honest, there were a couple of times where I found myself not excited for the next episode. But somewhere along the lines, you find yourself actually caring for Isla and Tsukasa and the adventures they get up to.\\n\r\nIt may go for cheap tears, and you're more than likely going to know how Plastic Memories will end by the second episode's conclusion - but it's watching the inevitable events occur that makes this anime such a treat to watch.\\n\\n\r\nConclusion:\\n\r\nI understand I'm in the vast minority of avid anime watchers by rating this show high but it hit me hard. There are some world building flaws, and the supporting characters are one dimensional and bland, but Plastic Memories never pretended to be anything that it wasn't, and it achieved it's job of making me care about Isla and Tsukasa.\\n\r\nDon't be mislead by what the first episode and synopsis tells you. \\n\r\nPlastic Memories is a slice of life rom-com. One that you won't forget, assuming you're not a Giftia.",

            "content": "By the title itself, you've probably managed to create a simple idea of what this series is going to be about - simply \"memories\". However, Plastic Memories doesn't only focus its purpose on the aspect of \"memories\". You may discover that it also covers the importance of relationships that the characters establish. Plastic Memories is a tale set near the distant future. The story of a young man experiencing the life of work, while he struggles to fit-in his recently obtained job. As we know it, work experience is definitely a skill that is essential for our everyday lives and the overall enjoyment of itis another story. However, in this tale, work can be described as \u201chappy-go-lucky\u201d, which the characters experience the opportunity to make special bonds - possibly something you might have never experienced before with your co-workers.\\n\\n\r\nEvidently, the basic premise of the story is set near the future. A world where humans coexist with android-like-humans called \"giftias\". At first, it may sound like a friendly atmosphere - unlike any typical dystopian story - but there are also secrets that lie behind these human-created-androids that contribute to the way their society works. The main protagonist Mizugaki-Tsukasa discovers the true nature of these androids by enrolling himself with the terminal services department, a company that specializes in retrieving the androids when they reach their final stage. Once that final stage occurs, malfunctioning kicks in and in the worst-case scenarios, psychotic levels can rise. This may sound like an interesting way to start off a psychological series; however, for this story, it's entirely the opposite. \\n\\n\r\nMy personal view of Plastic Memories was like watching two shows in one. In the beginning, the story led me with confusing questions: what is the writer's main focus of the story, or what are they trying to display for the viewers? What this tale lacked was generally the overall progressing of it - it was inconsistent - that was its main flaw. At times, it was quite silly to watch - at one scene - almost as if the creator was forcing me to laugh. You find yourself on loose ends, wondering what happened with the main purpose of the story. Other times, it gets too emotionally sidetracked with the romance - losing its purpose on the main event, which in this case, is retrieving the androids before the expiration date. Then you witness partial amounts of the way the TS-Department works. (I have no complaints with character development, though). Despite that, some people dig the whole romantic-comedy-genre and for this anime, they did a well-done job with it. Everything paced well. In addition, the studio, Doga Koba, did a somewhat magnificent job organizing the episodes that dealt with emotions like: sadness, anger, love, and happiness. One week you witness a sad event; the next week's episode \"soothes your soul\". (This method has created a nice balance for viewers that deal with an ongoing emotion).\\n\\n\r\nThe overall series is to some extent unique in aspects of character development. I mean, the relationship between a human and an android - is something that's unexpectedly surprising. It's strange to say the least. The characters have to constantly remember the times they spend with their loved ones (androids) and question themselves: will these memories become meaningless? This applied to Tsukasa, as he had to encounter difficulties with his partner Isla. Throughout the story, PM (Plastic Memories) took a turn towards another route, in which it focused primarily on the main character's emotions. Their interactions were by far the most memorable. I was led to multiple journeys and discovered the way Tsukasa and Isla managed to work in their environment. The jobs they were assigned with revealed new characters. Even the supporting characters have contributed greatly with Tsukasa's relationship. They weren't just some irrelevant character waiting by the sidewalk, hoping to obtain some screen time. They were quite enjoyable to watch. Some examples are: Hanada-Yutasaka and his clich\u00e9 advice, Kinushima-Michiru and her overboard temper (not to forget - her tsundere personality), and finally, Kuwanomi-Kazuki and her overprotective-ness for Isla. All these characteristics were essentially helpful for the overall improvement for Tsukasa's relationship (as I stated above). Lastly, they're just simply adorable - especially the way they interact with each other. Simply watching them - is a great way to put your mind at ease. Even the smallest interaction between Tsukasa and his colleagues was quite amusing to watch. \\n\\n\r\nTruthfully, I'm well convinced that the artists of this series have provided a considerable amount of effort - displaying a beautiful final-product. Although, I wouldn't say it's completely unique. The characters are given simple designs that match their personality - not too complex, though. It definitely wouldn't distract you from watching the entire length of an episode. Not to forget, I should also mention that the animations for the sceneries were amazingly and beautifully done. The animation was quite accurate. For example, the light would naturally shine like it would in reality (just to be clear, distinguishing the positives/negatives for animation isn't my expertise). Also, the scenes when the characters encounter an emotional pain; can possibly make any individual feel a sense of sympathy for them. Regardless of the typical character design, it's quite suitable for the story.\\n\\n\r\nPersonally, I believe that the music was somewhat the least impacting throughout the course of the series. There isn't any moment when I would try to put the efforts of remembering the last song I heard. On a positive note, the music definitely mixed well with the overall mood. The opening, including the ending songs didn't simply contain a repetitive tune, neither was it unappealing, but it managed to execute a beautiful sound.\\n\\n\r\nMy final opinion of Plastic Memories: it's heartwarming, it provides a rather enjoyable story, yet my anticipation for the overall plot was lacking the consistency it needed.Despite it being clich\u00e9 and silly, I have no regrets watching it. Now that you have collected all this data, manage yourself some time and watch this anime. If you are someone like me who enjoys another story that contains romance (ignoring what I previously written above), and to some extent, a combination of comedy, then by all means, endeavour yourself - Plastic Memories will provide you that endless satisfaction. You will experience countless emotions. I can't convince you how much I'm pleased with the final product of this show - neither can words express how much I've enjoyed this anime. Give it a shot, it's relaxing, and perfect for any viewer that's searching for some time to waste.",

All giftia, you learn early on, have a limit to their lives.\r\nWhich would include Isla, Tsukasa's giftia partner.\r\nThus, from the outset, we know where Plastic Memories is going. The question is how we get thereand what happens when we get there. And this focus on the process is why I think Plastic Memories is worth recommending. The characters aren't anything impressive. Each of them fits into a relatively well-defined cliche. The drawing and soundtrack for this series are pretty good, but far from being so good that they'd carry a series. But if you're willing to indulge in Plastic Memories for a moment, you'll probably find something endearing and redeeming about this story that revolves around an attempt to answer that question of how one would deal with life, when he or she (and everyone else) knows that its natural term is approaching. It's more than a mere philosophical question, and Plastic Memories managed to touch me a few times--and I think it'll touch you too, when you witness that the characters truly struggle with it and do their best to face it as the clock ticks on. It's not an amazing series. But it's a decent series that truly tackles life and death in a way that's more nuanced, realistic, and human than almost every other series I've watched.\\n\\n\r\nAll things considered, though, it's hard to highlight the merits of this series with words alone: the polarized opinions over it is pretty much due to the fact that some people simply can't resonate with the characters, so this is definitely one of those series that's more subjective sentiments based than average. If after episode one you can't find yourself at all interested, waste no more time and look elsewhere. Otherwise, this series will be well worth the watch.",

            "content": "[Adapted From Original Blog Post]\r\nPlastic Memories has been somewhat of everyone's favorite punching bag this year in spring of 2015. It only takes a glance through forums and the such to find people ripping up the show completely, claiming it to be a melodramatic and poorly written mess, and I was a little curious why that was. I mean, I'm relatively positive why backlash for Plastic Memories happened, but why has the public anvil fallen so hard on this seemingly simple series about robots, humanity and learning to let go? Now, in case you've just got here and have absolutely no idea what this animeis about, bear with me, because I'm here to say that Plastic Memories has been unfairly prosecuted by the community based on misguided expectation. So what am I trying to do with this review? Well, give it a fair trial. \\n\\n\r\nHello people of \"The Wired\", my name is Quan, I hope you're having a wonderful day, and today, I'll be giving my thoughts as I experienced them on the romance/drama/sci-fi anime of this past spring 2015 season: Plastic Memories. \\n\\n\r\nLet's talk technicality first. Plastic Memories was animated by studio Dogakobo, a studio that has only recently appeared on my radar mostly for their work on the hilarious yet flawed comedy Gekkan Shoujou Nozaki-kun that aired last year, because besides from that anime, they haven't done many things of mention; as they are still a company more or less still finding their stride. And if this stride continues, I think we can expect great things from them in the future. Plastic Memories was directed by Yoshiyuki Fujiwara, who hasn't done a whole lot, but his most notable directing work was probably Engaged to the Unidentified, an anime that while I haven't seen, I can guess won't fair as well as Plastic Memories did under my scrutiny. The script was handled by Naotaka Hayashi, another one who hasn't done too much work, but on the other hand, as well as writing the script, he is also the original creator of Plastic Memories. I commend him for that because he has done something many of us only dream of, and I also get to blame him for absolutely all of the problems the story has. Nice, that makes things simpler. Finally, the anime is 13 episodes long, airing in between April 4th to July 27th of 2015. Now, into the story. \\n\\n\r\nStory\\n\\n\r\n In a world where scientific advances have allowed the creation of humanoid androids called \"Giftia\" that posses real emotions to exist,  in one clean strike, the line between man and machine collapses, as Gifita are integrated into society as parents, children, brothers and sisters. In this changed world, 18 year-old Tsukasa Mizugaki is just trying to find his place. He has already failed his college entrance exams after collapsing half-way through the test, and his disappointed father, head of the SAI Corporation, the very company known for producing Giftia worldwide, offers him a position at the last place that he feels Tsukasa is eligible: the Terminal Service Department. There, Tsukasa will need to play reaper for Giftia that are reaching their \"expiration date\", forcing their depressed owners to sign their consent to allow Tsukasa to retrieve and deactivate the Giftia before their programming fails and they go berserk, potentially endangering society. Determined to make the best out of a clearly disheartening situation, Tsukasa encounters the rag-tag bunch of people that have gathered at the Terminal Service: his tsundere co-worker Michiru, who only started working a year before him, the timid head of the department, and of course, his new partner for retrieval: a Giftia named Isla. Isla is an emotionally repressed Giftia that, up until this point, has only served tea for her fellow workers at the department, but despite her rough exterior, Tsukasa finds himself inexplicably drawn to her, wondering who the real person behind her emotionless expression is.\\n\\n\r\nOkay, listen very close to me now, because this next part is very important, because understanding what Plastic Memories is trying to accomplish with its story is essential to enjoying the overall experience. This is not, like what I assume many viewers of this anime wanted as it started, an examination of what is defined as human in a world where the line becomes increasingly blurred; like what something such as Eve no Jikan set out to do. It's an easy preconception to have when you read the plot summary, but you can't go into Plastic Memories expecting commentary on the nature of humanity, because you are just not going to get it. Sure, the subject is touched on, that's sort of unavoidable judging from the nature of Tsukasa's and Isla's jobs, but it doesn't waver on it and it doesn't go into depth, and that is just how it is. So, if not about what you would initially assume, what is the purpose of Plastic Memories? Well, to put it simply, it's a romance... and a tragic one at that.\\n\\n\r\nNow, as anybody who is familiar with the genre knows, pulling off a well-written and believable romance in anime is no easy task, and Plastic Memories makes more than a few missteps in its execution. The first mistake is probably not putting the romance as the priority right away, and instead Plastic Memories spends its first few episodes on multiple assignments that Tsukasa and Isla must complete, not really stringing together any focus between the episodes. It can even feel episodic at times, and it's probably in these initial few episodes that people got misleaded on what Plastic Memories would be focusing on. The romance between Tsukasa and Isla feels nearly like a sub-plot in this stretch rather than what in reality is the beating heart of what makes this anime work, and when you're not focusing on the core of a show, things get aimless fast. Plastic Memories plays around with some, quite honestly, immersion-breaking comedy that doesn't flow well with the rest of the story, that at best is slightly amusing and at worst is distracting from the more sentimental aspects of the anime. Some side characters get episodes to themselves for slight development, but besides from the backstory of Kazuki: Tsukasa's tough boss, whose backstory is intricately linked with Isla's development, these backstories feel like pointless distractions that never really feed into the story again. Sometimes it focuses on the anguish of the people who are forced to part with their Giftia, especially in the emotion-fueled episode 1, but then sometimes it simply skips over this without a second word. It still serves as a passable slice-of-life with a sci-fi twist, but nothing in this first half of the anime is truly engaging or mold-breaking.\\n\\n\r\nIt can also be quite juvenile at times, which probably didn't help the slowly burning rage of veiwers who were still expecting Blade Runner or something. Plastic Memories isn't above fan-service or tasteless breast jokes, which does nothing to help its situation, tainting moments where the anime does try to be serious. \\n\\n\r\nBut once Plastic Memories finds its identity, as a romance, and as a story, sometime around the end of episode 8, it's a whole different matter. It was around episode 10 I think that I realized that the show's writing had improved drastically, and the only explanation I could come up with was that Naotaka Hayashi had finally began to tell the story that he truly wanted to tell from the beginning, all these side characters and world-building aside. And... it's really damn good, actually, one of the best romances I've seen in a good long while. It's not melodramatic and it's not rushed, building deliberately and wonderfully from episode 8 onwards to probably the best final episode thus far of 2015: 24 minutes of pure storytelling so gripping and emotional, that honestly, I wouldn't have had it any other way. Yeah, I'll admit it: I had almost had something in my eye at the very end. Shut up. But that's rare, actually, for me at least, to be completely satisfied with what I am given in an anime's finale, but Plastic Memories managed to pull it off, and that's worth a lot of praise. I just wish Plastic Memories could have realized that this slow build-up is something it should have been doing from the very beginning. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters\\n\\n\r\nSince I don't have a lot to talk about in terms of side characters, I'll go over them first. Michiru, the tsundere co-worker, is adequate as a character, getting an okay back-story and acting as sort of a cheerleader for Tsuaksa's and Isla's relationship, which makes her somewhat enduring despite her occasionally annoying tsundere tendencies, especially when her Gifita partner Zack can see right through her act and points it out constantly, usually for comic relief. As I said before, Kazuki is probably the only character that is essential for the main \"plot\"(for lack of a better word), and she is fairly likable too, being a sort of fussy yet tough mother-figure for Isla. At very least, though the supporting cast lacks of depth, they are all somewhat likable, which could  be almost just as important depending on the situation.\\n\\n\r\nTsukasa as a main character is not a lot to write home about, as he very much comes from the same \"bland main-protagonist\" camp that characters like Otanashi from Angel Beats and Kirito from Sword Art Online apparently attended. He just doesn't have a lot of personality, not that the anime doesn't try to give him one(before giving up and moving on to Isla). It brings up briefly his rocky relationship with his father at some points before pretty much completely dropping it, and what I took as a hint that he is becoming repeatedly desensitized from his job(or what Isla calls \"tearing apart memories\"), is pretty much gone before you have time to consider the implications it could have on his character. The one trait the anime bestows on him and keeps around for the whole duration is Tsukasa's tendency to keep sadness and or depression hid behind a smile, and while that's not a bad trait per say, it's just not really explored that often, only being brought up when convenient for sentimentalism. Not that the trick doesn't work in the last episodes, and you could say that is somewhat manipulative, but whatever, I thought it seemed genuine enough. \\n\\n\r\nNow Isla is by far the most developed character in the show, though I'm hesitant to say develop as opposed to change. She starts as apparently a near emotionless person, though through hints by her clumsiness and occasionally quirkiness, it's strong hinted that this apathy is not her real personality, or at least not the one she was born with. To be honest, she sorted of pissed me off in the beginning with this demeanor, especially since it was so obvious that Tsukasa was head over heels for her and was willing to do anything to make her happy. The show does well to strip away her character layers throughout the duration, and even if it is not hard at all to guess what the her character's underlying motivation is(and to be honest, it's pretty obvious), it's still well executed, which can matter more than complexity. What really sold it though in the end, was when I was watching episode 13, and watcing how Isla was acting. I realized just how completely different she was acting than how she had been in the beginning of the anime, and the crazy thing was, the change felt natural, like it had been built up; like it had been built up well. And that realization was enough for me.\\n\\n\r\nPresentation & Sound\\n\\n\r\nI must say, I'm impressed Dogakobo. Plastic Memories is a pretty gorgeous looking show, and I think that has a lot to do with a choice blend of color and aesthetic. Lush shades provide the sci-fi setting with a certain glamour that feels futuristic yet still very much connected to a present day setting, with colors exaggerated yet realistic. One problem you could say is that the setting isn't always strongly communicated through the visuals; you'd be forgiven for forgetting that this does take place in a futuristic setting occasionally; locations seeming like they could have been hand-picked from a present day setting. Though honestly, that's a mere nitpick in the face of an anime that looks amazing, from color, to character designs, to the way that certain scenes look.\\n\\n\r\nDone by artist Masaru Yokoyama, the music of Plastic Memories was never really something I took notice of. Admittedly, since this is a show that has been released very recently, I havn't been able to give the full OST a complete listen yet, but from what I heard while watching the show, the OST never really strayed very far from light slice-of-life jingles and soft slow piano pieces for emotional high-points. Take this overview with a grain of salt however, because Masaru actually does have a few good OSTs under his name, namely: The Rolling Girls and Your Lie in April, so maybe I just wasn't paying attention when the stand-out songs where playing. The songs I did notice was the quite good opening \"Ring of Fortune\", notable if only for the amazing visuals besides from the music, and a song called \"Again and Again\", which... is a quite lovely little song actually.\\n\\n\r\nEver since it first started airing, Plastic Memories has been subjected to unfair comparisons to sci-fi giants of the anime medium, hell, even to Ghost in the Shell, arguably the most influential piece of science fiction anime has ever produced, all against a genre it never really wanted to emulate in the first place. So I'm not going to. Because Plastic Memories isn't sci-fi, not really; it uses sci-fi elements to make its story work, but I'll judge it as a romance. And as a romance anime, there is one essential question I need to ask myself to judge if Plastic Memories wasn't just a melodramatic mess that just happened to tug my heart strings, but a competent and engaging anime that actually succeeded in exactly what it set out to do. At the end of episode 13, when all the dust has settled, and all the tears of the fanboys have dried up, did Plastic Memories make me care about the relationship of these two people? Did I care what happened to them? The answer? Well...\\n\\n\r\nYeah. And that's enough for me.\\n\\n\r\nFinal Verdict: 7/10\\n\\n\\n\r\nFor this review and others, feel free to check out my blog!

            "content": "This was certainly a highly anticipated anime for this season. Now that it's complete I thought to express my disappointment with Plastic Memories.\r\nStory: 6/10\r\nI was honestly going to skip this anime this season, but everyone was raving over \"the feels\" of the first episode. I was convinced to check it out. The premise of the show is very interesting. I LOVE the concept, but much like Glasslip of the summer lineup of last year. it has SO much WASTED potential. You think the plot will focus on the sci-fi element of the series, but it doesn't. It focuses on this forced relationship between the twomain protagonists. Isla's personality does a complete 180 from episode 11 to episode 13. I can't stand horribly transitioned personality changes in characters. It's poorly written and to be 100% honest, I could write a better story than this. People will argue and say the feels are strong in this anime, and I have to agree somewhat. There are a few scenes that are heavy on the heart, but the ending for the anime, for me personally wasn't emotional. If you're going to do an anime on provoking the viewer's emotion, you need to build the characters into a define element and have a compelling story, and frankly, this anime didn't do that. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nThe characters lack expression and there is several \"derp\" moments  when the animation doesn't hold up just right. The eyes really bother me too. I wasn't too impressed by the character designs. I'd say it's pretty average.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nI actually like the OP and ED song. It's shocking, I know. It seems a lot of people dislike it. The osts are also well placed in certain scenes.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 6/10 \\n\\n\r\nMuch like the story, the character's are poorly written. They have either no personality or they're generically bland. I didn't like Isla, she is nothing special about her. She's a typical moe archetype. Tsukasa is really no different. Michiru is really (pardon my language) fucking annoying. Every time she talks I wanna punch her in the face. She might be slightly developed with her backstory about her dad, but that's pretty much it. It's the same thing for Isla. All the characters are  too one dimensional for my tastes. I only liked them at certain points in the anime, but it wasn't enough to win my affection over wholeheartedly.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nI did enjoy how they started off the anime. Much like Owari, they had a strong beginning. But I was disappointingly led astray from what I thought the plot was going to be about into something that didn't really fit into the premise of the series. \\n\\n\r\nOverall:  6/10\\n\\n\r\nWith all this lost potential with robots and memory processing of what could have been a great sci-fi , it deserves this score. Which in all honesty isn't as nearly as low as you may think. I really don't recommend this anime. \\n\\n",

            "content": "10/10, I just finished watching the show and honestly, I've never written a review before on here but my thoughts on this show were so extreme that I almost had to write one. so let's talk about it.\r\nStory: let me start by saying that yes. this show is very sad. The storyline of this show is amazing, the premise sets up for a lot of sad moments, not only at the end but throughout the show. Even during the first episode, I teared up. The romance aspect of this show is fantastic too, I'm not gonna spoil anything but just know that the romance hasa lot to it instead of just the black and white I love him or I don't that a lot of anime has. \\n\\n\r\nArt: the animation is great in this show, the backgrounds and landscape scenes have incredible detail and all of the characters are drawn colorfully but with lots of detail as well. Also, I freaking love the opening to this show, it has a cool chalk drawing aesthetic and the plastic memories cuts with the tan design with the blue and red color are also really cool. You'll understand what I'm talking about once you see the show\\n\\n\r\nCharacter development: The character development in plastic memories is one of the best I've seen, almost all of the characters in the show have some development during the show, a lot of this can also be seen in the romance aspect that I talked about earlier. But it's not just the main two characters, everyone around them develops and grows as a person in just 13 short episodes.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: this show might honestly be my new favorite anime ever, I watched it all in one go and was glued to the screen the whole time. I originally planned to break it up and watch some tonight and the rest tomorrow night. but once I started watching, plans quickly changed. \\n\\n\r\nOverall I highly recommend this anime But do be warned, its a sad one. I cried like a baby multiple times. I had to drink a glass of water after this show, that's how much I cried.",

            "content": "Plastic Memories, we should create new memories with people, all while recalling the past. Tsukasa Mizugaki a recent high school graduate, after failing his college exam Mizugaki has settled for a job at Sion Artificial Intelligence Corporation for sort \u2018SAI Corp\u2019. They are responsible for the creation of \u2018Giftias\u2019 which are incredibly advance androids practically humans with the amount of emotions and memories they retain and display. Although, unlike humans they have a maximum lifespan of 81,920 hours which is the equivalent of 9 years and 4 months. Tsukasa is assigned to a department one and is partnered up with a veteran Giftias known asIsla. Their job is collect Giftias which are due for retirement since their time is coming to an end, if they don\u2019t manage they can go a rampage or malfunction. \\n\\n\r\nTheir first case is one with an older lady Chizu Shirohana with a Giftia known as Nina. A caretaking Giftia that does all the chores, caretaking, and providing for Chizu. Tsukasa being a beginner his approach is to sell and convince Chizu to allow them to take Nina away from and replace her with a new Giftia or erase her current ones memory bank. Chizu is persistent not wanting any part of this, always locking the door at the sight of Isla and Tsukasa. It\u2019s until Isla confronts and meets Nina that they have a small conversation, and convinces Chizu to hear them out. Nina knows her time is coming to end, she\u2019s frighten but her concerns like more with the well-being of Chizu, she overhears the conversation between Isla and Nina and is convinced she should let Nina go. It\u2019s not until they when they say their final goodbyes that Tsukasa finds out the difficulty of this job and why this job gets a few cases because of the difficulty it can be to get them and convince the owner of the Giftia to give them up.\\n\\n\r\nTsukasa Miguzaki is a sympathy caring guy when it comes Isla and his coworkers Michiru Kinushima and Zack. Although, Tsukasa does fall into the generic trope in protagonist where girls fall head over heels for him for not much of an apparent reason. Isla on the other hand is clumsy, quiet, keeps to herself kind of girl but when it comes can be out spoken and very confrontational. The way she communicates with Tsukasa is through her journal that how she conveys her thoughts and past experiences. Not much else can be said about Michiru other than she hides her true intentions with her aggressive Tsundere behavior and her partner Zack is a know it all.\\n\\n\r\nWhen it comes to the animation the vibrant colors convoy the feelings for the anime which can vary the instant a different tone shifts. The character\u2019s designs are splendid to look at even matching the character\u2019s architype at times, Michiru orange for being a labeled as hot head at times. However, being as distinct as they're you should be able to latch a name to every one of them instantly. The opening and ending sequences aren\u2019t anything you glamorous with not much meaning just the characters posing with nicely animated backgrounds. However, I do appreciate the small detail of the Opening sequence near the end where Isla face changes after every episode OP conveying the tone of the episode.\\n\\n\r\nPlastic Memories gives of a strong impression want to forgo a strong narrative story which it does to a certain extent with Tsukasa and Isla being the main pair of the series. Tsukasa being thrown into the world of Giftias how they function, interact, and even live among society to eventually what becomes of then after their time limit is over. It does carry eye-rolling tropes that don\u2019t necessarily take away from the anime but would have been better off if it went on a more serious tone. It would have benefited more if the removal of Giftias from their owner was more focal point.  It\u2019s heavy hitting moments is what made sitting through, worth it. Plastic Memories is a small delightful anime that anyone that has time to spare or wants to feel their heart sink down their stomach to small funny light-hearted moment, should take a moment to watch.\\n",

Then, I did some research and found out the writer of Plastic Memories the same as the writer of Steins;Gate, yeah, that Steins;Gate. \"yep that's why\"\r\nOverall it is an amazing anime, one of anime that makes me cry along with AnoHana and Angel Beats. The art is nice, the sound actor is great, my favorite character is Michiru\r\nI really love if the make a second season but that might be a bittoo much to ask, a movie maybe, about the main hero try to fight like the one in Ushinawareta Mirai",

            "content": "There are so many pitfalls to reviewing this show it makes my brain hurt.\r\nFor starters, the entire science fiction premise is not to be taken as a significant plot point. This isn't a hard sci-fi story where universal laws are well established and explored within the themes of the plot. Worrying about why they have expiration dates completely misses the allegorical nature of the plot. Isla is no different from a human girl. The giftia recovery process is nothing more than a thinly veiled excuse to have the protagonists introduced to the larger themes of the series before Isla herself becomes the focus. Trying toworld build until the very end probably would have turned out horribly. I mean, the Matrix was a fantastic Sci-Fi movie but look what happened when they tried to dig deeper into that!\\n\\n\r\nEven more crucial is that giftias having souls is a stated premise of the show. Isla's robotic behavior at the start is intended to be allegorical. Or maybe it's just a giant, awful pun. Either way it doesn't bear scrutiny and doesn't have to. People become withdrawn and afraid of emotional attachment for many reasons and Isla has several reasons to pick and choose. This is what made the series stand out from other death-tragic-romances for me; the intentional focus on the development of the person who is dying rather than solely exploring the grief of the survivors.\\n\\n\r\nTsukasa, ironically, nearly becomes a manic-pixie-dreamboy in the process, which is probably why the side characters spend so much time nearly breaking the fourth wall with their invasive and unhelpful advice. Having him called a lolicon, the various pickup-artist attempts he makes and everyone protecting Isla's feelings at the start all make sense within the context of the characters while also allowing Tsukasa to prove his sincerity to the audience.\\n\\n\r\nI won't bother with numbers here, because this is a beautiful series despite its clumsy delivery, shallow side characters and weak ending. I forgive it for its painfully accurate portral of regret, depression, fear of emotional attachment and misguided delusions of a better future. Ironically this is probably a series best enjoyed by people who have honest regrets about wasted time/youth.\\n\\n\r\nPS: Hey, there's a lesbian who didn't get senselessly murdered or rejected!",

            "content": "Anime Series Review No.3\r\nPlastic Memories an anime series holding so much potential from the r promotional video and especially the first episode. A anime series that will have my potential 9/10 or 8/10 if the plot expanded and handled properly. The plot have much to offer but sadly expecting the episode span to be 12 episode long instead of 24 to more number of episodes. I will just expect the series will focus eventually in the romance and slice of life part and yes I am correct it did focus on the 2 main characters romance but will get to that later but first Iam going preview the show separately first before I discuss the entire whole.\\n\\n\r\nStory 7/10\\n\r\nThe anime have an original premise for it focus on the companies retrieval operation on android's called \"Giftias\", androids that have 8 to 10 years lifespan with the most unique traits that machines and this timeline robots don't have which the ability to have emotion and to make memories which is one of the most special traits we humans have, instead of an typical routine in retrieving expired robots the crew instead became a grave retriever where they will engage the conflict of owners who have made memories and bond with the giftias and fail to let them go which make the story more intriguing and making the story for drama blends perfectly with the sci-fi genre and at the same time slice of life is unconsciously taking place in the events which make's a good formula but the comedy backfires the formula. I know slice of life and comedy blends well but drama and comedy doesn't especially if not controlled. Why? Cause when a comedy took place afterwards the drama it will ultimately deletes the dramatic emotion and replace with comic relief immediately butchering the seriousness of the drama. I am not saying comedy and drama cannot be made a good formula but the comedy and drama should have boundaries which will not break the premise original focus. Drama series to get it's impact to the viewers should be delivered seriously while comedy can be taken lightly. If the comedy doesn't effect the drama I can say the handling is good but in the first episode run they butchered the drama alot of times. The drama became a force drama instead because there are times you are moody in a particular scene in the episodes and sometimes you don't, making the drama just fraction of the series episode instead of the entire whole meaning there are times the scenes are serious and there are times the series is pure comedic nonsense but I did give a praise in the last 3 remaining episode where the romance drama of the main characters is delivered nicely and seriously making plastic memories enjoyable even if it have huge potential to become the shiny gem of the season. So many unexplained parts of the scifi is ignored in the series which is a complete disappointment for sci fi fans like me but still the romance development is a big \"O.K\" as a fan of romance. Romance that doesn't end in confession but romance that ends in the phrase \"Until death do as part\" which a lot of romance anime fear to present which make Plastic Memories a recommendable anime for slice of life and romance anime fan who like cute love story.\\n\\n\r\nArtwork 10/10\\n\r\nPlastic Memories have great production values and the art style smoothing and relaxing a great fit with the slice of life and sci-fi genre theme. The artwork can attract many viewers attention.\\n\\n\r\nSound 8/10\\n\r\nThe Opening of the series depicts the contents of what the series is  which they did major good job in hooking it's audience and knowing what events that can occur in the series and also depicts the potential of a lover story will take place which did happen as the story progress. ED \"Asayake no Starmine\" by Asami Imai a song that will stay in my song list for a long period time. At first the ED is ok but the more I knew about Isla personality and the tragic event that will happen to her I like the song in the bottom of my heart started to shed tears of happiness and sadness. The ED did a very good job is coloring the main heroine and making the aura happiness and sadness in the slice of life and drama. ED is praise worthy and the art did very good in making it's visual memorable. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter 6/10\\n\r\nThis is what I considered the weak point of plastic memories for because of the short amount episode given the supporting cast will have limited time to have a character development and the series will focus more on the main cast instead. Plastic Memories will be a great series if only we know better about the other retrieval office staff and their interesting stories but still they did make a great support in building up the main cast as a support in the series but I think they deserve better. I like Isla the most her traits of being short, clumsy and nervous make her a likable character even thought there are lot's of character like her but she did make something memorable in her own personality. The other characters became generic for the show give them less time to stand out to make them unique but still they are not useless and contributed fairly in the series following themes. Since I liked the characters I give a above average 6/10.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 8/10\\n\r\nI will say I dropped the series in the 3rd episode because of the misleading plot but 2 months past I try it again and in a great surprise I got hook and finish it without noticing the time. I felt great and happy for the ending and I will remember the events of other episodes and especially the last. \\n\\n\r\nOverall 7/10\\n\\n\r\nPlastic Memories is both recommendable and unrecommendable series for me for it will only attract a small portion of the population and majority won't be interested but it is still recommendable to anime fans who love decent romance, slice of life and drama series.\\n\\n\\n\r\nThis so far my longest review I made but thanks for reading my personal thoughts and opinions about the show. :)\\n",

When i say that, i mean the story is something new, that doesn't follow a normal concept. It still includes many of the cliche moments that make an anime of this genre nice, but the way that the romance between the two characters is played out leaves you hanging on the edge of your seat or just wanting to know more. \r\nThe main characters in this show are given their own screen time, where you get toknow about them. Not focusing too much on only one character but getting involvement from all sides. \\n\\n\r\nIf your up for a drama/romance, or a tearjerker this is the show to watch. You will probably end up enjoying it for many different reason, but this show is great!\\n\\n\r\nTheres heaps more that i'd love to say about this show, especially about how great a character Isla was, but overall this show was a 10/10, not something you find often.

            "content": "Yup, here I am, hating that review a anime that everyone reviewed already. It's really late for this review, because I'm writing this review on Summer 2015 anime season. First, let's talk about what I waited for, what I find. The most I waited for was Fate/Stay Night and Denpa Kyoushi for Spring 2015. Plastic Memories was... in my 5th, 6th maybe ? Anyway, I didn't expected too much. I didn't even looked at it's categories, just looked at Isla, and said \"I'm going to watch this, don't know why... And boy don't look bad, story is good...\" Well, when I first watched first episode,it was already decided that it was going to end sad. Said myself that \"Brace Yourself, feels are coming!\" You can see as well. And... well, you watch the anime and see. Story contains some spoilers from episode 1. Not much, only a few, really few. \\n\\n\r\n--Story--\\n\\n\r\nWell, I can clearly say that this drama series can opposite even Angel Beats. Yup. I cried those two the most. Sorry, the anime that I cried most is Ano Hana. Anyways, story is good and goes well without boring the audience. Just for you guys know, story would have ended episode 10, but they just remembered that \"Oh NO! We have 3 episodes more!\" and it's starting to bore. Because of this, I finished this anime yesterday. Just hang tight and watch it until end. But again, \"Brace Yourself, feels are coming!\"...\\n\\n\r\n--Art--\\n\\n\r\nIt wasn't nice. I can watch 2000 anime without saying that \"What's with this art ?\". But this art is ? Interesting. Hair is flashing in the middle, it's white. Okay, I don't care. No problem with Isla, her hair is good, her face is well drawn... But what's with that supporting characters ? It's so... so... I can't say it with words, go and watch.\\n\\n\r\n--Sound--\\n\\n\r\nIt was reaaaly good. Only problem with it, when happy moments, it's really bad. No good musics for happy moments huh ? But when it comes with sad moments, it's awesome, when you don't wanna cry, music says that \"You will cry!\"\\n\\n\r\n--Character--\\n\\n\r\nTsukasa is a boy, who does have a background, or not, we don't know, and who he is, we don't know, what he does, we don't know, what was he doing, we don't know... LOL. Character development is really bad, right ? Only character who has background is Michiru... Yeah. Only character with background is Michiru. No flashbacks on Main characters or supporting characters. Really, what is this?! In first episode, a guy says that \"You will work here, you can't hasitate bla bla\" I don't remember that well, and when you  come to final epsiode, waiting for it's explanation, it doesn't says a thing about it! Why is that Tsukasa must work there ?! You can't have a bond with characters because of this. Agh...\\n\\n\r\n--Enjoyment--\\n\\n\r\nOnly first 10 episode I watch was enjoyable, other 2 is boring, final is... go watch it, i don't care.\\n\\n\r\n--Overall--\\n\\n\r\nPlastic Memories is a good drama anime, it's awesome, but it lacks of character development. I tried my best to write it without spoilers, I really want to share with you that final episode is different from the other 12 episodes. Final episode is doing what is other 12 episodes need to do. Or it was for me. When I listen Plastic Memories ending, I feel that I created a bond with characters in final episode, and I developed empathy with Tsukasa while I don't want that. After watching the final episode, in first 5 minutes, you will know that you are going to cry. It's obvious. Well, enough with spoilers, Plastic Memories is a good drama anime. Not must watch, but maybe you want to watch it. Goodbye.",

It's pretty much marketed as a sad and depressing anime about the inevitability of mortality and the woes of love and heartbreak. However, you will quickly come to find that none of that is what the series actually embodies; it's very much a fluffy romantic comedy with a sci-fi coating that's sprinkled with the occasional sad undertones when you are reminded of what will inevitably happen due to the nature of the world the characters inhabit. \r\nThese sad undertones primarily derive from the occupation that the archetypalbut lovable cast of the anime work within; they are part of the Terminal Service, a sub-branch of the Sion Artificial Intelligence Corporation that are tasked with Retrieving Giftias, or androids, nearing the end of their designated lifespan which is a course of 9 years. The main character Tsukasa is thrust into this world and struggles to adapt to the harsh and unforgiving nature of tearing memories apart, but comes to accept this as he falls in love with his partner Isla, a Giftia herself, and realizes that the more he grows closer to her, the more it will hurt when she will eventually have to be retrieved.\\n\\n\r\nWhat's brilliant about this anime is it's simplicity and straight-forward plot that progresses linearly without any twists or turns. It progresses in a satisfying and well-paced way, including the romantic story which is one of the best I've seen in the genre, much like how our main character is experiencing his first time working in the Terminal Service. From the very beginning, the viewer knows how the story will end but yet, as it reaches it's inevitable conclusion, it hits even harder knowing there is nothing that can stop what will transpire and having to come to terms with that. The theme of acceptance of mortality underlies the very existence of Giftias and is something Isla must come to terms with as well.\\n\\n\r\nSo all in all, this is a brilliant and simple anime that takes archetypal characters and makes them likable and interesting as well as delivering exactly what it promises from the first episode, with an extremely gratifying romantic plot and fantastic finale. It doesn't raise expectations or make the viewer believe it will be something more than what it is, because it's not. It delivers exactly what is expected of it. And that's what makes it so beautiful as a whole, a story where you know what will happen but yet are still so engrossed with countless possibilities of what could be, only to be faced with what actually is.",

From the beginning the show pretty much establishes that the so called androids\r\nwithin the show are androids in name alone as they actpretty much act identical to the humans\\n\r\naround them.\\n\\n\r\nInstead the show uses its sci-fi premise as a narrative tool to set up an ideal world in order\\n\r\nto explore the nature of human relationships, mainly coping with the loss of loved ones and\\n\r\nthe inevitability of death and the end of all things.\\n\\n\r\nWith regards to the show itself, its let down by a few things, from the cookie cutter good guy\\n\r\nprotagonist and the most tsundere tsundere to have ever tsundered, narrative plot holes, \\n\r\nas well as narrative elements that can often times appear to be heavily contrived and \\n\r\nnarrative elements that would have been best left out of the show altogether like that bullshit \\n\r\nepisode in the middle which almost took the series in the direction of an action show but \\n\r\nthankfully they don't follow through with that idea.\\n\\n\r\nTo summarize the first 6 or so episodes are a slog to get through, from there its a mixed bag \\n\r\nof either you like it or hate it, the last few episodes however are superb. Lets get one\\n\r\nthing straight even though you know whats gonna happen, what matters is the execution and the last few episodes get it done right. They are well written, and offer a realistic portrayal\\n\r\nof what would happen in real life given the situation. They are so good in fact that it justifies getting through  the lackluster first half of the show just to see that ending that hits you right in the feels.\\n\\n\r\nIf you find you are having a hard time liking the show (i considered dropping it on the 3rd episode as the story seemed so generic), I recommend sticking with it cause it rewards you in the end",

            "content": "First off, this anime is a very simple piece of work. The story line is almost identical as Your Lie in April except its set in the future. Despite the ultra-straightforward plot, I still find it wonderful in many aspects.\r\nThe visuals are dope, what I expected an anime from 2015 to look like. The designs of the characters however are a little generic. A loli-looking girl with snowy white hair is kinda the norm in recent animes. Tsukasa is also quite average, and I would've forgotten him after a while.\r\nAlthough the characters might look a bit too normal, their personalities are really, REALLY pure. Innormal romance animes nowadays, you see all these dirty jokes sneaked in every chance they get. Fan service, too. Plastic Memories delivers the idea of innocent love and youth without having to put in these \"revealing scenes\" to keep us entertained, which I applaud.\\n\\n\r\nThe locations shown in this anime aren't numerous, either. Office, Isla's home and the amusement park. That's about it. I would've liked it better if they spent more time in more places, and one month was really too short to insert enough chances to extend and develop the story further.\\n\\n\r\nPacing was a bit off, since they didn't do much in the first few episodes. The ending was too predictable and simple, and somehow that's the beauty of it. It was simple, yet powerful. I found myself unconsciously shedding a few tears while I watched the ending. Similar to Your Lie in April, they left a letter for an epilogue. And I have to admit, that was a terrible ending, so bad until I loved it. Closure was great though, wrapped it up perfectly.\\n\\n\r\nNow for the overall score, this was one of the best animes I watched recently, albeit more development would've been nice. I would recommend watching it, but I won't be watching it again, since I'd have to go through the pain of watching the break-up at the ending again. :P\\n\\n\r\nFor a little theory I thought up, after the final credits, Tsukasa returned after nine months to Terminal Station, only to be paired up with a new partner. Some speculate it might be Isla with a renewed system or someone else entirely.\\n\\n\r\nPersonally, I believe that it was Isla with a new OS. Although Tsukasa showed close to no reaction upon seeing his new partner, he might have asked to have a new OS installed on Isla beforehand, thus he was expecting her arrival ever since. The fact he didn't show much of a reaction was maybe to start over with Isla instead of desperately trying to make her remember their old times, and keeping calm wouldn't make a possibly new Isla alarmed or uncomfortable. \\n\\n\r\nThe height of the POV of the new partner seemed about the height of Isla, and the boots he/she is wearing doesn't seem too masculine, hinting at the possibility of a female. A small white tender hand shaking Tsukasa's hand further reinforces the idea.\\n\\n\r\nThe chances of a season 2 are slim, since it was wrapped up so nicely. But the ending scene left a huge gaping hole if they wanted to continue. Like a door that was shut but still unlocked, there is still a chance for a season 2. If they were to make one, I'd definitely flock over to watch it. But I still like it the way it ended.\\n\\n\r\nCheers!",

            "content": "Stories like these are usually bound to receive criticism, and this one is no exception it seems. But I'm not going to delve into that, because I thought this one was actually pretty good. Let's see...\r\n[STORY: 8/10]\r\nFirst and foremost, we have to cut the creator of PlaMemo some slack. Naotaka Hayashi is fairly new to creating scripts/storylines. Heck, actually this is only his second attempt. So what better way to announce yourself to the industry than to procreate that traditional love story between a human and an android? Indeed, that very relationship is the main point of this series. Throughout the 13 episodes we seehow the androids, or Giftias, interact with the humans and have seemingly become an inseparable part of their lives. But we all knew that wouldn't last, would it? Because they were androids who had a set life span? How will our characters cope with that? This show provides the answer. \\n\\n\r\n[ART: 9/10]\\n\\n\r\nWhen I first saw the visual art for this anime that 3 months or so ago, I knew I had to watch it. Simply because the art was beautiful. Beautiful art never fails to aid in the appeal of a series, and this one did the job brilliantly. all the emotional scenes were well portrayed with the background art and the like. This component is certainly one of PlaMemo's strong points. \\n\\n\r\n[SOUND: 8/10]\\n\\n\r\nI'm actually listening to the OST while writing this now, and heck it's great. The background music fit the scenes well, especially for the emotional ones (I know I keep saying this but it's true). \\n\\n\r\n[CHARACTER: 7/10]\\n\\n\r\nThe character development of the main guy and girl is apparent throughout. From the first moment they met, all the way to the last - the change in their personalities were there on display. The growth of the main girl was the most commendable, because without her we would have no PlaMemo. The rest of the characters were touched on here and there, but not sufficient enough in my opinion. It could have been better, but then again issues with screen time as such. \\n\\n\r\n[ENJOYMENT: 8/10]\\n\r\n[OVERALL: 8/10]\\n\\n\r\nDoes tearing up count as enjoying? Because I sure hope it does! This series featured a good mix of light-hearted comedy and serious moments within each episode. Thanks to that, we all had one heck of a roller-coaster feel-trip watching this. For anyone who wants to watch a simple romance series, this is the one for you. It's not extravagant, but it's beautiful, and it will surely reach out to your heart.",

What a story! This is the first romance anime that I've actually enjoyed. If you couldn't tell, from the first episode I was hooked. The story was very well writtenand every episode left you with wanting more. I guess that's why I finished it in a day. :P While it may be different for other people, I thought that it was very unpredictable. There were so many twists and turns that just ultimately  leads to a tragic ending and ugh! It was so good! Just watch it!\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8/10\\n\r\nThere's no complains from me except that occasionally the people may seem like they're popping out from the scene sorta like they were pasted in after the scene was drawn.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9/10\\n\r\nGreat. I loved the music. As usual I always like to see what the opening and endings sound like and they were perfect. They had a nice beat and I felt like they fit every episode. As for the whole soundtrack, well there's like a bit of everything. Sad music, happy music, a song with a killer beat (you'll know it once you hear it) and more.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10/10\\n\r\nA very important aspect I always look for is whether there is any character development from the first episode right down to the last and because there was only 13 episodes, I really wasn't expecting a lot. However I was sorely mistaken. I don't want to spoil too much, but I will say that while our main characters Isla and Tsukasa may seem pathetic in the beginning that all changes once they warm up to each other. Now as for the other characters, they all too change in some way, although not as dramatically as Isla and Tsukasa do. But even so, every single one of the humans have a tragic past that's revealed later on that can change the way you think about them.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9/10\\n\r\nI laughed more at this anime than I have in a long time with others. Some of the characters have just the best personalities that I think anyone would like. The story's fast paced and while it's a romantic themed story it's not over or underwhelming. All in all, it's a very good watch and I think you (yes you) would enjoy it.\\n",

It was very good, earning eights across the board from me, but it could have been better. The art and sounds from the anime were fairly good. Dynamic and fluid, and not listless by any regard. The OP/ED stood out the most from the sound to me. Thankfully the over use of sound bytes/effects never happened. Allowing it to maintain a well rounded approach from start to finish. \r\nThe art of Plastic Memories was visually appealing, you could gain the senseof being there and experiencing it all. Very good in that regard. As follows for the characters of Plastic memories. Each was introduced and developed well in each characters own way. Got some back story, got some relationships, you got everything to build a connection to a character.  For my overall enjoyment, well I really got to enjoy the anime. Mostly in part as it was the first anime I've watched since I came back to the world of anime. I gave it two watches before starting a new one. The feels it gives are just right. \\n\\n\r\nTo finish this off it's story time! Well the story was nice. The concept was good and it felt warm and holding. We didn't start running right from the get go, instead we had a brisk walk for a little bit. Which was great, but of course it really picked up in the late game. Ending with the forecast calling for rain. Have your ticket for feelsville ready to show as you board the train.",

That is, it's a perfect shows for the days when you're house-bound and are looking for some gentle relief.  Last episode was as expected -- playing big-time with my emotions, and the final scene is possibly laying the grounds for a possible follow-up  -- is this a \"new\"isla or a completely new Giftia, or is it a human girl?  Which is typical of a lot of other series.Got to have that last emotional hook.",

(My english is a bit bad, hehe~)\r\nI didn't write any spoilers, so if you are about to watch the series or you need a second opinion.. Here it is!\u2014\r\nStory \u2014 (8.7/10)\r\nI loved the story. I cried mostly in every episode, which is quite strange for me. \r\nThe sci-fi part was great, but there were much more things. You will pass through love and even drama. The only bad thing I could find here was that with that plot they could have do more things than that. Not a lot, but some.\r\nArt \u2014 (7.9/10)\r\nI think the style isquite good. Good illumination and effects. The snag was that the characters (in some scenes) that were in the background weren't quite worked.\\n\\n\r\nSound \u2014 (8/10)\\n\\n\r\nThe sound was quite good, average. (But I loved some soundtrack named \"Again and again\".)\\n\\n\r\nCharacter \u2014 (7.9/10)\\n\\n\r\nIt could be better if we saw a bit of background characters' lives. Just saying. The others were good, some cliche personalities (like every anime), and some were lovely. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment \u2014 (8.8/10)\\n\\n\r\nIt was fun to watch, and it's catchy. At times you will cry, at times you will laugh, and at times you are going to be stick to the screen. \\n\\n\r\nOverall \u2014 (9/10)\\n\\n\r\nMore like a 8.75, but I think this deserves the 9.\\n\r\nI think it's a quite good anime for some scenes that really touched my heart.

            "content": "Before we begin, I just want all of you to know that, on the first episode of Plastic Memories, I cried like a little girl. Can you believe it? A full-grown man, bawling his eyes out like a little girl? I'd like to say I'm ashamed of myself, but the truth is, this anime gave me some feels. I believe that's why some people call it Plastic Feels instead of Plastic Memories.\r\nDespite some of the heart rending moments, this anime isn't all feels and tears. The humor is actually pretty damn funny. The main heroine in this story, Isla, is a Giftia, an android thatpossesses human emotions to the point where you'd never be able to tell them apart from a regular human - and she is an absolute riot. Seriously, some of the crap she pulls off in this anime makes me laugh my ass off. I remember watching her jump off a railing and belly flop into a trash can in one episode. I laughed so hard. Of course, the fun and games is also played up because of how heart breaking this anime is. Isla, especially, is a tragic character, in spite of all the humorous stunts she pulls. I think, for me, this is what makes me like her so much. She's funny, but at the same time, I really feel for her - because Isla is a Giftia, and Giftia only last for a total of 8 or so years before expiring. That's what this entire anime is about, and it's why the story is so tragic.\\n\\n\r\nTragic or not, there were some really touching scenes in this. I thought the romance between Tsukasa, the main character, and Isla, was downright adorable - incredibly funny and potential deadly for Tsukasa, but mostly adorable. Watching them muddle through their relationship, seeing Tsukasa try - and usually fail - to make Isla happy, really made it worth watching this anime. For those who enjoy watching a heartfelt romance with touching moments that are mired in beautiful tragedy - I'm looking at you Clannad fans - you'll definitely enjoy this. For those of you who don't like crying your eyes out, well, you probably won't want to touch this with a ten foot pole.\\n\\n\r\nStory: While the anime is labeled as a sci-fi, the actual sci-fi itself isn't all that important beyond the idea of Giftias, the androids who can experience human emotions. Society in this anime has advanced to the point where they can literally create robots that replicate human emotions - these androids feel, think, act, and interact as if they were human. In many ways, they ARE human. However, this anime is also somewhat misleading. While there are a number of scenes that are heartrending, a good portion of this anime is light-hearted, funny, and deals with the awkward romance between Tsukasa and Isla. I didn't mind this so much, mostly because I don't think I could've dealt with too much heart break, but I know others who might be turned off by this. Also, while this wasn't a deal breaker for me, there is one thing about this anime that I didn't like and made much of the story feel a little contrived. If this wondrous, technological society is so damn advance, then why the hell do they not have a way to store a Giftia's memory and place it in a new body? This is the one sore point for the anime, and also an issue that makes the feels less feely than they could be. This wouldn't be much of a problem if they explained WHY a Giftia's memory couldn't be stored in some hardcore USB drive, but they don't, and because they don't, a part of my disbelief is suspended, which cheapens some of the really heart rending moments.\\n\\n\r\nArtwork & Animation: I did enjoy the artwork in here. The art style is very bright and vivid, and there's a wide range of color palettes being used. Some of the character designs were a little bland, but a lot of the secondary characters are just archetypes and don't get much screen time, so I feel like I can forgive them. I do like Isla's design, but even I'll admit that she's a dead ringer for a long-haired version of Ayanami from Neon Evangelion. \\n\\n\r\nSound: I'd say about average. Honestly, there isn't anything inspiring about the sound, but the quality is nice and I didn't hear anything wrong with it.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I would say that this anime was nice, but it's not without it's flaws. I enjoyed it, but some others might feel it was too contrived. If you're looking for a decent romance with some light-hearted moments and also some tragedy, you'll probably like this.",

            "content": "Romances in anime are not a rarity by any means, in fact there are so many every season that it becomes hard to get into them, as most are the typical slice-of-life comedies. But every once in a while you see a show that looks like it has a different spin to the genre, a twist that hooks by the heart, and reels you in to watch this tragic tale.... until you realize that the hook is the only thing that's really keeping you invested for a good portion of the show.\r\nPlastic Memories has a lot of characters, and by characters I mean cogs inthe machine, because that's the best way I can describe them. They really have no purpose outside of moving the plot forward while having their own quirk to make them stand out, barely. The only 2 side character that get any development are the characters of Kazuki and Asuka Lang.... I mean Michuru. (Come on, she's CLEARLY Asuka!!) But even then their characters go nowhere, a bunch of wasted potential.\\n\\n\r\nThat leaves our 2 main leads to carry the show, luckily they manage to pull it off. Tsukasa is your typical good person, always having a smile on his face while being a klutz. His general nice guy attitude was a tad annoying at times, but given what his character goes through in the story, you grow to appreciate it more. Then we have our main female lead, Isla, who is by far the best character of the show. Isla makes this show worth watching; she's cute, she's funny, she's quirky, she's clumsy, she's just a loveable presence. She's also the focus of the main plot of the show, which is a good thing since she's the most likable character. As for the plot itself... that's more of a mixed bag.\\n\\n\r\nPlastic Memories is a 13 episode show when it should've been 24 episodes, because the world they create is incredibly interesting. There are multiple side stories that make up most of the show's arcs, and in them you can see a lot of potential for some really good drama... but all you ever get is that arc, leaving you feeling a bit underwhelmed. There is an uneven focus on different arcs, as one might have Isla getting closer with Tsukasa, but then it'll focus on a side character's backstory in the same episode, even though the focus should stay on Isla and Tsukasa.\\n\\n\r\nDoga Kobo handles the animation and they handle it well. The show is full of bright colors and stylistic locations. Its incredibly bright during its lighter moments, and subdued during its darker scenes, overall a great looking show. On the music side of things we have Masaru Yokoyama as the lead composer and... I can't remember that many tracks by him. This unfortunately falls into the category of generic anime scores, only being there to fit a certain scene. With that being said there is a track during the final episode that was very touching and well made, but aside from that I didn't remember much music-wise.\\n\\n\r\nPlastic Memories is a show that could've been so much more, but unfortunately fell short of its mark. That's not to say that the show stinks though, because it is very enjoyable to watch. I had fun watching Plastic Memories, despite a ton of flaws and missed opportunities. I liked it, you may hate it, or you may love it, watch it and find out.",

            "content": "Overall: 7.4/10 stars\r\nPlastic Memories explores on the theme of memories and what comes with it--both its positive and negative sides\u2014as well as how it impacts individuals: the ones who are leaving behind the memories, and the ones who are left with the memories. \r\nIt focuses on Tsukasa and those he meets at Terminal Service, a company that sends their employees to retrieve Giftias (androids that looks like humans with a lifespan of 9 years) with expiration dates that are due soon\u2014because if they don't, they can malfunction and cause problems for not only themselves, but also others, in particular to the Giftia owners and/or thoseclose to them (to the point of inflicting harm and causing injuries). Although at first, Tsukasa seems to be passive and kind of on the side, but as the series went on, he became more and more expressive by being involved with his work: starting with getting to know the process of retrieving the Giftias, learning more knowledge about Giftias (such as their lifespan, what happens if they don't get retrieved, the relations of their owners and/or those they are close to, etc) and his co-workers, such as Isla (a Giftia Terminal Service worker who he met before officially starting his job as a staff of the main office of Terminal Service), Michiru (a Terminal Service worker who was responsible for showing Tsukasa around when he first started his job there), Kanzuki (the boss of Tsukasa, who was also the partner of Isla before Tsukasa), etc. \\n\\n\r\nBesides from Tsukasa and Isla, the supporting characters also played important roles in the progression of the series. For example, the backstory of Michiru helped Tsukasa to have a good idea as to what can happen if a Giftia goes out of control. Since she was raised by a Giftia, she knows firsthand how painful it feels to not have someone you hold so dear to not be there for you anymore. \\n\\n\r\n***(Some spoilers ahead; read on if you've watched at least up to episode 9.)***\\n\r\nSomething I like about Plastic Memories was how the writers decided to emphasize memories and how it tries to highlight its concept/theme: what you can do, and should do during the time that you have with someone--especially if you (know you) don't have much time left with them. And although it's painful, you shouldn't let that hold you back from wanting to do something, because when the chance is gone, it\u2019ll be too late to make any changes; it also shouldn\u2019t hold you back from moving forward, and facing your days ahead, because being stuck in the past will prevent you from really living your life. This greatly reflects on Tsukasa and Isla, and their growth as characters. In episode 9, Tsukasa confessed to Isla about his feelings for her\u2014which was largely due to inspiration from Eru\u2019s (someone who works for Terminal Services) memories of Andie, who was recycled as a new person, now working at another Terminal Service office that does not concern themselves with the emotional needs and feelings of Giftia owners\u2014unlike the main Terminal Service office that Tsukasa works at. It made him realize that he just wants to do as much as he can with Isla before her time runs out, despite the aftermath\u2014as to how he\u2019ll end up feeling and experiencing: sadness and the pain of her absence. He doesn't want to give up, and that it\u2019s now or never\u2014to tell her how he feels about her. That\u2019s also what he takes from having his job\u2014that to distant yourself form someone you want to make memories with, and just be with doesn't do anything; in fact, you\u2019ll end up regretting not speaking up, and doing something about it when you can. Even though it'll hurt you in the end, it's better than wallowing in bitter sadness, knowing that you didn\u2019t even try to do anything in the first place. \\n\r\n***(Spoilers section over.)***\\n\\n\r\nCertain things that have been introduced and touched on (such as Giftia stealers, other Terminal Offices, etc) were not expanded on as much as it could have. If they were, this series could have been more layered, interesting, and perhaps even more memorable. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, this series is enjoyable, heartwarming, and beautifully animated. I particularly liked the expressions that Isla showed, especially her clumsiness (which resulted in many funny incidents).  \\n\\n\r\nI would recommend Plastic Memories to anime watchers who likes: Slice of Life, Science Fiction, and perhaps Romance. \\n\\n\r\nYou're welcome to post a comment on my profile to tell me any feedback and/or critiques you have for my review; any feedback and/or critiques are appreciated.\\n\\n\r\n***",

            "content": "I just finished this series, and I'm currently still on the feels train while I write this. The emotions it produced in me were very real, which prompted me to write my very first review.\r\nI was hesitant to watch this anime at first, mostly because I thought it would just be another generic plot meant to make you cry at the end because of lost love. I thought I'd had enough of those and lately I've been on a quest for anime that is different in some way, whether it was the art, the plot, the characters or anything. However, Plastic Memories has presented mewith a pleasant surprise each step of the way.\\n\\n\r\nThe first thing that struck me about it was the universe in which it was set. I expected an anime where the people treated Giftias as mere machines, created to do their work and provide good company, which is the norm in anime. However I didn't expect that Giftias were treated exactly as how they would treat normal humans. There was never any talk of \"You're just a Giftia, don't get ahead of yourself\" which is a surprise because most anime tend to make use of the human nature of treating others as lesser beings. As the show went on, the reasons were explained beautifully, leaving you to think about their behaviors for yourself and there was no spoon-feeding of facts. The universe allowed me to observe and understand it on my own, which was a great change.\\n\\n\r\nSame with the characters. The characters are the most important part, and frankly the selling point of this anime. They are REAL. They never behaved in the way I'd normally expect characters in anime to behave, and it was just so refreshing. They had their own quirks and complicated thoughts and feelings, and often behaved in a way that confuses you while giving no explanation, leaving you to understand the characters for yourself. You are free to analyse it as you please. The characters were the absolute best part of this show. \\n\\n\r\nIsla herself was a pleasant surprise, and not at all how I imagined she'd be. She's a breath of fresh air, difficult to understand, confusing to watch, and her antics, usually done with her stone cold face, cracked me up. She's also very lovable and definitely cute as hell.\\n\\n\r\nThe entire show was much more lighthearted than the synopsis led me to believe. It told of real emotions, real human connections, real interactions, all very beautifully presented in a way that made me smile. The comic timing was great, not once did unnecessary jokes ruin the feelz of the moment. The interactions were accurate, and easy enough to understand. The anime was a master at manipulating the bittersweet feeling throughout the duration of the show, which i think is a great feat. Not many can do that. I honestly felt the emotions exactly how the characters were feeling it.\\n\\n\r\nPlot wise, it was normal enough, because the interactions were the star of the show.  Sure, sometimes I did feel like certain plot points were introduced without warning or any logical reason just for the ease of it, but I'm willing to forgive that. Aesthetic wise it wasn't bad, but nothing especially aesthetic either. It was just pretty enough though.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, it was more of a feels trip than I imagined, not generic at all, and absolutely worth a watch. I guarantee you will fall in love with the anime as well as the characters, just as much as I did.\\n\\n\r\nP.S. Zack is a sadistic little bastard who is bae <3",

            "content": "Welcome to Robert's Too Late Reviews! Today we have a very interesting title to talk about. While Plastic Memories has it's fair share of issues we'll look at, I find it a bit baffling in that the series carries an overall rating of 8.01 (as of the time of this writing) and yet the reviews are filled with negative or mediocre scores all over the place. Well, this time I have to break from the crowd which includes some reviewers I have great respect for, and say that this anime was a wonderful watch for me, and I personally recommend giving it a watch ifyou enjoy romantic anime if you want to stop here and go in fairly blind. Will there be a new plastic entry on the RTLR wall of androids? Let's see about retrieving this one.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 8\\n\r\nThis is the biggest deviation I think I have from many of my fellow reviewers. The story is framed around androids that are fairly common in daily lives, and how they have a predetermined lifespan of around 9 years. These androids are a serious point of contention for many people. These are not your daddy's androids as they might say. These are not characters like one finds in Star Trek and similar sci-fi mediums. These are basically humans that are built and not born. This fact, that the Giftias (as they are called) are not Commander Data, but are something more akin to the androids from Blade Runner seems to have a huge impact on what people are expecting from the series. \\n\\n\r\nThese Giftias do not seem to be aware of their internal specifications in a manner like Trek's Data is, they never have one rattle off how many calculations they can do per second or what have you. The only instances I can remember at all that made a Giftia sound like an actual android was the main Giftia, Isla, saying 'error' and part of the time when she said that, it was to slip out of a conversation or to play like she didn't hear what she did. In fact, from what pop culture knowledge I have, the Giftias seem more like the Cylons on the remade Battlestar Galatica. Now they don't have moments where they forget they are androids, like Battlestar, but they aren't a fountain of facts and such as Data is. \\n\\n\r\nThe Giftias have feelings, a will of their own. They are shown eating and drinking and becoming embarrassed. They even are able to fall in love, and it is heavily implied that most Giftias do in fact have someone (usually their 'owner') that they cherish deeply. These are androids that are so human like that humans do fall in love with them, even knowing they are only going to live about 9 years. So if you hear 'android' and think about something similar to Star Trek, you're way off base, and your expectations will be blown because there is no true exploration of human/technological interrelationships. This is a love story framed around a looming date of departure. This isn't a new idea by far, as we've seen countless romance anime set around the idea of a finite time limit for a relationship to occur. Many times we see this very setting in the school setting, where graduation is the looming 'end' that threatens to break the relationship apart. There are many other examples I'm sure we can all think of. So this is NOT a sci-fi story exploring what love is and how it can extend beyond a pure human to human base, it's a conventional love story with futuristic trappings wrapped around the idea that time marches forward and the couple's time together is going to be limited. \\n\\n\r\nTo that fact, I have seen many both here on this site and other places listing Plastic Memories as being a real tear jerker, and I think that's because it's a love story, not a story about futuristic artificial life forms. If you approach it with this in mind, I believe you will enjoy the story far more than if you are expecting some heavy thought on man/machine interfacing. \\n\\n\r\nIn fact I find this to be kind of similar to Your Lie in April in the fact that Kaori knew she was dying, and still had her romance with Kousei, even with the end looming. This is the road Plastic Memories treads, and does so with it's own styling and methods, and I think they did pull it off pretty well. \\n\\n\r\nThere are a few issues to note, the first one being the human connection factor. There are several people who own Giftias that develop a deep relationship with, even among the employees of the company that take possession of the androids when their time is up to terminate them. At one point they have to deal with a woman that has fallen in love with her Giftia and thinks of them as husband and wife (doesn't say if it's legal to marry your Giftia for sure) and when it comes time for him to be deactivated, she instead runs with him, trying to desperately keep him forever. The problem therein is not being in love with a Giftia, but the fact it seems to be common knowledge that when a Giftia passes the 9 year time limit they quickly degrade, losing their personality and memories and tend to become highly dangerous and aggressive, and must then be terminated by force. If you knew staying with someone would drive them into murderous insanity, I think most of us would accept the parting for the good of all involved and for society in general. \\n\\n\r\nYet the show depicts more than one case of a Giftia either running on their own, or being ordered to hide by their owners. I don't think it's realistic to try to keep the android since they lose who they are as they break past the time limit anyway. I think it was meant to reinforce to us that the Giftias are valued and people have come to love and care for them so very deeply so we can accept the romance between the male lead and his Giftia partner. \\n\\n\r\nSo if they have time limits, why would people fall in love with them so easily, knowing they are in all likelihood going to outlive their Giftias' by so long of time? Well, pets are the same way, are they not? Setting aside the question of being 'alive' (which the anime tries hard to argue that Giftias *are* living beings) most pets do not live a lifespan anywhere close to their human owners. Most common pets such as cats and dogs often commonly dead by the decade mark. I have a dachshund myself that is 14 and is very ancient, as many of the others that we owned before him often died at around 7 or 8 years old. He even appears to be elderly, his entire brown coat of hair is now completely white, and he's very slow and no longer chases cats or the ball or any of that noise. Yet I still love him, even knowing that he will die, and likely very soon, and I could easily live 40 more years after him. The amount of time we have to love doesn't always determine our desire and ability to give said love. The heart does what it wants, whether the creature receiving our love will outlive us, or be gone to the hereafter soon. But, when my dog gets in bad health or is suffering, his time will be up, and I will see to passing him on to the afterlife in a humane manner. I think everyone in the anime's world would turn over their Giftias when the time came, and I think the most forced part of the show was the premise that people would run with their Giftias knowing they were going to 'snap'. \\n\\n\r\nThe second problem I see is related to how much humanity is given the Giftias. In actuality, the Giftia Isla is not even 9 years old. These androids may have the appearance of adulthood and all, but somewhere in the back of my head I wonder how they can achieve emotional maturity that matches their appearance of age. It doesn't help at all that Isla is short, and a lot of the time is very childlike. Kind of rides that uncomfortable line in her appearance and even in her reaction to emotional situations. I can look past it, but it is a little troubling at times. \\n\\n\r\nFinally, I must address another common complaint. It has been said that these Giftia are silly in that they cannot be salvaged and moved to a new unit or what have you at the end of the 9 years. I'd actually like to use Star Trek to illustrate why that's not a technical failing on the story's side, and why something as simple as a usb thumb drive is NOT the same as the operation it would take to 'preserve' a Giftia. Commander Data in Star Trek comes across at one point another android just like him, his brother so to speak, that is an identical match to him, hardware wise. He and the crew attempt to transfer Data's OS and even his data regarding memories to this new 'empty' android body (called B-4) and though he now possesses all of Data's knowledge and information, they pointedly bring up that B-4 is NOT Data, no matter how many times they copy over the entirety of Data's hard drives to the new model. The point is that Data is beyond just parts and computer chips. His experiences and existence is more than just 1's and 0's. Consciousness cannot be stored in any medium known to man or we'd all be uploading ourselves into computers right now, without fail. The soul, as one might describe it, isn't something you can move. We can't move a brain from one body to another and have it be the same person, we cannot move our soul and personality and existence into the mechanical realm, and in this anime, they have not figured out how to move a Giftias 'being' into a new frame. Therefore you can keep the actual hardware, but after every 9 years, they have to wipe it clean and reinstall everything. \\n\\n\r\nIn that process, a new creature is created. This new personality has new experiences and is influenced by all the same things that shape and influence us all. That's why you can't simply download a Giftia's soul and then upload it to new hardware. It's still a mystery what makes them self aware, makes them alive (and Giftias are shown as being absolutely aware and able to pass the Turing Test with flying colors). Therefore, 9 years is the limit, period. \\n\\n\r\nTo address the series itself, it's a love story where two people have to decide if it is better to love hard, and make the memories even knowing they are soon to part, or to stay separate and lessen the pain by not making any memories to hurt over. Of course the story evolves into an obvious case of 'it is better to love and lose than never love at all' to no one's surprise. There's moments where the human male lead tries to find out if Isla can be saved, but he quickly discovers the impossibility of the act, and then dedicates himself to making Isla's remaining time as wonderful as possible. Some knock for that, that he doesn't try harder, and I agree to an extend. I did want a huge ending where somehow, some way Isla was able to stay with the ones she loved, but it is not to be, and the male lead accepts this quickly and wastes no more time on something that just can't happen. \\n\\n\r\nI have taken care of hospice patients in my early years while nursing. If you are not familiar, these are people that are terminally ill, with 6 months or less to live. I've loved some of these people a great deal in a very short time, even knowing I was going to lose them, and soon. Love is something that springs and grows regardless of external factors. The only way to stop it is to harden your heart, and that's truly a terrible fate. Instead we should aim to be like Isla, to live the time we have to the fullest. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 7\\n\r\nThe art is nice, I admit I'm not much of one to knock art too terribly much or pay attention to the smaller details of animation and how it can be well done or not. If it hits a certain level, I might pay mind, but I'm usually too interested in learning about the characters and the stories to get too antsy over slightly jerky animation or what have you. Unless it's a total style thing, I admit I'm not the first person to ask about art issues from. I thought everything looked fine, Isla was appropriately cute (though I'd like her to look a bit older, honestly) and everyone else looked acceptable. I do wish they would have changed one of the redheads to another hair color, in the early going I mixed the two girls with red hair up a few times. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 7\\n\r\nThe voice work is acceptable to me, though the angry redhead could get close to overdoing it for me at a few points. The sleazy guy in the office sounded right, and the younger male Giftia was fittingly played as well. The background music sounded well enough. The themes weren't bad, and fit the theme of the show, but were not enough to keep my attention beyond watching the episodes. They did not make the list of themes I'll play outside watching the series. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 7\\n\r\nThere are several characters that work with the main couple at the Termination Services office, and they are all somewhat one note, but not always in a bad way. The boss is a bit of a pushover, as he begs this and that from the CEO of the business, an aspect that wasn't really played up in the series. Might have been nice to know who they operated before the changes Isla recommends came into effect. He is bowled over mostly by a fiery redhead that is either his equal or the first person down the ladder from him. She was Isla's partner for most of the years she existed, and has a definite love for the Giftia, but gave up her partnership. She's very protective of Isla, and keeps an eye on the couple. \\n\\n\r\nThe other redhead very much seems to have a love for romance, and even seems to have a crush on the main male on top of it. In fact Isla I think notices this, and is not jealous because I think she believes the redhead will be there to take care of the guy when she's been terminated. That she isn't leaving the guy all alone, that he has friends, and maybe even another girl who loves him close by. This redhead is a bit of a tsundere character, always doing things for either the guy or the couple together, all while screaming things like \"I just happened to have/do/get x, but only giving it to you because I have too many\" etc. Her partner is a Giftia, the younger guy and he loves busting his partner's chops by pointing out that she's doing things on purpose for the couple and blowing her tsundere cover. \\n\\n\r\nThe sleazy guy is always trying to give the main guy dating advice and makes a lot of wink-and-nudge jokes, and is all around just pretty perverted, though he has some funny moments. The rest of the cast work well in supporting the couple, including the Giftias they do retrieve, who all accept their fate and teach the main couple lessons through their situations and help the pair to grow. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8\\n\r\nI did really like this anime, and I didn't experience the 'forced' feeling it gave many people. I think that might be colored by my experiences caring for others as a nurse when I was younger. I've developed a level of love (not romantic, clearly) for people and had them ripped away from me, so the idea of loving even when time is short is something that makes sense to me, as I've been there, and carry those memories myself. And I wouldn't trade those experiences for anything in the world, even if it did leave me sniffling by someone's grave marker. How much more intense but important would it be if it was a lover? I think I'd be with them too, given that situation. As long as I draw breath, there is time to love someone. \\n\\n\r\nBest Girl: Kuwanomi Kazuki, purely for the night she gets drunk with Isla. I'll not spoil the surprise, but it was funny. That and the fact she cares deeply for Isla and is trying so hard to look out for her former partner. \\n\\n\r\nSo I stand up against the sea of 4's and 5's and happily declare this an 8 for me. I enjoyed it a great deal, and if you're mushy like me, I think you will too. Just remember its a love story, not a treatise on technology or anything like that. Giftias are simply people that come into the world by being built, instead of born. Look at them in that perspective, and I think it's easy to see the humanity in them. And where you have humanity, you have heart, and where there's heart, there's always love. Isla scores a post on the RTLR wall of cutie pies, though I had to break out a ladder to find a spot to hang her. Thumbs up!",

            "content": "Honestly, I think the naming of the anime is pretty bad. \"Plastic Memory\" makes me think like cheap or fake memories, whereas the anime tried to convey that memories are precious. So, I think the naming choice should have been better.\r\nStory - 8/10 & Character - 8/10\r\n-\r\nThe truth is - the story put me at awe at first. I had to grapple with myself quite a bit. Because the story is about \"Giftia\"s, high tech robots that look and behave exactly like humans. Humans socialize with them, some adopt them as child, some falls in love with them. These Giftias eat, sleep, go to toilet,have emotions, reasoning exactly like humans. Even the humans treat them exactly the same way as they treat other humans....\\n\\n\r\nThe following is even more awkward... The MC of the story falls in love with a Giftia who is his colleague in work. The MC and his colleague Giftia go on to retrieve Giftias who are soon to expire from their owners.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is unrealistic! How it is even possible to have emotions to machines that are created by humans, let alone having them as parents or children or even as lovers!!\\n\\n\r\nSo, to satisfy myself I cheated on myself and told myself that these Giftias are just humans with a lifespan of 9 years. Thus, I was able to put myself at ease and enjoyed the anime to the end. Otherwise, I was thinking of dropping the anime at episode 4.\\n\\n\r\nThanks to this, the story felt a bit more logical and I finished the rest of the anime in one swoop!\\n\\n\r\nArt - 9/10 & Sound - 8/10\\n\r\n-\\n\r\nI've written quite a few reviews. My focus always is on the story and the character. I don't notice the art or the sound that much. So, I usually rate them 8 or 9, unless the art or the sound is painfully bad. The art and the sound is fine with me. They sat quite well with the mood and the story.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment = Overall = 8/10\\n\r\n-\\n\r\nI rate an anime totally based on my personal enjoyment. It was not that enjoying to watch the 1st episode. But watching till episode no. 4 got me hooked up and since then it was a fun ride.",

The emotional attachment somehow made its audience members to be attached to the characters, but then leaving them with more answers rather a satisfaction. Should theanime have at least been given longer duration, it could have tackled more on the subject, yet it might then drag the emotional attachment.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are not really that exceptional, expect for the case of the main character itself, Tsukasa, who somehow has a slight character buildup, from an innocent high boy merely doing his job to a somehow slightly matured teen willing to weigh in facts and emotions in terms of decision making.\\n\\n\r\nArt and sounds were to be noted, as hues for its landscape scenes give you a warm feeling about the aura the series brings. Also, the use of varied soundtracks is well-executed, most notably the \"Again and Again\" piece.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, it is an enjoyable watch, but it's not something to be watched again. A rewatch can be done if you need a warm feeling after a heavy action anime watch time perhaps.",

So to avoid emotional pain she chooses not to make memories with anyone until 'Tuskasa' comes in her life and changes everything!\r\nDoing this actually made me appreciate the story even more and that is thereason i gave it a 10/10.\\n\\n\r\nNow i am not saying the story should have been like the one I imagined..

            "content": "Okay Plastic Memories is a strange anime in my opinion. At first I thought this anime was based on a visual novel so I thought okay if this anime does not satisfy me I can always turn to the visual novel. So I indulged right into the anime with an open mind and boy was I excited for this anime based on the first maybe 3 episodes. But unfortunately I was disappointed by the end of this anime and what's worse, I found out that this wasn't based on a visual novel so again I was extremely disappointed.\r\nThe main fall of Plastic Memories is basicallythe lack of episodes this anime has. I'm not saying it's THAT good for me to want more episodes but more to the fact that there is no development for the story and the characters. Everything is really forced and the characters suddenly change based on one interaction. What other thing that bothered me about this anime was the fact that they kinda ignored the whole \"cyborg\" concept. They masterfully utilized that concept within the first few episodes but as the story progressed it turned more into a heavily forced romance story about a girl's last days on Earth. It was really disappointing. The main MC at first was good, I thought his character was interesting as he could not differentiate if his job was a good thing or not but they sorta ditch his character and make him into a plain harem MC character. The \"I love you so i'm going to do whatever I can do to love you\" which made the MC not unique anymore. The main heroine is possibly the only bright spot to the characters in this anime, she was cute, she was clumsy, she was unique as she had thoughts that other cyborgs didn't have so she wasn't too bad. \\n\r\nThe art was terrible near the end, they didn't even bother integrating the characters within the background. It was as if they drew the background and just put the characters on top of it.\\n\r\nOverall, I really liked the first few episodes. I cried a few times but as I went through more episodes I was like \"WTF\" how did this character turn out like this. This anime really had all the potential in the world but poorly executed. I still enjoyed it because the concept was interesting and the music was good and I liked the main heroine but other than that, this anime is nothing special. I give it a solid 8/10 because mainly the first few episodes are that good to raise the score but I also did like the art.",

            "content": "Step into the world of Plastic Memories where humanity exists alongside androids. These androids have emotions and are completely indistinguishable from humans. Of all of the androids that exist, known are more similar to humans than the Giftia. These Giftias are sold to people as companions, ranging from parents who could never have kids to substitute parents. The issue is that these robots have a short life span, about 9 years. When a Giftia reaches its expiration it loses it\u2019s memories and personality. After which point the androids become unstable and destructive. So, with this knowledge the government has set up Terminal Services. People whoretrieve the androids at the time of their expiration and that is where our protagonist comes in.\\n\\n\r\nPlot: The story revolves around Tsukasa Mizugaki who has recently been hired and assigned to work at Terminal Service 1. In terminal service each team has a spotter and a marksman. The spotter is the human and the marksman is the android. The two of them balance negotiating and other responsibilities on the job. Going in, Tsukasa has no idea what to do but he quickly catches on. His marksman Isla is a Giftia is a veteran on the job. She is skilled but rather clumsy and struggles with negotiation. The show covers their partnership and the struggles that they face. The relationship between these two characters is what is the heart of the show. It is a beautiful journey from start to finish. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Tsukasa and Isla are definitely the best characters in the show, which is good because it\u2019d be a serious issue if they weren\u2019t. Isla is absolutely adorable and the imperfections in her human code is what makes her stand out. Tsukasa is your traditional MC who wants to do good but it totally fits and his character is extraordinary. What he contributes to his team and partner is a mind that truly sees the feelings of these androids that he\u2019s basically putting to rest. Other standouts are Michiru who has been with the Service for one more year than Tsukasa. She plays your typical girl that falls in love with the MC, what I did like however was what they did with her. The show uses her in a clever way and she becomes pretty important to the story. The only other standout is Kazuki who is the boss at the Service Terminal. She was enjoyable and I liked discovering her relationship with Isla as the show went on. Unfortunately the rest of the cast are stereotypical archetypes so no other standouts.\\n\\n\r\nAtmosphere: This show understands where it thrives and boy does it thrive. This anime pulls no punches when they want you to feel pure sorrow and heartbroken. Prepare yourself. The whole anime has a great feel to it, regardless of what you think while you\u2019re watching you\u2019ll at least have this feeling which is hard to describe other than saying it has a charm to it. It pulls you in and keeps you. Quick mention, the last episode is one of my favorite episodes of any anime, period. It is breath taking and pleasing. It captures every emotion of the show and condenses it into a very digestible and sad feeling. \\n\\n\r\nProblems: I don\u2019t have any really big issues with this show. It\u2019s no masterpiece but it\u2019s still quite good. \\n\\n\r\nArt: The art style is very pleasing. Everyone looks good for the most part. The show really showed it\u2019s stuff when it mattered. Nothing to complain about here.\\n\\n\r\nSound: Atmosphere is heavily influenced by the music and the music for this show was stellar when it needed to be. The opening is also really nice. Quick tip, watch at least the ending of the opening for each episode. You\u2019ll see why. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: This show is pretty amazing, I loved the concept and it provokes a lot of conversation as to what it would be like if we had basically humanistic androids. How human are they? Can you love one? It is a really touching anime and if you fall in love with Tsukasa and Isla you will be in for a real treat. It was really hard to explain how great this anime is without spoiling anything but It really is wonderful. I would basically rate it a 8.5 if I could.",

            "content": "Summarising quote: \"Create memories and cherish them.\" \r\nI try to take the general public's enjoyment as well as my own into account, so bear with me. Also, I may not pay attention to the nitty gritty details properly. I generally like to encapsulate the whole reaction and analyse its residual thoughts provoked in me than to focus in on little problems with the anime.\r\nAfter watching the first episode, I was intrigued. It was emotional, and clearly a very interesting start by drawing the audience's attention by starting off with a simple introduction to the characters. I knew it was sci-fi, but don't let this foolyou - if you thought this was focusing around that, it really isn't. This anime is a \"feels\" trip as people like to call it nowadays, exploring the relationship between a robot with a soul infused in it (ie: a \"giftia\") and their partner. I don't consider this anime to be a story that uncovers mysteries or certain holes in the plot, nor does it try to be one that does so. The story is weak, but by no means bad. It is simply explores feelings and relationships, in a touching way. If you are looking for an anime with a story or somewhat a plot, and a \"feels\" romance, I would direct you to \"Shigastu wa Kimi no Uso\" instead.\\n\\n\r\nI can understand why many people do not like this anime. It is simply too predictable, there is little character development (rather there is character \"exploration\" I might say) and no excitement. However, I personally find it to be unique. It starts off as somewhat a romcom, but later turns into something more heartfelt. The name \"Plastic Memories\" is important, because this anime digs deep to find out how important memories are, (emotionally, not philosophically) and the meaning of memories and happy times with someone's loved one. Memories are important, and can prove to be painful even if they are happy. But what is important is not the pain, but the memory itself serving as a reminder to what you have done, and sharing it with others only reinforces its impact, be it sad, happy, angry etc. that you can take later on with you in life and cherish forever. \\n\\n\r\nI will say, however, that I feel the characters weren't drawn out fully. I would have liked to have seen more character interaction an development between the supporting characters to show their impact and importance to the development of the main characters' memories and realisations.\\n\\n\r\nI believe that if this anime were to have a season 2, it would be great to see how the main character has moved on and see how he interacts with others. If a different style were to emerge, it could develop a similar realisation story with a plot accompanying it, and focus on different characters instead. However, I believe that this season is enough to settle this anime.\\n\\n\r\nI don't really have a knack for reviewing the animation quality so this will be brief and probably not the best to trust.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 8 \\n\r\nBasically everything above.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 10 \\n\r\nI found nothing to be wrong with it. Very colourful and vibrant.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10 \\n\r\nMusic helped to create the mood. I found nothing to be wrong with it.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 8\\n\r\nFairly well developed but would have liked to have seen more of the supporting roles if this anime were longer. Other supporting characters seemed to be developed a bit more than the \"main\" supporting characters (characters that were always just in the background).\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8\\n\r\nThis is personal, but I really enjoyed it. I only put 8 because it doesn't exactly agree with my personal taste for a deeper plot and some kind of moral (something related to the real world, rather than just it being purely psychological), but it was good, I personally also didn't see much fault with it.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8\\n\r\nI feel that this anime does the job to satisfy it being a \"feels\" trip, and for many people, this is what it would be. However, the moral of it is harder to reach and can be overlooked by many, as it is not very explicit. If you watch it after having read this review, I hope you will come to appreciate my views.  Feel free to contact me if you disagree with anything, or want a discussion.\\n\r\nI recommend this anime to \"feels\" lovers, people who don't mind a story with lacking action and plot, and those that like to reflect about relationships with others.\\n\\n\r\nAs always, read multiple reviews to get a second opinion. I don't trust myself :P\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "In the distant future, a constantly-expanding company known as the \"SAI Corporation\" has created a way to install human emotions into androids in order to assist with various levels of human companionship. Tsukasa Mizugaki, after failing his college entrance exams, had no choice but to accept a job at SAI following a recommendation from his father. His role in the company was none other than working in the department that retrieves androids that are on the brink of expiration. This completely-original new series will leave you grasping for tissues far more often than you can handle.\r\nThis sci-fi drama by Naotaki Hayashi (Memories Off 2nd/Steins;Gate: TheDistant Valhalla) is the first complete anime series from the seasoned scenario writer. Plastic Memories is animated by the somewhat lesser known studio \"Dogakobo\" and was produced by Aniplex with some help from MAGES. (The studio. No actual mages were used in the making of this series...as far as I know). I'm the kind of guy that reads through every listing on AniChart prior to the launching of the new seasons. And if there are any two things that catch my eye during those moments of intense eye-straining, they would be \"Original series\" and \"Drama\". Needless to say, I Immediately highlighted Plastic Memories in green and eagerly chalked it down as my most-anticipated show of Spring 2015. Having no knowledge of what it would be, apart from the brief description available on a few news sites, I was ready for anything..Almost anything, at least.\\n\\n\r\nPlastic Memories follows 18 year-old Tsukasa Mizugaki as he lands a job at the \"Terminal Service Department\" of the SAI Corporation. Terminal Service's only real responsibility is the collection of humanistic androids known as \"Giftias\" as they reach the end of their lifespan. This job normally comes with anguish and disdain, seeing as these androids can fulfill the roles of child, parent, friend, etc. Needless to say, most owners are quite reluctant to give up their companions. The thing is though, if the giftias go on to \"Live\" past their expiration date, things get kind of bad. The androids basically go haywire, resulting in a nearly complete loss of memories and a state of shock/confusion for them that can even cause them to harm others in rare cases.\\n\\n\r\nBut the show takes an even more dramatic turn when Tsukasa is paired with a giftia as his partner at Terminal Service. It becomes less of a show detailing the hardships that come with relinquishing companionship, but instead becomes more of a depiction on how things get to that point -- how things like relationships decay over time. And more often than not, that time and those relationships go by faster than anyone could ever realize. The chemistry between Tsukasa and Isla grows stronger with each episode. At the same time, however, so does the knowledge that their relationship will come to a close a lot sooner than they want it to. So now we get this roller-coaster ride of emotions as we are essentially forced to watch the two fall apart. This brings up questions most of us are too afraid to ask, particularly the age-old question, \"Would you want to know exactly when you are going to die?\". \\n\\n\r\nIt is important to note, however, that this show isn't just tears, sadness, and an excuse to tweet sad emojis. There are a solid amount of scenes in this show that are packed to the brim with hilarity and allusions to other popular anime series out there. There was even one scene where Tsukasa just flat-out dropped a Chuunibyou Demo Koi Ga Shitai! reference and I basically just died on the spot. These moments of intense jubilance and laughter really create an atmosphere that feels...realistic. Life isn't all sorrow, despite what many angsty teenagers think (And I'm allowed to say that because I was once among them). Happy memories constantly attempt to overwrite sad ones. The thing is, that isn't all that easy, and Plastic Memories knows that. It hits ten times harder whenever Isla starts to talk about how she won't be able to keep her memories for much longer.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters apart from Tsukasa and Isla are good, but not particularly interesting apart from who I would call the \"Main\" side-character, and that is a fiery red-headed tsundere Michiru. Only one side-character apart from her has actual background information, but to be honest, the show doesn't really get you to care about it at all. But that's just a problem you are going to come across when you have such great chemistry between the two main characters. Any situation they don't factor into becomes obsolete in a way. And so those brief moments detailing the past are okay, but there are more important things we have to deal with right now. Tsukasa and Isla only have so much time together. I don't think that time was well-spent in those glimpses into the past for other Terminal Service members.\\n\\n\r\nAnother thing I want to touch on before we wrap this up would be the noticeable mood-shifts in the series. Even though they do create that \"Realistic\" feel I mentioned earlier, something still seemed...amiss about them. I can't put my finger on what it was exactly, but it just didn't feel right at times. Don't get me wrong, I'm completely fine with the show playing out like this, but I would understand why some people would call it an issue. In my opinion though, which is what reviews are really all about, the mood-shifts only slightly take away from the overall experience. There is still a plethora of important themes like mortality, coping, and how many relationships are doomed to fail from the get-go. These themes are what really make Plastic Memories the show that it is.\\n\\n\r\nPlastic Memories creates a story viewers actually care about. Its relationships, even though they are set in a sci-fi environment, feel a lot more real than other relationships in current anime. The story is well-paced and well-written in an impressive semi-debut from Hayashi. The ending, though I will not spoil it right here, provides slight closure but still gives that looming sadness that will creep all over your body. It leaves room for a second season, but does not beg for one. And though I highly doubt there will be one, I would still love to see it. Plastic Memories is equal parts adorable, touching, and memorable all at the same time. It is easily accessible and I would recommend it for new and old fans of drama. Original shows are becoming less common with how many different ways things can be adapted now. But where they are done correctly, they look just like this.",

            "content": "Warning:\r\nThis anime will tear your soul a new asshole.. jk :^)\r\n**SPOILERS AHEAD**\r\nPlastic Memories is a love story of a guy and an expiring android... nothing much more to it.\r\nThe Plot\r\nSo as one would obviously guess, as the story progresses, the main characters Isla and Tsukasa fall in love and typically, as one side wants to avoid hurting the other one, she decides to ignore him, and again, typically, they make up and live happily forever... well almost.\r\nThe problem is that to the watcher it becomes apparent in very early stages that there is no way of avoiding the expiration of a gifta. Isla is goingto die and the guy cant do a shit about it. So the anime turns into a terminally ill cancer patient.\\n\\n\r\nSo what was the point of this anime again? Oh well, to show that people relationships have ups and downs and you should not be afraid of \"making memories\" (who the f**k translated this?). Did someone just say clich\u00e9?\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters\\n\\n\r\nCharacters in this anime are stereotypical and obvious rippoffs(no point arguing here).\\n\r\nDark haired Mr. Nice Guy\\n\r\nKawaii shy loli\\n\r\nAsuka\\n\r\nThe perverted big breasted girl\\n\r\nThe ladies man\\n\r\nBoss who has no authority\\n\r\nStrict bitch\\n\r\nStrict bitch 2\\n\r\n2 guys one cup\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe clickbait\\n\\n\r\nThis anime features a typical \"escape from harsh reality\" workplace where the employees get to do the f**k they want to. They come to work as it was a f**king school lol. The watcher is supposed to symapthize with the typical main male protagonist and then like the kawaii flat chested loli. For people who like S/M they added Asuka and the other bitch.\\n\\n\\n\r\nWhy I dont like this anime?\\n\\n\r\nBecause the anime lacks of plot. We have relationship crap going on, we have some character development going on (asuka turns into a less of a bitch) and some boring backstroy filling... AND THATS IT. Maybe its me... maybe I'm disappointed that the anime turned out to be some kind  slice of life hack. Maybe its because that I can feel that the scriptwriter didnt bother to work very hard to create a bit more interesting story and went for simple ca$h money templates.\\n\\n\\n\r\nWhat makes this anime different?\\n\\n\r\nThe main strength of this anime is also its greatest weakness. To create such deeply emotional story the author had to freeze the plot development, the characters dont have any \"interactivity\" with their fate. They cant do anything to stop whats coming, there is no deus ex machima (favorite element of many other series) and I like it because I'm tired of absurd solutions and happy endings. BUT when there is nothing meaningful happening in the anime, its not very pleasureful to watch.\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt\\n\\n\r\nArt level was good (white rim on everything was a bit too much) and animations were nice, except for a scene where they loop how one guy is rubbing another guys arm... very triggering.\\n\\n\\n\r\nConclusion\\n\\n\r\nThere is a good reason why this anime is rated 7.88 on MAL(>implying its a low score). An anime that manages to keep its plot evolving and fresh gets rated much, much higher.\\n\\n\r\n5/10\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nTo watch or not to watch?\\n\\n\r\nUh?... U liek FEELS m9? If yes, then watch this anime for sensless FEELS and DRAMA, try not to think too much though.",

            "content": "Plastic memories is set in a world where technology allows human souls to be granted to androids, called Giftias.  These androids are virtually identical to humans and don't age physically, but only live for 11 years.  Our protagonist is a young man who recently joined Terminal Services, a department that is responsible for collecting Giftias who are approaching the end of their lives.  \r\nThe most important thing to understand about this show, and something I think wasn't understood by some people going in, is that this isn't anything deeply philosophical like Ghost in the Shell or something.  It's not attempting tomake any sort of grand sweeping statements about reality, society, or anything like that.  That's not the angle they're going for here.  At the end of the day, Plastic Memories is a love story.  The early episodes focus heavily on their job, and thus their impact on society, but that serves mostly as a framework to give the rest of the show greater impact.  And viewed from that perspective, it's fantastic.  \\n\\n\r\nThe protagonist is honestly very refreshing.  He's strong, but in a normal, human way.  It's nice to have a main character who's completely aware.  He understands what's going on around him, and deals with it like an adult.  \\n\\n\r\nI found Plastic Memories to be one of the more earnest, heart-felt romances I've seen in anime.  It's honestly quite startling how some scenes seem to overflow with genuine pure love.  The character development in the two leads is significant, lending credibility to their relationship.  Their bond actually develops and grows, and they change as people because of it.  \\n\\n\r\nSo sit down, grab some tissues, and go nuts.  If you're looking for hard sci-fi or large-scale societal intrigue, this isn't that.  If you like touching love stories, you'll like this.",

            "content": "Plastic Memories is your run of the mill romance/drama with a little sci-fi sprinkled in there. I didn't hate the show, but it did little to stand out from the rest of the genre. When I finished the last episode, however, I did look back at the show in a positive light. Though the show lacks originality, it is not so clich\u00e9 that it is unwatchable. The show clearly demonstrates why there are typical plot and character devices in romance/dramas, it\u2019s because they work time and time again.\r\n I'll keep the rest of this review short. \r\nStory: 5/10\r\nThis show has no surprises, and from thefirst episode you will likely know exactly how the story will end. The story is driven by one key fact that Giftias (the robots in the show) have a limited life span. With this one rule, the rest of the story plays out through character interaction. The futuristic sci-fi world set up in the show plays little to no role in the story other than the existence of sentient robots. I was quite displeased in how little the world was developed, but what can you ask for in 12 episodes.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nThe character designs and backgrounds are well done but unoriginal. The art works for the show.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nThe OP is pretty catchy and the rest of the music was well done. It doesn't stand out too much and there was nothing that I heard that amazed me.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nI was pretty disappointed in the main characters. They are very bland. Tsukasa is your typical male hero who is sensitive and does the right thing, and Isla is your typical heroin that seems to be stupidly incompetent and relies on the hero for everything. The show is saved in this department by having a good cast of side characters. They are funny and significantly more dynamic that the main characters. I found that I enjoyed their development more than the main ones.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nEven thought the show is unoriginal and very predictable, I still enjoyed it. As I said previously, the show plays the typical plot and character devices for the genre; however, there is a reason that the clich\u00e9s are used. It's because they work. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7/10\\n",

            "content": "I was really hyped for this anime before it aired since it was going to be produced by the studio I adore so much and also because of the staff and cast the anime gets which I was surprised to see.\r\nWelcome to this futuristic city in Plastic Memories, where humans live together with androids that have typical human characteristics - physical, mental and emotional - named Giftias. Produced and managed by the SAI Corporation, they are able to live up to 81,920 hours, and problems arise when they are expired. So, its Terminal Service department are responsible for collecting soon-to-expire Giftias, where their memories willbe erased. The story follows Tsukasa, who is offered a job into the department, and her partner Isla, a Giftia who does not seem to know what she is supposed to do.\\n\\n\r\nAt first glance, you might think that \u201coh, we will probably some work from these service people in the story\u201d. My short answer is \u201cyes, you will\u201d, but my definite answer is that the focus in the story has been shifted from one place to another as it progresses. There are indeed retrievals shown in the anime, while a few are \u2018interesting\u2019. However, they are usually riddled with plot-holes, where you may not understand the situation well or how it panned out from start to end. This does not mean that they are not enjoyable, depending on the outcome and how the viewers feel, I think that they are good to watch. The idea of Giftias in the story is great - knowing for the fact that they do not survive, we can see how the human owners react to, and of course the emotions it portray. One usually feels sad whenever their companion leaves the world, right? Sometimes, their emotions took over and they want to escape with their Giftias, hence the \u201c\u2019interesting\u2019 retrievals\u201d part comes to play. But so what? I feel that the idea of Giftias still lacks - some questions left answered - hence the \u2018sci-fi\u2019 part of the anime needs more work.\\n\\n\r\nSince there is the romance genre in the anime, it is pretty obvious that Tsukasa and Isla are in a relationship. Like I said, the focus shifted. Without spoiling, I can say that their romantic development is quite slow, since they took their time to think about their feelings. Eventually, at one point of the story, one of the two confessed and they became romantic buddies. tfw I would not have this kind of story in my workplace. As many claimed, their relationship is also interesting to watch. In fact, that is clearly the main point of the story. The development steadily improves towards the climax, and that is where more feelings developed. One might argue that it is clich\u00e9d and I can agree, but it is pleasing for many.\\n\\n\r\nThe cast involves partly from this special Terminal Service full of great people of different personalities. Apart from Tsukasa and Isla, there are a few who have more prominence than the rest, and they usually support the pair for the greater good. What I really love about the story is Isla\u2019s change from being shy and dull to being more open and happy, hence her character development is lovely. Tsukasa has some moments, but he also changed gradually. With the support from his colleagues, his approach towards Isla gets better. Hey, isn\u2019t that sweet? The rest of cast are side characters, which most of them appear for retrieval jobs. There are some that has good backstory to share, trying to move with the viewers, while others are okay. \\n\\n\r\nThe animation for this anime is pretty. The futuristic setting around the city looks great, achieving a nice \u2018hi-tech\u2019 feel. But even so, there are some locations that look normal and yet still looking nice and fresh. It is nice that some of the sceneries are referenced from real-life places. Overall, I like the sceneries done, with a nice colourful palette as well as the lighting that portrays the mood of the scenes. The character designs look okay, but the facial expressions are a charm. They are able to capture a lot of emotions from happy to sad, whether they are exaggerated or not.\\n\\n\r\nThe opening song, sung by Eri Sasaki (a newcomer), captures something special for this anime. The instrumental makes up this emotional feeling, and the vocals are powerful. The ending song, sung by Asami Imai (remember Chihaya?), is nice to hear and that is because of her beautiful voice. I like the instrumental as well, but if you want something with more impact, the opening song is a better choice. The soundtrack is impressive, thanks to Masuru Yokoyama\u2019s compositions, who also helped out in Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso and Rolling\u2606Girls. The tracks manage to fit it the mood of the scenes perfectly. The voice acting is well-done, especially of how some of them who express their characters\u2019 emotions brilliantly. Special mention for Yasuaki Takumi, who voiced Tsukasa, for the great work. \\n\\n\r\nSure, not many people will like Plastic Memories because their expectations or impressions go different as the anime progresses, and I can totally understand. Thus, it should be noted that this anime focuses more on the relationship between a human and a Giftia, who are both partners at work. It is quite weird (or heart-wrecking for some) to read the previous sentence, but the development truly captures the essence of the anime. I can say that I am quite satisfied with the story, except if the writing can be better, hence I enjoyed the anime very much.",

            "content": "The theme of artifical life created by humans has been a staple in the world of scifi, particularly when the artificial life are androids that closely resembles its creator. It's these near-humans that provide an expansive world of possibilities in story telling that reflects back on what it means to be human. In Plastic Memories, this is the starting point for the story of the relationship between Tsukasa and Isla, a young man and an android, both of whom struggle to understand their feelings for each other while under the shadow the technical limitations of artificial humans in the story universe. \r\nThe story wastes notime in establishing the plot framework for the androids called \u201cgiftias\u201d. Purchased by individuals to be used as companions and servants, the giftias are manufactured by the same massive corporation that has employed a down-on-his-luck Tsukasa in its retrieval department. With an operational life span of nine years, Tsukasa learns that giftias must be retrieved from their owners before their expiration date, the risk being that their artificial minds will quickly degrade with potentially disastrous results. \\n\\n\r\nThe limited lifespan of the giftias is the underlying plot mechanic that progresses the story as Tsukasa's relationship with his work partner, Isla, develops. With her expiration date rapidly approaching, both characters face a situation where their growing feelings for each other is constrained by the unmovable limitations of the giftia technology. \\n\\n\r\nIt's the premise of this story that originally attracted me to this series, which seemed to be rich in opportunities for further exploring a much-loved scifi theme. Unfortunately, I felt that it came up well short in this regard. The giftia concept worked nicely in relating to the contemporary issue of the development of artificial human companionship, modern Japan being a prime example of these efforts. But in Plastic Memories, it feels more like a secondary plot mechanic to kickstart Tsukasa and Isla's relationship and drive it to the conclusion of the story. \\n\\n\r\nThere is some effort to explorer the human-android relationship implications through the clients of the retrieval service, but those are all too brief and really only touch briefly on some of the issues without raising any substantial questions. In this respect, the world of the giftias and its technology felt under-developed and seemed more like a simple background setting for establishing the framework for the couple's relationship.\\n\\n\r\nIn contrast, the romance side of the story does succeed. Isla and Tsukasa's characters effectively work well together in the story to portray two young lovers caught in a hopeless situation. A weak point is  that Tsukasa's character is rather generic in design, Like many male leads in a romance, there's never really any doubt that his seemingly limitless reserves of optimism and dedication will ever waver. Of the two, we see the most progression with Isla. I found her rather offputting at the start of the series, as she felt like a mishmash of well-worn traits designed to pull in the audience, but as the story developed she gained a lot of depth. The supporting characters were serviceable in advancing the story, but none of those characters particularly stood out or were memorable. \\n\\n\r\nIn the visuals department, the animation was quite nice overall, particularly the animation for the characters and their facial expressions. Nice background art tied everything together visually. However, there were numerous times when it felt like the studio had focused their animation efforts and budget on key scenes. There were far too many still shots and static montage scenes that were immersion-breaking. It was those moments where I kept getting the impression that they simply didn't have the resources to fully animate some scenes and had to take shortcuts as a result. \\n\\n\r\nIs it a show that I would recommend? The first few episodes were particularly weak. If anyone is going into the show looking for a good romance, they need to know that they should stick it out to the end. For anyone going in looking for a really interesting story about androids and artificial life, they may be disappointed. A lot of opportunities to explore some really interesting ideas were not taken. With these caveats in mind, Plastic Memories is still worth a watch. It comes up well short in the scifi, but does deliver on the romance drama side.\\n",

            "content": "OK, I'm going to keep this review short. Three things to note about this anime: it is a romantic slice of life anime, it has a proper ending (no loose endings), and it isn't your standard romance anime. I assume you've read the anime synopsis on MAL.\r\nI was honestly surprised at how good Plastic Memories was. I didn't go in with a lot of expectations and romance anime are a hit or miss with me. This anime respects the viewer. It is a romantic slice of life anime with some themes concerning death and loss (that aren't heavy handed) with which you could draw realworld parallels, actual romantic development, doesn't make use of any cheap gimmicks, and main characters you don't end up hating. For example, quite a lot of romance anime make use of twists or emotional music to create more tension or emotion than there actually is. Plastic Memories doesn't do that. It depends on its characters for emotion and tension, and succeeds. A lot of reviews criticize this anime for being linear and predictable, but here's the thing, it never tried to be unpredictable. Being \"predictable\" is a bad thing if an anime actually tried to be unpredictable; however, the direction of Plastic Memories was very clear from the start, and honestly, that was quite refreshing. It didn't try to fool the viewer with cheap drama, and I really liked that. \\n\\n\r\nPlastic memories has one of the more realistic romances I've seen in anime (which is kinda funny, considering the fictional setting). Its characters, while some of them were a little cliched, were quite good too, especially considering the amount of episodes this anime had to develop them. The character development was gradual, instead of being unrealistically sudden. Given the vast world this anime took place in, it could have easily lost its focus, but it maintained its focus on being a romance anime. \\n\\n\r\nThe sound and art were decent too. I really liked how the ending part of the opening changed almost every episode.\\n\\n\\n\r\nI highly recommend this anime, especially if you like romances. Even if you don't like Plastic Memories, at least you'll see that not all romances have to make use of the same tropes and cliches concerning plot. It didn't blow me away, but it is a very solid romance anime.",

It sat the mood of the whole anime. I would say it was familiar and unique. Familiar because I\u2019ve seen it in other \u201cnew\u201d anime and unique, because of the way it fitted the story to the fullest. The style of this anime also fit the mood. I felt it sat the mood, and for me that is one of the most important things when watching anime. The backgrounds in this anime where detailed, but notso I got lost in the story. When I watch anime an important thing for me to continue watching are the backgrounds. I feel that in some anime the background disappear a bit, and the style focus too much on the character. It does not in Plastic Memories! The backgrounds were an important factor in this story, and I got drawn into the plot. It was hard for me to go to sleep because of that. It may seem I was too drawn into the background-design, but I wasn\u2019t. I felt it helped me focus on the characters, and see the whole thing. The characters design was likewise. They worked together. I felt the characters personality, and how they were designed helped me to see the characters. Their voices fitted them perfectly, so I have nothing to complain about there. Because of their voices I feel I lose sight of the personality of the characters. I did not during this anime.  The OP and the ED fitted this anime perfectly too. I felt it sat the whole mood. It helped me recover from feel-trained-episodes (the ED), when I had had a feel-trained-moment. The ED and the OP wasn\u2019t misleading at all. \\n\\n\r\nThe anime is about a boy named Tsukasa Mizugaki who is offered a position at the SAI Corporation. SAI Corporation is a company known for its production, and management, of androids/\u201drobots\u201d with human emotions. They are called \u201cGiftia\u201d. The Giftia have a limited lifespan. In the company all the humans are working alongside with a Giftia. They are retrieving Giftia of other humans when their last day comes. \\n\\n\r\nFor me he story was beautiful. It was both heartbreaking and heartwarming at the same time. This is an anime in the genre sci-fi/comedy/drama/romantic. Beware of the feel-train. It started already the first episode! But the emotional moments could not bring me to stop watching. I only wanted more.\\n\\n\r\nI give it a 9 out of 10! Nothing to complain about. I enjoyed this anime to the fullest and I will definitely watch it over and over again.",

Tsukasa failed in his entrance exam so the friend of his father recommend him to a work he don't know until he went to the place and met a girl named Isla. I have no idea about how will the story goes on until you watch all episodes. At first, the story focus on the dramatic moments between the Giftias andtheir owner. Explaining the work they doing when retrieving the giftias from their owner and you can feel the emotions in it when they are retrieving them.

            "content": "(This has been adapted from my blog/reddit thread. Spoilers ahead!)\r\nI have talked about memories in other reviews that I have written, and it is fascinating the things you start to recollect when you begin contemplating that word. I remember this time when I played indoor soccer as the goalie. I will never forget how, during one match, I managed to kick the ball from our end into their net due to a super lucky bounce. I rarely scored (I was not very good) so such a rare occurrence combined with the manner in which it happened is something that will stick with me forever. Thereare also those not-so-happy memories; I remember my grandpa\u2019s funeral, watching my mother and her siblings weeping for their father, with me, my brother, and my other cousins carrying the casket. It is one of the saddest moments I have ever experienced, with me still owning the cotton glove to this day. Soccer or family, happy or sad, memories are, as Plastic Memories somewhat depicts, a beautiful existence that should not be tossed aside but instead embraced for as long as humanly (and Giftia-ly) possible.\\n\\n\r\nSTORY\\n\\n\r\nPlastic Memories follows young Tsukasa Mizugaki who has just recently transferred into a company that deals in the retrieval of \u201cGiftias,\u201d or cyborgs with human souls. Partnering with a clumsy Giftia known as Isla, the two\u2019s relationship slowly blossoms.\\n\\n\r\nPlastic Memories manages to get off on the wrong foot from the very beginning due to apparent tonal issues. The tone of an anime or any other work is set in stone, with minor fluctuations throughout. For example, a comedy is designed to make the audience laugh, but that does not mean it must fully abstain from serious or less-than-light-hearted moments. Instead, it must make sure that it keeps the tone in mind and refrain from making egregious divergences from its initial path. Think of the tone like a slinky: it can bend, twist, and contort but when left alone it always goes back to its neutral state. For Plastic Memories, it takes the slinky and nearly breaks it. Very early on, the anime does not know what it really wants to be; one scenario has a tender moment between a grandmother and her grandchild only to have the next piece of dialogue revolve around potty humor. The next episode has intermittent joking that is not as jarring but the episode following becomes nothing but humor despite the drama surrounding it all. This problem is finally corrected by the fourth episode onward, so the tonal issues leave, but that kink in the slinky always remains and is therefore never forgotten.\\n\\n\r\nThe show\u2019s greatest strength lies in the events that take place. Essentially, every situation is designed for one of two purposes, sometimes both in unison: building the world and guiding the series towards the finale. This sounds very simple, perhaps mandatory for any tale, but it is how natural it all comes off as being that gives the narrative its edge. With each encounter, the anime does a nice job of providing the rules or foundation regarding the \u201cGiftias\u201d that have become commonplace. What a \u201cGiftia\u201d is, how they are used and taken care of, who they are, when certain problems arise because of them; situations like the Giftia who goes rogue or the Giftia who undergoes a reboot allow the audience to learn of the world and its workings through natural progression of the plot. Simultaneously, these same events indirectly push the narrative down the \u201cpath of no return\u201d \u2013 namely, Isla\u2019s death. The anime never outright claims how the show will end, but it does not have to, for the previously established rules indicate that her eventual passing is simply inevitable and irreversible. By doing this, the finale does not feel forced or cheap, leaving the viewer with a welcome sense of satisfaction.\\n\\n\r\nThroughout the drama, comedy, and world-building elements, the anime plays with its theme of memories. What is interesting is how the title plays into it all. An anime\u2019s title is synonymous with the \u201cface\u201d of the show, meaning careful consideration is given to it. Here, calling the memories \u201cplastic\u201d might seem like a reference to the Giftias and their robotic status, but it is more profound than this. Plastic is a material that is not biodegradable; it fails to erode or fade no matter what happens to it, and the same can be said of memories. They last a lifetime, long after the moment passes, shaping a person\u2019s life for the better. They occur in the past, are remembered in the present, and affect the future, giving them the power they hold. In Plastic Memories\u2019 case, memories do the same; the show depicts recollections of previous happenings, provides new ones in the form of lap naps and a Ferris wheel, and preserves them in a tiny yet personable diary. The beginning bogs down this type of thinking due to being funny rather than serious, and by the end it is not immediately clear how everlasting memories are due to the romantic relationship that gains a lot of the focus, but the anime at least demonstrates how important such a concept truly is.\\n\\n\r\nANIMATION\\n\\n\r\nPlastic Memories takes place mostly at the on-site location where Tsukasa, Isla, and the rest work, as well as the dorm rooms that house them. However, the show does deviate from the norm by having the characters visit amusement parks, local cafes, shopping malls, movie theaters, and other parts of the main premises. The lighting is often appropriate, camera work is nothing special, and reaction faces are aplenty to fall in line with the reactionary comedy.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the character designs, they are almost overly futuristic mostly due to the required white officer outfit they all wear to signify the position they hold in society. Other than their actual clothes, characters like Isla and Michiru retain cuteness and beauty, respectively, Kazuki\u2019s flame-like bun matches her fiery personality, and Tsukasa, as is the case with most main characters, is as plain as plain can be. Overall, nothing spectacular is given, but they at least keep themselves from being overbearing or distracting.\\n\\n\r\nActual animation is somewhere slightly above average. Despite the action that sometimes takes place, the show is normally filled with dialogue-heavy segments between the characters. As such, the animation is not too extensive but there are moments \u2013 such as when Kazuki gets angry or Michiru becomes flustered \u2013 when it does pick up. They are infrequent, but even then, the show does a nice job of incorporating facial expressions, hair movements, and other subtleties to give movement where needed.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS\\n\\n\r\nThe majority of the cast does not hold much of a place in the grander scheme of things. Yasutaka is a womanizer and Takao is a husband who has troubles being a father to his daughter, but both fail to affect the plot at large, as do the other side characters. At the minimum, Kazuki and Michiru have interconnecting pasts that provide the audience with the chance to not only learn more about the mysterious Giftias and how they are treated but also aid in revealing Isla\u2019s past. Such memory investigation is contextually relevant and therefore more powerful in terms of the characters and their development.\\n\\n\r\nConsidering her place in the anime, Isla is without a doubt the strongest character of the show. Initially, she is perceived as nothing but a klutz; she cannot perform basic on-site duties, she has difficulty socializing with others, and the only task she is truly capable of performing is watering plants and making tea. Over time, the viewer comes to understand that Isla, despite her weak abilities, cares deeply for the people around her, especially her fellow Giftias. But after experiencing so many scenarios and undergoing her own form of loss, she ironically comes to a rather depressing conclusion: that it would be best for her not to be remembered. She resigns herself to a fate worse than death, becoming a recluse to remove herself from everyone\u2019s memories, for she feels that if she is forgotten than she can keep those close to her from ever getting hurt. It is not until Tsukasa comes into the fray, peeling back her shell and being there for her when others would not, that she finally begins to open. She comes to understand that memories are not meant to be painful; they are meant to be celebrated, to give those that live something fond to look back on, because memories stand the test of time. Her final conversation makes this wholly evident, where she reminisces with Tsukasa about the memories they have of each other, allowing her to move on in a moment that is beautifully poignant.\\n\\n\r\nAs for Tsukasa, he is by no means a strong character but he does manage to bring about his own message. Not much is known of him early on besides the standard qualities: he is nice, he is hard working, and he is funny every once in a while. However, when he experiences the implications of a rogue Giftia, the audience sees how emotionally compromised he is. Outwardly, he always tries to be the upstanding dude, but inwardly, he goes through difficulties just as Isla and the others do. As he bids farewell to Isla the audience sees, for the first time, him putting forth his feelings without any reservations. It is a minor change in his person, but the time he had and the relationship he established with the girl of his dreams gave him the outlook he always needed: to cherish what one has now, for it could be gone before one knows it.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND\\n\\n\r\nThe opening theme is quite strong when it first starts. The singing is soft and gentle, with a bout of strange sounds adding to the less-than-happy atmosphere. However, by the second half it loses its luster, becoming a conglomerate of noise that is not pleasing to the ears. The ending theme, similar to its OP counterpart, has an immediately good start with a catchy tune carrying it into the main portion. There, the piece becomes a mix of melancholy and happiness that fits the mood of the anime quite well. As the track ends, it takes on the same beat as how it started, making a whole package worth listening to.\\n\\n\r\nThe rest of the soundtrack is largely forgettable, with the show using a typical set of tracks for the mood at hand. Some of the tracks utilize pianos and violins for the sad times, quirky sounds for the happy ones, and even English-heavy lyrical pieces for those very special occasions. The tracks are nothing grand or poor in execution, but none are worth caring for, either.\\n\\n\r\nVoice acting for Plastic Memories is somewhere around average. A special shout-out is deserved for Chinatsu Akasaki as Michiru for her defensive way of speaking.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT\\n\\n\r\nI hate goodbyes, despite knowing they are a part of our daily lives. I think this is why I bawled when it came to the ending; having to bid farewell to someone who is so cherished is something that really resonates with me emotionally. I was not even that attached to Isla as a character, but the concept and the situation had many tears streaming down my face as the finale was happening.\\n\\n\r\nIf I get a bit more personal here, when I remember my grandfather\u2019s funeral again, I have this distinct memory of me standing there, looking at the peaceful look he had on his face. I remember not crying, but shaking my head, almost unable to comprehend that this person, who I have known for so long, was now physically gone from this world. There were things I wanted to ask him, should have asked him, but never got the chance. But then I looked behind me at the monitor that had been set up, where the picture reel of the life he led was being played. Him at the cottage with his own kids, that one time at a restaurant where we celebrated his wedding anniversary; so many memories were flashing by \u2013 some that I experienced with him and some that I had not \u2013 that it was obvious how great a life he had. Today, at this moment, I realize now that he is not gone. He is in my heart, with the memories of him that I have being something that is truly eternal. I have this anime to thank for making me understand this simple fact that I should have known all along, and for that I will always be grateful.\\n\\n\r\nPlastic Memories is not the best when it comes to its art, its music, and even many of its characters. But the touching story it tells and the importance it places on memories is not only relatable but extremely sincere. Isla has moved on, but the memories of her will most certainly continue to exist in all of us.\\n\\n\r\nSUMMARY\\n\\n\r\nStory: Good, early tonal issues are eventually corrected, with natural events leading to a satisfying conclusion and a theme on memories which is executed well enough\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: Fine, okay art style, okay character designs, slightly above average actual animation\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Fine, side characters do not do much, Tsukasa is par for the course, with Isla being the strongest of the bunch\\n\\n\r\nSound: Fine, okay OP, good ED, okay soundtrack, average VA work\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Good, ending had me crying, but more importantly made me realize how fantastic memories really are\\n\\n\r\nFinal Score: 6/10",

We are introduced to a young man named Tsukasa who failed his exams but his father gave him a job where he retrieves Giftias, which are the androids we have talked about before, and he is paired with one just like everyone is; her name is Isla and she seems distant but grows closer and closer to him. (Sorry for the not needed summary, I just want my firstreview to be fancy!)\\n\r\nWhile looking at this anime's reviews, I've seen they aren't that great so I decided to make an account just to review this, I felt obligated to defend it so bear with me as this is my first review and I'll try to do my best.\\n\r\nTo me, this anime had a deep message about how we must get through all the bad things in our life and death must not be seen as a sad thing, but something we must accept. It had an amazing ending and I must say, I've never cried at an anime before. Then again, I don't really watch sad anime that much.\\n\r\nNow then, enough with the rambling, let's get on with the scores!\\n\\n\r\n .....:::STORY:::.....\\n\r\n______10/10______\\n\r\nOutstanding story, it had a deep meaning, it was sad but also had its happy moments, it has overwhelmed me with tears (episode 2 and the ending) and I really liked that it knew exactly when to end it.\\n\\n\r\n .....:::ART:::.....\\n\r\n_____9/10_____\\n\r\nEverything looked great and it was really well made, almost flawless.\\n\\n\r\n .....:::SOUND:::.....\\n\r\n______8/10______\\n\r\nIt was really good, but sometimes I can't tell if I'd like it without music to keep the atmosphere or with it to influence the viewer's current feelings.\\n\\n\r\n .....:::Character:::.....\\n\r\n_______7/10_______\\n\r\nI really liked all the characters, but some of them were kind of cliche, not going to go in detail though. Isla had a lot of character development and I enjoyed that very much, but everyone else was pretty ordinary and I don't really like tsunderes (not talking about Isla).\\n\\n\r\n .....:::Enjoyment:::.....\\n\r\n_______10/10_______\\n\r\nI have loved this series, it's really immersive. The thing Isla tells the other Giftias really impressed me: \"May you one day reunite with the one you cherish\"\\n\\n\r\n .....:::Overall:::.....\\n\r\n______9/10______\\n\r\nThis has been a really enjoyable anime, but personally I don't think a 2nd season would be good since we'd hate....\\n\\n\\n\r\nWe'd hate the absence of our dearest Isla :c\\n\r\nI still cry when I hear about this anime, too!\\n\\n\\n\r\nShould I keep making reviews?

            "content": "\" Memories warm you up from the inside. But they also tear you apart. \" - Haruki Murakami\r\nThe synopsis itself might sound a bit disheartening, so are some of the reviews but if your instinct is telling you to watch it, then you should follow it. The very first episode is impactful enough to keep you going but yet there's more to that.\r\nThis is a cheerful anime with awkward yet cute moments ( a bit cringy romance ) that will make you adore the main characters and the side characters as well, each with their own quirks. Of course, Isla stands out the most withher many expressions and her clumsiness which just steal everyone's heart. The story portray a fiction world where the technology has made its advancement to another level that robots with emotions are possible, however, with a certain lifespan. So you should already know how the story is going to end, and yet you won't be ready to hold your tears for it.\\n\\n\r\nThe main grasp of the story that moved me is how one's memory and personality can simply be taken away and the tool that used to activate it, is a ring, the very symbol of happiness and future. We seek to create memories as much as possible to cherish those little moments but yet some memories will eventually turn into a curse, they can warm us up inside and tear us apart at the same time. \\n\\n\r\nSo the real question that arises from this anime is, will you still seek to create memories with your loved ones, even though you know you will eventually lose them and even though these memories will shred you apart afterwards?\\n\\n\r\nThe answer is yes. Up to a certain point, we will all lose something or someone precious to us, someone we hold dear to, someone we can't forget and we don't want to forget. We will still do everything we can to create the memory, cherish them and to be with our loved ones because in the end, we are all human and nothing hurts more than regret.\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "The first half of the series fulfills my desire for a slice of life cyberpunk story. I was getting sick of the dystopias and the negative idea that technology is only going to be harmful to humanity. I enjoyed seeing how the short life-span of androids and how putting them out of commission and replacing their personalities were given a more sweet melancholic vibe in comparison to how these elements were treated in Philip K. Dick's \"Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep.\" Tsukasa had a lot going for him as a character because he's entering a work environment where people don't expect too much outof him and he wants to do more than what is expected for his own self-fulfillment. This characteristic complements Isla since she too is trying to overcome her own limitations in her own ways but still requires the help of others to find new approaches on how to overcome them. I enjoy how their interactions with the other characters embody the theme that relationships require work and both individual and group effort. I also enjoy how the anime allows the other characters to lead their own lives instead of spending every moment revolving around the relationship between Tsukasa and Isla.  However, the true nature of the anime is revealed through the second half where you realize that the only purpose of Tsukasa is to highlight the best qualities of Isla. I found this to be a great put-off since I was expecting to learn a bit more about Tsukasa and see how his self-perception and what he lacks as a person (hobbies and sense of where he wants to go in life) could possibly reflect his attraction to Isla.  I wish this anime could go deeper into the philosophy of obsolescence and make the androids seem more different than humans with more physical limitations other than losing their memories and personalities.  In the end this anime is a well-made slice of life, romantic comedy/tragedy, and cyberpunk anime. I would consider it as one of my greatest guilty-pleasures.",

From the first and second episodes i knew that i was right. The first time Tsukasa and Isla meet are in an elevator as Tsukasa is going to get a job. The look in Islas eyes were the first thing that brought me sadness. \r\nThroughout the course of the anime they build a relationship with each other which starts out in a building called Giftia retrieval force 1. This is whenthey next meet. Next is spoilers so i cant really say anything other than they work together for a while.\\n\\n\r\nIslas character evolves the most throughout the anime as she goes from an emotionless nobody who serves tea everyday to a happy go lucky girl who begins to enjoy life. Most of this is due to Tsukasa and the way he interacts with Isla. The rest ... I'll leave for you to find out. \\n\\n\r\nI would definitely recommend this to watch because of the sheer story-line and characters. But i will advise you to have tissues nearby as you will almost certainly be in tears.\\n\\n\r\nHopefully you enjoy and to quote Isla \" I hope you are one day reunited with the ones you love\".\\n\\n\r\nPs: I was crying in episodes 1-2 because of spoiler stuff.\\n\\n",

            "content": "Format: Passed Premise Format - 13 Episodes.\r\nAh! Plastic Memories had so much potential. Truth of the matter it could have gone on many different routes on which to take the story but given that it green lit with 13 episode the production team took it to what Plastic Memories is truly about, It's been a while since I've seen a story revolving around human & android relationship even since Chobbits!. \r\nRight now you're probably asking whether this is similar on any way to the mentioned anime above or do they share a format?. The answer is a simple no as the plot unfolding on PlasticMemories isn't meant to delve into a beautiful story or pull out a Hamlet by Shakespeare so the Hyenas at MAL could maybe be satisfied to have a medium of art turned into what they want it to be rather than to judge it for what is the anime trying to get at or judge an apple for being an apple not a screw.  Chobbits made it's presence known by  elaborating whether androids and humans could possibly hit it off and whether androids could perhaps  become self aware and the possible message of them stealing the human characteristic of socializing and ditch it somewhere for the company of a to quote Vegeta from Dragon Ball Z \"A bucket of screws\", An android.\\n\\n\r\nPlastic Memories went the other way and elaborated an scenario on which we've gone past self awareness and accept androids or \"Giftias\" how they're called in Plastic Memories as a being equal to or akin to human and set the template on a Slice of Life manner on which you could become the observer and be the receptors of the message this anime wished to deliver onto you.\\n\r\nThings like limited Life Span, Specifics about the design or how the Giftias work scarily identical to humans are tossed out the window. As well of onto how the idea or replicating the OS personality and copying of memories of a \"Giftia\" once gone passed the expiration date is never explored, This isn't neglect nor is it a flaw because the story isn't of value but the playout of situations development once the variables and/or unexplained factors are outright ignored so the anime can get started on doing what it is meant to do on this instance deliver a message and get your attention.\\n\\n\r\nStory = N/A, Summary = N/A, (Message = Applicable).  8\\n\\n\r\nMizugaki, Tsukasa is an 18yr old graduate who has failed to enter college since he failed his entrance exams because of an unexpected illness or maybe cold feet. His father calls in a favor to SAI CEO to give him a job that happens to be retrieving androids nearing expiration dates. Failure to do so can result on the androids erasure of personality and unlocking of absurd strength that all androids have but have limiters to so that they don't kill or destroy anything by accident or deliberately do so in the case of an error. \\n\\n\r\nHis partner is a Giftia that goes by the name of Isla to whom he little by little becomes drawn to and eentualy must deal with her eventual departure as a Giftia due to the circumstances of their life span. All of which the anime is really about, Closure, Moving on with your life  and the message to live out the fullest and make every second count. Most humans have an average life span of 68 - 83 years and because of this we see death really far on the horizon, Though personally I think of this as a very short life span our perception if time is elongated. Plastic Memories exploits this human characteristic by delivering to us a Giftia identical to humans but with a known limited life span.\\n\\n\r\nI've stated the average life span of a human but do you know how long you'll live?. Does anyone without an illness know exactly when is it we must depart from the world?. Would you love your life and make every second count if you knew how long you had since the very beginning and perhaps get things in order to do what humans ultimately can not do. That is, To say Good bye.\\n\\n\r\nThe Giftias are nothing but a proxy of us that puts known mortality to perspective. Would you live your life differently if by the time you're self aware you knew exactly how much you have to live and when is your expiration date?. I perhaps would  but that would certainly kill all the fun on my perspective. \\n\\n\r\nPlastic Memories message came flying with an array of different color on a very solid manner. Have you made every second count?.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: 8\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is very good and fluid, It did and performed under the task at hand.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8\\n\\n\r\n The music was great and the voice actors did a very good jobs.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 8\\n\\n\r\nThe characters were well nit and did chemically what they were required to do placing each single one of them at different stages on which our main character grew.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10\\n\\n\r\nI thoroughly enjoyed Plastic Memories to the fullest. It did a masterful job at what is set out to do and it is to make you aware of your mortality and anyone else you love, Family, Friends and even pets since you'll most likely will outlive them. Make every second of your life count and make as many memories you can.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8.4\\n\\n\r\nHow did I arrive at this score?.\\n\\n\r\n8 + 8 + 8 + 8 + 10 = 42 / 5 = 8.4\\n\\n\r\nOverall = S + A + S + C + E \\n\\n\r\nDivided by criteria which they're 5, so by 5. If it were to reach a .6 then I round up to the nearest 10th.\\n\\n\\n\\n",

The first episode in itself is emotional, and we're immediately shown how the Giftias work in the world of Plastic Memories. \r\nThe storytelling in the series is enthralling, though predictable at times, it covers it's few loopholes up well through other plot points. Overall, it deserves an 8, just because of how emotional it gets throughout, with the retiring of all the Giftias, as well as, well you'll see if you watch the series.\r\nThe art quality isn't as good as many other anime, but to be fair, it's not that big of a deal. The series focuseson it's plot and character development, and the art just isn't that important in this series.\\n\\n\r\nThe OST is one of my favourites in all the series that I have watched, but apart from that, there isn't much else to the music. The openings and endings are great, but the themes, etc, aren't really significant/noticeable.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter development is where this series really shines. The development of relationships between all of the characters, not just the two main characters is clearly visible, as all of the characters turn from strangers to a big family by the end of the series. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, it's a great series that I would recommend to almost anybody.

            "content": "The conclusive review - if anyone wishes to have the episodics, I can PM them since I don't have a website. \r\nWhen a show leaves an incredible impression you're always left wondering one of two things - what the author can do next, and whether the author could possibly hope to match it again. Plastic Memories comes onto my watching list quite a long while since the release of Steins; Gate. While it wasn't perfect the twisting, turning emotional journey I went through in those 24 episodes was undoubtedly one of the strongest anime experiences I've had. So Plastic Memories has quite the hurdle toleap if it wants to equal or potentially exceed its predecessor. \\n\\n\r\n~\\n\r\nLife's a game against time; a game where time always wins. But how far can you go before the end?\\n\\n\r\nThe memories can be more valuable than the experience, they say. That may be true, but what if one day, you were to lose those memories? In essence, this is what Plastic Memories is all about. It's about memories, the creation and inevitable loss of them. \\n\\n\r\nBut knowing that memories have an expiry date, how should we best enjoy the time we're given? The struggle to enjoy the time we have left is what main protagonist Tsukasa constantly faces across the series. Death, although not as we know it, is a common theme across the series. So without further ado, let's get into it!\\n\\n\\n\r\nAs the image suggests, this story focuses much on the two main protagonists, Tsukasa and Isla. Isla is a Giftia - a hyper-realistic android indistinguishable from a human, with her own quirks and interests. Giftias are far beyond the usual companion's android - this is made startlingly clear in the first few episodes, as Isla demonstrates a stunning proficiency with tea and interests far beyond a simple robot. And although the story inevitably revolves around the progression of Tsukasa and Isla's relationship as partners, the side characters serve not only to further their relationship, but to also offer background into pre-series events. Although these characters are helpful in developing relationships not only between the main duo but between themselves, deepening character interaction and development, there are occasionally examples of tropes that are overdone (which, for the sake of spoilers, I will not elaborate), and on a whole character designs are not bad but not revolutionary either. So the characters get a 7 - not outstanding, but certainly nothing particularly bad other than a few overdone tropes here and there, as well as rather plain design. \\n\\n\r\nBackground art is a different story - the backgrounds of Plastic Memories is one of the most consistently beautiful of this season - it lacks the pure impact of something like Unlimited Blade Works, or the magnificent reflections of Hibike!, or the vibrant and energetic style of Kekkai Sensen, yet it has its own appeal in its simplicity and its suitability to the situations where it is used. Although it is clear Plastic Memories is set in a futuristic world, there is nothing too far-fetched - the environmental design is the strongest aspect of the art in Plastic Memories, especially a specific part of the amusement park, which becomes a significant recurring element throughout the series. There's nothing too futuristic, yet the feel of a neo-technological society can certainly be felt through the neon lighting and the faceted buildings; yet there still exists a touch of the 'old world', so to speak, in the form of familiar sights such as bazaars and amusement parks crowded with people. \\n\\n\r\nAs it was in Steins; Gate, music played an invaluable role in establishing the mood of a scene. Certainly in Plastic Memories, the attempt can be seen, and the effect felt. But in the same way as the characters, though there was certainly nothing wrong with it, there was nothing groundbreaking in it, nothing that truly struck where it hurt, where it felt strongest. It cannot be denied, however, that it does get close, and on a few occasions it did suit the scene incredibly well. Sound is a very strong element of Plastic Memories - arguably, the story's faults are balanced out during its powerful moments by equally powerful and monumental musical scores. \\n\\n\r\nAnd  at last, we come to the finale, the decisive element, the most important component. The story. \\n\\n\r\nPlastic Memories, being an anime where death and the 'destruction' of memories occurs repeatedly, does indeed have several heart-pounding and tear-evoking moments. On more than once occasion, I was almost moved to tears. The story ultimately comes to a painful conclusion and fortunately, the deus ex machina event I feared never came to light, and it ended on a high note for the series. However, this is the problem. Why, if its art and its sound are both excellent if not scintillating, and its conclusion is powerful and resonant yet suitable for the anime, does it only score a 7?\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately, everything that was right about the story was more than balanced out by what was wrong. In a nutshell, Plastic Memories' story has high points and drastically low points. These low points can be summed up simply - poorly placed humour. It is something that carries over from Steins; Gate; the overdone trope of a tsundere within Steins;Gate comes to mind. However, it seems to have been taken to a next level in Plastic Memories - instead of jarring tropes, which as I have detailed above already exist, though not quite at the same level, there is an excess, a superfluity, even, of poorly executed romantic comedy-styled humour. Every single time I saw Michiru's face of jealousy I immediately braced myself for what was to come - initially, I thought it would be similar to Steins;Gate where the bad would soon be bled out of the system and it would progress without hindrance. But unfortunately, it stayed throughout the series and although there is no denying it decreased significantly to the point of near-lack of existence at the final few episodes, this reversal occurred too late in the series. The sheer pain of having to endure the terrible slapstick comedy, not least the episode which spent all 25 minutes on Tsukasa's attempts to further his relationship with his partner, involving terrible advice from all the other characters. It is unbearable, and I eventually got to the point where I had to pause and take a water break due to the sheer amount of frustration I was experiencing, and it is never good for an anime if it causes more frustration than joy. We watch anime not for an objective experience; we watch it not because it's an obligation; we watch it for fun, and if I am forced to have to endure through a series through an obligation to finish a series as much as I can possibly bear, as well as the slim hope that the ending could possibly drag it up from hell, is far too much. \\n\\n\r\nSo, Plastic Memories. Is it a worthy successor to Steins; Gate? In some respects, possibly. But as a whole package? I'm afraid not. \\n",

            "content": "Plastic Memories is good, but not a masterpiece. I see this particular anime as a creative and exploritative experiment by the studio that created it, as it seems to be kind of daring in it's style and formular. Which is a good thing, and also why its a little higher than what it maybe should be. It does alot of things right, but also falls short on a few things that maybe could have been given more thought to.\r\nStory: 8\r\nThe story is outright predictable, almost from the get go. From episode 2 and onwards you will not be surprised. However, that is in fact, nota bad thing. This is the very first time i have ever experienced a story, which only becomes better, because of its predictability. Although this does sacrifice the element of surprise, it is still a new thing which i cannot with good conscience condemn. The story is simple in nature, there is not alot of mechanics going on, or things to keep tap on which is also a good thing, when dealing with romance. The thing about romantic stories, is that the more complex they become, the harder it becomes to relate yourself with it. It is only when you are able to relate to a romantic story, that you can actually become touched by it.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 7\\n\r\nThe art serves its purpose. It is not top of the line, neither is it bad. Keep in mind, this is animation meant for a romantic story, not Attack on Titan.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 6\\n\r\nNothing in particular to notify about here. The sound is fair in nature, not eargasmic and not intrusive.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 8\\n\r\nThe main characters really shine in this anime, they are believable and actually competent (fairly rare for main characters to be). The supportive characters on the other hand, are fairly lacking. I however blame the amount of screen time they are given, and will not punish this too much, since it really is the main characters that are supposed to be in the spotlight. On top of it, the backstory of some the side characters is less believable in my opinion.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10\\n\r\ni enjoyed myself thoroughly, this was a new take on how to do love stories. I did however not cry, but that did not make things any less sad nor any less joyful. If you are in the mood of a good love story, that is competent and believable in the grand scale of things, then this is for you.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7,8 ==> 8 (Very Good)",

            "content": "I randomly came across this anime after seeing it on the popular anime tab via Crunchyroll. When I saw it, I decided to check out what the first episode would be like. But when I did, I knew I would be going on a journey through the lives of Isla, Tsukasa, and the members of Terminal Service One. \r\nWith the beginning of the anime starting off with Tsukasa meeting Isla for the first time, I felt that it would revolve around the comedy that each character brings. However, I was totally wrong in that regard since it was wholly romance. The beginnings of the seriestaught me more about what Terminal Service One does and how Giftia's are created to serve people that choose to get one. From the episode of the old lady who would refuse to give her Giftia away to the episode where Marcia is kidnapped by the black market retrievers, I only thought it would be similar to how the TV show CSI is run; for those of you who don't know, CSI is run on a sequence of events. First off being the murder, second being the CSI members analyzing the evidence and determining who the killer is, and lastly, capturing him/her. While, it's not a bad formula to work with, there's so much more you can do with it. Like, for example, providing character development.\\n\\n\r\nBut that's where I was totally wrong. Plastic Memories doesn't just show viewers the day to day life of a worker at Terminal Service One, but it utilizes the fact and evolves the relationships that Tsukasa has with Isla, Michiru, Zack, Kazuki, and many more. Although there were several cringeworthy moments that I had to skip, the entire story was incredibly solid. By the last episode, I couldn't believe that I had binged the entire series in a few days and was wondering how it would end. Well, to say the least, I cried at the end...\\n\\n\r\nThe key phrase that stuck out to me throughout the series was \"I hope you will be reunited with the one you cherish\" because it's pretty relevant to how we go on about our daily lives. While we think that life is pretty long, it's not. Deaths happen everyday from various causes and we get older. Through all of this, this anime has helped me understand that valuing, and cherishing, the people we communicate with on a daily basis is the most incredible thing we can do for each other. Without it, we're just listless people bored out of our minds. Thank you to the creators of Plastic Memories because like the title says, these memories don't last forever. When we are gone, our memories go with it. We are Giftia's in a sense and should use our time to make the most out of it.\\n\\n\r\nStop reading this and go watch Plastic Memories. It's going to be a fun one!\\n\\n\r\n:D\\n",

            "content": "May contain light spoilers, trying my best to keep spoiler-free. Also, recommended to read synopsis before reading this review to get context. \r\nMemories are a concept that get explored with vast array in anime, most notably establishing that point in the story that gets bundled with shock factor. Whether used as a way to show contrast between scenarios and characters like in \u201cIsshukaan Friends\u201d, or as a heartbreaking turning point in \"Steins;Gate\", their appeal often comes from the induced literary devices such as dramatic irony. But what happens when you take the more audacious approach, instituting the fact that all memories (of a main character)will be lost within the next two months? And this is just the second episode. \\n\\n\r\nStory 6/10: \\n\\n\r\nTo begin with, Plastic Memories is an anime that really lacks any semblance of direction. While the plot progresses in a coherent and linear fashion, it really does not establish itself fully as per usual, aside from setting up for the the glorious, \"feel\"-filled finale. To illustrate, around 1/3rd of the show is spent on the characters' jobs at the Terminal Service. The main cast retrieves the widely distributed \"Giftia\" from their respective owners, and each arc often ends on a bittersweet note, specifically because all Giftia inevitably share the same fate as Isla; the main love interest whose memories will eventually disappear. My main issue with this is the fact that these scenarios rely a lot on flashbacks, making it feel as if plot elements are repeatedly being introduced rather than being fully developed and fleshed out. \\n\\n\r\nIn the case that the characters are not focused on their jobs, the atmosphere is fickle; generally starting the episode off with comedic segments, later making transitions into a more melancholic and cute stage between the two main characters. One other thing to take note of is that near the end of the series, almost every episode features unnecessary drama in its latter half. To me, Plastic Memories is at its best, spending time on fleshing out the two main characters in a realistic fashion (i.e. a fun trip to the amusement park). Unfortunately, the drama in every episode, excluding the finale, falls flat on its face because the build up prior to each moment is simply insufficient. In short, retrievals of the Giftia side characters are what I'd like to call \"pseudo character development\".  The reason why I say this is because; in almost any production, drama is at its best when the emotions are authentic. In stark contrast, the retrievals of Giftia make it seem more like a preview of the world, with emotions being less conspicuous and more contrived, when compared to dialogue and monologues among our main cast. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, the story wasn\u2019t abysmal or unsightly, but its potential could have been fully salvaged, had the side characters made their presence fully realized. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters 5/10: In such a revolutionary and distant world, it would be best for the characters to be realistic, serving as a link between the viewer\u2019s ordinary perception of the world, and the sentiments introduced throughout. The problem is not that the side characters receive null screen time. In fact, they get a similar amount to the two main characters. This may be a bit of a tangent on my part; however, if anything, the idea of Plastic Memories is again, to leave viewers dazed in recollection at the end. You know exactly what\u2019s in store for the finale from episode two. Without constant interaction between Isla and Tsukasa, the ending would inevitably be unacceptable. \\n\\n\r\nHere\u2019s where the branch between the way the plot develops and the side characters comes in to play. Half of the characters really do not feel like sentient beings, because of how downright bland and dull their designs are. There is the seemingly cold hearted-senpai, the flirt who is the laughing gag, and lastly the Tsundere that refuses to condone Isla\u2019s relationship with Tsukasa, despite the fact fact that it\u2019s not like she likes him or anything\u2026 BAKA. Moreover, it seems as if the writers did not really know what type of role the side characters should have played. Are they supposed to be fully developed and reliable bros that we can relate to? Or are they just there are plot devices and meant to forward the comedic twists? The writers can\u2019t decide. Simply put, they are half-baked, and act as a jury, reacting to everything the plot throws at them. Perhaps it might have even been best if there weren\u2019t such a focus on the side characters in the first place, but that\u2019s much up to their likability, which will differ between us individuals. It would lead to some amazing extra screen time for our main cast though.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the two main characters; Isla and Tsukasa, they are bland conceptually, but luckily develop a great deal. At times it feels forced, but the story is only 13 episodes, so it\u2019s to be expected. Regardless of the fact that the development they receive is more than sufficient to like them individually and as a collective entity, it does feel a bit odd that they grow to like each other so early on in the story. You could attribute this to the lack of chemistry between the two by default, because they aren\u2019t exactly your standard Romeo and Juliet. Isla is the quiet type without much understanding of the way humans interact and lacks depth at first. She does not have many established eccentricities and desires because the story is set within the scope of her two months to live. But if you\u2019re in it for that quiet, clumsy kuudere, she\u2019s perfect. There isn\u2019t much to be said for Tsukasa aside from putting up an overly positive front and burning passion to help Isla. \\n\\n\r\nLuckily, despite flaws in characters, the above average sound is still a  great accompaniment to the growth of the two main characters. \\n\\n\r\nSound 7/10: The sound in Plastic Memories is great, namely the opening sequence. The contrast between the upbeat parts and ballad-like vocals really do reflect the nature of Plastic Memories well; a bittersweet lullaby, as well as a roller coaster of emotions for some. I have no complaints against the chosen seiyuus, but they aren\u2019t exceptional, hence meriting 7 points out of 10. Ranging from a melancholic piano arrangement, or to more lighthearted pieces, BGMs are played are the right opportunities and can be a heartfelt experience when bundled with the stellar visuals.  One thing to note however, is that more often than not, there is no soundtrack playing in the background during the more emotional moments. For what it\u2019s worth, more is less. And for such a cute show, it works wonders. \\n\\n\r\nFun fact: The last few frames of the opening sequence changes every time. They depict Isla\u2019s emotions differently with each coming episode, another reason as to why the opening is amongst the best of the best for me. \\n\\n\r\nArt 7/10: There is a lack of colour to those who are going into this show expecting vibrant, artistically well-thought out visuals. Regardless, it works well with the show because the setting and unconventional world really do feel like \u201cplastic\u201d and two-dimensional at times. However, this changes as the story progresses, looking a lot more picturesque and realistic in comparison.\\n\\n\r\n Lastly, the animation is rather inconsistent. In one episode it might be fluid throughout, and on other occasions, it\u2019s sloppy. Fortunately, it is not anything that will make or break this show, even for those with a perceptive eye for animation. And then there are the character designs, which I LOVE. Sure, it is not outlined in red like a show such as \u201cNo Game No Life\u201d, but it\u2019s kept simple which I feel a lot of anime these days need to learn from. *cough shaft*\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 6/10: Whether you enjoy this show is up to whether you rate objectively or subjectively. \\n\\n\r\nBut be warned that it\u2019s no masterpiece, especially if you\u2019ve delved too far into an objective mindset. If that's the case, then maybe it really is no more than the unauthentic plastic the anime industry doesn't need. \\n",

            "content": "Here we have an anime that puts me in a total personal polarity, I like it a lot, but there's that little voice inside my head that says \"look, there's a lot of shitty stuff\" so, yeah, it is a bit difficult to me review this one, but I'll try my best.\r\nStory: 7\r\nThe plot is really cool, is creative and with a lot of emotion, but also feel kinda, well, false. I know it's a sci-fi story and I don't have to believe it at all, but it have a lot of holes in it. So, you can watch it for this two paths, thatis really good or really bad, and this is one of a few series that a feel like this.\\n\\n\r\nGotta say, the sci-fi part is the only part when everybody will say, it's really good, the world that shows is really amazing, feels futuristic but not to a really extreme future, with a lot of chromatic stuff like in that spongebob chapter, actually, a lot of things are similar to or times, but with a bit more of \"science stuff\"...yeah, that's not a really good way to put it, but you get the point.\\n\\n\r\nNow, the bad stuff are the main part of the plot, and these are the giftias, not because they are bad ideas, but because it one existence feels too forced to make the audience stay in a kinda saddy mood. If you read the synopsis (that you should) you might know what a giftia is, an android with emotions and personality but they got expiration (yeah, like those doritos that you're eating). The utility time of this machines are 81,620 hours (if I remember well) and here's the biggest problem with the story, why the hell would you create an android like this if you are going to give it like 5 years of life? I mean, it's almost a human being...actually, they're pretty much like humans being, they're put in the role of parents, brothers, sons, girlfriends, I mean, that's freaking cruel.\\n\r\nTo the defense of this, I can say that maybe there's a strange error that happens in the program of the android that make a crush or something, but, as I say in the beginning, is a sci-fi story, it doesn't have to be that real at all.\\n\\n\r\nNow, if you don't nitpik a lot, I could say is okay overall. It's kinda cliche, but could be even a bit heartbreaker...like, a bit.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9\\n\\n\r\nThis art is beautiful, looks really amazing, at first couldn't see that great, but got a lot of details that make it really awesome.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 6\\n\\n\r\nNow, I like a lot the opening and the ending, theirselves as songs are really good, and with the animation, it's a beautiful trip, but, the rest of the ost feel kinda awful, like out of the place sometimes and others trying to be subtle but if you spell it like ]\"~S U B T L E~\"[ ...yeah, pretty forced.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 7\\n\\n\r\nOkay, let's see the good characters.\\n\\n\r\nIsla: She's a loli, so since the beginning we have a half of fans and another of haters, and gotta say, I'm part of the fanbase, not because she's a loli, but because in general is a really likeble charater. She's kinda cold sometimes but also she gets happy a lot, in general, got a lot of personality, trying to do her best but she's kinda clomsy, but not to the point of a cliche. The bad stuff is that she's a giftia, so, as I said, the feel is forced for this reason.\\n\\n\r\nEnough of good characters, almost the rest go from okay to god damn awful.\\n\\n\r\nWanna stand out a character in particular.\\n\\n\r\nThere's a guy called Hanada, and I just hate him. For some reason, he really pissed me off, and I really don't know why. I mean, there's some reasons like he's lax and irresponsible, normally that doesn't disgust me at all, but the fact that he's a public server just put anger on me. Could be just me, but almost everytime he was in scene, I felt really angry.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 6.8\\n\\n\r\nIn a more pesonal way, I would give it an 8, I really enjoy watching this anime, but, being more objective, got a lot of things that could pissed off a lot of people. I just said the ones that I think are the most relevant, but there are some other things that could really distract you. So, if you're looking for an intelligent and original anime, with heavy psychological stuff, you could say is a total failure, but, if you only wanna watch a simple series, slice of life, romantic, with a saddy mood and a touch of sci-fi, you could like it a lot like me.\\n\\n\r\n(Also, I don't really know if saddy is actually word, so, I'm really sorry for use it)\\n\\n",

Amamiya Sora really breaks out from \"asseylum shell\" and transform into a good seiyuu.. i expected she will be on par with KanaHana..\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\\n\r\nthis one is good, but the ending really disappoints me alot and there are no climax in this anime makes it became rather bland.. so it is really spoiled the fun... don't expect something extravagant on this anime.. because this one doesn't have anything to hype for\\n\\n\r\n6/10",

            "content": "This anime brought me both tears and joy, and tears of joy too. The anime in overall can be quite depressing, depending on the viewer of course, but let me just tell you all, that this anime can be depressing, but also very sweet, definitely worth your time.\r\nStory: I found the story to be a little unique, and it just reeled me in as i grabbed the bait. After a few episodes i just couldn't stop watching, because i wanted to know more. Now as a romance lover i just felt that this anime was the right choice for me, because once the romance makesit's entrance, the anime gets really cute, but i guess it also gets a bit more depressing. Now the story is basically about androids with feelings, or so called \"Giftias\", and there are people who owns them. Some keeps them for business and some for romantic relationships, or maybe just a drinking friend. Problem is, these androids all have expiration dates, around 9 years. I think you understand why i'm saying this anime can be depressing now, right? I wont go further than that, but i'll tell you that's this anime is going to get cute and also a little awkward, but that's part of what makes it cute. To wrap the story up, it's packed with emotions and feels, you will feel happy and sad, and i think you will love it, not for me to say though, but that's that.\\n\\n\r\nArt: The animation was perfectly fine by me, looked pretty good, didn't need time to get used to, i think aniplex and doga kobo did a great job with the art overall, and i don't think i have much more to say here, i'm not an expert.\\n\\n\r\nSound: I think sound was pretty okay in general, it matched the special effects, and so on. The voice actors were good, they really fit the characters if you ask me, it worked out nicely. If it could've been done better, that's something i cant say.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: Ah yes, the characters were very good. We have some cliche characters too, like a tsundere for example, Michiru is her name. I took a real interest in these characters because i was a little captured by their backstories, the backstories were really good, i really fell for the characters after that because it fit the anime's theme very well, they were kinda depressing too, but they were explained nicely, and not many characters were left out. Character development was something that played a HUGE role in this anime. How everyone feels about each other, judgement, and of course, the romantic developments. The romantic developments were proper, for once. It was well plotted, and it really made you like the characters even more,(Referring to the protagonists). Overall the characters, their backstories, and their development were very well executed.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment and Overall: This anime is not really a happy go lucky anime, but it's gives off a lot of joy too, but it's still depressing and it doesn't exactly make you feel whole. It has a few flaws, but in general i really enjoyed it. It was a new experience on the feel train for me, and it gave me so many mixed emotions too, it just felt great watching it to the end. I rated it 10/10 because i felt like it deserved it for filling me with so many emotions, and that it still felt good afterwards. Why does it feel good afterwards? You will understand if you've seen it. Also, what made me feel really good inside was after the last episode, there was an after credits scene, and just let me tell you this, look closely at the hand Tsukasa is shaking, then you will understand why i felt happy after seeing it. Well i guess that about wraps it up for my review. I hope this review helped you understand the anime a little better, and i thank you for your time. Until next time :)",

After the first rewatch I was so disappointed, but now, thinking about it I realized that it is not that bad. \r\nPlastic memories starts like a show about the benefits and problems  of intelligent robots with feelings but it ends being an anime versionof ex machina, but goes further, so If you liked ex machine watch this anime. \\n\r\nStory: As I said it doesn't go as how it looks like at the beginning, an that's a pity because the first episode is with difference the best one, apart from that,  story it's well written, looks pretty natural but also it's so basic and doesn't have much profundity. \\n\r\nArt: it's ok, very expressive, also characters are well designed, as Gintoki says \"you must recognize a character by its silhouette \" and in Plastic memories, you do it perfectly. \\n\r\nCharacters : As a personal opinion, this is the worst part of plastic memories, not because characters doesn't evolve but because they're characters we have seen a thousand times, you see, the story is also a bit typical, but the new scenario makes it look like something different, and also the only one that makes something unexpected for her role is Eru Miru, who's definitely my favorite character of this anime. \\n\r\nEnjoyment : this show can be described only with one job : feels. It's enjoyable? Yes,  definitely, the show knows when it must be happy and when it must be sad, and you'll have a good time because it has pretty good jokes and looks so natural. \\n\r\nOverall : This is a good show, definitely not a masterpiece, but as a good drug it makes you feel well while  you're watching it, it's a pretty good 8 because even if the characters and the story are typical, it all looks like something new. The only thing I can say that disappointed me it's that it lets moral implications apart, if you have a free day watch it, but don't expect the best romantic anime.",

            "content": "Have you ever knew that something would happen, no matter what you do? But even despite the fact that you knew, you still tried, hoped and did for the best until the very end? To the bitter end...\r\nPlastic Memories offers a promising, unique story. We follow the life of 18 years old Tsukasa Mizukagi, who fails his college entrance exams because of health issues. He is then offered a job in a renowned SAI Corporation due to his father's connections. SAI Corporation is known for production and managment of \"Giftia\" - humanoid androids with human emotions. Giftias life span is set to 81 920 hours,after which their programming becomes corrupted and they either stop functioning or turn into \"Wanderers\". Because of this, all Giftias must be \"recovered\" before theirs life span ends. After the recovery, there is nothing left from the Giftia. Tsukasa's position is in the Terminal Service Department, where the main job is to recover Giftias that are close to their expiration. However, in the Terminal Serice Department, humans must work together with Giftia as a team, so Tsukasa is ordered to work with Isla.\\n\\n\r\nIsla is a veteran Giftia. She has been in active duty for six years, but after an accident 3 years ago, she has been only serving tea and doing some minor jobs in the office. Even though she refers to part of her job as \"ripping memories apart\" and gets really frustrated about it, she accepts her new partner. Tsukasa is more than happy to be partner with Isla as he fell in love with her. Yes, love on the first sight. To add more to this, the teams must live together in one apartment, so Tsukasa has to move into dorm with Isla.\\n\\n\r\nIn the first half of the series, the story actually focus on the Giftias and their releationship between humans. We get to know some side characters and little bit of their stories. We also learn how a proper \"recovery\" of Giftia should look like and how Tsukasa's department does it - letting Giftias and humans make happy memories together 'till the very end. But not every recovery is easy. Some people doesn't want to leave their Giftias, because they are emotionally attached to them (who can blame them after 9 years living with Giftia...) or your target for recovery can be \"kidnapped\" by a black market retriever. In the worst case scenario, the Giftia turns into Wanderer and starts tearing apart everything that stands in her way.\\n\\n\r\nAs the story progresses into the second half of the series, we wave a goodbye to more random Giftia recovering and we focus on the relationship between Tsukasa and Isla. Now if we do the math, we know that Isla's life span is running short (6years of active duty + 3 years of serving tea...). It is time for Tsukasa and Isla to deepens their feelingss for each other. We venture with them to standart romance - slice of life anime themes. Festival, \\n\r\namusment park and much more, all the goodish things from romance genre. It is now, that Tsukasa realize he doesn't want to be separated from the one he loves. He search for a glimps of hope - is there a way to prolong \\n\r\nthe Giftias lifespan? Is there a chance, while \"recycling\" the body of giftia, that some of the memories will remain? As the end nears, Tsukasa stops thinking about what will come. We live now and here, let us make beautiful memories of everyday moments. I just want to be with you, the way it is supposed to be...\\n\\n\r\nIn the end every Giftia must be recovered before the end of its life span,  there are no exceptions...\\n\\n\\n\r\nPersonal opinion\\n\\n\r\nWhen i started Plastic Memories i was really excited about it. The story in first few episodes pointed to something unique. But sadly, for me, it didn't deliver, at least the second part didn't. I would much more rather see more sci-fi look at the show than slice of life/ romance. Having wanderers doing their things and TSD with Tsukasa trying to recover them would be awesome. Do not get me wrong, i have enjoyed the romance - slice of life aspect of the show, i was about to cry at the end - the build up was pretty good. But is it too much to ask to have it as a side story?\\n\\n\r\nThe side characters were also good, even though they didn't have too much background stories provided. I have enjoyed tsundere Michiru, tho it was annoying from time to time.\\n\\n\r\nOverall it was really painful for me to watch this series, but that comes with a lot of slice of life anime. In life we ultimately need to learn how to let go, be it something we love, enjoy... even this painful experience will make us better than we are. For me, this anime showed all this perfectly and not only once, but multiple times from all different perspectives.\\n\\n\r\nI would reccomend this for everyone, who is looking for good - unique story - slice of life/romance anime. You can also enjoy some fanservice and stereotype characters while you are at it.\\n",

            "content": "When I read the description for this anime, I made the mistake of getting excited. Well, maybe that's a bit harsh. But the idea of a romantic tragedy (it didn't say tragedy but you can understand where this was going with a quick read of the description) with sci-fi themes? Awesome!\r\nBut unfortunately, as other reviewers have said, those sci-fi themes never really delivered. The entire premise is, from a computer science point of view, ridiculous (you can build machines that perfectly replicate human life but you can't back up their data?????) but i might have excused that if they'd ever done anything with the sci-fithemes themselves. The science fiction side of this story is only there so that the main female character will die. That's it. The science behind it is never explored beyond that. EXCEPT when they use the even more ridiculous \"after they expire they get robot rabies\" plot line which itself is only used in one episode (and that episode itself was easily the most interesting one of the whole show, which really makes me wish they'd explored the expiration thing more...) and then to give one character a sad backstory. But like I said, as ridiculous as the lack of data back-ups is, the idea that roboticists built these machines to have extra, unnecessary power that they can lose control of is completely unbelievable. But again, this idea of expiration is dropped, except to be the reason why the main female character needs to die.\\n\r\nAfter the first three episodes, the sci-fi-ness disappears, and this turns into a basic romcom. You could replace the \"she's a robot who's going to break down soon and she collects other dying robots\" premise with \"she's an oncologist who has cancer herself\" and it'd be exactly the same. Unfortunately for the show, once it's a romcom, it focuses on the characters, and the characters are flimsy at best. None of them ever evolves beyond the stereotype they were originally written as. There are certainly some cute scenes as the relationship between the two \"develops\" (in quotes because their relationship is so predictable it's lying to say it grows dynamically), but by the end, when the inevitable happens, I didn't feel sad at all, because the show had done so little to develop the characters that I couldn't sympathize for them at all.\\n\r\nAlso, while I'm talking about the characters, let me just raise my issue with the character of Michiru, who is introduced as a rival of sorts and then... forgotten about? Apparently she gets over her feelings for Tsukasa, or maybe she doesn't? The show stops caring about her as Tsukasa and Isla's relationship develops and the entire subplot of Michiru's feelings for Tsukasa never gets any resolution. That really bugged me.\\n\r\nThe art was... fine. There were a few pretty scenes, but nothing out of the ordinary. The animation was pretty good. I didn't spot any obvious flaws. The music was forgettable. I will say that the voice acting was beyond what I expected. Tsukasa's VA in particular did really well with his generic anime boy character's script.\\n\r\nMy review here is obviously harsher than my score is. That's because, while I was watching it, and while there was still hope the story could resolve itself, I really did enjoy it. If you accept that this is a romcom, not a sci-fi, and if you pretend that Tsukasa and Isla are characters worth caring about, there are a lot of cute scenes between the two. I could tell that these two really loved each other (although that's just because they said it so often, and it's a sign of bad character writing if the only reason you know the character feels something is because they tell you they feel it, and not because the story itself shows you how they feel) so I was preparing myself for the heartbreak when the final scene came around, but it didn't hurt me, because even though the show had told me that this was a heartbreaking scene, I didn't feel that it was.\\n\r\ntl;dr Takes a good sci-fi idea, makes it ridiculous to fit the plot, then throws out the sci-fi altogether to make this wholly into a cute but forgettable romcom with an ending that thinks it's a lot more tragic than it actually is.",

            "content": "DISCLAIMER: This is my first review ever, so bare with me here. I hope you read it and all feedback is appreciated. \r\nThis show was definitely one of the biggest disappointments of the season for me.\r\nThe fact that this was a story from the author of Steins;Gate, Naotaka Hayashi, it got me very curious and excited for it. Though, I now understand that this must have been a story that the author wrote and was like, \"wow, this isn't that good, I'll never put this in one of my visual novels\" and then put it in some random folder on his computer to forget aboutit. \\n\\n\r\nPlastic Memories had the foundation to be something great, something really special. Looking back, even the first episode showed a lot of its problems but I was blinded by the tear-jerking moments and thought it could be something more. Though, it never went much further than it did in the first episode. I was expecting this anime to explore the androids further: the conflict between them and humans, their struggle to comprehend emotions, the government's regulations on them, etc etc. I expecting something like Time of Eve (which was an excellent anime for all of those who never watched it), but this anime was nothing more than a painfully average romcom. \\n\\n\r\nThe androids were basically humans except with shorter lifespans, their was no real big conflict between the androids and humans, the retrieval system was absolutely moronic (I'll talk about this more in a bit), barely any governmental problems, and the characters were all boring and they're exactly what you'd expect from a romcom with no real major traits to make them stand out. I'm not even going to spend any more time on the characters because there's not much to say about them. This anime didn't explore its setting to the fullest and it only did the bare minimum. The retrieval cases they had to do didn't really carry that much weight after the first one in the first episode, they eventually became repetitive and it felt like a distraction from the main point of the story which was the romance. Eventually the cases did take a backseat and I wondered what the hell was the point of them in the first place? \\n\\n\r\nThis leads me to my next point: The retrieval system was laughable on how badly it was managed. When I sat and thought about this, I realized just how stupid the retrieval is and made me just loath the anime even more. Society manages to make androids, but for some reason they didn't put a system in the androids to turn them off when they run out of time. What happens instead is that they go berserk after a certain time and it's the job of somebody to go retrieve them before they go out of control and potentially harm the people around them.... Are you fucking kidding me? All they had to do was have a shut off option after the timer goes down and problem solved! If they have the power to make advance androids, then why couldn't they implement this system. There's no need for going to someone's place and try to convince them to sign a paper to shut off the android. Whoever were the engineers to these androids didn't realize one simple solution. So basically, the retrieval system is an unnecessary mess, making the whole job of the characters rather ridiculous. It's simply there just to force emotions out of us and I believe that is extremely poor writing. \\n\\n\r\nAgain, the androids are basically humans. There is nothing different about them and this made me raise an eyebrow. I love movies like I-Robot, Machina, or even Terminator where it explores that concept of the \"ghost in the machine\". There's something wonderful about me seeing robots/machines start to development more emotion and start to become more than just machines. I love seeing the clash between the robots and humans, and how they interact with each other. Animes that did this well was Time of Eve and Casshern Sins, Gargantina even did it well. Ghost in the Shell is also obviously an anime that portrays machines in society in an amazing way and it brings in a lot of different questions and morality issues to the table. However, this anime failed at it because it never once explored it. The androids were just like humans and they acted no different. Coming from such a talented author, I thought Hayashi would have brought a lot more interesting and well developed concepts to the table. For all I know, Doga Kobo's higher staff could have just taken his original idea and warped it to how it turned out, but seeing how he was in charge of the screenplay and created the original concept, I think this mainly falls back on him. Anyways, I expected a lot more from the setting, story, and characters. \\n\\n\r\nThe romance in the anime is probably its strongest point, but even then it's not too special. The problem for me is that the romance is completely normal. This is a human falling in love with a robot and vice versa, but why does it feel like two humans going through a stereotypical anime-love process? Well, it's because that's exactly what it is. They could have replaced the whole concepts of robots and made Isla an ill patient with cancer and this anime probably would have been exactly the same. This goes to show just how underdeveloped the androids were in this anime, and that they were nothing more than humans with shorter lifespans. Complete waste of a setting with a lot of potential.\\n\\n\r\nIn the end, this anime is just an average romcom. Nothing more, nothing less. I would not recommend this anime to anyone unless you have a soft spot for simple tearjerkers. If you're a veteran to romcoms, then it's not worth your time. If you're not a veteran, then look elsewhere because there's much better options. Do yourself a favor and watch Time of Eve, Ghost in the Shell, and/or Casshern Sins if you really want an anime that's going to handle robots in an interesting and compelling way. \\n\\n\r\nOverall I'd give it a 5/10. It's an average romcom with tons of wasted potential.",

            "content": "Plastic Memories is an anime that quickly works itself into a bit of a kerfuffle. It is an anime that, after finishing the first episode, you will know exactly where it is headed and how it will end. Now some might be turned off by a story with such a predictable and inevitable conclusion, but I think this kind of set-up is not always a bad thing; because sometimes the journey is more important than the destination. The question that now arises, is the journey worth it?\r\nIt could be worth it if the elements that this show comprises of weren\u2019t so mediocre or sub-par. Onebig selling point of the show is the romance element, which is a crucial element in making the viewer want to watch through the rest of the series. The biggest problem with the romance presented by Plastic Memories is the two main characters. For a romance to be engaging, the viewer should at least like the two characters, the viewer should want the two characters to be happy and it should be clear to the viewer why the two characters like one another. So how does the romance in Plastic Memories fare? Well, we have Tsukasa and Isla, and I did not like either one of them in the slightest. It\u2019s not just me being sour; it is a fact that the show gives us very little reason to like either one of these characters. Tsukasa is the generic \u2018nice-guy\u2019 character who, in the pantheon of romance anime protagonists available, is an absolute bore to watch. I really don\u2019t understand why writers don\u2019t try just a little bit harder to make a character (the main character, no less), just a tiny bit more memorable. Give him an attitude. Give him an unusual personality trait. Give him something inspired and unique, for the love of god. But nope. We quickly form an opinion of him and it does not change much at all in the 13 episode run of Plastic Memories. Isla is another uninteresting character whose only appeal is the fact that she occasionally acts cute, often tripping over and acting moe. That\u2019s it. We never get a good sense of why these two bricks feel affection for each other. The very first scene of the anime shows us a crappy \u2018love at first sight\u2019 scenario, which I think is supposed to explain away why Tsukasa loves Isla. But, because Isla is an emotionally detached can opener, she seemingly does not return his feelings at this exact moment and goes on to act uninterested in him for a good span of episodes. When she suddenly DOES fall in love with him, it feels extremely unnatural and again, we are left with no sense of why she actually likes him. There is actually a scene in the final episode where the two characters are on telling each other what they like about each other. The reasons they come up with are incredibly plain and stupid (\u2018I like the way you are always smiling, I like how you are so clumsy\u2019), which continues to cement the artificiality of the romance. It is a trite and bland romance which is, for some reason, egged on by the even more trite and bland supporting cast (who are so trite and bland that I do not think they even deserve a paragraph written about them). The romance element is nothing but sub-par, and is not a good incentive at all to not drop the show after one episode.\\n\\n\r\nDespite being a massive component of the show, one could always try to turn a blind eye to the flawed romance and attempt to enjoy some other element of Plastic Memories. However, such an action would also result in disappointment. Plastic Memories takes place in a sci-fi setting, and its premise is something that actually piqued my interest. However, if the science fiction elements were judged by usual science fiction standards, Plastic Memories ends up being undeniably abysmal in this respect. Plastic Memories depicts a world where advanced AIs called Giftias have integrated into societies (don\u2019t ask why they exist in the first place, they seem like more trouble than they\u2019re worth) and the main characters engage in Retrievals, which is when you basically euthanize a Giftia before their AI goes haywire and turns them into dangerous berserkers. It is not long before any astute viewer will be able to pick holes in nearly every aspect of this premise, rendering it improbable to the point of spoiling any enjoyment or intrigue presented by this world. There is no clear reason for the existence of Giftas, other than to act as stand-ins for family members or to act as \u2018love-bots\u2019, for the lack of a better term. If this is truly the reason for their existence, the show does not explore the deeper ethical concerns of commodifying love. Beyond thematic shallowness, you can find more evidence of a poorly thought-out plot devices. There is no reason for their \u2018berserk\u2019 state to exist, as any forward-thinking person would program the Giftias with a timed deactivate, in preparation for the extremely likely event that someone will try running away with a Giftia (so likely that it happens all the time). In one of these \u2018gone berserk\u2019 scenes, we clearly see that these Giftias have superhuman strength, given the way that they can leap around cityscapes effortlessly. Again, this begs the question, what is their purpose? If they are really just stand-ins for people, why do they have the strength and dexterity of some kind of combat cyborg? If they will inevitably go berserk, why give them such dangerous latent strength? These things are ticking time-bombs, raising further questions as to why anyone would want to make a business out of creating these, and even if they choose to do so, why they weren\u2019t designed with a fail-safe to stop the berserk phase, and FURTHERMORE, why such a small and inefficient department is taking care of this extremely important Retrieval process. Occasionally, the show tries to make us empathize with the \u2018gone-berserk\u2019 Giftias, which doesn\u2019t work at all. We are clearly shown how dangerous they are, and how they urgently need to be put down. However, whenever a character does perform this highly necessary action, they are generally depicted as evil grunts with no humanity. It can become difficult to root for who they want us to root for when the 'baddies' seem to be absolutely correct in their choices.\\n\\n\r\nWorld-building is also woefully lacking, an essential element of science fiction. Not only is the setting already unconvincing, but it teases us with potentially interestingly elements that are never developed any further. One example is the black market collectors who try to kidnap Giftias right before their scheduled Retrieval, but we never see why they would do such a thing in the first place. We are left to guess. Are they harvesting the robotic parts of Giftias? If so, why do it so close to the Retrieval date, where they are literally less than a day away from going berserk? Many interesting ideas are simply skimmed over, making the world of Plastic Memories extremely underdeveloped and a real waste of potential. Other sci-fi build and develop their worlds to the point where the setting itself reflects the central themes of the story. I am not asking for such an insane level of world-building, but I am definitely not satisfied with the scraps that Plastic Memories offered me. Plastic Memories only develops its sci-fi world and setting just enough to please the ones who aren\u2019t really watching it for the sci-fi world and setting.\\n\\n\r\nSo if Plastic Memories is not using its time to world-build, then what is it doing? What element could be so important that everything else must be put on hold? I\u2019ll tell you what. Plastic Memories is trying its hardest to split your sides with its 'comedic' relief. The cardboard cut-out cast spew repetitive punch-lines constantly, none of which are unexpected or particularly well-delivered. Not only is this humour unfunny and a real waste of screen-time (remember, this is only one-cour), but the comedic relief on multiple occasions can even ruin the tone set by a preceding scene. A perfect example is at the end of the first episode, where a teary-eyed Retrieval sequence is absolutely put to waste by starkly appearing and absolutely unnecessary toilet humour. Yep, TOILET HUMOUR. Most of the other \u2018humour\u2019 is Isla making funny faces after making a funny mistake (ha ha), Tsukasa being accused of being a pervert (lol rofl lmao) , or Isla and Tsukasa being forced into embarrassing, ecchi-type misunderstandings (oh stop my sides are about to split). Lather, rinse and blatantly repeat.  Some may say that the comedy of Plastic Memories makes the characters more likeable or stops the tone from becoming too dark, but to me the only thing it adds is immersion shattering tonal dissonance. And this is needless to say, not a good thing at all\\n\r\n. \\n\r\nThere are only a few aspects of Plastic Memories that keep it just barely watchable. When watching Plastic Memories, I did feel like there was some level of care put into how this anime was directed, and a good amount of thought put into some of the visual motifs present. A good example is the chair that Isla sits in throughout the series (https://imgur.com/gallery/iyGXqsI/new). Given that the Retrieval process involves sitting down in a chair, a visual motif such as this serves as a constant reminder of what is to come, and how the characters are aware of this impending inevitability. There were a handful of other meaningful, memorable shots that again, quite well, reflected what the characters may be feeling at that particular time. The finale was also a pleasant surprise. Throughout the series, I was expecting it to be an irritating, over-the-top scream-fest like the ending of AnoHana. But to my delight, it was remarkably subdued and communicated what it needed to without ever becoming too sappy or too melodramatic. No tears were shed, as I did not particularly like or care about either of these characters, but I would say that the final few episodes were a tasteful departure and something of a small reward for sitting through the rest of the show. \\n\\n\r\nPlastic Memories delivers just enough sci-fi to count as a sci-fi, just enough romance to count as a romance, far too much comedic relief, and a few tearjerker/heart warmer scenes that, unfortunately, do not wash away the aforementioned sins. If you are a sucker for romance and melodrama, no matter how average it may be, then by all means proceed beyond the first episode. If you are anyone else, there is no good reason to complete the entirety of this half-baked anime. \\n",

Both for the one who's leaving... And for the one left behind\" -Isla\r\nFirst of all, i just wanted to say that Plastic memories was probably one the anime i was looking forward to the most. So i did have high expectations for it.\r\nThe story revolves around a world like we live in today, but maybe a few hundreds years fast forward. The main character of the story, Tsukasa. Is a newly hired to work for the Terminal service,which was a corporation made to handle giftias which are basically androids with human character traits. He later falls in love with hes co-worker Isla. They soon started dating but faces the cold reality of what giftias are.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is really well made. The only thing in my opinion that would've made this anime better is maybe a different approach to the ending.\\n\\n\r\nas for the art for this anime, is simply outstanding. The art from this anime is definitely one of the strong points of this anime and it is easily distinctive from other anime's.\\n\\n\r\nThe sounds for this anime aren't really anything special or that different from others but The Ost tracks for the anime as well as the ending are pretty good in my opinion.\\n\\n\r\nOne of the keys to success for this anime was character development. Throughout this anime, there were many episodes that builds up character development slowly as the series progressed. The characters in this anime aren't really all that distinct maybe besides Isla. But although the lack of uniqueness from characters. This anime puts a perfect balance between types of anime characters to make the anime as a whole unique in its own way.\\n\\n\r\nFor me this anime was very enjoyable. I waited every Saturday for a new episode to come out and this anime made me change my perspective on some things.Overall i think this anime was pretty well made. it is definitely an anime more for people that are into drama and a hint of comedy.Overall i think this anime did meet my expectations.  \\n\\n\\n\\n",

The lifespan of a Giftia is 81,920 hours (roughly nine years and four months), and that's the kicker if they pass their expiration date, it causes personality disintegration, memory loss and outbreaks of violence .\r\nAs a result, the employees of the Terminal Service  must go to the owner of the Giftia and retrieve it(basically it's a form of mercy killing imo)\r\n Those assigned to the Terminal Service work in teams consisting of a human and a Giftia\r\nso we have two main protaganists of the series Tsukasathe human and Isla the Giftia.\\n\r\nThere were also other Giftia and human combos that also work in this establishment but mentioning them would be too much of a pain.\\n\\n\r\nAll you have to know is that story pretty much revolves around these two dunces.Their awkard flirting and their intentional relationship created solely to hook us to the dramatic if not predictable finale.\\n\\n\r\nThe story like make you think that it is deeper than it actually is  and watching the first few episode you might even have those \"feels\". But after first few retrievals , the plot realises the amount of repetition it is going through quickly tries to transition into a darker tone which they immediately drop for love-dovey slice of life romance.\\n\\n\r\nPoint is i think the show could have done a better job explaining the world they live in  that they have to rely on robot nannies . All joking aside, when it came to drama the does it well for an anime of this genre at least. Those sad moments however, vary in impact and you are made to feel more some characters more than others.\\n\\n\r\nLook i know that Isla is a sweetheart but when a show favors a character more than it's actual setting i have a bit of a problem.\\n\\n\r\nThe story could been about a girl with a terminal illness and the show's drama would not change much.\\n\\n\r\nWhat makes a show stand out from the rest is it's unique setting and some well written characters.\\n\\n\r\nAnd this show has none. Isla may be a great character but even she isn't far from the klutzy cookie cutter streotype. The others aren't much better, some might say even worse.\\n\\n\r\nThe show is still pretty good, might even be one of the better animes this season if not for snafu s2.

            "content": "How does one make a great anime such as Full Metal Alchemist or Steins;Gate? An intriguing or unique plot? Great animation? Wonderful voice acting and music? Enjoyable characters? The answer is all of them. To truly make a good anime, one must combine all of these together into one enjoyable package. Plastic Memories is one anime that does this extremely well in most of these categories and was one of the most interesting animes of the spring 2015 season. \r\nStory: 8/10\r\n\tThe story of Plastic Memories is mostly a compilation of short stories about retrieving androids called Giftias which are now everywhere in this stories\u2019 futuresociety. Giftias are not your regular androids though. They are robots with a synthetic soul, each with their own personalities but they have one major problem: they only live for 81,920 hours. After this point, these Giftias turn violent, and lose their memories and personalities. Now this caught my attention very quickly. Why specifically 81,920 hours? Why do they even have a set life span? To me, this didn\u2019t make too much sense. In fact, why after 81,920 hours do they go crazy and become violent. Seems like something that the company who made them would fix really quickly due to public safety concerns. Now if you can get over this minor detail, then you will find Plastic Memories a very cute and well-crafted story about the retrieval of Giftias and the story of Tsukasa and his partner Isla. Now this anime will focus more on the over-arching romance between Tsukasa and Isla so if you are looking for anything not related to that or the short stories on retrievals, then you will not like this anime and think of it as wasted potential. If you are looking for romance though, this is an absolutely perfect series for you and I would highly recommend it for anyone in it for that. If you also like any anime that is sad such as Anohana, and Angel Beats! Then you will enjoy this anime too. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 9/10\\n\\n\r\n\tI love the art style in this anime. It is amazing and really shines as one of the best parts of it. Animation is smooth and not done sloppily to produce something horrid like Sky Wizards Academy did. I really have nothing to complain about the art. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 9/10\\n\\n\r\n\tThis anime\u2019s soundtrack is very peaceful and beautiful. If you are hoping for something memorable though, you won\u2019t really get it as most of the songs are forgettable. Some songs from this sound track though are just some of my favorite such as the Opening \u201cRing of Fortune,\u201d the insert song \u201cagain & again,\u201d and the ending theme \u201cAsayake no Starmine.\u201d These songs are absolutely beautiful in my opinion all though you may not agree. These songs help solidify the tone and mood of the series and overall make for a more enjoyable experience. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 7/10\\n\\n\r\n\tThe characters in this anime are amazing if they are in the main cast. Isla, Tsukasa, Kazuki, and Michiru all stand as an example of the great characters from this series. All these characters are developed throughout the series with their personalities changing all throughout. On the other hand though, because this series focuses so much on the romance between Isla and Tsukasa, it leaves out many of the other characters in the dust. Many of the extra characters have little development and lack a lot of characteristics making them boring in their scenes. There are characters that are in the between area such as Nina, Marcia, Souta, and the Grandma from episode one. They all get enough screen time in the little time they have and they all genuinely feel like they are part of the main cast. It\u2019s unfortunate that this could not continue with many of the other characters though as some just get barely any development at all. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\\n\r\n\tI loved this anime through and through. The romance between Isla and Tsukasa was interesting and fresh from what I have seen. Even now around a year after I finished the series, it still holds a place in my heart as one of the best anime I have watched. All of the important elements of an anime came together and made something almost worthy of being called a masterpiece. It was a wonderful ride from beginning to end and I will definitely re-watch this for many years to come. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9/10\\n\\n\r\n\tEven though I enjoyed this anime a lot, there are things that keep me from giving it a masterpiece 10/10 score. For one, even though I loved all the characters, I could just not let the minor character development slip by. The sometimes forgettable soundtracks, and some minor details that I would have loved to have seen expanded upon just forgotten in the middle of the series also brought it down from being a masterpiece. So should you watch Plastic Memories? Yes, even though it may not be for everyone, Plastic Memories is one anime that I highly recommend to anyone who likes the romance and drama genre. \\n",

            "content": "WARNING... spoilers in this review!\r\nWell... as you can see from the rating I gave this particular Anime, I am speechless. I usually NEVER and I repeat NEVER watch Anime that have the genre drama in it. I'm usually more of an action type guy. The reason I came to like anime was because one of my friends told me to start watching Anime. I told him I would give it a try. And before I knew it, I couldn't stop watching Anime. A while ago, that same friend recommended an Anime to me: Plastic Memories. He told me it was one of his favourites, soI was like: I'll give it a try sometime... \\n\\n\r\nLike I already said. I'm not into Drama type anime... So I kinda forgot about it. But after a while he told me again... Go watch Plastic Memories. So I told him I would once I was done with the Anime I was watching at that time. And I did... \\n\\n\r\nLet me first tell you this... NEVER has any series in MY LIFE made me cry like a little b!tch. The way they did character development is amazing. I just love how they build up this love between Isla and Tsukasa. Talking about Isla, she is way to adorable to exist in a non-existent world. I just love her facial expressions and her clumsiness. Anyways... the ending of this anime is in two words: ABSOLUTELY AMAZING. Well.. of course It's really sad but hey, what can you expect from this genre and the way this anime works. Giftias that only live about 9 years? Since Isla had been working there for a while and is a Giftia herself, anyone could have seen this ending coming...\\n\\n\r\nIf you're into drama I would definitely give this one a try. The story is amazing, funny/kawai characters, and of course a SH!T TON of... you guessed it, DRAMA.  \\n\\n\r\nOverall, I wil never forget this Anime. And tbh I probably wont be watching anymore drama anime sinds I now know my heart wont be able to handle another one of these.\\n",

This romance anime was different. The main male character, Tsukasa, falls in love with Isla who is a Giftia, a human like android. Apparently, Giftias have a short lifespan compare to humans and must be deposed? I don\u2019t know since the anime never said what they do to expired Gifias. Well Tsukasa and Isla tried to make memories before Isla has to be collected. \r\nMEMORABLE PARTS \r\nThe ending of this anime.\r\nI could say more but I can'tspoil the anime.\\n\\n\\n\r\nMy overall rating- 10/10\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Plastic Memories story as a concept is very good. Overall the anime is fine but according to me it miserably fails at two points.\r\n1) WEAK MAIN CHARACTERS-within the first few episodes you can guess very well what will happen in the end, but it would have been better if they had developed the main female character a bit better with a stronger resolve and attitude because the male character is also weak, thus both of them of the same type makes it a bit monotonic, one of them should have been an outspoken extrovert. In fact you will find the supporting female characters to bemore interesting and better suited for the job.\\n\\n\r\n2) USELESS EMOTIONAL DRAMA-the anime at times tries to make you feel emotional but fails, that's mainly due to weak characters, in the end too i was a bit disappointed as it tried to but couldn't evoke emotions from the inside, as it was in the case of Your Lie In April,  a very well developed female character in the end gets you attached.\\n\\n\r\nin the end it is a good anime to watch, in the category of tragic love stories,  but don't expect it to leave an impression as Clannad or Your Lie in april did.\\n\r\nI'd give it 6/10",

            "content": "NOTE THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS. NOT MAJOR ONES. BUT STILL SPOILERS. READ AT YOUR RISK/DISAPPOINTMENT.\r\nWhen I first heard of this series, this was around the time I was reading the original Astro Boy manga by Osamu Tezuka. During this time, I was really into science fiction and robotics because it raises a plentiful amount of ethical and moral dilemmas on values of society, such as \"racism\" against robots, slavery and concerns of overpopulation. I stumbled upon Plastic Memories, looked up the barest minimum and immediately got excited. Introducing concepts of robots with time limits, it raises many questions such as \"How do people react withthe idea that their loved ones will no longer exist?\", \"How would you react when your time is up?\", stuff like that. So I finally watch the series and what I got was... not what I wanted.\\n\\n\r\nDon't get me wrong, what the series attempts to do it does well, it just doesn't try to be more than what it could be. I can't call the series bad, unwatchable, or even horrible, in fact, by some standards I can call this series good. It's just... disappointing. This is a shame, because the series establishes such an interesting world but doesn't try to explore it. Am I being too harsh? Well, let's see if I am.\\n\\n\r\nLet's start with the easy ones:\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8\\n\r\nI liked it. It was good.\\n\\n\r\nI mean, I liked the credits... the lighting in the background provided a nice touch.\\n\\n\r\nOverall I don't have any complaints about the art.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8\\n\r\nLike I said, I liked the credits. Both the credits and the opening do well accompanying the theme of the series: that everything is finite and will eventually die. There isn't much to say about the sound other than...it's good. Not amazing, just good. I can settle with that.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 4\\n\r\nAnd now the problems begin rolling in. Like what I said earlier, the story isn't bad, it just doesn't try anything new. Let's begin with the plot shall we?\\n\\n\r\nThe story is about Tsukasa, a human with a capitalist rich dad who forces him into a crummy new job with some average Joes. They retrieve Giftia, humanoid robots that are approaching their 9 year lifespan. Tsukasa is paired up with Isla, another Giftia. Together they pick up Giftia and make some memories before Isla's time is up.\\n\\n\r\nThis plot is interesting right? Right off the bat we are introduced to someone who knows when her time is up, and another who can observe that character's end/death. Naturally this anime will have a focus on their relationship and the challenges they overcome both as co-workers and as partners.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, this is not substantial. Not because this single story isn't interesting, because it is, it's just that even with only 13 episodes, this single story is not enough to satisfy. Plastic Memories is a series that tries to establish such an interesting world, so as a result, it has plenty of subplots, where like Cowboy Bebop and Trigun, it sometimes doesn't focus on the main plot and will instead focus on world building, which is fine by me. In fact, this is necessary otherwise the world will feel barren, like there is nothing but wastelands outside the building they work in. By premise alone, Plastic Memories introduces many complex ideas that delve into the human psyche. Except here's the problem: it doesn't.\\n\\n\r\nI mean, it does have a couple of subplots, such as the Grandma and the kid in the first episode and that kid with the robot mum and the other guy with the other robot... that's it.\\n\\n\r\nLet me get this straight: There is a massive world full of people with robot companions who can die any second and this anime only gives us 3 dilemmas? Three quarters of the plot focuses on the relationship between Tsukasa and Isla, which is fine by me, until I realise that THREE QUARTERS is too dang long. In one episode it focuses entirely on their relationship, which is fine. Then the next one is also their relationship, which is also fine. But then the next is also entirely fixated on their relationship, and that's when I ask, \"Did they run out of ideas?\". Apparently yes because their relationship is also shoehorned into one of the only 3 subplots in the entire series, like as if they ran out of ideas and changed half of the subplot back to the main characters. Most of the episodes are just the main characters doing happy things together, like their job is an afterthought. Their assignments are pushed aside, like yesterday's rotten milk and we the audience are not taught to care. In fact, there is actually more than 3 cases, but because they are so inconsequential to character growth and the plot these other cases themselves have so little screen time as the focus is just on the main characters. One case literally encompasses the first and last minute of an episode. That's it. But since the main characters' relationship goes under the \"characters\" section, I suppose that I should instead focus on the 3 subplots I brought up.\\n\\n\r\nThe Grandma and the kid one was done very well. Especially for a pilot episode, it had everything I was looking for: The interactions between characters coming to terms with their own mortality. What I didn't like though, was how they are forgotten almost immediately afterwards. They are never brought up again. The main characters are naturally moral people because the plot demands a moral main cast and that family is just HEARTBROKEN after the whole fiasco. They should be visited at least once where they'll be like, \"Oh I'm fine\" or a news report of what happens to them after the pilot. The plot doesn't care. Just more happy teenagers flopping over tea or whatever. Guess what? I care what happens to the Grandma. I kept watching the ketchup spewing tomfoolery that the main cast get up to just so I could find out what happens to the poor old lady.\\n\\n\r\nThe entire plot feels barren, which should not be tolerable in a futuristic setting. Setting? Hah more like Upsetting! Ooh let\u2019s move on.\\n\\n\r\nMoving on, now we go to the other guy and the robot. Like I said, they aren\u2019t even the main focus of the episode, so I shouldn\u2019t even give them credit. Their entire existence is to drive Tsukasa and Isla closer and that\u2019s it. I\u2019m giving them the amount of credit the anime wants me to give: not much.\\n\\n\r\nNow let's focus on the kid and the robot mum. Unlike the first subplot, this story, similar to the main character\u2019s relationship, is too long. It literally closed up all loose ends on its first episode and introduced more problems simply by continuing the arc. Turns out that when Giftia pass their lifespan, they turn into wanderers, which is short for going bonkers and turning into rabid killing machines, which is cool and all but... during the prototyping stage, shouldn't that be the first thing mechanics should fix? Real life robots aren't that volatile. Otherwise no one would buy them! Apparently running around with 9 year time bombs are commonplace in this world. Time bombs that are sentient, and they think. Why doesn't a single Giftia try to extend their lifespan? Why does no one try to fix the glaring tick tock baboom? And most of all, why does no one? There is not a single person who is against the very idea of a walking berserker that can snap any moment. What if a person manipulates their Giftia into hiding from the authorities for 9 years and then drops it on a nearby city. That's a subplot I WANT to see. But like most subplots in the entire anime, wanderers get touched upon once and never seen again. And why should it? I mean, the main characters are playing with ketchup and apparently that's more important.\\n\\n\r\nAnd then there are the Giftia Poachers... where do I begin? Basically these chumps steal Giftia because...why? Not too sure about the reasons. Why would anyone steal a still operating and almost imminent ticking time bomb? But like everything else, it all happens in one episode: they come, they do their business, and then they go. The anime does not have any incentive of pursuing this issue further. In fact, the idea that someone is foolish enough to steal a time bomb says something about the world. Are Giftia expensive? What effect do they have on the economy? The stock market? Were Giftia used in warfare? I'm asking so many questions because none of them are answered. I have so many sleepless nights asking these questions, because I have been left with so dang many.\\n\\n\r\nAnd that\u2019s the problem. I ask for answers, and I receive nothing but questions. The series would have been more interesting if there was a world to intrigue me. Heck, we don\u2019t even learn where Giftia come from! There are so many different story ideas I can bring up from the top of my head. An insecure Giftia is driven insane and becomes an early wanderer. A mechanic successfully transports a Giftia\u2019s mind onto a computer, reversing the roles of who lives and who dies first. A person protesting against Giftia is unaware that they are a Giftia themself. An abandoned Giftia encounters a hobo and the Giftia does everything in its power to bring the hobo happiness. Tsukasa actively tries to extend Isla\u2019s lifespan. There are so many different ideas that are pushed to the sideline in favour of cooking or whatever horseplay they get up to. I feel that if they did a better job at world building,  I would forgive them for having such small focus on major issues that the world provides. I mean, Tsukasa has a capitalist dad and he gets 10 seconds of screen time tops and the Giftia Making Capitalist Company isn\u2019t even delved into. So much potential for exploring corporate corruption or you know, real problems in everyday society.\\n\\n\r\nIn short: The plot should have been more towards building its world, rather than its characters\u2026which aren\u2019t even that interesting to begin with.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 4\\n\r\nIf you\u2019ve read what I wrote earlier, you can tell that I don\u2019t think highly of the anime\u2019s focus on Tsukasa and Isla. This is because while interesting, the relationship lacks the substance to carry three quarters of the anime. Nine episodes is a like\u20263 hours. That\u2019s a long time of nothing but cooking with ketchup. I don\u2019t even like ketchup.\\n\\n\r\nAround about then I realised that the anime\u2026was a romcom. My response: well I can\u2019t say that Plastic Memories was a BAD romcom, because I have little experience with romcoms themselves, heck, it might even be a GOOD romcom. But because the anime juggles their relationship with their expansive world, the anime has no choice but to fail establishing one of them and unfortunately, I got the wrong end of the stick.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of their relationship, personally, I think it was done well. Surprised you, haven\u2019t I? Well they had to succeed at their relationship, or else the anime would have no substance. The problem is, the main characters\u2019 relationship doesn\u2019t even need that much screen time, hence my three quarters meltdown earlier. Plastic Memories does a good job making me care about Tsukasa and Isla, and how Tsukasa would act when Isla is gone. I genuinely cared when the ending came around. A predictable ending, but an alright ending nonetheless.\\n\\n\r\nReally Tsukasa and Isla work off each other. On their own, they aren\u2019t interesting. Isla has a backstory that should be a huge focus on the series but apparently her relationship with park benches are more important. Personality wise, she\u2019s clumsy, which has a lot of brownie points with the loli fanbase. I personally have better things to complain about so I\u2019m letting this slide. My main complaint is that her backstory has so little screen time. She\u2019s pretty much stereotypical waifu bait which is done all the time in anime\u2026so whatever.\\n\\n\r\nTsukasa on the other hand, is unusually perfect. For a pampered rich kid with a capitalist dad, he really turned out well didn\u2019t he? Turns out the most pampered thing about him is his brain, because he doesn\u2019t even know the rules of Giftia when he joins, even though we are led to believe that Giftia are commonplace. He also seems to believe that life itself revolves around Isla, because he doesn\u2019t care about the world around him. The opposite of me. In fact, Tsukasa actually sees the corporate corruption I was looking for but deep down he doesn\u2019t care because once again, this theme is touched once and thrown away faster than an adult diaper. Overall,  he\u2019s not interesting and his entire existence has no meaning unless Isla is involved.\\n\\n\r\nThe other characters\u2026well\u2026they don\u2019t do much. They get moments here and there, but deep down they\u2019re just cookie cutter stereotypes that I\u2019m not driven to care about. You know the ones. The tsundere, the beta male, the sempai guy, the usual flock. As the plot focuses on 2 characters tops, most of the cast is driven to the sidelines. Similar to the plot, they needed to be unpacked for me to care. Except I don\u2019t. And that\u2019s a problem.\\n\\n\r\nIn short: The main character\u2019s relationship is done well. That\u2019s the only positive thing I have to say.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 6\\n\r\nI have a confession to make. When I first finished the series, I gave it 10 overall. Later I thought about it and gave the series 8. Then I thought about it again, and gave it 7. Then guess what? I thought about it again, turned the score to 5 and began writing this review. I feel that this is the type of series where the more thought I put into it, the more its glaring problems begin to show and the more upset I become. Due to the nature of MyAnimelist\u2019s ranking system, I could only give it the lowest \u201cpositive\u201d rating, because I genuinely enjoyed the series at the time. It\u2019s only now that I look back at the series where all these holes kept popping up and I was left with no choice but to keep marking it down and feeling like I wasted my time. Short term enjoyment and long term suffering is the term I\u2019m going to use here to describe this feeling.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 5\\n\r\nIn conclusion, I can\u2019t say that this anime is bad. I can only say that this anime is disappointing. It creates an interesting world but doesn\u2019t try anything new even though it has no choice but to establish their rules to cover up their gaping plot holes. \\n\r\nTo sum up the entire series, it is in my opinion, forgettable. The only things I can remember clearly, is that Tsukasa and Isla were close, but that\u2019s because if I didn\u2019t remember that, then I\u2019d feel depraved. Like three quarters of my lifespan went missing. If 13 episodes can only let me clearly remember one thing, then we have a problem.\\n\r\nOne could argue that my perception of this series is overall negative because it did not provide what I was looking for to which my reply is: Yup. Pretty much. But even then, this is why I was disappointed with the series overall. It provides a world with no substance.\\n\r\nIf you are looking for an interesting series with an interesting world, then Plastic Memories is a red herring from the get-go. It will not give you what you want. If you are into romantic comedies,  then I suppose you may enjoy this series. If you like cooking or ketchup, I recommend an actual cooking anime.\\n",

The stunning visuals, lovable characters and overall a really enjoyable anime. Despite others thinking it was misleading or not living up to its full potential I would absolutely recommend this anime to people who are first getting into anime, or people who enjoy romance anime.\r\nWhat I like:\r\nI love the beauty of the romance between the two main characters and I also love the way this anime delivers and solves different problems. When watching this I found myself smilinguncontrollably to the stunning visuals and the beautiful story. The simple yet effective elegance of this anime is basically on point. Even after the anime I felt myself wanting more.\\n\\n\r\nWhat I don't like:\\n\\n\r\nThe only thing I dislike in this anime is the few times the characters act out of place. Despite this I think that no anime is good without its small imperfections and I loved it anyway.\\n\\n\r\nDISCLAIMER: This anime is not for everyone, of course. Some people may hate it and some people may love it. I just think it's worth a shot!\\n\\n\r\nThanks for reading!",

This show ended up having a lot more to say about how we live our own lives. And its message was great.\r\nIn case you couldn't tell by the description, this is a tear-jerker. I have a fun habit of watching things that make me bawl like a small child. The reason I like sad anime so much is because they usually have the most to say. This show was no exception (though it was no Clanaad Afterstory, thank God). \r\nUltimately the reason Irated this show so low was because it left a hole in me with its heartbreaking setup and then didn't really do anything to comfort me afterwards. The ending felt abrupt and it gave me no consolation for enduring through an end you know is coming from the beginning.\\n\\n\r\nThat is just one man's feelings on the matter though. Definitely a good watch. But worth the pain it will put you through?",

            "content": "First of all, the overarching plot and moral/purpose of this anime was portrayed consistently and effectively throughout in some unique ways. Needless to say the animation was top notch and perfectly portrayed the atmosphere at specific times of the anime, e.g. during comedy scenes the characters would be turned into chibby characters to lower the seriousness and during more significant meaningful moments the animation was clear and elegant clearly displaying emotions of characters. That brings me to characters, speaking of which, this is the only anime where I can say I liked EVERY single character. Everyone had their own unique personalities and no character wasmade just as a mere plot device, everyone had their fair contribution to the anime overall. I also quite liked the romance in this anime because it wasn't the main characters falling in love instantly, the development in the relationship was actually shown and reasons for  love interest were actually mentioned making it more believable. In terms of consistency, there were many humourous parts which I honestly didn't expect from an anime of this genre, however it wasn't bad as it gave some breathing room amongst the more sad and serious aspects of this anime. In terms of character development, none of the characters really changed aside from the 2 main characters, isla and tsukasa. For tsukasa is was shown through his perception of memories themselves. At the start of the film he mentions with uncertainly \"what would I do if my life was predetermined\". During the first few scenes they hinted that he thought it might be better off not having memories as you wouldn't feel as sad when they disappear but this changes during the course of the anime (same case scenario with Isla). We can see change in Isla in how she doesn't conversate with anyone and is isolated from everyone for the reason that she does not want to create memories that will only inevitably be destroyed. This gives her a unhuman robot type feel. I mean she doesn't smile once until like episode 11 or something. We can see that through her personality she answered the question that was asked at the very start of the film, \"what would you do if you knew you had a predetermined life\" to which her answer was to live it to your full potential making the most memories possible. It ended in an expected yet fulfilling way to say the least. Overall I really liked this anime. 9.5/10. Would've been better with a nice soundtrack however that is not a big deal for me.",

I'm not gonna go into details too much cos' i know if anyone reads this pointless review i'm only gonna waste time so i'm going to keep it as short as possible (totally not lazy)     \r\nI wont be explaining much about the story but rather the \"Moral\" of it since i don't wanna summon spoilers as a curse or start a riot for such a perfect show\r\nIf morals also seem like spoilers you can stop reading it.\r\nSo the anime startswhen a loser like me can't seem to find a job, but eventually gets into the SAI Corps where they produce err..or manage human- like machines called Giftia's . They possess everything a normal human would posses, Emotions and a soul to say the least or to specify. but it turns out that they only have 9 years and 6 months until they're memories reboot themselves after all nothing lasts forever, not even stars\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nSO! moving on to the moral: So the Moral is easy to grasp but by the end you'll get the feeling of hesitation to finish the anime since you realise that the end is nigh. We all know that feeling . This anime basically teaches us the principle of life \"Nothing lasts Forever\" all we can do is cherish the moments as time slowly begins to turn them into Memories. It's a Sad truth and a reality we all have dealt or have to deal with. i just cant get over that quote though\\n\\n\r\n\"Having happy and beautiful memories won't always bring you salvation. The more beautiful a memory is, the more painful it can become. It can even become terrifying. Both for the one who's leaving... And for the one left behind.\"  -Isla (our beloved)\\n\\n\r\nIt goes to show how memories can bless us with joy and comfort but wherever there is light there is darkness . Memories can also become a curse, once you're caught up in it ..it's hard to let go of em.\\n\\n\r\noverall the characters are adorable and the story opened my eyes to reality and i'm grateful for that. i may not have much friends but anime's like these share hope with me by \"reality checking\" me.\\n\\n\r\n9/10 (would've been a 10 if they filled us in about the ending)\\n\\n",

That does not mean it's bad, but it's pretty entertaining. This is done in a great way that can take us by a small train of emotions that still thrills us such thing as love, but the real important idea of this anime is the fact of having to say goodbye to what we love. It transmits in a good way the beauty of an eternal dismissal, with all its pain and all its passion, it can teachus the coldness of hearts accustomed to the pain and beauty of those ready to love. Maybe it becomes something pretentious with the step, but still remains entertaining and moving, a good anime to kill those cold nights and just look for a bit of comfort.",

While PM's near flawless tone setting can make you cry your eyeballs out, its shallow character development/complexity and the many expositional backstories hinder PM from being a memorable experience.\r\nStory 6/10\r\nPM does set the stage really well, introducing you to a very interesting premise involving the Androids and their significant limitation: their lifespan. However, intentionally or not, PM does not dive into the concept much, instead, it turns into a full-fledged romance between the two main characters. Throughout the series, there were so many plot points toexpand on but were neglected as exposition.\\n\\n\r\nTone 10/10\\n\\n\r\nPM gets their sound design and art near flawless every time, resulting in many, very touching and immersive scenes where you certainly need a tissue nearby. For example, silent scenes with beautiful scenery and you can almost guess or empathize with what the character going through or thinking. Because of the tone, many scenes can easily divert your attention away from sub-par writing and character development.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 5/10\\n\\n\r\nPM's characters are disappointingly bland and one-dimensional. Many of them had great backstories but aren't elaborated on. However, their backstories only serve as exposition for the story. Likewise, many of the characters themselves serve as plot points and virtually do nothing the whole series. None of them has elaborate personalities beyond their archetypes, and we don't sympathize with any of the other characters.\\n\\n\r\nOther aspects like art and sound are good.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, \\n\r\nIf you're looking for an emotional journey, definitely watch PM.

Slice of life comedy is well blended with the established tragic narrative and its been a while since I've felt my emotions in such a conflicted state.

At the time, I was all for romance anime and I was looking for some good romance anime after completing another romance/comedy not too long ago. Let me tell you, this anime pulled me in on its first episode and I COULD NOT wait for the next episode the next week. After a while you already know how the anime will go, but you will believe something can somehow change and you will believe it until the very end and the ending is rewarding. It is an anime that will makeyou cry. The relationship the main characters have is so touching and the anime is able to add humor in the relationship and it all fits in. I loved every minute of the anime and all I cherished every moment of the anime. I wish it could be longer. \\n\\n\r\nThe supporting characters are also very good and they fit in very well and make the anime enjoyable and a fun time. There was one character who had a liked another character, but later on, they did nothing to develop it and seemed to drop it. It didn't really affect the story too much so it was fine. Another problem with the anime is the fact that it was advertised as a \"sci-fi\" as well as drama and romance, but the anime HAS \"sci-fi\" elements, but doesn't focus that much on \"sci-fi\" that much which may mislead some viewers.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, this anime was very touching. The opening fits the anime VERY well and sets the tone for the anime. I still listen to the opening to this day. I loved every character in the anime and the relationship between the main character and the girl was touching and I enjoyed every minute of it. It is a romance story that will make you smile, laugh, and cry all at the same time. I felt like something great was learned each episode and I loved how the different characters evolved overtime. This is definitely my favorite anime as of now by far.",

            "content": "---Azyure's Short, Hot, Intelligent and Truthful Review---\r\n(As is the case with all of Azyure's Reviews, no synopsis proper will be given, however, some non-spoiler[ish] plot points will be discussed)\r\n---Story---\r\nThis anime's story starts well. The initial premise of life-like androids, indistinguishable from humans, and what happens to their memories when they 'die' is great. This premise is somewhat original, interesting, philosophically reflective and, in general, important to think about as a human. Still, the ending to this show is projected from the start; that is to say, the show pulls no punches, you will know how Plastic Memories ends after the shows first episode. This interestinginitial story, however, is quickly discarded a few episodes into the show, in favor of another generic romance. The new romantic premise suffers from one incredibly major flaw; the romantic relationship to which the show turns it's focus, is forced upon the watcher. Around the halfway mark of the show the fundamental story, tone, and philosophical impact change completely. What's worse, as I stated before, is the romance is boring, uninspired, and built up for the sole purpose of attempting to break the watcher with the ending. Again, however, the watcher knows after the very first episode exactly how the show will end. So the romance is shoved down your throat in every remaining scene in the show. Montages galore, settings meant to pull at your heart strings, failed attempt after failed attempt at forcing an emotional connection between the watcher and the generic characters. It does not work. And the show ends exactly how it projects in the beginning. Unless this is your first (or one of your first) romance anime, or you're a loli, it probably won't interest you much after the first 4 or 5 episodes.\\n\r\n---Art---\\n\r\nMeh, at its best. Awkward at it's worst. One specific redhead was, visually, very interesting, otherwise, no one stood out. That said, the OP was well executed and looked good.\\n\r\n---Sound---\\n\r\nGood OP song. Meh ED song. Fair VA. Nothing stellar, but not offensive in any way.\\n\r\n---Characters---\\n\r\nOther than one inherently interesting character (Michiru) that could have been good if developed, the characters were bland. Since the entire story changed halfway through, there was no character development. Sure, the writers attempted to develop the main characters, but they didn't even succeed at that. All other characters were unnecessary, irrelevant, and undeveloped after the first 5 or 6 episodes.\\n\r\n---Enjoyment---\\n\r\nThe show set itself up in episode one, and ended exactly how it said it would. There was no character development, and no emotional attachment. A romance I didn't care about was shoved down my throat at every turn. Hell, even the ending they attempted to build up to the entire second half of the show was uninteresting.\\n\r\n---Overall---\\n\r\nI'm sorry Plastic Memories, you could have been very good, but you couldn't help yourself. If you want an interesting show with some romance, why not try Your Name, Steins Gate, Monogatari, or Your Lie in April instead.",

            "content": "When I found Plastic Memories on AniDB, I read a review in which a certain person said, quote: \"It sucks, and if you liked it you are contributing to the death of good anime.\" At the time, I thought that guy was just an idiot, because every single person has different likings... Now, after watching the series, I can't do anything but agree with what the review said.\r\nPlastic Memories is seriously not a good anime and everybody who thinks otherwise is either very unexperienced, or lacks the ability to criticize. The worst thing about it is that the anime is not actually good in anything.Every single thing about it: characters, plot, romance, comedy, emotions: is average at best, and it's very hard to defend PM with that fact.\\n\\n\r\nStory 4/10\\n\r\nStarting with the story, which is the thing that was bugging me the most. The first episode introduces you into an interesting world full of androids and real people working and living together. The premise from the first couple of episodes is actually pretty decent. However, the creators sacrificed the plot completely and instead of that focused on some side stories of random people and the relationship between the main duo, which was a big mistake in both cases. You may think that they will tell you something about the androids, how are they made or something, but no, the show doesn't give a fuck about that and rather focuses on the lame romance between the two lame main characters. The romance itself sucks and even tho the anime is trying to be emotional, it fails miserably. To say something positive, I think the ending was not that bad, comparing to the rest of the show. And I like that they kept it simple.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters 2/10\\n\r\nCharacters are hard to chew up in this anime. Like I already said, the main duo sucks. Isla isn't that bad, yet she is still average main heroine at best. On the other hand Tsukasa sucks completely. Yet another anime with lame main character who can't do anything but beeing nice and apologizing for no reason. I also find his reactions to be over-emotional, which is a thing I normally enjoy, yet with Tsukasa it was way over the top. Meanwhile these two get the most attention, some possibly good side characters get no room at all. There were some promising one's: Zack, Kazuki, Sherry: sadly, their only purpose in the show was to do some funny gigs, which worked only in Zach's case. Another character, who gets a fair ammount of time, is Michiru. However, her character was completely ruined by the fact she was in love with Tsukasa. Also, there was almost no backstory to any of the characters, with the only exception being some scenes from Isla's and Kazuki's past, but that's just not enough. In a nutshell, the show gives the attention to badly made characters while ignoring some well-made one's, which is a shame.\\n\\n\r\nSound 7/10\\n\r\nI think the OST is nice. The opening and ending weren't that good, but the anime's soundtrack was very enjoyable. Especially the slow tracks were really nice to listen to, sadly there was only a small bunch of them.\\n\\n\r\nArt 6/10\\n\r\nI think the characters looked really good, but everything else was average.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 4/10\\n\r\nAt this point. I told you why is the anime so bad. So let me now say atleast some positives, to even things out a little bit. The comedy was sometimes good and even though I was not laughing that much, I did giggle from time to time. The whole world was interesting, it's a shame that they didn't do anything with it. Even the romance had some good moments (it still sucked overall tho). This is also the kind of show that even though you know it sucks, you don't really mind finishing it. There are show's that I can consider better, yet there was a time when I just wanted to drop them (most notably Ao Haru Ride, which I gave 6/10). That didn't happen to me with Plastic Memories, even though I knew right from the beginning that it's not good. Also like I said, the ending was decent.\\n\\n\r\nAnd just like that, I will give Plastic Memories a 4. In the end, It's not like the show sucked completely (even though I said it multiple times, lol). It's just that it stayed way beyond my expectations, mainly because of the fact that the creators focused on the weak points rather than the strong ones.",

            "content": "Review in one sentence: good, although a bit flat.\r\nI have seen many sad romantic comedies. AnoHana, Clannad, Your Lie in April... What makes Plastic Memories stand apart is the lack of tension. For me, this is what defines it. Whether you find it a good thing or a bad - it's up to you. For me, it's a bit of both.\r\nFrom the very first episode you know exactly what will happen at the end. The show will make it very clear that there are absolutely no chances for a subversion. In other animes tragedy at the end comes either as a surprise, or you willbe teased many \"will she or won't she?\" moments. \\n\\n\r\nAnother reason for the lack of tension is that other animes will put several heavily emotional moments in the middle. This one does not.\\n\\n\r\nWhy is this a good thing and a bad thing? Well, I understand where it is coming from. It shows that the creators treat their audience more maturely, knowing they will understand characters' feelings without extra tension. On the other hand, this is also the reaon why Plastic Memories fails to leave strong impression - but under no circumstances I would call it a bad anime, just a bit flat.\\n\\n\r\nMinor notes: animation is fine. Music is one of the worse elements if you ask me. Isla is moe enough, but not as much as to annoy people who don't like it. Don't expect much tragedy - the show is just as much about coming to terms with departure of a close person, as it is about experiencing your first love.",

            "content": "A lot of complaints are made about the fact that the Sci-fi universe isn't explored and explained enough, and I sort of agree with this argument, as the futuristic context is a bit pointless to the underlying themes of the show. To me, the setting was only a pretext to write a story about love, the inevitability of endings and how to deal with loss. Although using robots with a 9 years life expectancy is an unusual and original approach to those themes, in the end it doesn't serve the story in any other way than giving limited time to the female protagonist. It's easierto appreciate Plastic Memories once you understand the show is a romance at heart with Sci-fi elements, but it's still a shame to see all of the unexplored aspects of a narrative involving things as complex as relationships between androids and humans. I wish we had gotten a bit more of a commentary on the matter, or at least more explanations on Giftias and the reasons of their existence. The show had so much material to explore, especially considering the seriousness of the subjects it tackles, but decided to take a different path.\\n\\n\r\nThis is the main problem I have with Plastic Memories: it lacks focus. It has something to say, but it keeps drifting away from it, as it wants to do too many things at the same time. The concept of falling in love with someone whose end is near is tragic and compelling, but it is not properly focused on until the last few episodes: the romance is introduced in the beginning and then sort of forgotten before reappearing again, instead of being build up throughout the show,which makes it not as natural as it could have been. The show goes in all sorts of directions, often lingering in slice-of-life territory, which would have been fine if it had been well dosed. But I feel like there is too much of it; and Plastic Memories could have used this time for more relevant storytelling, such as fleshing out the main characters, adding more logic to the Sci-fi universe, finding ways to convey the powerful message that the show already has, or exploring a romance that is in and out of itself deep and complex. Not that it doesn't do these things, it just that often the more generic slice-of-life atmosphere takes the spotlight, to the detriment of the story and its impact on the viewer.\\n\\n\r\n*spoilers*\\n\r\n However, when the show does get on track and concentrates on it's core themes it does it very well and manages to create some very touching moments, delivering emotions with subtlety and realism. The romance, although it can feel unconvincing at first, is not melodramatic and feels authentic in the end. Isla and Tsukasa become comfortable together, and as a pair they are just plain sweet. The last episode in particular is done wonderfully, as the viewer has to go trough the grueling experience of watching the couple's last day together. The show stops to wander around, and just delves straight into these characters and their emotions as they face the inevitable, setting up what is to me one of the saddest ending to anything I've ever watched. The way the two characters say their goodbyes to each other and Tsukasa's pain afterwards; it's all done extremely well, in this sort of sad but serene atmosphere. It feels real, brutal and bitter while being very beautiful at the same time. \\n\r\n*spoilers end*\\n\\n\r\nI've got to admit, the ending did it for me; it touched me so much that I don't think I can be that objective when giving my final verdict. Because despite all of the issues this show has, to me, those last episodes make up for it. The themes are superbly expressed by the end of the story and it has emotional depth, reminding us about the reality of loss and death that goes with love and life. Plastic Memories had such an impact on me that it would be dishonest towards myself to give it lower than an 8. It does have a lot a problems regarding the execution of its storytelling, but when it works, it's powerful, and it's going on my list of anime that I won't forget.\\n\\n\r\nNow I am going to go cry in a corner for a week, goodbye.",

            "content": "TL;DR: Plastic Memories had a promising start, but lack of focus prevented it from truly soaring.\r\nPlastic Memories was an anime I really looked forward to this season. Written by the writer of Steins;Gate and animated by the skilled Doga Kobo, it seemed like it would work out. Unfortunately, as a friend of mine described, while not incompetent, Plastic Memories put all its eggs into the wrong basket, investing in its far weaker areas without playing to its strengths.\r\nPlastic Memories takes place in a future where androids called Giftias look and behave exactly like humans. People purchase these Giftia for many reasons, often companionship or love.However, these Giftia have a limited life span of 81.920 hours (nine years and four months). When the Giftia pass this life span (which is more like an expiration date) they become \u201cWanderers,\u201d or violent, powerful, feral androids without their memories. To prevent such tragic cases, the Terminal Service exists; they go and collect the Giftias and erase their memories. Giftias whose OS is erased are reset and then can be implanted with a new personality or trashed. To take care of these Giftias, the Terminal Service operates in teams of a human, called a \u201cspotter,\u201d and a Giftia, called a \u201cmarksman.\u201d They need to get the approval from the owner in order for this to occur, which sometimes involves the Terminal Service team to act as pseudo-therapists. Tsukasa, a new recruit to the Terminal Service who got his job through connections, is paired up with the clumsy and reticent Isla. While performing their job, over time, Tsukasa falls in love with her.\\n\\n\r\nI won\u2019t knock the setting. Is it strange? Sure, but I have a suspension of disbelief for such things. I\u2019ll accept the setting, because it does show thought was put into it. \\n\\n\r\nHowever, after the first half, I don\u2019t know if the creators accepted the setting.\\n\\n\r\nWith its odd plot, Plastic Memories had potential. It could examine the fleetingness of life, relationships breaking down, the truth of memories. And those were just alluded to. One segment of Plastic Memories has Tsukasa and Isla working with an officer from another Terminal Service branch, where they (and we) learn that the Terminal Service No. 1, where the protagonists work, is different from the rest. Our heroes perform their job in a personal, caring manner, connecting to their \u201ctargets,\u201d whereas the other Terminal Services went in, collected the Giftia in question by any means necessary, and left. Why does Terminal Service No.1 focus on a more caring approach? What are the implications of this? Plastic Memories sloppily addressed this for a few seconds and went on its merry way.\\n\\n\r\nInfinitely more offensive is Plastic Memories handling of the aftermath of the \u201cMarcia arc.\u201d At the tail end of this arc, Tsukasa and Isla not only had to deal with a traumatized young orphan boy and his caring Giftia sister, but also were up against Black Market dealers. Introduced earlier in that episode (how\u2019s THAT for foreshadowing), these scumbags con people out of their Giftia in order to sell them on the black market for cash. After this, Martha becomes a Wanderer and the team has to deal with her, as torn as they are. This mini-arc was masterfully done, and I had great hope for Plastic Memories after this. You have to understand, this isn\u2019t me imposing my expectations anymore \u2013 this is what Plastic Memories gave us.\\n\r\nBut it seems that the creators didn\u2019t want to give us that anymore.\\n\\n\r\nAfterwards, Plastic Memories becomes primarily a workplace romantic comedy, with Tsukasa falling in love with Isla. Sure, fine, that romantic relationship can happen. It\u2019s not a big deal. But at the same time, it almost completely does away with its setting. All of a sudden, it\u2019s Tsukasa fumbling around on how to ask Isla out and everyone giving him advice. Suddenly, all of the eggs switched from the drama basket to the slice of life basket. This, in itself, is not entirely reprehensible. But then, Plastic Memories forgets its hook \u2013 its setting. Yes, the second half, for episodes at a time, all but disregards the setting of Plastic Memories almost altogether. With occasional whispers until the finale, Plastic Memories sunk into generic territory with clich\u00e9 dramas (Isla and Tsukasa aren\u2019t partners for an episode! But now they are! Isla can\u2019t accept her love for Tsukasa! Tsukasa can\u2019t ask Isla out! They\u2019re an awkward couple!) and hard-hitting episode titles like \u201cRice Omelet Day.\u201d A workplace comedy is not by itself bad, but when you have such a unique setting, use it.\\n\\n\r\nThe cast cannot support this outside of acting out of generic roles. The protagonist, Tsukasa, is exceedingly underdeveloped and uninteresting. He\u2019s 18 and a nice guy, but that\u2019s it. We get some good stuff when he\u2019s sad, like with the Marcia arc or with the expertly handled finale, but hey, that\u2019s it. Isla, as the same friend from above described, is a Rei Amamiya moe-blob android. Yeah, she\u2019s cute. And she makes tea. She\u2019s also your clumsy dojikko who\u2019s afraid about losing her memories. Describing Isla is nothing more than a checklist, because, unfortunately, she is merely a collection of tropes thrown together. \\n\\n\r\nThe rest of the cast similarly suffers, and can be described with disjointed sentences. Michiru, I suppose, is the most developed, as her adopted father was a Giftia who she let become a Wanderer (This particular case was also the last case where Kazuki, Isla\u2019s previous partner, and Isla worked together). Unfortunately for Michiru, that\u2019s all she has going for her; otherwise, prepare the tsundere checklist, because she\u2019s got all the tropes. The aforementioned Kazuki is scary and weak to alcohol, but she appreciates her coworkers and Isla. Zack, Michiru's partner, is a teasing young boy. Constance is the new Giftia partner of Kazuki, and he is calm. Kazuki is scary, but she appreciates her coworkers. Yasutaka is one of those casual lazy characters that Rikiya Koyama sometimes plays. Sherry is his serious partner. Eru is a technician who... likes cute things. These characters appear and leave, never developing, and only exist for Tsukasa and Isla to develop off of them. Even there, the show does not take Tsukasa farther than his bland traits nor Isla farther than her robotic moe characteristics. \\n\\n\r\nAs far as presentation goes, the show generally hits it out of the park. Shiny hair gradients aside, the character models are nicely done, and the show has a good time working with semi-futuristic environments. Doga Kobo finds a nice balance there, making the show seem futuristic enough to seem slick without seeming centuries in the future. The soundtrack hits all the somber notes well, as well as the (inappropriate) cheery ones. While the characters are bland, the voice cast does a good job with what they\u2019re given, with Sora Amamiya admittedly making Isla very cute.\\n\\n\r\nAt the end of the day, Plastic Memories sells itself as a decent romantic comedy, with a finale so well done that you would be tempted to forgive the remaining sins of this show. But you can\u2019t. With bland characters and a jarring tonal shift in the second half from a dramatic futuristic show to a slice of life romantic comedy that forgets its Giftia setting, Plastic Memories didn\u2019t remember to stay focused throughout its run.\\n\\n\r\nStory - 4 (mostly for its second half, barring the finale)\\n\r\nArt - 7 (good but not spectacular)\\n\r\nSound - 7 (Good but not spectacular)\\n\r\nCharacter - 3 (Bland, underdeveloped, and/or cliche)\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 5\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 5.2 (rounded to 5)",

Literally, they even have to work-out to keep muscle mass.\r\nMaking one of the main characters be an \"android\" is arguably where this show tries to make itself stand apart from the rest of these types of romance shows as this genre type is quite common and excluding the android part, the characters don't really have toomuch personality to them to set them apart from other shows.\\n\\n\r\nI guess one thing that was intriguing about this show is that they skip the whole \"prejudice towards androids\" thing, as that arguably happens in most shows/movies when androids are introduced in society (like Time of Eve, for instance), here they are treated more or less like any other person. This fact, however, comes with the biggest gripe I have with this show. The androids in this show are more or less EXACTLY like humans, with the main difference being that they have a limited lifespan of about 9 years. Because of the fact that they are so like humans, the story really wouldn't be ANY different if you replaced the \"androids\" with just normal humans. If you still want the limited lifespan to be a factor, make them terminally ill or perhaps in the future genetic clones that may only be able to live for a few years before their bodies fail. That way, I wouldn't have a problem with the inconsistency of being able to recreate perfect human androids, but unable to make them last more than 9 years. Even worse though, for dramatic purposes, when these androids are close to death -- unless they are specially taken care of before failure -- they turn into berzerking murder-bots.. seriously? There was no better way to introduce drama than that?\\n\\n\r\nIn the end, my point is that the element that could make this a unique romance show is rather inconsequential and the android part hardly affects the storytelling at all, and when it does it just feels contrived. A show like 'Time of Eve' or a movie like 'Her' wouldn't at all be the same if the Android elements are removed because they are so integral to the storytelling.\\n\\n\r\nThe show is not great, but at least serviceable enough to give it a watch. There are, however, so many better stories out there worth your time.\\n",

            "content": "Story 7/10\r\nI think the concept is great: a job where you take away someone's loved one, and the company's standards don't allow for empathy. It could have made for a good drama. However, as some reviewers pointed out, the transition from serious scenes to the total opposite is extremely abrupt and ruins the mood. I think the show would be better off without the over-the-top dramatic romance or trying-too-hard comedy (think that one episode where the main character tried to get the girl to pay attention to him) scenes. A little, sure. But too much, I think you're ruining a great concept. The scenes thatactually focused on the retrievals were good and emotional - I think because the show is about this aspect, they should have had more of these and less of the behind-the-scenes romance.\\n\\n\r\nArt 7/10\\n\r\nCharacter art was decent, and some background scenes were beautiful (while some were just okay). One thing that really stuck out to me was the typeface and style of the font in the opening sequence - not the first thing that someone comments on, but I found that really beautiful. On another note, the white outline (not the horizontal highlight, the outline) that is on everyone's hair gives me the impression of one of those chibi picture dramas - meant for comedy and not seriousness.\\n\\n\r\nSound 6/10\\n\r\nI didn't find the soundtrack anything special. The theme songs didn't seem intriguing to me either - I just skipped them; usually if I found a theme good, I won't skip it.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 5/10\\n\r\nI'm somewhat okay with stereotypical characters, except for the tsundere and the klutz. I found the tsundere here just.... way too annoying. Who the heck barges into someone else's dorm room unexpectedly? She bounces back and forth between 'You're an idiot' to the main character and 'I want you guys to succeed' to the main couple. The main girl, or the klutz, doesn't have any real redeeming qualities, I feel. She's also annoying and helpless, and the only reason that the story is as dramatic as it is is due to her time limit. Moving on, the main character is ditzy and doesn't seem to know anything - who gets a job and doesn't even research what it's about, and then proceeds to tell the boss that he doesn't know what he even signed up for? Not only that, but he fell in love with a girl who he simply saw in the elevator - and she was crying too! And then he's stupid enough to actually believe the dumb advice that people give him about how to get a girl, like come on, you went to school, how do you not know what's socially acceptable? Then there's the creepy blonde pervert who seems to have a thing for the main girl. She's only there for the fanservice aspect, with her larger-than-DD chest and the fact that she always shows her cleavage and likes to grope other big-chested girls. Other than these four, the rest of the characters were enjoyable because they weren't in-your-face trying-too-hard to be funny.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 5/10\\n\r\nSee Story and Character",

            "content": "I guess it is up to me to write a review that doesn't make this anime seem like a total waste of you time, because it is not. Plastic Memories is an anime that a appealed to me ever since I first saw it, and I finally got to it recently. Overall, I would agree that the anime is pretty average, about a 7, good but nothing special. Th thing is, the anime has a whole lot of charm, and I think that is why I enjoyed it so much.\r\nStory(8/10)\r\nIt seems as though many were expecting this to be a huge emotional mess with hugeideas and some revolutionary something. Maybe, because I don't expect things from an anime, I wasn't left feeling disappointing not getting what I wanted from it. Th story has a very cool concept that I have yet to see. I found the anime to be well paced, though it could have benefited from being a little bit longer, as episodes-10 take place in a month, then 11-13 suddenly jump through a month, so that felt a little under developed. Don't let that discourage you, however, there is still enough for the story to develop well. I found the comedy, romance, and slice of life elements to be really enjoyable, as they are the strong points. Th end was fittingly sad, but that wasn't the focus. I believe that the anime wanted you to focus on the happy and fun moments, demonstrating the ideals of the show itself, which is why you won't be an emotional wreck at the end of the show, like many people seemed to have wanted.\\n\\n\r\nArt(7/10)\\n\r\nTh art is good, but nothing special. I was hoping for the anime to be a little prettier, and I wanted to give it an 8, but it never seemed to have a special flair to it. Maybe it was those super thick white highlights.\\n\\n\r\nSound(7/10)\\n\r\nLike the art, the sound was good, but nothing to lose your pants over. I really enjoyed the voice acting, though. The background music and ambient are nice, but nothing that will keep me up at night for.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter(9/10)\\n\r\nI really like the characters here, I thought they were great. The only complaint I have is that a few of the characters seemed unimportant or seemed to have no impact on the story, but I can only think of a few characters that fit that description. Focusing on the rest, there may not have been anything directly outstanding compared to other anime, but they were well developed. The character development was also really solid, and didn't seem like anyone suddenly had a change of heart, or seemed like they didn't change at all. I say that for the main characters, naturally secondary characters won't have the same kind of development.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment(8/10)\\n\r\nI had a really good time with the anime. It was an easy watch, but still had an impact. It was simple, clean, and solid. I finished it in about four days in three episode chunks, and it was a good pace for it. There isn't much else to say about that.\\n\\n\r\nSo in the end I thought Plastic Memories was great. It was a very solid show that wasn't weak in any particular point. It was paced well and had likable characters. I would recommend this to people looking for a show with a nice laid back feel and some good comedy. I also recommend this to people who like something that isn't too taxing, but has a good emotional side as well. I do not recommend this to people who want something that will keep them up at night, make them cry their eyes out, or have some revelation. As I said before, the anime itself represented the concepts within it, to leave you with happy memories in the end, not sad ones.",

            "content": "Today feels like a day for rants. Plastic Memories was kinda disappointing. I expected more from Hayashi, the scenario writer for games Ch\u00e4oS;HEAd, Steins;Gate, Robotics;Notes and Bravely Default. It was decent, but the amount of lost potential imo was too much. To describe the anime in a sentence: Hayashi started to implement his familiar writing style, then decided halfway that he was gonna focus on a completely different direction, but opted against changing the first half of the story.   \r\nThe story is good written as concept, the directing and execution of said story was poor. Tsukasa fails his college entrance exam and isoffered a position at SAI Corporation due to his father's connections. SAI Corp is known for its production and management of androids that possess human emotions called \"Giftia.\" Tsukasa's position is in the Terminal Service Department where their main job is to recover Giftias that are close to their expiration. He is then paired up with Isla, a female Giftia who was never given any responsibility other than serving tea to her co-workers. \\n\\n\r\nTsukasa and Isla make house visits to retrieve these Giftia from their \"owners\". Giftia have complete emotions rather than being a tool or a pet, they are friends and family to these people. So naturally parting ways with their giftia can get very emotional for both Retrieval Teams and Clients. While working as a team, Tsukasa and Isla gradually become closer to each other, as does Isla's expiration date. Thus, we have the story. Watching these two grow and deal with the stress of their unpleasant job. \\n\\n\r\nDespite having this great set up and a decent cast of characters, they only nail half of the focus. My main gripe is the blatant out of place comedy that ruins really great scenes. For example at the end of episode one, when Chizu overhears Nina and decides to sign the retrieve form, you get that amazing atmosphere with \"Again & Again\", then the heartbreaking  moment when Nina who is so worried about what's gonna happen to Chizu when she's gone, and finally Chizu's gratitude for being so understanding of the value Nina had to her. The feels are strong, then in an attempt to break the tension on the car ride back, Isla starts to shudder and worries she's about to pee herself....... what a buzzkill. And this happens over and over throughout the series.\\n\\n\r\nThings pick up and get tense halfway through when the team has trouble retrieving a target. There's a chase, some conflict of interest between government and private response teams, and some trauma history that is unearthed which causes some friction between characters. Then once the episode is over..... the show suddenly turns away from the whole thing like it could not have happened and now it's strictly SoL Rom/Com? But..... things were getting interesting! Oh well, I like romance, and this had some great moments..... only to be ruined shortly after. Especially when you thought it wasn't going to go down that incredibly cliche moment of awkwardness between a \"couple\". You are proven wrong with the two worst episodes of anime they could have produced. I'm honestly impressed the last episode was handled as decently as it was. I expected it to be either an ass-pull, a vague closure, or overly dramatic. But instead I really enjoyed it.     \\n\\n\r\nNow with the characters. They are interesting at first, but how many times do I need to be obviously reminded that Michiru and Kazuki are Tsundere? Or that Sherry is a borderline Yandere? Or Eru is yuri freak with a speech tick? They are so one dimensional it's painful. Michiru has an interesting past, but it's hardly shown to affect her actions beside from one episode. Also there are a couple lines in one ep that implies Kazuki and Yasutaka had some kind of relationship. But it's never looked into. There's a large cool world with lots of stories to be told. TELL THEM! They tease us with build up then continue to bore us with simplistic, unfocused, what seems like useless filler episodes. They were interesting but don't have an affect on our characters pass that one moment. Instead you wait til halfway through the series to flip a switch from the focusing on the job of our characters, to only focusing on Tsukasa and Isla. I forgot they even had a job retrieving Giftia after episode 5. The romance was expected, but I didn't think it was gonna be so much cheesy fluff after the events that transpired midway. \"How should I ask her out *uncomfortable suggestions from others \" \"W-w-w-would you like to go to the park *blush\" \"*sees Isla in a towel *blush\" \"Michiru goes all Tsun Jealous\" rinse, repeat, with maybe four or five awesome scenes in between for 7 episodes. Then the admittedly good ending.  \\n\\n\r\nDon't get me wrong, I really liked the show, the animation and music were great, and it had some really nice moments in between my gripes. I guess maybe I hyped the show a bit too much for myself? I was expecting great things from the combo of Hayashi and the same team that produced another original anime \"Mikakunin de Shinkoukei\" which I absolutely love! Plastic Memories 5/10",

            "content": "This is my review of Plastic Memories.\r\nFrom the moment I read the synopsis of this anime, I knew it was going to be a tearjerker. So I decided to try this out.\r\nStory :\r\nI'm sure you all read the synopsis, so I'm going straight into my views. The story is very linear, there isn't much plot twists, and by the 2nd or 3rd episode you already know how the story is going to end. However, what makes this a treat in my opinion is the journey to the end. The pacing is not fantastic, and the comedy scenes sometimes ruin the mood of the show forme, but overall it is a good story and does not go out of point. I do think that if the show has unused potential and that it could be even better if given more episodes.\\n\\n\r\nArt :\\n\r\nThe art is pretty standard, it's good. The only complaint (sort of) that I have is that the characters look shiny to me. Maybe it's just me.\\n\\n\r\nSound :\\n\r\nWhen I listened to the opening, I thought it was good. Then I heard the ending. Asayake no Starmine is absolutely beautiful. I could listen to it all day without getting tired of it. The soundtrack is not very memorable, unfortunately, and nothing really stands out that I remember, but I don't remember anything horrible either.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters :\\n\r\nIs it just me or are the side characters being developed more than our MC?\\n\r\nIsla is the big main focus of the show obviously, and she had way more screen time and development than the other characters. Her personality changed throughout the show as she grew, and the side characters got decent development in the form of backstory, from the past to where they are now. Tsukasa however, felt like he didn't change at all. From episode 1 to episode 12, he gives me that standard romance main character vibe. It was only near the end of the last episode that I felt he was getting developments, and it was drastic and abrupt.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment :\\n\r\nI enjoyed every episode of this anime, the comedy was not bad, but not outstanding, and the ending was beautifully done. Combined with one of my favourite ending theme songs (Asayake no Starmine), of course I enjoyed this anime\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I give Plastic Memories a rating of 9/10",

It was a blend of lots of things. Even though this anime is shown only one genre which is Sci-fi I think there's more to it than just that. The story brings us comedy, drama, a little feel but it mixes em perfectly. I just had to give it 10 as it was a complete original.\r\nSound: 8/10 The sound fitted really good in the scenes. The OP and ED were also good.\r\nCharacters: 8/10 The characters in the anime were really brought tolife. Even the minor side characters had their own episode or 2 along with the side characters. So they fleshed the characters more for the audience to  show us why they are like that. Not many anime flesh out the side or minor side characters. Other anime just keep the side character to be a side character.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: 9/10 This was simply beautiful. Everything was well done. The art style, brightness level, beautiful scenarios all were just well done by the studio Doga Kobo who also did the animation of Mikagura Gakuen Kumikyoku which just finished airing its last episode on Wednesday. They also have done the animation of many anime that I have watched. I also really liked the background illustrations.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8/10 Again enjoyment was spot on with a lot of funny scenes in each episode or two and they served it good.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: A beautiful anime I would recommend to watch.\\n\\n\r\nOverall Score: 8.6/10\\n\\n\r\nPersonal note: I would suggest you but the Blu-ray copy when it comes out and enjoy the story even more and also help the producers earn something\\n\\n\r\nPersonal note 2: Brace for feels\\n\\n\r\nPersonal note 3: These are completely my opinions alone and these are spoiler free reviews",

            "content": "\"What if my lifespan was predetermined.. I wonder how i'd handle that? I would spend that limited time living my life to the fullest\".\r\nThe line at the end of the series perfectly summed up the entire series. A wonderful roller coaster of emotion, that'll take you on a journey of seeing the world in the eyes of Giftias. An artificial Humanoid produced by a fictional company in the future, that has been integrated perfectly into the society, as if they're naturally part of the world. These humanoids have various roles, depends on what their human partner needs. They can be children, co-worker, bodyguards, or evenparents.\\n\\n\r\nEven though they are very versatile, they are still man-made, they can only live through predetermined lifespan. Once they've reached the end of their lifespan, they have to be 'retrieved' by the company's 'Terminal Service' staffs. That's where our protagonist came into play. After graduating from his school, he stumbled upon the Terminal Service 1 office, an humble yet unusual branch office, where he got paired up with a mysterious girl that he met before, Isla. With his naivety and her clumsiness, they have a strange yet intriguing combi that made a lot of their clients dumbfounded, yet blissfully happy at the end.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is simple yet well developed, carefully guiding you to reveal the truths behind the Gistias. Unfortunately, for me the early episodes feels like they're trying too hard to make this series 'as not depressing as possible' by breaking the build-up touching atmosphere with jokes and funny scenes, which ultimately made my heart a bit confused (?). But after 4 episodes or so, shit got serious. The plot intensed heavily, the mysteries unfolds, and the atmosphere glooms. It may sounded like horribly dark, but it's actually quite warm. The series didn't really 'forces us to cry' by showing our characters screaming at each other's throat or something, it's actually quite the opposite. You'll find these complex characters smiling through almost all of the hardships, which made my tears flows ridiculously. And that, if i may say, is the main charm of this series and could be the very core message that it tries to implies through the story, \" I would spend that limited time living my life to the fullest. No matter how matter what i faced\".\\n\\n\r\nGenre: Sci-Fi, Romance, Slice of Life.\\n\r\nRatings: 9/10\\n\r\nConclusion: A must watch for Romance fans! Might even recommend this for non-regular watchers.",

While this is good for the side of me that just wants to see that cute relationship; however, some context would have been great. Had the series had more episodes, it probably would've been great. It didn't have enough room to go into detail about the setting and make a story of it whilst focusing ontheir relationship.\\n\\n\r\nAnyway, the main issue here is all of the annoying cliches we see all of the time are all over this series. It's almost disgusting. ESPECIALLY with Michiru. Tsudere who hits the generic male protagonist whilst having dead parents. \\n\\n\r\nPersonally, I did enjoy the comic relief and the journey itself.

It makes me wonder what if they just refined the show a little and how much of an improvement that would've made.\r\nPROS\r\nPlastic memories is one of the few anime's that doesn't feel rushed in its 13 episodes. Generally speaking, most romantic comedies with 12-13 episodes always feels rushed so i commend Plastic memories on overcoming this. I found the comedy to be good acceptable, I wouldn't say every episode made me laugh, but the ones that did, really made me laugh.\r\nCONS\r\nRight so this could very well be a very subjected personal opinion but I feellike Plastic memories does a terrible job with character traits. At times it felt like it jumps leaps and bounds ahead of what one character's personality was to enhance the current situation, I wasn't too welcoming of this strategy. I also, unlike many others, disliked the start of this anime, I felt it to be bland and it lost be by the first episode, only after continuing a month later, did I find some interest in the anime.\\n\\n\r\nShould you watch?\\n\r\nI think if you really enjoyed episode one, and this science sort of genre then you won't be disappointed.

            "content": "\"Plastic Memories\" suffered from a severe identity crisis.  By no means however does that warrant this series as terrible, but that the premise and plot just did not seem to coincide with one another.  Almost like the time my parents told me I was getting something \"cool\" for Christmas, but instead I got an Almanac while my friends got the latest gameboy cartridges and toys.  An A-L-M-A-N-A-C.  Well back to the point, all-in-all \"Plastic Memories\" was still a fairly enjoyable series among the plethora of backwash anime like the \"Fate/Zero\" series by Ufotable.  I was joking by the way, pleasedon't hurt me.\\n\\n\r\nSet in futuristic Japan, with lasers and fully automated cars and all that other futuristic jazz, androids have found their way into the daily lives of the public populace, some even situated as intimately as a family member or lover.  Interesting enough premise right?  Well, \"Premise's\" archenemy, \"The Plot,\" thought otherwise.  The setting for the series amounted to nothing more than a superficial guise, a  mere pedestal for the boy meets girl with terminal illness scenario.  The audience are only given a vague sketch of the surrounding world and not much else is elaborated on.  And did I mention the inconsistency?  But if there is one thing that stood out though, it has to be that this series has the most innocent \"bath scene\" I have ever seen.  \\n\\n\r\nThe art was superb, is what I would like to say, but there were obvious inconsistencies throughout the series.  The camera often spans back to show distorted faces, or the backside of the characters.  Or maybe that was just because I have a 90s piece of [insert vulgar term here] laptop.  But for the most part, the art was otherwise fluid and appealing.  \\n\\n\r\nAnd here we finally get to the characters development of the series.  Aside from some typical characters archetypes (like you know, that tsundere that thinks about what to do as a tsundere before acting like a tsundere), not many of the characters are really fleshed out.  The prime example being the male protagonist, Mizugaki Tsukasa.  Besides the fact that he may be a straightforward and caring type, not much else is known about who he is or why.  The characters in this series felt bare and some even slightly foreign.  So for a sci-fi genre that focused almost solely on drama, either the buildup of tension was mediocre at best or I'm just a callous ----.  \\n\\n\r\nAside from the obvious misplaced sci-fi elaboration in \"Plastic Memories\" and my rant, the series was still fair.  Don't be demotivated by this review (or others) to put this show in the bin, decide for youself where you stand.  For some this was a real tear-jerker, decent for others, and appalling to the rest.  Just don't dive into the series expecting to get that sci-fi fix.  \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Plastic Memories remains one of my favorite anime to this day despite the fact I think it was lacking in many ways.\r\nThis futuristic story stars an 18-year old boy Tsukasa Mizugaki. Basically, he decides to go into the work force after failing his college entrance exams and through family connections lands a job at Sion Artificial Intelligence Corporation. This is the company responsible for the manufacture, distribution, and critically reclamation of human-like beings known as Giftia. As a member of Terminal Service One, Tsukasa and his coworkers are one of the groups responsible for retrieving Giftia before they run out of memory space (and allegedlygo berserk, killing people with their superhuman strength). Why this happens isn't fully explained but it's the future so whatever.\\n\r\nNow Tsukasa Mizugaki must become a grim reaper of sorts while learning about love, loss, and acceptance in this Slice-of-Life about him and his partner.\\n\\n\r\nQuality - 9\\n\r\nThe art in this anime was hands down one of the best I've seen. Like seriously. The use of color and light, the characters' expressions, even the angles used were all top notch. The characters themselves, on the other hand, are one of the great weaknesses of this anime. As if in an effort to keep up with Romantic Comedy norms, more than 50% of the characters are oblivious of their surroundings and make mistakes that seem unacceptable for people their age, especially considering they're at work. Beyond that, most of the character problems could be fixed with more in-depth backstories and more scenes in general, but this leaves characters seeming especially bland and almost recycled. On a brighter note, I loved the music and the story was pretty well-written.\\n\\n\r\nLikability - 10\\n\r\nI somehow found myself incredibly attached to these characters despite or maybe even because of their blandness. I liked how the first few episodes in particular seemed to have their own arcs, and cute bittersweet stories. I find series in general that question morals, death, and individuality to be interesting in their own rights, but this story cleverly skirts those types of dark topics and puts you in the mind of a teenage boy at his first job. He's worried about the impressions he leaves, the quality of his work, how people get along with him, etc. I feel this was a smart way to share the emotions of a dark story without getting into the smaller details or looking at the big picture. There are moments and emotions in this anime that left a deep impression on me and I feel it told the story it wanted to tell.\\n\\n\r\nRecommendability - 9\\n\r\nThis has a lot of depressing moments, very little action, weak characters, and some plot holes.\\n\r\nEverything else was beautiful. It properly constructed its own world and sat me down inside it to have me watch an ordinary boy at a somewhat ordinary job. It had me grinning, thinking, tearing up...all practically on command. It does what SoL greats like K-On couldn't for me through the use of emotion, color, and actual plot. If you can handle a tearjerker, I recommend this 100%.\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 9",

            "content": "Plastic Memories tells you a story about a situation where AI technology advanced to the point where they are indistinguishable from any human. This makes them capable of living among society, mostly as a rehabilitation mechanics for those with trauma or other reasons. Sadly, they have limited lifespan of 9-ish years, enough time for human to get attached to. Thus, it left you with only a fabricated memories that are doomed from the start, something that might stay with human, but not with 'human'. You might remember who that 'person' is, but if that 'person' is 'inactive' and has no recollection of those memories...does thememories you had even exist...or is it just plastic memories?\\n\\n\r\nTo be honest, the pilot episode of Plastic Memories sold me. I won't deny that I cried by the end of the first episode. It sets me up for what I was hoping to expect from the series: an anime about the relationship between two different, but alike species that tries to do their job of retrieving 'human' from human who are almost like a family to them before they go, rogue...an interesting way of looking at the prospect of 'letting something go'...with a little sprinkle of comedic rom-com in there.\\n\\n\r\nSadly, that little sprinkle turned out to be a shower and the comedic rom-com engulfed the whole show. It turned a show with an interesting premise into another comedy. The show itself is still decent with what you expect from a rom-com that tries to force drama. But when something you believe will be great turns out sour, it's a backstab like no other. \\n\\n\r\nIf the show sticks to the idea of Augmented Memories, it will go far.",

Creations full of life, spirit, imagination, and will as us humans.\r\nFor the sake of science, these sentient creations were put through for the general public to use. However, there is a catch in these creations.\r\nTheir life time is limited. On a clock. Temporary.\r\nOur main cast is a very important company that needs to deal with these limited sentient lives, because if they do not do their job, then these creations go haywire and become extremely dangerous.\r\nBut there are a couple of huge emotional impacts that prevent this job;\r\nIt is very hard to let go of someone,be it fabricated life or a diseased life, it is really hard to face the fact that it all ends.

How heavy that weight is to give and receive it.\\n\r\nLastly, how would one, who knows how limited their time is, spend it? Some may choose to isolate themselves to not give grief and mourning to close ones. Some may let it all out and do what ever they want. Some may finally choose what they would've never imagined themselves to do before.\\n\\n\r\nWhat an amazing and emotional premise this show has, like the little bitch I am, I cried. Cried for the things our characters had to deal with, cried for the things they wished for, and cried for the time when they need to part ways.\\n\\n\r\nThe biggest issue in the back of my mind however is, who the hell gave the okay for these things to be for public use?

            "content": "I came to this anime courtesy of a funny picture I saw on the internet. The \"Anime Makes You Cry Starter Pack\" included such gems as AnoHana, Angel Beats!, CLANNAD, and this little number. I love sad anime, and I came into this with high expectations. The premise seemed novel, and the art was pretty good looking.\r\nBoy, was I betrayed.\r\nThis isn't a bad anime, by any means, but it is a confused one. The idea of consistent tone is completely lost to the directors, which is stunning considering this was written by the same mastermind who gave us Steins;Gate. The plot bounces from colorful slice-of-lifehijinks to unspeakably tragic emotional drama and back again with the vigor of a pinball in a dryer. The premise and world of this somewhat distant future is not explored very far beyond the world as seen through the eyes of our \"good-natured idiot\" protagonist. Characters' motivations are often murky, when they are delved into at all.\\n\\n\r\nThe series has a very neat futuristic vision that permeates the setting. The gadgets and gizmos are interesting analogues, but the series doesn't delve into the mechanics of how these things work, which is kind of a bother when they go full sci-fi in one episode and Tsukasa fires some sort of beam cannon that shoots...virus packets? \\n\\n\r\nThe character designs are decent but nothing you haven't seen before. Tsukasa is the everyman character with boring looks to match his boring personality. Isla has the traditional albino pseudo-loli look made famous by Illyasviel von Einzbern. Eru is the fan-service genki girl technician who is only around to get her tits out. Kazuki is the somewhat-threatening mentor with ties to Isla's past. Michiru is your oh-so-typical hot-blooded tsundere who devotes herself purely to furthering the tragedy train that is TsukasaxIsla to its inevitable conclusion. Yeah, don't do us any goddamn favors, girl.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is crisp but everything seems to have this ridiculous white gleam to it. I guess it's because it's THE FUUUUUTURE and everything has to be shiny and spotless in the future. It becomes especially noticeable in the characters' hair, like they all bathe in vaseline before every scene or something. It's off-putting.\\n\\n\r\nSoundtrack is actually really good. The OP visuals and song are a bit deceptive, but still listenable. The ED song is a performance by Asami Imai with random color filter shots of Isla making strange faces. It's decent to listen to. The voice acting is perfunctory, with no real standout performances, although Chinatsu Akasaki and celebrated veteran Megumi Toyoguchi turn in above-the-curve roles as Michiru and Kazuki, respectively.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is a pretty decent romp as long as you don't think about it so hard and as long as you understand that everything outside of the romance is treated with precisely zero importance. This is a romance story first and foremost: Guy meets girl, guy falls in love, guy finds out girl has about a month left to live, and decides to make that month full of memories for her to...take with her to data oblivion? This is where it starts to become physically painful to try and delve into these characters' heads or try to impose logic on the world outside of that possessed by demented sadists. Why would anyone think making and disseminating Giftia as they are presently constructed was anything less than a recipe for intense heartbreak? Why would you make androids that are capable of emotion, sell them to people, have them forge bonds, and then have your goons happily show up at their door to reclaim the \"property\" with a disturbingly hearse-like vehicle and plastic smiles? Is SAI Corporation secretly a major backer of some anti-depressant manufacturing company or something? I fail to see the purpose, because it's never explained, and that leads me to my next huge problem with this series.\\n\\n\r\nA lot of things are NEVER explained or elaborated upon. They're hinted at. We see that the CEO of SAI is a bit of a shady, \"ends-justify-the-means\" kind of figure...but that's as far as it goes, because we only see bits and pieces of the world outside of the love bubble occupied by Tsukasa and Isla, and neither of them has the slightest hint of curiosity about anything outside of the other party. There's a sub-plot about the fact that Tsukasa's particular branch of the Terminal Service (read: the above-mentioned reclamation crews) is a huge profit loss to SAI because they conduct their recoveries much more humanely than other branches, but it never goes anywhere. Michiru has a tragic past, but it's resolved in one episode and never spoken of again.\\n\\n\r\nInstead of diving into the science of this science-fiction tale (you know, the stuff that made Steins;Gate an instant classic), we have innumerable scenes of our supposedly true love pairing failing to communicate and generally being extremely awkward around each other. Tsukasa has the character depth of a mud puddle and similar perceptive faculties, but somehow we're supposed to root for this guy because he's... I dunno, nice, I guess? Isla deserves better, but chooses to spend the final 2000 hours of her life devoting herself to him.\\n\\n\r\nAnd speaking of Isla, she's the one character that doesn't seem like a carbon copy of somebody from another series, and has some of the best dialogue and some truly funny moments in the show, especially her facial expressions. She's emotive, charming, clumsy, cheerful, but above all never a bore to watch. She's a bright spot in an otherwise rote and shallow viewing experience.\\n\\n\r\nIn closing, is there anyone I would recommend this to? I guess if CLANNAD: After Story made you sad, but you didn't want that pesky moral and message getting in the way, you can subject yourself to this emotional torture porn. The fact that Plastic Memories has no real message behind it just makes it feel empty. Sure, it'll make softies like myself tear up a bit, but there's no real substance, nothing to make you think after the credits roll for the final time. It's just unrelenting sadness for its own sake, and that is its greatest sin of all. Tragedy is a part of human life. Senseless tragedy, on the other hand, is something we see too much of in our cruel world. Personally, it doesn't make any sense to make it part of your entertainment options. There are better romances out there, and there are definitely better sci-fi stories.\\n\\n\r\nI guess the funny image was right: it made me cry. I guess it's just a shame that was all it was capable of doing.",

I just don't like the tsundere characters, and there are two of them here. One of them especially gets over the top angry, and physically harms the main male character, if that were reversed and any of the male characters acted in such a manner that anime would be universally hated. And because of the tsundere characters I found this anime unwatchable after 4 episodes.\r\nThe art, sound, and animation are all fine.\r\nThe main character, Isla, was interesting, she seemed to bequestioning whether she was alive or was just a machine with a limited lifespan. It would have been nice to see how that developed. However, her male lead was pretty much bland and a cookie cutter character, apparently he's there mostly as a foil for juvenile jokes and the tsunderes' wrath, and, to provide a romantic interest for the main character.",

            "content": "When going into this show I didn't really have much to go off of the only thing like it I had seem was chobits(which I really wasn't a fan of). However in just watching the first episode I knew this show was special. It did a great job of showing the harsh realities of this world and these robotic humans I guess you could call them.\r\nStarting with story I was unsure about how much I would enjoy the shows concept but that unsureness was soon dismissed once I saw how it was presented. Seeing how close these \"robotic humans\" were to there owners/parents and howsad they were to have to leave each other was really touching and unless your heart is made of stone I can guarantee you will be feeling something by the end of the series. Above all else it made me thankful for my own family that I am lucky to have and how wonderful they are in my life.\\n\\n\r\nMoving on to art, the series looked beautiful. I don't really have much to say on this topic other than the night scenes looked wonderful the dark sky mixed with bright lights really caught my attention. The reason I say the series looked beautiful is, I just liked the art style, really have nothing else to say about it.\\n\\n\r\nMoving on to sound, the music was really fitting for this series. It could be dramatic and happy when necessary and really helped me get drawn into the scenes even more. Most notably the opening and ending theme were especially enjoyable. The opening did a good job of drawing me in originally and above all else just fit well with the tone the series tries to set, while the ending I found more upbeat as if to say \"it'll all be OK.\" \\n\\n\r\nNext is characters(main only):\\n\r\nTsukasa(main male)-incredibly likeable and compassionate, he'd do anything for those he cares about and really showed how caring he can be during his partnership with Isla, wanting to stay with her no matter what was going on with her.\\n\r\nIsla(main female)-excellent backstory and the main cause for all the tear shedding in the series. Despite being shy and not very emotional she does care about her friends, especially Tsukasa. She is also very dedicated and likable and by the end you only want to see more of her.\\n\r\n(Other Characters)- I know some of the characters are considered main but I do not as the series does not focus as much on them. But I will say I did enjoy them and their banter with one another, they made me laugh, they made me cry, I enjoyed them and I'm sure you will too.\\n\\n\r\nFinal Thoughts- If there's one word to describe this show it would be; feelful. I'm not sure if that's even a word but I don't care, every episode I felt something, whether it be sadness, love, or happiness I felt something it brought out my emotions in the best way possible and I enjoyed every second of this series and the characters it introduced me too.\\n\\n\r\nRating 9.5/10 (Cause the ending while good, left me a little unsatisfied)\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Before I get into any of the details I'd like to say that this anime runs through a great plot in a very very short time. Compressing a story that could have easily ran 2 seasons into 13 episodes is a choice made, and after watching is, I think that is a valuable thing, even though the plot, the characters, really most things suffer from it. But I'll get back to that at the end.\r\nThe story itself is not a simple one, but adresses issues that come more and more into view into view as the 21st century progresses. What is artificial life and howdo you value things? Unfortunately, due to it's short framing, there is very limited room to go into ethics and therefore it is only shortly touched upon that artifical life is seen by different people as different things, artificial or life. The message brought however through the story, of making the best of what you're given and treasuring moments is really good. Again due to short timeframe, this message had to be forced on with several harsh plotdevices that don't really make sense as well as hard curves in the story. The good thing about how that is handled, is that it is forced on by the side characters, who, more than anyone, understand the reason to hurry, which does justify many of the choices. \\n\\n\r\nThe art is wonderful, though I will admit to not being adapt at seeing quality. There are some lovely recurring themes in the imaging and setting. In particular I appreciate the night settings. Additionally, design choices for many of the futuristic contraptions, are really good, staying not too close to current trends, but also not veering too far off. \\n\\n\r\nSound was minimal, except for a few dramatic songs where absolutely necessary, but so very suitable and often soothing. I honestly have very little I can say about it. It is not the reason you should watch it, but once you do, you'll definitely find some enjoyment from it. \\n\\n\r\nNow characters is where this anime really falls apart. There is so little time to show them, that instead of an expanded personality beyond a type, they are given a message. In case of the two leads, there is some more, but again, though they have a decent personality, it is their message that captivates as there is too little time to really delve into their personality. Usually I'm very critical of that, but again, for some reason it doesn't bother me in this anime. What messages they carry are carefully chosing, interlinking and integral and that makes them valuable enough. \\n\\n\r\nNow, the reason I enjoyed it so much comes down to answering that fundamental question that I posed at the start. What makes me say that this story being compressed into 13 episodes is a valuable thing? This is a love story about coming together with a deadline hanging overhead. The instant the series started I realised what was going to happen, as it was outright stated by the protagonist, and immediately I got worried. From the third episode on I kept on checking how much time they had left. How many more episodes they had before time was up. I was getting swept up in the exact same thing that all side characters were getting swept up in, the race against the clock. The story twisted and turned really weirdly occassionally, but I didn't mind, because it forced progress in this short time that I had. I cried throughout the entire last episode and then it ended. As it should. As the message of this anime was all the time. \\n\\n\r\nI write this review only 15 minutes after having watched it, and maybe I'm not objective, but I think that is okay. This anime is not meant that way. It's supposed to sweep you up and plant a seed of thought. Life is beautiful in its shortness, in its finality, and so is this anime. Yes, it is not perfect, and there are things I'd like to have seen different, but that would have taken more time and there wasn't. For once, that doesn't make it bad, it makes its message just a little bit stronger. \\n\\n\r\nPS. I don't think I'd watch it a second time, because it might lose some of its charm... Just once, and then it ends. That's enough.",

I was ready for some feels, but instead all I received from 7 episodes was a ludicrous plot and forced tragedy for the sake of creating forced pain and drama.\r\nThe whole plot that surrounds the idea of androids that have a set lifespan/memory/personality but are fully treated in every way as a human, especially emotionally, is just plain annoying and not even remotely believable. \r\nWhy would anyone invest so muchemotion into an android knowing they exact date they will leave you and why would anyone allow them to raise children or act as surrogates for family members?\\n\\n\r\nI tried to suspend my loose grip on reality so that I can try to enjoy this anime full of demented logic and plot holes, but I just wasn't able to suspend reality to that extreme.\\n\\n\r\nI really did give \"Plastic Memories\" a full shot, but in the middle of episode 7, I promptly dropped it and am much satisfied with my decision.  \\n\\n\r\nI'm not a hater of tragic anime.  Heck I've watched \"Grave of the Fireflies\" and have kept a somewhat faith in humanity even after watching it.  \"Plastic Memories\" just made me not want to emotionally invest in any character once you understand the plot premise because you just know how it will go.  People will emotionally invest in androids that will \"die\" on a specific time and you will be hurt.",

            "content": "//Spoiler Less section//\r\nPlastic Memories is one more iteration in aproaching relationships with free will IA/Androids. It has a good premise and promise lots of drama, mainly focusing on the short life span of those androids called Giftias (9 years), and our protagonist who works on end and retirement of old units. Being full sentient personas, this Giftias act, feel and live like normal humans, with worries and fear handling what will be an early death by all means.\r\nI may recommend it for newcomers, but there are far more better series out there delivering what you expect from them. It was a good ride but notan awesome one, just fine.\\n\\n\r\n//Spoilers Ahead: BEWARE!!//\\n\\n\r\nOnce watched, i have several issues with this anime, it has the potential of becoming a great drama but it fails hard to deliver. A lot of time is lost in most meaningless missions at work, taking too much time explaining the consecuences of not retiring a Giftia.\\n\\n\r\nEven so, the main plot of romance fall apart, diluting while the short time is spend on secondary characters history. It's hard to believe it's too much of a big deal the lost of a Giftia, giving that society is full concious of it's life span and service for what looks like more than a decade, and that's exactly what happens outside the main characters office. It's quite cruel how it's depicted, they the only office that worries about both the Giftia and its owner.\\n\\n\r\nThe hardest is thinking about how human Giftia's are and the horrible dilema of creating this entities with such a short life. Wich look like no problem for the company producing them, the creepy use in society.\\n\\n\r\n\u00bfAnyways what is a giftya? They eat and look like need to, even they can enjoy food, so they have sense of taste, a gastric system to process and give energy, but they have \"battery\" and need to be charged everynight. They have memories like they actually got a biologic brain, therefore it's memory can't be copied because it's a sinaptic connection, not a bunch of digital data. Yeah, i'm overthinking it but it's a good sign of how bad the Giftias were designed only as a plot device without getting deep on details.\\n\\n\r\nLeaving those problems aside, this anime entertained me, but doesn't hook you up too hard. You keep expecting things to happen but they don't, at the end everything is rushed out in three episodes. The most interesting part is cut out, the aftermath of the climax, but looks like anything matters, they throw another model and our protagonist is perfectly ok after a few months. At the end it feels like it's not such a great deal, only to those who suffers it's destiny, giftias.\\n\\n\\n\r\n//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////",

            "content": "I was aware of Plamemo since the time it started airing, but a lot of thoughts of it made me delay watching it, and I tell you it was not for nothing. At first I my expectations from synopsis information were like: a guy gets to work at company where they collect androids or giftias whose time is expiring and it will be accompanied with a lot of tears. Actually in reality so it is. With a lot things added and mixed up, like futuristic sci-fi setting, technologically advanced world, it makes a good anime.\r\nIn fact the story is not that full of tears asI would expect, though I'd say it is very good only at the start. Still full of clich\u00e9s, like: inexperienced newcomer at the job Tsukasa. And the fact that he gets to team up with Isla. Later it gets rather straightforward. It was rather predictable, and closer to the end a little overstretched. Perhaps it's for making the viewer empathize and shed a few tears. The end was the same as I'd foreseen even before I've watched half of the episodes. Anyway it is not making it bad, it gives a lot of ideas to think about. Interesting thing is that you may see this story as a sad story or you can see it as a very positive story.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters pleased me way more than the story. Cute, clumsy, making strange faces Isla. Serious, inexperienced, but eager to learn Tsukasa. Other characters are very bright and have their unique sides. Even in this 13-episode anime you can notice character development, but it's mostly concerning Tsukasa and Isla as they are in the focus of the story. Just comparing them at the beginning and at the end shows a significant difference.\\n\\n\r\nArt is a strong side of this anime. Great character design, great backgrounds, great coloring. I really liked to watch those bright scenes. City landscape during the dawn and the night city looks super awesome!\\n\\n\r\nSound is good. Atmosphere is always made right. ED and OP are nice and not make you skip them. I couldn't guess that Isla was voiced by Amamiya Sora, who voiced Akame from Akame ga Kill!, till I checked it. I've heard of Takumi Yasuaki before, but he made Tsukasa fit the character very well. Seiyuu job is great as always.\\n\\n\r\nOverall we got a curious and rather unusual, slow paced romance story without sudden turns of events. It does make anime world get +1 good series. Don't let the synopsis deceive you, it is not so as it may seem to be! Most memorable and impressing for me in this anime are the bright art, characters and philosophic ideas.",

            "content": "I'll start this review with a question. Can a show be considered a great show if the ending is already presented to you early on in the show? The simple answer, Yes. The complex answer, It depends on how the story is built.  Plastic Memories was a fairly good show that I do no regret watching, although I wouldn't consider it a \"great\" show. I'll explain. (Minor Spoilers)\r\nStory: 5 (Mediocre) \r\nThe story follows main protagonist Tsukasa Mizugaki who works at a \"terminal service\". In this setting there are Androids that feature realistic human qualities called \"Giftia\". These \"Giftia\" have a life span of 9years and after 9 years have passed the Terimal Service must collect them from the owner. Everyone in the terminal service is paired up with a Giftia, and as such Tsukasa is paired up with a Giftia named Isla. \\n\\n\r\nA large amount of the show follows the protagonists as they retrieve Giftias from people all over the city. During the later half of the series we see our Hero and Heroine getting a long much better than just partners. Slowly but surely they start to develop feelings for each other. This is obviously a problem because Giftias have a lifespan of 9 years, what will happen?\\n\\n\r\nArt: 7 (Good) \\n\\n\r\nArt was good, I have no complains about the art or any mistakes that might have been made with the production of this anime. I feel like the facial expressions of the characters very well suit each and every situation as the story progressed.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10 (Outstanding)\\n\\n\r\nI really do love the sound, it supports the show in every aspect. The OP and ED both fit to the mood of the entire series. They did a great job with this.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 6 (Fair)\\n\\n\r\nOur main Hero Tsukasa is pretty average, nothing that makes him stand out from the rest. I found him very replaceable and that other characters from other series could have done the same as him and probably better. Our Heroine is a great girl who seems to start off as Kuudere but softens up as the series progresses showing great development for her. The other side characters don't help much with the progression of the show or the development of the main characters.  \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 6 (Fair)\\n\\n\r\nI have watched shows of the similar genre that kept my attention, this show was unique in what they wanted to show the viewer but i pacing of the show is a bit odd. It made me want to put it on hold for awhile.]\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 6 (Fair)\\n\\n\r\nMain flaw of the series is the character/plot development. It's not something like Clannad that over the course of 48 episodes show the lives of two characters in love. This shows a much shorter romance. \\n\\n\r\nIt's not a show you go running to you friends telling them to watch this show. It's the type you stumble across, decide to watch. Smile, and put it in a special corner with anime that weren't all that great but worth the watch. \\n\\n\r\nThanks for reading, give this review a thumbs up or thumbs down. I don't mind I would just like a lot of criticism. Talk to me on my page if you'd like. \\n",

So i am very curious and have to check it out for myself.\r\nWell Plastic Memories is a very simple story where boy meet girl and they have a feeling for each other. The only problem is that the girl- Isla- is an android that possess human emotions called \"Giftia\". And Giftia can only live more than nine years. So what willhe do? Check the anime for yourself.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation of this show is rather average, but when it needs to be good, it's good. But the music is amazing, very nice op and ed coming along with touching bgm.\\n\\n\r\nI really think that Plastic Memories is a very beautiful show for the start to finish.

There's just one flaw: a Giftia can only live 81,920 hours (about nine years and four months) before their memories fade and they become mindlessviolent zombies.\\n\\n\r\nHere we are introduced to Tsukasa Mizugaki, after failing his collage entrance exame, he lands a job at SAI Corporation (the company responsable for creating the Giftia) and is assigned to the Terminal Service Department, whose purpose is to reclaim the expired Giftia.\\n\\n\r\nSurrounded by Giftia and partnered with the beautiful and clumsy Giftia - Isla, Mizugaki must come to terms with the short life spa of these life-like androids.\\n\\n\r\nAt first we are lured in, with the first episodes with a lot of emotion and light comedy but then the series starts to decline into clich\u00e9 jokes and mild fan service before finally redeeming itself with finale.\\n\\n\r\nStory [b] 7/10 [/b]:\\n\\n\r\nIt's starts slow with some funny scenes and you might start the believe it's another clich\u00e9 anime but slowly evolves and blossoms into an original romantic slice of life that teaches us hope to cope with the loss of someone we truly love.\\n\\n\r\nArt [b] 8/10 [/b]:\\n\\n\r\nIt's really colorful and very well drawn, the characters change outfits depending on the situation and space and there is no weird mix of 2D and 3D elements and some animes try force our throats.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter [b] 7/10 [/b]:\\n\\n\r\nThere is some really good character development from Mizugaki and Isla, and we soon see how their relationship blossoms.\\n\\n\r\nThey really care for each other and it's not a clich\u00e9 love relationship were the characters are so afraid to confess to each other that the anime ends without even a declaration of love, their development is really life-like and you can't stop yourself from rooting for their love, but it sometimes get short on premises and then you are bitch-slapped into reality that this is not a perfect anime.\\n\\n\r\nOverall I give it an [b] 7.2/10 [/b].\\n\\n",

            "content": "This show will surprise you. It certainly surprised me, and I believe many others would agree.\r\nAniplex brings to us Plastic Memories. I'll try to make this quick.\r\nHere's my review! (Not interested? TLDR at the bottom.\"\r\nGiftia are human beings in all regards except for the fact that they're synthetically created and programmed. They have a life span of 81,920 hours, which is about nine years. Things start to go wrong, very wrong, when a Giftia is pushed past its time limit, so Terminal Service's job is to alert Giftia and their owners/guardians/companions that their time has come to deactivate. This results in a complete wipe ofpersonality, memories, and identity, but not destruction of the body. The physical body of a Giftia can be reborn per se, but not the soul of the previous. This is a double-edged blade, bringing hope and joy to some, but sorrow and pain to others.\\n\\n\r\nPlastic Memories covers all of that within its 13 episodes, which I think is perfect to flesh out the world and characters.\\n\\n\r\nThat being said, the story was great. What we're set up to believe in the introductory episodes is that this anime will be filled with many different arcs and many characters that will get their background, their story, their ending, then a satisfying ending, whether it be happy or sad.\\n\r\nThis is not the case. There are several important retrievals within Plastic Memories, mainly in the first half of the show, but the second half is when things go in a different direction. Not a bad change, but change nonetheless.\\n\r\nBasically, the first half is mainly about retrievals and the other characters, which get their spotlights and their endings. The second half focuses more on the main characters, Tsukasa and Isla, and their romance and the time they spend together. Character development is aplenty in the second half, and I admit to being brought to a couple of tears. I can say I'm glad that I gave the screen my full attention during the important moments.\\n\r\nThis anime is not the most technical or the most creative you'll ever see, nor is it the best or the worst. It's simply there for people, to enjoy or not to enjoy. If you like it, you do. If you don't, you don't. Simple as pie. My suggestions to you? Give it a whirl. Don't drop this series if you pick it up, watch it until the end. You may have seen it coming, but if you allow it, the wrap-up will leave you either in tears and with a smile on your face. Aniplex may have lost focus during the production of this show, but it only gets better if you're like me. This anime will set up for one thing, but show you another. Don't get your hopes up, but don't lose them either.\\n\\n\r\nTLDR and Ratings\\n\r\nWell. It turned out longer than I thought. Whatever.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 8\\n\r\nSimple idea, simple genres, simple tags. Does it well, even though the story threw curve balls near the middle. Focus shifts from separate arcs during the first half of the series, then to the main character development in the second half. For what it's worth, the story was off focus at times and lost focus completely but it is still great nonetheless.\\n\r\nArt: 9\\n\r\nAppealing animation, simple but golden. Not anything outstanding, but enough for the world to look alive. Some odd expressions here and there, but that's to be expected. Doesn't take away from the main focus.\\n\r\nAlso, the introduction and outroduction are amazingly done. Very creative, if you ask me. Watch those in full length if you will/\\n\r\nSound: 9\\n\r\nTheme songs are fitting, matches the show's feeling of bittersweet emotions and time creating a rift between people. \\n\r\nCharacter: 10\\n\r\nAmazing character development. Each retrieval is like its own arc with its own characters, all of which have background and personality and stories to tell. As for the main characters, male protag and female protag get an insane amount of development in later episodes. Tons of character development, tons of emotional moments, tons of atmospheric build-up, all for a stunning climax that was visible from a mile away, but performed beautifully and heart-breakingly and tear-jerkingly anyways.\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10\\n\r\nLoved it. Actually made me want to put aside my multi-tasking skillz and focus completely on the show during its final episodes. Worth watching, definitely a hidden gem for those who can see the beauty in some stones.\\n\r\nOverall: 9\\n\r\nWatch this show, it may not be what you're looking for nor what you're expecting, and that's a good thing. I just ask you this, whatever you do please don't drop it because you aren't enjoying the story until you reach at least around halfway through the series. The focus changes dramatically around the halfway point, and you should at least see both sides of the story before you make a decision. Watch it through to the end, if you would.\\n\r\nBye!",

Or just generally sad, yet hopeful.\\n\\n\r\nAnyway, it has a gentle type of feels, you can see it from a ways off but it seems like it was done deliberately to give viewers time to come to terms with the fact that the tragedy is inevitable.\\n\\n\r\n9/10",

The art-style it's fine, I just have some minor complaints about lights and shadows in some scenes, but that'sit.\\n\r\nIf you love sad-romantic stories that'll probably leave you crying in a corner of your room for an hour, check Plastic Memories out.",

            "content": "(My first review, so sorry for possible mistakes)\r\n*May contain minor spoilers*\r\nFirst of I have to say that I think about memories a lot, and I'm really emotional when it comes to that.\r\nFirst episode was something truly great. \r\nInteresting characters, story and aspepects, line/graphic. Music was something that I wasn't really happy about, although I have to say it's mostly my taste.\r\nAs I was going further into the anime, the episodes were getting worse, not dramatically but I felt that they aren' something unique. \r\nLaste episodes brought back all my faith and enjoyment for the anime.\r\nSince I got my opinion covered, lets go to the actualreview:\\n\\n\r\nStory: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nAs we see in the synopsis, the story is about Tsukasa Mizugaki, Isla and his new work in the SAI Corporations.\\n\\n\r\nI didn't really like the futuristic placement of the anime; fortunately though, It wasn't so invasive for me while watching. First episodes were truly dramatic and enteraining, later on in the series unfortuantely we get few \\n\r\n*MINOR SPOILER* \\n\r\nepisodes about Isla's and Tsuakra's romance/relationship, most of these episodes were simply unenteraining. \\n\r\nFortunately, later on in the series we get much better \"version\" of these episodes, which are both entertaining and dramatic.\\n\\n\r\nLast episode was on the clannad level of sadness. (and it's the biggest reason fo 9/10 story)\\n\\n\r\nArt: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nI dont have to say much about it. It's truly outstanding piece of art.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nMusic in the anime was one of the biggest issues for me; it was really typical and \"sweet\" for me, although some of the tracks were great, the majority of time we get something that I personally don't like. (sweet pos stylized music that reminds me of Zero no Tsukaima)\\n\\n\r\nThe voices of characters were great, as in most of the animes these day.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nAnd here's another issue with the anime, the characters are boring/typical in every\\n\r\nway possible. We got the typical tsundere, a rough senpai that cares about others even if shows some physical abuse, etc. \\n\\n\r\nThe main protagonist beame a good character in the middle os the series. \\n\r\nI also liked the process of Isla acting/psychology change.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nEven though this anime had really typical aspects, I just didn't get bored with it. It was something that got me really surprised, and in the end, I'm happy that I watched it with to the end with joy.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nI has its ups and downs but in the end, one of the more dramatic/sad animes out there.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Funny gags, great production and direction, as well as cool character cast are what make it enjoyable and worth watching. \r\nYou'll have to abandon a lot of plot logic to be able to enjoy it, as similarly to NagiAsu, any logic in worldbuilding is completely subject to whims of the plot. Plot which unfortunately has both pretty bad writing, as well as pretty bad stereotypes. And not bad stereotypes in the ''tsundere'' sense, nah, those aren't bad or good, those are just tropes at this point. I'm talking bad cultural stereotypes. While it might be in line with j romance culture and otaku romance mentality,it doesn't make it any less unhealthy as a perpetuating norm. More specifically, the scenes in first half where Michiru is sticking her nose into other people's romance business like it's her sacred duty to make sure nobody dares think of anyone else in a romantic sense as that would be lewd and inappropriate. It's not the act itself that's really bad, it's how she perceives it as a social norm and story doesn't go on to deal with it in any way. An unhealthy norm to propagate, since it only staggers the potential real life romances by not inspiring the viewers to be honest with themselves and others. \\n\\n\r\nRight, enough of that. \\n\\n\r\nThis is hardly the most important reason for why writing here has issues. It's mostly the first half of the show, nearly all the little one off episodes with their mini stories that revolve around clients. They should be there to provide context for our main characters interactions, not to make us cry every single episode. Expecting the viewers to cry at your cue for every little thing like that, for characters they only just met, both fails to work and leaves a sour aftertaste. So instead of sad and dramatic, it comes off as incredibly cheap and melodramatic. I almost wanted to drop the show at that point, but I didn't since those little side stories obviously aren't the actual point of the show, but just badly handled fillers and exposition. \\n\\n\r\nIn case of Plastic Memories, it all depended on how last third would be handled, will it be as shitty as writing demonstrated so far, or will they actually pull it off well in some way? I was 50/50 about what to expect. Show up to that point has shown a lot of very good micro-writing, well executed gags and pretty much every slice of life scene was on point. And there's something to be said about making slice of life scenes not boring. If you can pull that off, you kinda know what you're doing, as a studio. Luckily, they didn't opt for melodrama in the end, but went for the low hanging fruit of playing it straight. So while the story is nothing new, nothing unexpected, nothing special in any way, and rather predictable, writing felt well handled in the last third of the show, and together with top of the line direction and production, delivered on what pretty much everyone expected and was here for. \\n\\n\r\nSo I'd say PlaMemo succeeds at what it sets out to do, hence the favorable rating. I personally enjoyed it (once it stopped with the fillers) since this is what I was here for as well: non boring moe romance with great production and some feels on top, that also isn't braindead but also has couple of things to say about life, which even though generic, are quite resonant and well executed, leaving an overall good impression.",

            "content": "This review is mostly spoiler-free, not that it should matter anyways.\r\nI'm going to keep this review short, because I don't think it deserves any more time out of my life than it has taken already. It seemed really promising in the first episode, but then it all went to hell by the second.\r\nSTORY - 2/10 - The plot ended up making almost no sense at all and it had SO MUCH POTENTIAL.\r\nWhy is there a specified number of hours on a Giftia to begin with? Is it a bug, or intentional? What kind of human makes slave-like robots capable of feeling emotion, and why wouldyou create them that way? Why are Giftias even necessary in their universe?\\n\\n\r\nI have barely scratched the surface. These are not very difficult questions, either. Why did the writers of this anime not address these SUPER glaring faults and instead fill time with unnecessary comedy to fill their time slot? How does comedy even make sense in this series? There I go asking questions again, and I bet that NONE of them will ever be addressed. It's really a shame that these flaws were overlooked. Even 10 minutes or so of backstory, scattered between episode even, could have saved the story element entirely.\\n\\n\r\nArt - 7/10 - Sure, the art was nice. I'm sure you know that already, and seeing as though Aniplex made this, it should be expected. Most well-done part of the show for sure.\\n\\n\r\nSound - 5/10 - The only thing that specifically caught my attention sound-wise was the intro theme. Everything else is forgettable at best.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 3/10 - This anime has very basic characters. You have your innocent protagonists, the jealous tsundere third wheel, and all the other characters are just... bleh. Not interesting at all, unfortunately. Isla was definitely the best character of the bunch, and seeing her evolve over the course of the show was pretty cool. Tsukasa, on the other hand, is just another familiar face.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 1/10 - When you make your show a ticking time bomb, you know it is bound to explode.\\n\\n\r\nAnd that is what happened here.\\n\\n\r\nAs much as I want to say I appreciated the smaller moments in the show, I end up remembering what the show is about in the first place, and it completely ruins the experience. There's always that thing nagging at the back of your mind that you cannot get out, and it will stay there right up till episode 13. This is a spoiler-free review, mind you, so I won't disclose that - but you will find out what it is MUCH too quickly.\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 4/10 - Giving this show a 4 is extremely painful. I absolutely loved the concept of the show, and to see it fail so badly is really sad. One of the hugest issues of the show is the pacing and poor use of airtime. If I were to rewrite the show, I would put the episodes roughly in this order, from first to last:\\n\\n\r\n1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 2, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12 13.\\n\\n\r\nNow, obviously you would not want to watch them in this order as it stands. But if you consider all the main plot points, the path of the show becomes much more clear as it transitions from unusual romance story to edge-of-your-seat drama. This episode order builds up an immense amount of suspense, rather than the poor use of time Aniplex decided upon. I actually have no idea why they would spoil something so early in episode 2. Call me crazy, I suppose.\\n\\n\r\nSee ya next time.\\n",

Okay, what a hole! And on top of that the whole retrieval process is very crude and devastating. I understand privacy issues and all that but why would you tell your android your personal information? They shouldn't have to to watch if they don't want to.\r\nGoods: Story is very solid other than what's listed above, I like the foreshadowing from thestart. Pretty predictable and don't have to jump through loops to figure it out. So it's either make or break, they let you know from the start if you want to continue or not. The romance between the two MCs is very adorable and pure. And the build up for the ending is amazing too.\\n\\n\r\nArt 10/10\\n\r\nIt has a very fresh art style that most animes should start following honestly.\\n\\n\r\nSound 6/10 \\n\r\nDidn't too much care for the OP or Ending I don't look at stuff like that so I always give a low score.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 9/10\\n\r\nStrangers, Friends, then Couple. You've gotta remember the story is about Isla and Tsukasa. And their development toward each other. When you have that in mind, hence the reason for my score. You'll see when you watch it.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 10/10\\n\r\nIf I didn't work a 10-5 job, I would have binge watched this show. You have no idea. I loved every moment!\\n\\n\r\nOverall 10/10\\n\r\nIt's a fresh romance series, with new feelings and a different adventure. And they did everything right. If you like short romantic animes. This is 100% for you like I said, and if you're looking for something a little more slower paced and longer. Don't waste your time.\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "It's been awhile since I last reviewed an anime and I had my own way of reviewing it, but this time I'll go for something new.\r\nHave you ever watched an anime and after finishing it, you think to yourself, I should've not watched it. Most people will interpret that because I said this, the anime will be bad. The only reason I regret watching this anime is because of all the feels I'm getting right now at 2 am in the morning, just after finishing Plastic Memories.\r\nThough the story had some similarities to other anime that was frequently mentioned in the site I watched itin, it still did pretty well. The story started off quick and introduced almost all of the side/main characters. You would expect a first episode to be all happy and that, but as a man, it almost made me cry because of how sad the ending of the first episode was. There isn't any violence/gore for you anime-watchers who aren't into that kind of stuff. Rather, this anime focuses more on comedy, romance and making you cry because of how sad it is. Sometimes the story will drag, but that's because they don't want you bursting your tears out in the first 5 episodes. A bit of sadness, then happiness, then sadness again. It was slightly funny for me, but that's mostly because of how random it is or the faces the characters make during some scenes. Though, some parts of the story need to be covered more.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is actually one of the best I've seen in a while, though that's to be expected from an anime illustrated this year. Colours are bright to catch the eye of the viewer, not too dull and the choice of colours used are superb. Some people say graphics is not what's most important when playing a video game, or watching a film, but would you want your viewers to decide whether that 2 by 2 pixel in front of them is a cat or a dog?\\n\\n\r\nSound quality was pretty good, but I wouldn't be able to judge a lot of it mainly because I listened to the anime with headphones that have 1 side working. The piano OST playing in the background actually makes the scene more emotional or maybe relaxing. For me, sometimes I could see if the anime is sad or happy by the choice of the OP the anime uses, and for this one I could tell it was sad. Nothing special about the ED, just cheerful music playing.\\n\\n\r\nOoh, characters. For me, character development was probably the best thing about the characters (wut). At the start, some of the characters were very unlikeable but as the anime progressed, they became very likeable, because of what they do to help the main character. The only character that wasn't very special for me was probably Tsukasa. He's too much of a wuss. He needs to man the fuck up, suck it up and move on, fix the issue. Isla was somewhat of an uphill-downhill-uphill development. I liked her at the beginning, then she started being a bit of a bitch (expected in a romance anime) but she progressively got a bit more likeable after. In my opinion, Zack was probably one of my most liked character, because of his \"cool\" and \"I don't give 2 shits what's happening\" attitude.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyed this anime A LOT. I was watching the 2nd season of To-Love Ru Darkness and I saw the cover of the anime. Looked at the genres and immediately saw \"comedy\" and \"romance\". I had to watch it, so I decided to watch it on my phone. Staying up to about 3 am to watch episodes of this anime was a bit fun, but headaches aren't the next morning. Also, there is a cliff hanger that would irritate everyone because of how important of why they should reveal it. Season 2 plz.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, a 9/10. If you can control your audiences' emotions just by using story, art and voice acting, then you have done something right. The emotions you want to pull out are mainly happiness, sadness, goosebumps or curiosity. If it's anger, then you've done something wrong. Would I re-watch this? You might as well ask me if I should re watch Angel Beats! (yes I would re watch definitely).",

I'm really glad I didn't skip this one.\r\nThere are constant reminders throughout the series that give you a sort of reality check of whats to come, but you cant help but to continue watching. Isla is a sweetheart and you cant help but fall in love with her character right off the bat. The characters are all enjoyable to watch and the story is very pleasant. \r\nYou should watch this anime if your in a very relaxed mood and youare willing to overlook potentially missed opportunities for plot development. There are not very many holes, but if you nit pick you will find them. In truth, I did not notice them until after I had my cool down period because I was just so sucked in to the story. Give it a shot. If by episode 3 your not hooked, then try something else, but definitely dont skip this one if you can help it.",

            "content": "I knew what I was getting into when I signed up to watch this one. People all over told me what I was getting into, and yet I still wandered in. What I found was a bit more than originally met the eye.\r\nFirst off, the overall premise has been of particular fascination to me for a good few years. I had always wondered in the back of my mind what the world would be like with such human-like machines, and what the technical limitations might be. Those sorts of premises had been well-used in science fiction for decades, and yet everyone seems to gloss overwhat downsides might come of it. That's where this series really shines, in showcasing that.\\n\\n\r\nIf I had to bring up one complaint, it would be that the tone seems a bit confused sometimes. In some instances you'll have a real heartstring-tugger followed by some comic relief that wouldn't really be out of place in any other slice of life series. Sometimes this can negate the emotional punch a scene might be supposed to pack, but other than that I was really quite satisfied.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, what we have here is a series that runs with a bit more depth than one would assume based on what the consensus says. The premise is great, the characters are easy to get behind and relate to, the style is quite pleasing, and at the end of the day, it hooks the viewer, leaves them wanting more. And isn't that what a good series should do?",

In fact, there are no visual differences at all, ever. There's very little separating the androids from people except an arbitrary limited lifespan that's shorter than humans for no reason than to create drama. Besides the androids, there are no technologies that truly change daily life in the setting.\r\nIn short, don't watch this show because you want to watch a sci-fi.\r\nIf you still want to look into it, instead of the normal three episode test, you shouldn't haveto watch anything beyond the first episode to understand the atmosphere and execution of the rest of the series. It plays out like a slice-of-life anime and ends with a tragic love story. I have to applaud the show for setting their slice-of-life in an office building instead of a high school but that's about all I can really compliment it on.\\n\\n\r\nThere are a couple moments meant to make you cry, but they feel cheap. Just like a terminal illness is a bad writer's crutch when they want to create drama.\\n\\n\r\nIn any case, I'd recommend finding something else to watch.",

I expected the story will progress by showing a series of dramatic retrievals of Giftias being attached to their owners. The first few episodes went like that, but halfway I felt it actually went in a different way. \r\nIt could've been better I thought. \r\nThe idea of romance is nice. I like the main problem of the story which is that you can't stay with your loved one forever since they are certain circumstancesdifferent worlds experience that makes the viewer feel the feels. Unfortunately, I felt that I didn't feel the futuristic atmosphere in the anime, like there is no distinction between Giftias and humans. It could've been better when at some point, they objected the idea of romance between Giftias or humans since they are two different concepts. I felt that the main circumstance of the anime is that the fact that they can't be together for a long time since there is a time limit before Isla is going to be retrieved. It could be the same way in a slice of life setting, wherein two lovers can't be together since the girl has an incurable disease, and they have this time limit to enjoy their precious moments. I felt the impact of Sci-fi is not that strong for me to appreciate it. The problem with Sci-fi genres is that you can't make it a sub-genre or if you're going to add sci-fi in your anime, it should be the main impact of your anime. The romance of the anime is nice, atleast it could've been better if they mixed it with a slice of life setting.\\n\\n\r\nI recommend this anime if you like tragic love stories or if you like the feels of being unable to love someone due to time and to those people who think time is such a cruel entity.",

            "content": "Plastic Memories, I feel as if Episode 1 sets you up, basically saying Here is the tip of the iceberg, everything from here is more and more sad. Episode one does a very good job at introducing the show, and showing what type of show it will be.\r\nThe Story:\r\nThe Story is in my mind, one of the best I've seen, there is no overall antagonist, it is literally just about Tsukasa, Isla, and the rest Terminal Service. The story gets better and better with every episode you watch, and It almost feels as if they show you sad events as if only to prepare youfor the ultimate sad event at the End.\\n\r\nWhile the Story is extremely sad, it is sad in a happy way, meaning it is only sad because it was so happy. The music Does a very great job at giving this feel.\\n\\n\r\nThe Music:\\n\r\nYokoyama Masaru, does the majority of the music, and does a extremely good job at it. With the tracks like, Memories, The fact of the Depression, bye, and of course the track that was done with Melody Chubak, again & again, shows just what the album has to offer. Again & again, the lyrics themselves are a happy message, the singer sounds happy, but the tune and melody are rather sad, and the song itself leaves you almost sad, but at the same time happy. The Fact of the depression is another great track which shows you that there are more then just sad, happy, and peaceful songs, as the song itself makes you feel as if something bad has happened, or as if you just received horrible news.\\n\r\nOver all the music does a great job adding to the show, and is great to just listen too.\\n\\n\r\nThe Characters:\\n\r\nWell, we have our Main character, Tsukasa, and the secondary main character, Isla. Tsukasa felt relatable, in the sense you could feel what he was feeling, or at least understand why he was feeling the way he was. He also is rather a cheery person which only adds to the inevitable sad ending.\\n\r\nIsla is an interesting character, while at first look Isla comes off cold, her character becomes more and more lovable as the anime goes on, she herself changes, and we later learn why she is the way she is, which makes her character relatable, if not at least understandable.\\n\r\nThen we have the main supporting cast. Michiru, Zack, Kazuki, and Constance.\\n\r\nMichiru is kind of a Tsundere in the sense she gives Tsukasa a hard time about everything, often insulting him, but is shown to have a soft side with her friends.\\n\r\nZack, is Michiru's Marksmen at the terminal service, and likes to lightly tease Michiru, and Tsukasa.\\n\r\nKazuki plays a rather important role, as does Michiru, but there is not really much to say about either without spoiling. Kazuki gives everyone a rough time, especially Tsukasa, as she cares for Isla greatly.\\n\r\nConstance is Kazuki's Marksmen, and is a rather reserved person, and he tends to be the best one with giving advice, from what we see.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nWell, The show does a good job at making most characters relate-able, or at least understandable, which makes them more connectable.\\n\r\nThe story is well thought out, and very well executed.\\n\r\nThe Characters were enjoyable, and the story left me wanting more, but satisfied at the same time. I recommend this anime to anyone.\\n",

            "content": "There's been a current trend within the anime community, whenever an anime is \"feelsy\" it's guaranteed to be \"10/10 flawless, nothing can compare\" and while this may be true for some anime such as Clannad, there are others which have \"feelsy\" elements but are not executed well, I say this because Plastic Memories fits in the latter. While having an interesting premise set up for a lot of drama the execution is questionable. \r\nStory\r\nSet in the future, technology has advanced so far society has created artificial intelligence known as Giftia. While Giftias are very humanlike in both appearance and personality the problem is their shortlife span only being a little over 9 years. After their expiration date they become 'Wanderers' essentially being killing machines. Our story follows Tsukasa and Giftia Isla as they work for a terminal agency that shuts down these Giftias before their expiration date to ensure they don't become Wanderers.  While the premise is interesting and set up for feels there is one problem that bothers me, why would that be allowed? I mean especially since people are reluctant to give up their Giftias cause they treat them like family there should be an army of these things destroying the city because some people are too stubborn and to in love with their Giftias, according to the anime this has only happened once which I find hard to believe but nitpicking aside the story is still ok. I like the premise and the first episode did a good job introducing the world but the major problem is the inconsistent tone the show is giving; one minute it's a drama, next is comedy, next is romance, next is freaking Psycho Pass. I am being serious there's an episode that is pretty much Psycho Pass. With this inconsistent tone that the show gives me I found it hard to immerse myself with the story, I wasn't sure at times whether to laugh or to emote because at one point where it's serious it then turns into a comedy. I do think this show has potential despite that nitpick I made earlier and feel like it would be more effective if it was an episodic series. Instead the show uses its premise to tell a pretty generic romance story and though while having development it's not anything to be amazed about in my opinion because this kind of thing has be heavily done before in the romance genre. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters\\n\r\nThis is probably my biggest problem with the show the characters suck with the exception of Isla and Zack. The main character Tsukasa is your typical generic male romance protagonist being pretty beta and experiencing love at first sight with Isla. My main issue is the show uses this to execute anime cliches all over the place because his character is beta as fuck. I don't want an arrogant protagonist but the cliche's were so frustrating to get through with this guy and there was nothing that made him unique to be a main character other than to fill in the main character role. This also goes for most characters, they all generally fit some generic trope to an extreme like Michiru is the tsundere, Kazuki is the overprotective mature one, Eru's the energetic one with the speech habit etc. etc. While these characters have backstories I wouldn't say it's enough to justify their general character because this show likes to constantly remind me how generic they are especially Michiru. It feels like the show writers were just ticking off a list of characters that they thought need to be in the anime and decided to rarely work on them. Isla is probably the only decent one because she shows development, starting off as a kuudere but actually develops her own character which is a plus and I only like Zack because he fucked with everyone which entertained me because I hated mostly everyone. \\n\\n\r\nPresentation (Animation and sound) \\n\r\nThe animation probably the best thing about this anime, I'm not entirely for the whole 'moe' appeal that the show tries to give off to some characters like Isla but even so this anime looks good and has a nice style to it, I'd say that a lot of people will most likely appreciate the art style. The soundtrack on the other hand for me was barely noticeable including the opening and the ending. \\n\\n\r\nConclusion\\n\r\nThis show had potential and in my opinion could have been something better but it decided instead to use it's premise to deliver a generic romance story with 'feels' and just because it has 'feels' doesn't mean it's instantly amazing. The execution is incredibly inconsistent and the characters are incredibly generic that I can't see this show as amazing. There is some enjoyment to be had and if you enjoy your romance stories then go ahead and check it out but if you're looking for something to watch in general I wouldn't recommend this. \\n\\n",

The opening is something that i caught myself humming throughout watching the show. If you're looking for a love story that will make you feel then this may be a good anime for you. I cried for the last three episodes because of the story and because it was coming to an end.  The character development and pacing of story help to capture the emotions that the characters are feeling. The anime also has good supporting charactersthat you grow to love. If i could improve anything, it would probably be the length of the anime (like most good anime). If you have the slightest interest in watching this anime, follow your instinct and just give it a chance.",

            "content": "\"Error, I couldn't catch that.\" Gotta start using that :V\r\nWell, to begin with, this anime turned out to be something completely DIFFERENT from what I've imaged. It says to be a human/technology (robots I guess e.e) kind of anime and it wasn't bad, it's just that... I expected it to be different but oh well. \r\nJust so you know!! NOPE it's not about I don't know, adventure/mystery/action kind of anime. It has far more romance than everything else and it's cute in a way just as I stated before, NOT expecting that e.e \r\nsorry, I guess I'm still in shock xD e.e \r\nThe art isreally nice as it's a modern anime. The characters are well formed with different personalities and that bipolar kind of person in every anime xD\\n\r\nI honestly feel so bad as this anime never made me cry like everyone else was TnT Just the first episode or second (can't remember) I was about to cry but not the way Clannad or Kanon made me cry ;A;\\n\\n\r\nYES! This is a sad anime so unless you are a rock like me, YOU WILL CRY.\\n\r\nThe story itself is well interesting... I don't know, I was expecting it to be different. Not that I'm complaining, I did the decision to watch it ._. \\n\\n\r\nIf you've watched the Beat Angels or something like that (a sadddd anime), it's something like that. Someone Has To Die. I found it most interesting like half the anime, there's a develop in the story and characters grow and you obviously get to know more about them. \\n\\n\r\nYou should give a try if you're into romantic/sad kind of animes xD Well of course there's more to it but I'd say that's what it's mostly about c: \\n\\n\r\nWatch charlotte if you watch this one, they're almost like the same thing but the other one is more interesting xD :D",

            "content": "Perfect anime for those who like tear jerker dramas; Well, that would be the first impression anyone would get after reading the synopsis, but even if you are afraid of crying, this anime would prove to be worth watching it. This anime will be filled with some sad and bittersweet stories, but most of these have very beautiful and meaningful messages. The plot of this anime was in general really good, but, for some people including me, it lost its quality towards the end. \r\nAt the beginning, it could be said that the anime focused on the lives of other people, and not directly onthe main characters. Basically, the main characters will meet other people and thus we will get to know their individual stories. Those episodes were really great. I almost cried with some, but that just shows how good they were to engage the viewers or at least me. Human need for affection and the fear of losing someone close are the main topics of the episodes of this anime. Good episodes with very deep messages were built around those two ideas, which even if the endings were not the happiest they would offer some hope and show the bright side of everything that happened.\\n\\n\r\nI did not enjoy the last part of the anime that much. Do not get me wrong, the ending was not that bad. However, this anime which had some really nice tear jerking stories, became a romance story. Romance, well, there is nothing wrong with a little romance. The problem with the romance on this story was that it got to a point that it was a bit too ridiculous; I mean, a romance story could not get any cheesier than this one.  Also, perhaps another reason why I did not like this part of the anime is that the story focused on the main characters. Well, that sounds a bit stupid, but to be honest the main characters were not that likable. \\n\\n\r\nThe main characters in my opinion were not that great. I got to admit that I loved Isla and her clumsiness at the beginning, but eventually it got old. Tsukasa was not such a great character from the start. If I were to describe him I would say crybaby, useless most of the time, wimp... Anyway, why watch an anime where the main characters are not that good; well, like I said before, the first part of the anime focused on the lives of other people (Secondary characters). Those characters were really good, and it was their stories that made this a good anime. Background stories and the conclusion of the stories of the secondary characters were always entertaining and satisfying.\\n\\n\r\nAnyway, I think overall this anime is good. It has some really nice ideas, and some of the stories are well executed. I might have been a bit disappointed about some aspects of the anime, but it had some really good and strong messages.\\n\\n",

            "content": "Plastic Memories was one of the many anime\u2019s that was anticipated in the Spring 2015 season. Spring 2015 had so many good shows that Plastic Memories needed to be great in order to stand out, did it? Probably not.\r\nThe premise was one that I had never seen in a long time. In the show, humans have invented \u2018Giftia\u2019s, androids that have emotions and feelings just like humans. They can laugh, cry, have emotional pain, and they can have relationship with others too. Giftias are so human-like to the extent that they can be part of someone\u2019s family when a loved one is lost: they canbe a daughter or son, a helper in a workshop, a parent or guardian, and even a lover! There is a catch however; Giftias have a fixed lifespan of 81920 hours, which is about 9 1/3 of a year. And after that period of time they would start to break down. This is where our heroes come in, the retrieval team. These people come to \u2018retrieve\u2019 or to take away the Giftias that are on the verge of their expiration date.\\n\\n\r\nAfter reading the synopsis, few questions might pop out, should you make memories with someone that is going to be gone for good? Or would you distant yourself to avoid hurting both you and your loved one? Why would you love someone when you know that they would go away? Plastic Memories shine in these aspects, as you can see how different people react upon being contacted by the retrieval team to take back the Giftias, which are not just robots or androids but have become someone important in their lives. Some try to run away, some are always in denial, some have already prepared for the worst, these are very real emotions that shows how we react in the real world as well, when we know someone is going to be taken away? How would we react?\\n\\n\r\n        Time to introduce the characters, despite the unique premise, the characters are not. We have the main character, Tsukasa who is the all-round nice guy and tries his best for the people he cares about, we usually use the word nice when we don\u2019t really have anything to say about him, and he\u2019s just that, nice. We also have Isla who is the kuudere type of girl, and always distances herself from other people, not to mention she also have the cute girl doing cute things trope as well, as she is pretty nervous and confused when doing certain things. These two characters have the most character development, which is not saying much. I can\u2019t even remember all the side character\u2019s name because of how one dimensional they are. You have the tsundere, the big-breasted girl, the boss who always gets drunk, and so on and so forth. Plastic Memories is not very strong in its characters, but the show is all about Tsukasa and Isla and how their relationship goes, *minor spoiler***     Isla is a Giftia, which means she has a limited life span, you probably know which direction the show will take after knowing this.  End of spoiler ***\\n\\n\r\nThis show had lots and lots of potential; however so many overused tropes are thrown in it that it became a generic slice-of-life sometimes, it also had moments where the show looked like it didn\u2019t know which direction to take. Another thing that bugged me was due to it being a 13 episode anime, the Giftia concept was not fleshed out completely, we do not know why the Giftias break down, we don\u2019t know whether humans are trying to think of a way to stop these Giftias from breaking down to avoid breaking the hearts of their loved ones that are left behind. Another logical question is what kind of masochist would want to have a friendship/relationship with someone that they know would die in less than 10 years!\\n\\n\r\nDespite saying this show has characters/concepts that have not been fleshed out and they might need more episodes. I personally think Plastic Memories could have been a movie instead, as some episodes look like some stand-still waiting for something emotional to happen, it\u2019s like watching an anime that you know has the feels but you have to wait for 1-2 episodes for the \u2018feels\u2019 moment to come. \\n\\n\r\nFor those looking for unique scientific concepts like Stein\u2019s ; Gate, you\u2019re out of luck. This show focuses more on how people cope with the loss when the Giftias are taken away from their lives\\n\\n\r\nPlastic Memories is definitely one of the \u2018feels\u2019 anime out there, but I don\u2019t think it would be one where it could rip your heartstrings to shreds like some anime do, having only 13 episodes it still made me felt emotional at its teary moments as I became attached to the main characters, but not to the extent where I might feel depressed for a few days.\\n\r\nPlastic memories is a great anime for newcomers too, it is not too weird of a concept, its premise is very refreshing, fan service is there but not overwhelming, and it is one that hits home if you are the emotional type. Though the tropes are there, but someone needs to introduce the tropes sooner or later.\\n\\n\r\nTL,DR : Touchy anime that has character development flaws besides the main characters ,has a very good premise that wasn\u2019t fleshed out enough, a good show to see if you want to challenge yourself to the \u2018feels\u2019 but don\u2019t want to cry your eyeballs out.\\n\\n",
