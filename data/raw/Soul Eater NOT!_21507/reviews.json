            "content": "*Minor spoilers ahead*\r\nWhat is Soul Eater Not supposed to be? Is it a yuri slice-of-life made to appeal to people unfamiliar with the original Soul Eater, or is it a necessary part of the Soul Eater canon, aimed at those who enjoyed the action and drama of the original series? The answer to that question remains a mystery. I'm not even convinced the author of the manga understands what he's working on. \r\nSoul Eater Not is an exercise in mediocrity. It is a gust of wind with no particular destination. By jumping from genre to genre and trying to appeal to both the slice-of-life crowdand fans of the original series, it ends up pleasing neither. The end result is something that, while not offensively dumb, lingers in the mind with no more than passing apathy. I doubt anyone will remember its existence after a year. Even half that time might seem generous. \\n\\n\r\nThe first few episodes were promising enough. It didn't seem like it would make any impact in the industry or do anything particularly interesting, but it was fun nonetheless to watch the banter between the innocent protagonist, Tsugumi, and her two companions, Meme (think Yui from K-ON) and Anya (the tsundere ojou-sama). The unique setting of the Soul Eater franchise even gave 'Not' its own distinct identity in the sea of indistinguishable slice-of-life, and hey, it did its job just fine in the moe department. There was no drama, no deep themes or underlying message, and that was OK. For the first half, Soul Eater Not is actually a fairly decent slice-of-life anime. \\n\\n\r\nAnd then everything turns upside down in the seventh episode. The main three are off shopping, fooling around as they always do, and then from nowhere comes a generic villain who attempts to murder one of the side characters in gory fashion, throat slicing and all. Uhh... all right, then. What's supposed to come as a shock instead brings confusion and frustration. It almost feels as if the script was suddenly hijacked by a different team of writers. There is no consistency, no purpose in this except perhaps for a vague thought of \"Well, I guess it's time to add in some drama so Soul Eater fans don't get bored.\" In reality, all that was accomplished was both sides of the audience being alienated. \\n\\n\r\nThe melodrama is guilty of more than just existing. It is terribly written, every scene reeking of some eye-rolling clich\u00e9. Even the accident at the end of the seventh episode is written off as inconsequential, the story awkwardly shifting back into yuri comedy just minutes into the next episode. The drama itself is so boring that falling asleep becomes a more exciting prospect, because, hell, how are we supposed to immediately empathise with characters who previously were only used for gags and fanservice? After trudging through the predictable 'one of the main characters is now possessed by evil!' clich\u00e9, the final episode treats the viewer with a full dose of stupid: said character comes back to reality with a kiss and the group then defeats the powerful villain (who they do not have the combat ability to even defend themselves against) with the indomitable power of friendship! Please. I want to puke.\\n\\n\r\nAmong Not's many issues is its clumsily-written romance. The fourth episode has Tsugumi falling for Akane, one of the few male characters, merely because he threw a few suave words her way. It's never explained whether Akane feels anything for Tsugumi, and of course nothing ever comes of the romance either. It's actually completely forgotten by the next episode. I guess one way of explaining it would be that the manga's later chapters are meant to focus on the two's romance, but even then it shouldn't be completely discarded and brought up again whenever the author feels it's convenient. It's doubly awkward since the author doesn't even know whether he wants to pair Tsugumi with Akane or one of the two girls; it haphazardly alternates between heterosexual romance and yuri. All of it just feels very out-of-place-- a lot like the drama.\\n\\n\r\nOn the plus side, there are plenty of cameo appearances with the cast of the main series. They don't add more than a few lines of dialogue here and there, though, so don't expect another adventure with Soul or Death the Kid. I suppose it's always neat to see what they were doing behind the scenes. \\n\\n\r\nWith regards to the sound and artwork, Soul Eater Not does not offend the eyes and ears but it never hits any high points, either. It looks okay. It sounds okay. The only issue is that the unique, paint-like art style of the main series is missing here, so those who enjoyed Soul Eater for its visual design will be quite disappointed. The opening theme is pretty nice, though. It's overwhelmingly cute and mirrors the fluffiness of the anime's first half. The OP was almost like a glimmer of hope in the show's unpleasant final episodes. \\n\\n\r\nIt's difficult for me to recommend Soul Eater Not because, well... who would I recommend it to in the first place? Soul Eater fans? They will be bored with the yuri of the show's first half. Slice-of-life fans? They will be frustrated with the tiresome melodrama of the second half. Critics? Well, maybe if they enjoy yelling at their monitor. \\n\\n\r\nSoul Eater Not is an anime that doesn't really please anyone. It is not quite awful, but it also exerts no effort to be more than just a passing, colourless breeze. It's the kind of show that comes and goes every single season. It is destined to fade away, lonely and forgotten.",

            "content": "The title \"Soul Eater NOT!\" should give you a warning if you're coming to this show expecting an action shonen like Soul Eater. It's exactly as it says it is, for the most part, its NOT Soul Eater. But does it NOT being Soul Eater make it automatically bad? Not at all. This is a fun experience and definitely a worthy prequel to Soul Eater, even if its not quite the same. \r\nStory(7)\r\nIf you didn't already know, the whole concept of Soul Eater is about these kids that to go a school where they learn to basically fight witches and other evil. Every living personhas a soul and depending on your connection with your soul, determines how good a fighter you are, essentially. Certain people have the ability to transform into weapons. Other students wield these weapons and they partner up to fight evil.\\n\\n\r\nWhere as the original Soul Eater focused on pro students at the school that go on missions and leave the school quite frequently, Soul Eater Not focuses more on the newcomers of the NOT class. The story revolves around 3 cute girls that go to the school. Tsugumi is a weapon. Meme and Anya are misters and they both want to partner up with Tsugumi. The only problem is, you're only supposed to have ONE mister at a time, not two for one weapon. Nonetheless, the group befriend each other and leave that problem for later. \\n\\n\r\nNow most people are very quick to judge this show for its complete change of style, both visually and genre wise. The whole first half of the show if not longer, other than the lore, its essentially nothing like Soul Eater at all and takes on the more \"Moe Slice of Life\" role similar to shows K-ON! or Yuru Yuri rather than an action show like Soul Eater. The show is even categorized as an Ecchi, though the fanservice here is relatively minimal to non existent at all. The show at first definitely isn't Soul Eater, but again, its not trying to be. \\n\\n\r\nWhile it is very similar to other Slice of Life Moe shows does that mean its quite as good as them? I'd say no. The slice of life portions here are fine but shows like K-ON handle this genre much better. However, what's here I don't think is bad and I really do appreciate because they help show what Soul Eater didn't: how one BECOMES one of the higher class students and what life is like BEFORE they go out adventuring. In many ways, I feel like this show introduced the whole concept of a series nicely, (though it has some what of my same problems I had with the original where they hardly showed them doing any actual school activities at all.)\\n\\n\r\nNear the end of the series, the story starts to pick up and it feels a lot more like Soul Eater. It transitions a lot more into an action show. Not only that, it also has a few connections to the original series that I think make this a nice prequel overall. \\n\\n\r\nArt(6)\\n\\n\r\nOne of the primary knee-jerk reactions to this show was how much the art style had changed from the original show. The original show had a very unique and funky art sort of art style to it. This one, while still remaining somewhat different to a lot of anime, is mostly a very generic, cute art style. \\n\\n\r\nNow many people see this as a negative, and to some degree I agree, but after a while I noticed that the original art style doesn't really suit this type of show, the same way this new one wouldn't suit the original. They're 2 different shows. While the old style was definitely better, this one works for this type of show and it's nice to see something a little different.\\n\\n\r\nSound(7)\\n\\n\r\nI like the opening and ending while the main BGM wasn't that memorable to me. Voice acting seems solid enough to me and I'm pretty sure most of the characters from the original cast have the same voice actors. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters(7)\\n\\n\r\nAs for the new characters here, they aren't as good or fleshed out as the ones from the original series, and while many would complain that they're very simple, I still enjoyed them I found them over all to be likable and fun. \\n\\n\r\nAs for the returning characters, their cameos are probably a lot of the appeal to fans of the original series, though certain characters get a lot more appearances than others. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment(8)\\n\\n\r\nOverall it kind of had a slow start but as a fan of both Soul Eater and Moe Slice of Life I enjoyed this series a decent amount, especially near the end. \\n\\n\r\nOverall(7)\\n\\n\r\nMany people label this show as a shameless attempt to cash in on the moe fanbase. Whether or not that statement is true, I personally still enjoyed this show. \\n\\n\r\nIf you're a fan of the original Soul Eater and also like or don't mind a moe slice of life type show, I'd say give it a shot.\\n\\n\r\nHowever if you're a fan of the original series and are looking for a more action oriented show and can't stand a cute premise like this, this show probably isn't for you.\\n\\n\r\nBut also if you haven't seen Soul Eater and are interested in watching it, I think this is a nice way to introduce you to the series as by the end, it does transition into a more action type show and answer a few questions of how things happened in the original series. But again, that's only if you're into a moe type of show as well. If you are only interested in Soul Eater, skip this and just watch that. You won't be missing anything TOO important at all.",

            "content": "Soul Eater was an okay show. Soul Eater NOT!, however, is NOT an okay show at all. Hell, even the title is a good indicator. You see the word NOT? Honestly I see it as a sign. Do NOT watch this show. It's NOT worth your time. It's NOT Soul Eater. Okay, let's just move on to the review. \r\nStory: 5/10\r\nThe story is just complete... meh. This girl discovers that she's a weapon, so she goes to this academy so she can sort herself out. She meets some friends and they have adventures together inside of the school. \r\nOkay, that's pretty bland. It pretty muchleaves you wondering, \"Wait, what the hell do they even do in this show then? Is this a slice-of-life?\" Yes, it is. You answered your own question. This is a slice-of-life. The setting isn't particularly bad, I'm not biased against the genre, it's just not very good, either. It doesn't really add anything more than what Soul Eater offered. In fact, I think it offers less than before. There is a conflict (and when I say conflict, I don't mean who ends up with the main character), but honestly it's just pushed to the side until the very last episode. It's like they actually want to make the show more boring for the longest time possible. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 7/10\\n\r\nThe art is nice. Everything's bright and bubbly; it fits perfectly well with the tone of this show. I preferred the old art style, but this one's still okay with me. I don't really have any complaints.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 6/10\\n\r\nThe soundtrack isn't memorable at all. Really I can only remember the opening, and I don't even like the opening all that much. I guess it serves its purpose, and there weren't really any pieces that stuck out to me, but that's the thing; there are none. There's nothing bad, sure, but nothing good either. The only compliment I can give is that it's not bad. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 3/10\\n\r\nThe characters are absolutely the worst part of this show. They're seriously bad. The main character is a clumsy ditz. That's her character. She's just clumsy. She's also the most sensible out of the three main characters, but considering the fact that they're all mental that's really not saying much. Then there's that girl with the big boobs. I can't even remember her name, I think it's Sena, but if you can only remember a character because of her big boobs, that's a big problem. 'Cause, guess what, Sena isn't special either. She's even more clumsy than the main character, and the main character is already pretty freaking clumsy. I think she has short term memory loss too or something. Finally, my least liked character, is that rich snobby girl. Oh yes, the girl that acts like a snob and she's rich. Great. We really needed this type of character. So really, all in all, the characters are boring, there's nothing interesting about them, they're incredibly cliche, there's nothing new that they add to their stereotype, they're just plain bad.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 3/10\\n\r\nUsually with slice-of-life shows, characters don't matter that much. Sure they might be horrible, but it doesn't matter if what they actually do or say is entertaining. Take for example K-ON. All of the characters in K-ON are trash. They're all boring. But, put them in a funny situation, and suddenly K-ON is somewhat nice. Soul Eater NOT!, however, does not do this. They put them in incredibly boring scenarios, and then you have even more boring characters, and what do you get? An incredibly boring show. Sure, mix in some ecchi now and then. That's really gonna reel me in. I think somehow they predicted that Soul Eater NOT! was going to be a horrible show, so they just said, \"**** it, let's just make them lesbians. Who gives a ****!\" And now, along with boring characters, they're now presented with more horrible and unfunny jokes. I honestly gave up in the middle of it. And then I went back after I decided that I might as well finish it. Now, I'm not going to say that that was one of the worst decisions of my life, but it was possibly one of the worst decisions of my life. \\n\\n\r\nOverall:3/10\\n\r\nOverall, Soul Eater Not!, like I said, is not worth your time. The story is average at best while adding nothing new, the soundtrack isn't memorable, the characters are absolute trash, and the comedy is nonexistant. I found nothing funny about this show, except for maybe how hilariously bad this show is. No, really; it's that bad. Take a shot for every time one of the main characters start blushing because of some stupid yuri crap and sooner or later you'll end up in the bathroom of a Denny's. The only, and the only, good thing I can say about this show is the art. It's actually somewhat good. Too bad I can't say the same for, hmm I don't know, literally everything else in the show. Please don't watch this show.",

            "content": "Alright so first let me get rid of the fact that this is taking place as a Soul Eater spin-off and that Soul Eater is even apart of the title because honestly, to be fair the title does say \"Soul Eater NOT\" so the thing you should expect is for it to be NOT soul eater. However I'm not gonna judge it based on that fact, I'm gonna be judging it as an anime as a whole and not some side series to an awesome shounen anime. I'll probably spoil a lot by the way. Grab some popcorn and sit down because I have alot to say. \\n\\n\r\nThe Story (2/10) (Prepare for a butt-ton)\\n\\n\r\nSo before some of you start trying to point fingers at me, I will say right now that the story for this anime was most unexpected. What I expected from this anime was a sorta action, shounen thing going on except from the perspective of the main characters being female teens, I mean after all, the genre does say action and shounen right, to my surprise the first episode actually made me believe that was going to be true as well however, episode 2 is where it all went downhill. Now I am not a fan of slice of life anime such as K-on or Lucky Star at all, I think they are dreadfully boring and nothing but girls screwing around doing random crap amongst themselves, having real life random conversations. I do believe the point of anime is to escape reality, so when I see an anime taking place in an unrealistically awesome place such as Death Weapon Meister Academy, the last thing you'd expect to see is the main action of the anime being the main characters planting pumpkins, going shopping and getting jobs as being maids at Death Bucks Cafe, a lot of this anime is just of them doing regular girl teenage stuff given the environment around them isn't normal at all, the things they do are just too normal for the setting. \\n\\n\r\nNow unlike Lucky Star and other SOL animes, there is an actual plot in Soul Eater Not however, I wouldn't necessarily call it \"Good\" in any way due to the fact that the pacing behind this so called \"Plot\" is god awful, here's my brief summary of the plot pacing: Main girl almost gets killed by witch, goes to get a maid job. Main girl gets attacked by mind controlled man, Fanservicey Physical Exams and Pool Cleaning time! Girl slices her fucking neck open right in front of the main girl, plants pumpkins! I don't think shit like this mixes together at all in my opinion, even when the serious stuff like that does happen, its very brief and barely lasts before going back to the screwing around style, barely any of the story is really explained. It's like just when you think the story is actually about to pick up it slaps a big NOPE in your face.\\n\\n\r\n The last few episodes didn't have much screwing around as it finally started to fully pick up on the background story that the first 9 episodes barely had but there was one problem here, it wasn't the main characters that were involved in the main pick up of the story, it was two side characters that got into the action as the main characters had their own little personal troubles to deal with like Meme being possessed, Anya being escorted back to her home and Tsugumi hurting her leg. Alright so why is the whole show based around these characters then? I know I failed to mention why all them ran into these problems but honestly I don't even care enough to explain. What I will mention though is that near the end, finally Tsugumi and Anya fixed their problems (with the shounen ways of friendship) and now wanna get Meme back from the clutches of the evil antagonist. Oh Yeah! By the way, there's an evil person behind the story, almost forgot. Haha must of not been important enough, maybe if they explained who she was a little better or why she is trying to kill everyone or just something, anything that would make me care to remember at all. The show ends in the most bs and predictable way possible however I won't spoil that much, you'll probably see it coming though. \\n\\n\r\n That was a lot of typing so I'm hoping you got the main reason of why I think this story sounds like it was made by some 12 year old writing a bad Soul Eater fan-fic.\\n\\n\r\nThe Art (6/10)\\n\r\nI'm not gonna say the art is necessarily bad or anything but I'm not gonna say that I liked it. Personally I didn't like it because it made all the soul eater original series characters look like tools but I'll be lying if I said it didn't look polished and clean. Some awkward animation quirks here and there, action scenes really aren't the best either but I wouldn't write it off as \"bad\"\\n\\n\r\nThe sound (8/10) \\n\r\nThe first time I heard that damn opening I just couldn't stop listening to it xD I found it very catchy. The ending theme wasn't my cup of tea but overall the soundtracks in the actual show were nice and fit the moods of the situations. The JP voice actors were also very good at portraying the voices of the characters, especially Anya, they got the snobby rich girl voice right. \\n\\n\r\nThe Characters (1/10)\\n\r\nTwo words, One dimensional. One dimensional characters can be described as characters that have a set personality trait and right from episode 1 you can see that they set up these personality traits like they stamped it on their fucking foreheads. You got your nice but insecure girl Tsugumi. You got your busty air headed girl Meme and you got your snobby tsundere rich girl Anya. Character development is near non-existent, these personality traits stick throughout the entire show. Hell a side character named Kim got more character development then any of the main characters and even that was scarce. I can maybe see some people enjoying the personalities they have but I am not one of those people. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (2/10) \\n\r\nDid I enjoy Soul Eater Not? Yes I did! I enjoyed the parts that didn't include the main characters. I enjoyed the parts that included these two guy side characters and the soul eater main series characters. However since the amount of screen time these characters got ranged around 15 minutes in this entire 12 episodes series, that is not a good thing. To sum it up, I barely enjoyed Soul Eater Not. I didn't like the main characters at all and I didn't like the way they portrayed the show. It was boring. I found myself drifting off while watching it very often. \\n\\n\r\nOverall (3/10)\\n\r\nYou could say I rated this show based on personal preference of anime. If you prefer the kind of anime where there are girls screwing and around doing shit all then by all means I recommend it. If you're like me and don't wanna watch a show that includes girls fooling around, doing barely anything in a place called Death Weapon Meister Acedemy, which by the way I don't think I saw in any point of this anime of them actually training as weapons and meisters but correct me if I'm wrong, then I do not recommend this show as it will just make you love and miss the original Soul Eater series even more (that is if you watched it). Remember though, this is just my opinion and if you disagree that's perfectly okay. Sorta. I mean seriously in any aspect I look at this show I can't call it good. I can't call it good for being a slice of life anime but then again I never liked Slice of Life animes in this style however all I do know about a lot of Slice of Life fans is that they like it for its cute style, well frankly I didn't find it all that cute so I'm gonna throw that out there. I can't call it good for being a action/shounen/supernatural anime because it barely had any of that, maybe the shounen part. For the comedy part well, I didn't find it that funny, only part that made me giggle were the flat chested jokes they were throwing at Tsugumi. Overall 3/10 and I still think I'm being generous about giving it this score.\\n\\n\r\nSitting down every Tuesday to watch this felt like a chore, I thought about dropping this anime numerous times but as I did with K-on, I kept pushing through. Bored out of my mind, I finished. This will most likely be the last Slice of Life anime I watch (In the K-on style at least). Huh, funny. I keep calling it a Slice of Life yet it's not even listed as it's genre. Something must be wrong. Whelp that's my first review done, this was probably written poorly so hopefully I won't have to come across something like this show that I'll have the urge to review.",

            "content": "The original Soul Eater series was a shounen battle romp done right. It was zany, high-energy, and alternatingly funny and adrenaline pumping. It had a distinctive, colorful, and lively art-style that would make Tim Burton jealous, and an off-beat sensibility that separated it from most other shounen. It was a show that bled attitude; simultaneously unique and recognizable as a shounen title. The show is considered a classic of the late 2000\u2019s in some circles, and rightfully so. In stark contrast is its spin-off, Soul Eater NOT, a show that falls firmly into the conventions of its genre; in this case, slice-of-life anime (for themost part). Well, that\u2019s not entirely true, some of the magic that made the original such a blast is still there. However, it doesn\u2019t shine through nearly enough to overcome the decidedly over-treaded tropes that dominate the show. This is perhaps why Soul Eater NOT feels so lukewarm, and why it will likely be a disappointment fans of the original.\\n\\n\r\nThe show isn\u2019t bad for what it is trying to do, and certainly has some nifty things to offer. This spin-off takes place sometime before the main story, so some of the fun comes from seeing the original cast pop up and get a little insight on a few of them. We get to see Liz and Patty\u2019s edges soften as they go from hardened street thugs to the quirky sisters we know from the original Soul Eater series. It\u2019s also neat to see the beginning of Kim and Jacqueline\u2019s partnership, and why Sid is a zombie. However, the most important bit of information that the show offers is that not all the students in Death Weapon Meister Academy are badass fighters. Some weapons and meisters are just learning how to control their powers so they can live normal lives, these students are put into the NOT class.\\n\\n\r\nSome such students are the three heroines of the show: Tsugumi, Meme, and Anya. They\u2019re a rather odd trio in that Tsugumi is the only weapon of the three, while Meme and Anya are both meisters. Since partnerships usually consists of only one meister, though it can have multiple weapons, it\u2019s up to Tsugumi to choose who her partner will be. Of course, with Tsugumi being the archetypical nice yet indecisive heroine that she is, this is one of the central plot-lines of the show. Much of the show\u2019s duration is spent with the trio getting into misadventures and deepening their friendship, with appearances and cameos from the original cast sprinkled in. Needless to say, this means the show is largely light-hearted fair, with tons of silly shenanigans and a lot of quaint scenes of cute girls doing cute things, though of course it has some dramatic moments mixed in. Being set in as zany a place as DWMA, there is no shortage of strange situations for the girls to encounter or colorful personalities for them to meet. It\u2019s light and comfortable and has a quaint charm to it, unfortunately, it also greatly lacks inspiration. Tsugumi, Meme, and Anya are ultimately too plain of protagonists. They don\u2019t have the extremely distinctive quirks and personalities of the original\u2019s cast; it often feels like someone grabbed the protagonists of generic School Comedy A, and dropped them into the Soul Eater universe. The humor can often also come across as uninspired, not necessarily unfunny, but just too commonplace in slice-of-life anime. The material has a feeling of being done before multiple times, which diminishes the show\u2019s charm. It dilutes the twisted weirdness that made Soul Eater so appealing to begin with, watering it down into something inferior. At times, it honestly feels like a waste of the setting.\\n\\n\r\nOf course, this belonging to the franchise that it does, there is a plotline that involves fighting and nefarious schemes, lurking beneath the slice-of-life antics. Citizens of Death City are going on sprees of violence, under the control of a witch. Sid and other DWMA staff are trying to find the witch causing these attacks before things get worse, and while Tsugumi and her friends are blissfully unaware of the unseen threat, they soon find themselves right in the middle of it all. In stark contrast to the fluffiness of most of the show\u2019s material, this plotline is ominous and creepy. The tonal shift is honestly rather jarring, especially when an episode which is mostly contains light-hearted shenanigans has an eerie scene that has a threat written in what can only be assumed to be blood end the episode off. It doesn\u2019t gel well with the rest of the show\u2019s content because tonally it is on the opposite side of the spectrum. Which is sort of a shame, because the best part of the show is this darker plotline. Shaula, the younger sister of Medusa and Arachne from the first Soul Eater series, is a menacing presence. She lurks around in the shadows, plotting chaos and murder, so gleeful in her evil that it\u2019s almost infectious. The show always gets more interesting whenever she makes an appearance to disrupt the typical slice-of-life fluff, and it\u2019s her villainy that provides the show with its most striking and memorable moment: a day at the market that takes horrific turn. It also puts Tsugumi and her friends through an emotional wringer, giving their relationship some much needed conflict. Unfortunately, the show never strikes a balance to make the tones fit together, and it culminates in a less than spectacular final battle, at least for this franchise.\\n\\n\r\nOn the technical side of things, Soul Eater NOT is also a step down from the original series, but it\u2019s still a good looking show for the most part. Character designs are cutesier than before, which is certain to rub some fans the wrong way. However, the world retains the off-kilter and colorful outlandishness that makes it standout as unique, creepy laughing sun and all. The animation concerning characters\u2019 body language and behavior is pretty solid, however, action sequences are spotty. Some fights look good, some look average, and some look genuinely bad. Even at their best, the action sequences here never reach the exhilaration and excitement of those of the first series. The music is pleasant, fits the show tonally in both its silly and serious moments, and is used accordingly. However, it is just not a soundtrack that will be memorable or that supports the content in an exceptional way. It does its job, and little more than that.\\n\\n\r\nI\u2019ve compared Soul Eater NOT to its predecessor quite a bit in this review. While that might not be completely fair, as a show should be judged by its own merits, it isn\u2019t without justification. The sad fact of the matter is that NOT suffers from the same stigma most spin-offs do, it doesn\u2019t live up to the expectations set by the original; both in content and quality. When a show uses the name of a franchise, viewers will have set expectations, fair or not. It\u2019s only when a spin-off adds something substantial or improves upon the material that fans will react positively to it; those kind of spin-offs are a rarity. Unfortunately, Soul Eater NOT is not amongst those rare exceptions. It has problems even when it is not being compared to the original, and ultimately doesn\u2019t add anything of great substance to the much beloved series.\\n",

            "content": "The title of the series speaks for itself. For starters, this is definitely NOT Soul Eater. If fans were eager to wait for a long anticipated Soul Eater sequel or remake, then look elsewhere. It just seems that Bones didn\u2019t decide to do such a project and instead focused on this alternate spinoff, with characters from the original series making cameos but is, and will NOT be a Soul Eater continuation from the same author. Still, this show has its own ways to shine and that\u2019s NOT an understatement.\r\nDespite being a spinoff, the show still takes place in the same universal setting and that\u2019s theinfluential academy of DWMA. One might also label this as a prequel though since many of the events happens before the original series. It could be beneficial to watch original Soul Eater series to familiarize yourself with some of the cameo characters. However, it is not imperative. In fact, this show focuses on a trio of girls that chronicles their daily lives in a strange yet innovative world of spiritual power. \\n\\n\r\nStarting with 14-years old Tsugumi Harudori, we quickly find out in the beginning that she is not a normal girl. After a certain incident involving her realizing the essence of her being as a weapon, she goes to Death Weapon Meister Academy (DWMA) as part of the NOT (Normally Overcome Target) class to discover her potential. The catch is that she is still a beginner and a newbie at the academy, until she meets fellow students Meme Tatane and Anya Hepburn. It\u2019s from here that the trio forges a powerful friendship that tells the story of this show. For Tsugumi though, she is an average girl with average skills. Her ability to turn into a weapon (halberd) may seem admirable but takes effort to pull through. The first episode depicts her transformation the first time as she embraces her destiny. But really, she is just a normal girl with normal traits. Unlike her two other friends, her skills lacks in comparison.\\n\\n\r\nEnter Meme and Anya, the other two protagonists. Although existing as polar opposites, they possesses skills that makes Tsugumi in awe whenever they display their abilities. Meme, a bubbly girl with a short-term memory, is shown as a girl that cares about her friends. And despite being well endowed and sometimes spacing out during class, her athleticism is a testament that people admire. On the other hand, we have Anya, an elegant girl with a more egoistic nature who often choses to refer others as \u201ccommoners\u201d. Her encounter with Tsugumi sticks out as a fascination because she seems Tsugumi as the ultimate commoner. But despite her haughty, tsundere tendencies, and cold behavior towards other people, it\u2019s easy to see that she truly wants to become friends with others. She also shows an antithesis of the classic princess-type character for her boldness to explore; in fact one of her reasons to enroll at DWMA for discovery and learning. Further evidence of her boldness involves her tactics to take risks such as her fight with Tsugumi as a weapon against a fellow student and later on against a real threat. Maybe the trio don\u2019t possesses much in common (hell, even the hair color serves as a gimmick) but they share a bond of unique friendship, forged by their connections.\\n\\n\r\nThe show might have a different cast of main characters but other members from the original Soul Eater does make cameos. Some in fact plays more important roles such as Maka, Soul Evans, and Sid. Other characters such as Black Star, the Liz sisters, and Death the Kid serves more as guidance and progress with the story to evolve. However, this doesn\u2019t work out right for this show on some occasions. This is because the show has a taste of slice of life where some episodes stands out to depict every day events and experiences. And despite the show taking place in a fantasy world, the realism can be related for characters such as Liz and Patty for their pasts. Also, one prominent feature involves Tsugumi as we witness her growth. There\u2019s a contrast between this show and the original Soul Eater in terms of motivations. From the original series, Maka (the main character) already has a dream and what she wanted to be when she grew up similar to most characters. Here, we have Tsugumi, an average girl with potential but yet doesn\u2019t entirely know what to do with it. Throughout the series, she develops more confidence as result of the time she spent with her friends. Yet on various occasions, she still doesn\u2019t stand out too much especially during dire situations when standing beside Meme and Anya. From some points, her progress can feel sappy in a ride that feels off balance, especially compared to its parent series. But do note that the show does have its more grim moments later on involving a dangerous antagonist with a taste for experiments.\\n\\n\r\nTo get full enjoyment from this show is to appreciate the relationship dynamics between the characters. Supporting character also get their own spotlights such as Kim and Jackie, the Liz sisters, among others. Their relationship may differ a bit from our main trio but their purpose remains the same \u2013 to illustrate the nature of characters and how they can build connections with one off another. Otherwise, some nature of the characters can feel a bit of prejudice when the term \u2018witch\u2019 is used. This is evidenced with Kim\u2019s presence in the show as she feels a weight of stress but yet is able to maintain her cherry self. On the other hand though is a weakness in characterization especially with development. Most characters suffers from this either in a lack of background depth or change. To cut to the chase, the show doesn\u2019t do well when it tries to focus itself with character development.\\n\\n\r\nJudging from a standalone point, the show has its many similarities and differences. The similarity involves perhaps the mechanics explained in the beginning such as the NOT and EAT classes. Other terms such as meister, witch, and traitors also become terms with established usages. Classes are taught at the academy in a similar fashion to the original series by experienced instructors. On the other hand, differences expands more than just the style of the story. The comedy is instead influenced by the characters\u2019 gags and gimmicks. On several occasions, the show can even feel like watching a typical \u2018cute girls doing cute things\u2019 with its aesthetics. Here, it\u2019s also expanded by the cutesy relationships, fashionable maid outfits, and occasional fan service. As opposed to a full all out on shounen story, we get a borderline slice of life tale chronicling a trio of cute girls. On the other hand, the story can seem rushed, blend, and feel crammed together at once.\\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s not about recreating the Soul Eater atmosphere again, but the show\u2019s artwork can come as a hit or miss in this category. The standard character designs achieves its purpose to make the girls look adorable and innocent to match their persona. Similarly, the background and fantasy like aura gives off a familiar vibe from Soul Eater. DWMA is designed to give fans that sense of nostalgia along with idyllic dose of its energy. But for what\u2019s worth, it doesn\u2019t feel serious on most occasions. There is enough action on occasions to bring back the Soul Eater shounen feeling. The bad news? Well, it would be the quality. Bones really dropped the ball with its production here as the action feels lifeless and dull. In the beginning though, it had consistency but later on is out of pace. Long story, short: it isn\u2019t a battle shonen anymore so don\u2019t expect high level action. Also expect some edgy fan service on occasions because like mentioned before, the show has a much lighter mood so expect much more goofy moments. \\n\\n\r\nSoundtrack functions as a device to supplement the Soul Eater NOT atmosphere. On most occasions, it is lighthearted with a good complimentary measure. The way is executed has a good balance with its slice of life mood and more ominous scenarios. The OP and ED song has eccentric energy to itself with some catchy dancing sequences. But to top it off are the character voice mannerisms. Character tones have a general yet admirable attribute to them to provide their roles. Anya, for instance, can speak in both a haughty yet caring voice. Other characters, in particular witches, speaks with a noticeable baleful voice to contrast the mood of the story. What you see is what you get though as the show has a clear goal in mind. The soundtrack and voice department achieved that.\\n\\n\r\nThis show might NOT be what the original series offered but it can still be a fun little ride of academic adventure. The trio of our main characters lacks purpose but builds on their connections to forge and tell stories. It is the charming relationships between the characters that paints this show as more than just a SOL ride. But if you\u2019re looking forward to a hardcore story or expansion of what Soul Eater had presented, then it\u2019s the wrong place. The comedy may seem also seem mindless at times but its gimmicks can be attractive when it stands out on its own. It may not be a masterpiece of the coming ages from the Soul Eater world but neither is it gagantous.\\n",

            "content": "First off, I'm not a reviewer.\r\nThis named prequel of the critically acclaimed \"Soul Eater\" has got me cringing and shuffling my hair, even more so than Eureka Seven's Pocket Full Rainbow movie. It surprised me that it did. Those who've read the manga and/or watched the anime series may have mixed feelings or downright hate it or love it, god knows why. \r\nStory, 3: The story had a lot of potential, but it really didn't go into much context at all. The witch comes in to destroy all of DWMA but her motives are devoid and unoriginal. It's just looking for blood and gore forher entertainment with no background or so to back up why to even say how she came to be who she was. The supporting characters are really weak as they feel like they're just there to set up things for the MC until she realizes the situation not until the second to last episode. Yes, throughout the show the MC who is the weapon, I don't remember their name, that's how bad it is, goes on with her slice of life show and while she yearns to become stronger she doesn't really go through much of a training sequence or desire a goal when it's clear that would've made her motive at DWMA much more stronger than the friendship stuff she would've had with it. For the most part, the main cast just strolls around and have fun and then get a friendship boost for the last level....I'll leave the rest to you.\\n\\n\r\nArt, 7: The art isn't really anything original or unique to say. It's similar to almost every anime in the last few years and present. Although it is quite refined and I haven't seen any derpy faces which kind of shows the studio gave the art a lot of time and effort.\\n\\n\r\nSound, 5: You know actually, I was so appalled by the characters every dialogue the sound I couldn't hear at all. Although I did like the opening song it was decent.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter, 1: There is no character. They are a mixture of cliche, generic stereotypes as if they were just created like the Power Puff Girls. The MC strives for nothing. She knows nothing like Jon Snow knows nothing yet he is COOL and does something like a badass. Here the MC, weapon girl, does not do anything. She doesn't even try to realize the situation in DWMA nor cares about anyone else other than her friends. Who cares about fodder. The other two MC, the meisters, are yet again a generic princess who knows martial arts but is useless most of the time until the plot calls for it. The forgetful girl with big boobs and the idiot among them although the weapon girl is also an idiot. if you think about it they are nothing but fan service and I'm okay with fan service but not the way it's presented here. As for the rest, the original cast I was glad to see but they don't represent them as good as the original series even though this is a prequel. I don't believe they were that bland. Everyone else is just used a tool to set everything up.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment, 1: If I cringed and shuffled my hair while moving around weirdly on my chair because of how bad and annoying this show was I'd be either crazy or this show is actually that appalling. There were moments that made me blush a little but it only lasted less than a second. It doesn't have any measure of excitement and the battle animations were terrible.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, 1: This show is the worst show I've ever seen earning itself a 1/10. This show literally SLAPS you in the face if you enjoyed the Soul Eater Manga or anime this show detriments everything the world and character of Soul Eater once was. It tried to give a different take but the way it presented slice of life with some action was god awfully bad. The final fight literally yelled \"PLOT\". Don't joke with me, I love slice of life and if you do too this show does not live up to the Soul Eater series let alone it's own genre. It is NOT worth anyone's time yet already many people watched it or is watching it. I just felt like slapping whoever wrote this. The characters are literally a combination of only cliche and generic things. They don't have a taste of originality like Death the Kid's obsession with symmetry. Now that's called character. And for those rating this show above average should write their own stories and see to themselves they could write an even story just as bad as this or better. The show's main point...there was not point. It's your usual friendship  stuff. The art and stuff was like I was watching any other anime that looked just like it. The conflicts within this story will kill your hype for expectations for the moment because it is a mind manipulation show. And that is my review without talking crap and spoiling anything. Although I actually did talk crap only.\\n\\n\r\nThen again I'm not a reviewer.",

I've read some negative feedback about it, but in truth it's an easy going anime. You don't have to guess or wonder about much, it's not like Hakuouki. The characters are very shallow and there is not much development throughout the 12 episodes. But...Regardless, if you've just finished watching/reading something brutal or brutally cute then Soul Eater Not is just what you need. It's mediocre in plot, but exceptional in quality (I simply love the animation). So go for it, I promise you won't have a mentalbreakdown like you did after the first episode of Attack on Titan or a completely and utterly confused look on your face after watching 3 episodes of Ergo Proxy.",

            "content": "Soul Eater NOT! is difficult to judge because it's hard to pick what standards to judge it from, as well as what demographic it is trying to accommodate. If you come in looking for a slice-of-life anime, the steep, intermittent changes in tone and the general story-arch may be jarring for many. If you are coming in for a story-driven action-fest akin to the original series, this show will disappoint with its sparse and short actions sequences and how few episodes are actually driving the story forward. This show also assumes you have seen the original series, else many of the unique concepts behind thecanon as well as back stories and cameos from the original story will be lost to the viewer. \\n\\n\r\nStory: \\n\\n\r\n    The first half or so of Soul Eater NOT is very episodic with little overarching story to speak of, instead using the time to introduce the characters as they go about their first semester at DWMA. The last six episodes is when the story starts kicking it in to gear, but up through the end I found it somewhat shallow, both in complexity and scale. The anime does offer up some quite entertaining moments, whether its humorous or unsettlingly dark and unexpected, but these are relatively few and far between. Overall, it is a very \"the power of friendship\" kind of story, so be aware. \\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\\n\r\n    There isn't a lot to say about the art except that it was \"okay.\" As a slice of life the colorful and somewhat simplistic nature of the bulk of the animation holds up fine, but the few action sequences were largely hit-or-miss; some scenes were relatively fluid and enjoyable, while others were completely lacking. \\n\\n\r\nSound: \\n\\n\r\nAgain, the sound was okay for the purposes. The voice-acting was decent enough, as I didn't find myself cringing at any particular characters when they spoke. The music was forgettable however; literally I can't remember any of the songs besides the opening...\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: \\n\\n\r\nIn terms of the three main characters, their personalities and motivations are pretty generic; you can pretty much pin them to a T from the first episode or two. You have the main girl who wants to get stronger to protect her friends, one who lived her child-hood in high class and wanted to escape it, and the overly enthusiastic, dim-witted one. Not much else to say. \\n\\n\r\nThe supporting cast is where I believe much of the show's entertainment lies, as long as you are familiar with the original series. Many recognizable faces are present in one way or another, and it was actually very interesting seeing their stories expanded upon from before the events of Soul Eater without any major discrepancies of the overall canon. I feel that I would have enjoyed the show much more if it gave more focus to this pre-story in terms of these recurring characters. There are a few characters, however, that I feel are not given proper justice and/or inconsistent if you are familiar with the original canon. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: \\n\\n\r\nAs I stated before, most of my enjoyment came from the expanded narrative around the supporting cast. I didn't find the show overly bad in any way, but as I am confessedly not a huge fan of the slice-of-life genre, those who are fans may get more out of it than I did. Although I still find the action-side of it lacking, if you are a fan of both genres and aren't afraid of switching between them in the same continuity, I would say go ahead and give it a whirl.",

            "content": "This show definitely does not deserve a 9, but I really enjoyed it so that's what I gave it! (Haters to the left)\r\nSTORY:\r\nAnyways this story centers around Tsugumi Harudori, a 14 year old girl who has found out only recently that she is a weapon. So she goes to the DWMA to learn how to control her newly found power and fight. A very similar story to the actual Soul Eater anime but revolving around the NOT class instead of the EAT class. (Hence the name, Soul Eater NOT)\r\nCHARACTERS:\r\nThe characters in this show were okay. None particularly stood out to me even though I enjoyedthem. The characters I did like however were mainly ones from the original anime like Kid, Maka, Soul, ect. One thing I really loved about this anime though is that they went into the background of a lot of minor characters from Soul Eater. I loved learning about Kim and Jacqueline and how they became partners. Also the fact that Kim is a witch was really interesting because they never mentioned anything about it in Soul Eater.\\n\\n\r\nART:\\n\r\nGorgeous. This is one of the prettiest art styles I've ever seen. I feel like it fit the tone of this show better than the other animation for Soul Eater (don't get me wrong, I love Soul Eater's animation too) would have. \\n\\n\r\nSOUND:\\n\r\nMeh. It was alright. Nothing really stood out to me. I did enjoy the opening though.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT OVERALL:\\n\r\nDefinitely not worth a 9, but I enjoyed it so I keeping it a 9. I'd say only watch this if you're a major fan of the actual anime and are very forgiving XD",

            "content": "Let me get this straight, the reason why I watched this show is to actually view the old characters one last time *cries*. The fact that I miss Death the Kid, Black Star, Maka Albarn, Tsubaki Nakatsukasa, Patty and Liz Thompson, and of course, Soul E. Evans (I'll have you know I placed those names without consulting google and other websites. I memorized them!), immediately I was in cloud nine after receiving a notice that the spin-off of Soul Eater will be released. I actually kind of expected that Not! will not satisfy me but I didn't expect it to disappoint me this much.\r\nThe storyis labeled as decent for score but for me it's unsatisfactory. You want the idea of having a dark and action-packed show like Soul Eater, instead you get a flow of story about teenage girls who can't solve their problems in getting a partner. It is a slice of life rendition of Soul Eater. It shows the everyday life of students INSIDE DWMA. Their lives are different from the former gang, it's less complicated and duller. Their singing is excruciating and this show cannot be K-On. Dear Bones, you cannot be Kyoto Animation! Not ever! The cuteness, plot holes, fillers, and unhelpful shits in the story made me regret watching this show.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is lazy and pathetic. I get the idea of how the characters are younger and cuter but, COME ON!! There is no reason to make the art look so, sluggish and shitty! I do not like how the characters looked like mashed paintings or abstract figures! Have you seen that fight with Eternal Feather? (reference: Youtube) It was the saddest animation I have ever seen in my entire life. It looked like 15 year old kids could do that fighting scene. Setting the fighting scenes aside (which is I think only 3 or 4 scenes), I see how uncomfortable it is to watch huge breasts floating all over my eyes. The only thing that I loved was Shaula's hair and Sid's younger face (which is a bit hot). \\n\\n\r\nThe sound was okay but not good enough, sorry.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters were the worst. the way Atsushi Okubo created them were not what I hoped he'd do. I hate their personalities and their corny and cheesy moments just made me puked. The MC which I don't remember her name anymore was really plain. She has two ponytails which made her look more childish and useless. She also makes this idiotic catchphrases that makes my eyes twitch and for some reason they laugh for the heck of it. The other, with the huge boobs were drastically made for fanservice. She has a short term memory which I guess is not original and I hate how she flirts like a yuri character. The commoner lover which I can remember her name is I think, Anya? She has this uncontrollable personality, the tsundere type. I personally hate most tsunderes. They blush all the time trying to make characters worry and all and they think they're so cute but they actually have a dysfunctional and suckish personality. I'm sorry but this dumb trio is nothing like the group I loved from the first season. Stein, the old characters, and the coffee manager were the only characters that were less disappointing.\\n\\n\r\nI didn't enjoy it, I regret watching it.\\n\\n\r\nI think you guys need to see this first before watching the original Soul Eater to compare the beauty of Soul Eater and the wickedness of this poorly-animated show. I just wanted to see that original characters one last time *sobs mathematically* but I never would've guessed that this show would be a rip-off. \\n\r\n#lame\\n\r\n#iknowthisisnttwitter\\n\r\n#idontcare\\n\r\n#thisanimeisbullshit\\n\\n\r\nI cannot guys, I just can't. I'm just thankful that this became possible because in that way I can see the characters again. So I guess this is goodbye, Soul Eater? *cries so hard that it breaks everything in its path*\\n",

Although, the only likenesses they share is their name and characters.Those who have not read the manga may be in for a bit of a surprise, Soul Eater NOT is a slice of life and lacks much of the action and suspense Soul Eater has. But, what it does is give the audience a great background into the events that transpired before the start of Soul Eater.\r\nArt: 7/10 The artwork in Soul Eater NOT was the only letdown for me. The art is quite different from Soul Eater's. To make the show fit theslice of life genre the producers made all the characters more \"cutesy\". I personally would have rather seen it with the original artwork, but whatever.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 8/10: The characters are showcased well, and some background information is provided to make the characters seem less shallow. I enjoy the interpersonal conflict that persist throughout the show on who Tsugumi will choose as her partner.\\n\\n\r\nOverall I rate it an 8/10. I feel this is fair because, for a slice of life anime, it has its fairly dramatic moments, coupled with other conflicts. I think if you have seen Soul Eater and are a fan, this would be worth your while. NOT really gives good insight into the protagonist from both shows and what led up to the events in Soul Eater. I would not suggest you watch this before watching the original Soul Eater or it will be very hard to follow and you will have very little enjoyment from it. Gagantous!",

The characters were all well thought out. All of them were brilliant, apart from the blasphemous Black Star, but put that behind and then you had a very good show.\r\nI couldn't wait for this series to come out. But I watched through untill the third episode and just decided to chuck a brick at my TV set. We had a well explained well planned show, that got blown to bits though this series, Soul Eater NOT! Thegreat action parts, are gone. All this show is now is a lesbian musical. Not an action show, which by the way, everyone wants.\\n\\n\r\nWhy would you change something that worked so good. This is going to kill the series unlesss they cut out all of the childish crap.... In short your new show is bloody annoying!!!\\n\\n\r\n4/10 Story:  yes there is a story. Through what I've seen and heard, all there really is to it are three 14 year old girls(spoiler alert) who meet, live together, work in a restaurant, annoyed Liz and Patty, then killed a witch... That about it\\n\r\n8/10 Art:  the animation is brilliant. One of the best I've ever seen\\n\r\n2/10 Sound: the squeaking voices and singing... Its really painful to listen to... Very annoying\\n\r\n1/10 Character:  I'm sorry, but there's really nothing to be said here. The characters weren't in my opinion very well thought out. It seems as though these new characters were just plomped into the series\\n\r\n1/10 Enjoyment:  not in the least... Yes there are some funny pieces. But the little amusement you get from this series gets plundered everytime those childish squeaking kids do something\\n\r\n3/10 Overall:  Wouldn't watch this series ever again... Had to buy a new TV set thats how annoying this series is... I would recommend watching the normal Soul Eater series instead\\n\r\nUnless you prefer lesbian musicals...\\n",

            "content": "Definitely a good watch. But, if you are expecting the non-stop action and fights that the OG series has, then you will be let down. It definitely moves at a much slower pace as well.\r\nLearning that there is indeed an \"EAT\" class and a \"NOT\" class, depending on an individuals power and will to fight and the differences between the two,  was enlightening. The story centers around the three MC's, all female students in the \"NOT\" class, and it goes through out their stay at the DWMA as they try to cope with their abilities while trying to still live a regular, normal lifew/o all the fighting that the students in the \"EAT\" class are preparing for. You learn about the daily routines of the students, and the hardships that accompany them as they try to hone their abilities. Being able to see this secondary path the students can take at the DWMA was a great concept. The series definitely focuses on friendship, which the OG series does as well, but in a less coarse way unlike the OG. At times this series does slow to a snail's pace in terms of the plot. But, if you stick with it, it does pick up in intensity towards the latter part of the series.  All of this is done in a very cutesy way. Almost too cutesy at times. (Lol)\\n\\n\r\nYou also get to meet a good amount of the original characters as well, as they make sporadic appearances throughout this series. It was very awesome to see them all in the \"early' years at the DWMA, and how their roles took shape. You also get a good amount of background on them through this series, which answered a fair amount of questions that I had after finishing the OG series. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters are developed very well. You learn almost everything you need to know about the characters in a timely manner, and the relationships between characters are developed very smoothly. The flash backs and back story is all well placed, eliminating a lot of the possible confusion that could've come about if it wasn't. \\n\\n\r\nThe art style/ animation used is very good. Very consistent with what you'd come to expect for a Soul Eater series. Same with the music. Each character has unique physical traits, and definitely all are unique.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, the series provides a good amount of enjoyment. It is a worthy prequel to the OG series, and provides you with some great background. They did a great job in connecting the two series, while not taking away from the originality of this current series.",

            "content": "Soul Eater NOT is arguably the anime equivalent of ice cream on pizza. Two perfectly wonderful foods that when combined create something far less than the sum of its parts.\r\nSoul Eater is without a doubt a cult classic with a unique art style and one of the things that makes it shine as a piece of art is its reluctance to rely on clich\u00e9 tropes to float the narrative that, in this case, stands strong on its own merits. There's nothing to say a sequal/prequal would be inherently bad or disliked and i'm sure fans would welcome such a project providing it honoured the originaluniverse (you could probably deduce from that remark that Soul Eater NOT does not).\\n\\n\r\nSo what makes SE:NOT so bad? Slice of life is often a refreshing change of pace to the otherwise typically fantastical stories that dominate the world of anime, cartoons and TV media in general. I enjoy both action and slice of life so i like to think i am not biased in judging this show on both accounts since i approve of both equally anyway. Simply put, SE:NOT is a failure of juxtaposition and a failure of writing. That is to say it fails to really choose what it wants to be and then fails at both, then trying to fix it after-the-fact with popular tropes rather than making something not broken to begin with. Trying to cash in on both the contemporary \"cutesie\" SoL element that has become popular recently and the rough and raw elements of SE that made it popular back in the day simultaneously.\\n\\n\r\nThe original Soul Eater universe plays such a small and even moot role in this title it begs an obvious question of why they even bothered. The DWMA plot could be replaced by any other similar concept and functioned all the same, if not better. Which makes one consider the likelihood this was simply an attempt to milk an existing popular title to boost views on an otherwise generic, magic themed SoL. The cute generic main characters seem almost injected into a foreign world, slapped on like a sticker or after thought.\\n\\n\r\nIf i were to summarise my thoughts on this title it would be that the authors should have chosen one concept and run with it for the sake of consistency. Either honoured the original title with a proper sequel/prequel instead of a half arsed spin-off with cameo's or stuck with a SoL with magical elements and utilised the typical conventional art style for an original story that would have stood humbly on its own.\\n\\n\r\nThe attempt to try both smacks of laziness, but also a surreptitious money grab and neither sit well with me as a consumer.\\n\\n\r\nIf you like Soul Eater, cameo's and slice of life then you may want to check it out if only to tick it off your list. It's not horrible, but it wont blow you out of the water either.",

I understand the title says \"Not\", but I thought ir be each weapon and meistsers background stories. Instead, it follows a group of three freshmen students at Death Academy, totally new to the Soul Eater story. Fighting is literally nonexistent in the story. There's more unnecessary ecchi, and the animations have changed to fit a seeming younger audience. The main characters of Soul Eater (Maka, Soul, Blackstar, etc.) show up like once. They also have been \"cute-sified\". The fighting animation seemedslow and laggy compared to the original Soul Eater. Overall, Soul Eatee Not is more of an extra thing. So if you're a huge Soul Eater fan, don't watch it because it's unrelated and disappointing.",

            "content": "*Minor spoilers ahead*\r\nWhat is Soul Eater Not supposed to be? Is it a yuri slice-of-life made to appeal to people unfamiliar with the original Soul Eater, or is it a necessary part of the Soul Eater canon, aimed at those who enjoyed the action and drama of the original series? The answer to that question remains a mystery. I'm not even convinced the author of the manga understands what he's working on. \r\nSoul Eater Not is an exercise in mediocrity. It is a gust of wind with no particular destination. By jumping from genre to genre and trying to appeal to both the slice-of-life crowdand fans of the original series, it ends up pleasing neither. The end result is something that, while not offensively dumb, lingers in the mind with no more than passing apathy. I doubt anyone will remember its existence after a year. Even half that time might seem generous. \\n\\n\r\nThe first few episodes were promising enough. It didn't seem like it would make any impact in the industry or do anything particularly interesting, but it was fun nonetheless to watch the banter between the innocent protagonist, Tsugumi, and her two companions, Meme (think Yui from K-ON) and Anya (the tsundere ojou-sama). The unique setting of the Soul Eater franchise even gave 'Not' its own distinct identity in the sea of indistinguishable slice-of-life, and hey, it did its job just fine in the moe department. There was no drama, no deep themes or underlying message, and that was OK. For the first half, Soul Eater Not is actually a fairly decent slice-of-life anime. \\n\\n\r\nAnd then everything turns upside down in the seventh episode. The main three are off shopping, fooling around as they always do, and then from nowhere comes a generic villain who attempts to murder one of the side characters in gory fashion, throat slicing and all. Uhh... all right, then. What's supposed to come as a shock instead brings confusion and frustration. It almost feels as if the script was suddenly hijacked by a different team of writers. There is no consistency, no purpose in this except perhaps for a vague thought of \"Well, I guess it's time to add in some drama so Soul Eater fans don't get bored.\" In reality, all that was accomplished was both sides of the audience being alienated. \\n\\n\r\nThe melodrama is guilty of more than just existing. It is terribly written, every scene reeking of some eye-rolling clich\u00e9. Even the accident at the end of the seventh episode is written off as inconsequential, the story awkwardly shifting back into yuri comedy just minutes into the next episode. The drama itself is so boring that falling asleep becomes a more exciting prospect, because, hell, how are we supposed to immediately empathise with characters who previously were only used for gags and fanservice? After trudging through the predictable 'one of the main characters is now possessed by evil!' clich\u00e9, the final episode treats the viewer with a full dose of stupid: said character comes back to reality with a kiss and the group then defeats the powerful villain (who they do not have the combat ability to even defend themselves against) with the indomitable power of friendship! Please. I want to puke.\\n\\n\r\nAmong Not's many issues is its clumsily-written romance. The fourth episode has Tsugumi falling for Akane, one of the few male characters, merely because he threw a few suave words her way. It's never explained whether Akane feels anything for Tsugumi, and of course nothing ever comes of the romance either. It's actually completely forgotten by the next episode. I guess one way of explaining it would be that the manga's later chapters are meant to focus on the two's romance, but even then it shouldn't be completely discarded and brought up again whenever the author feels it's convenient. It's doubly awkward since the author doesn't even know whether he wants to pair Tsugumi with Akane or one of the two girls; it haphazardly alternates between heterosexual romance and yuri. All of it just feels very out-of-place-- a lot like the drama.\\n\\n\r\nOn the plus side, there are plenty of cameo appearances with the cast of the main series. They don't add more than a few lines of dialogue here and there, though, so don't expect another adventure with Soul or Death the Kid. I suppose it's always neat to see what they were doing behind the scenes. \\n\\n\r\nWith regards to the sound and artwork, Soul Eater Not does not offend the eyes and ears but it never hits any high points, either. It looks okay. It sounds okay. The only issue is that the unique, paint-like art style of the main series is missing here, so those who enjoyed Soul Eater for its visual design will be quite disappointed. The opening theme is pretty nice, though. It's overwhelmingly cute and mirrors the fluffiness of the anime's first half. The OP was almost like a glimmer of hope in the show's unpleasant final episodes. \\n\\n\r\nIt's difficult for me to recommend Soul Eater Not because, well... who would I recommend it to in the first place? Soul Eater fans? They will be bored with the yuri of the show's first half. Slice-of-life fans? They will be frustrated with the tiresome melodrama of the second half. Critics? Well, maybe if they enjoy yelling at their monitor. \\n\\n\r\nSoul Eater Not is an anime that doesn't really please anyone. It is not quite awful, but it also exerts no effort to be more than just a passing, colourless breeze. It's the kind of show that comes and goes every single season. It is destined to fade away, lonely and forgotten.",

            "content": "The title \"Soul Eater NOT!\" should give you a warning if you're coming to this show expecting an action shonen like Soul Eater. It's exactly as it says it is, for the most part, its NOT Soul Eater. But does it NOT being Soul Eater make it automatically bad? Not at all. This is a fun experience and definitely a worthy prequel to Soul Eater, even if its not quite the same. \r\nStory(7)\r\nIf you didn't already know, the whole concept of Soul Eater is about these kids that to go a school where they learn to basically fight witches and other evil. Every living personhas a soul and depending on your connection with your soul, determines how good a fighter you are, essentially. Certain people have the ability to transform into weapons. Other students wield these weapons and they partner up to fight evil.\\n\\n\r\nWhere as the original Soul Eater focused on pro students at the school that go on missions and leave the school quite frequently, Soul Eater Not focuses more on the newcomers of the NOT class. The story revolves around 3 cute girls that go to the school. Tsugumi is a weapon. Meme and Anya are misters and they both want to partner up with Tsugumi. The only problem is, you're only supposed to have ONE mister at a time, not two for one weapon. Nonetheless, the group befriend each other and leave that problem for later. \\n\\n\r\nNow most people are very quick to judge this show for its complete change of style, both visually and genre wise. The whole first half of the show if not longer, other than the lore, its essentially nothing like Soul Eater at all and takes on the more \"Moe Slice of Life\" role similar to shows K-ON! or Yuru Yuri rather than an action show like Soul Eater. The show is even categorized as an Ecchi, though the fanservice here is relatively minimal to non existent at all. The show at first definitely isn't Soul Eater, but again, its not trying to be. \\n\\n\r\nWhile it is very similar to other Slice of Life Moe shows does that mean its quite as good as them? I'd say no. The slice of life portions here are fine but shows like K-ON handle this genre much better. However, what's here I don't think is bad and I really do appreciate because they help show what Soul Eater didn't: how one BECOMES one of the higher class students and what life is like BEFORE they go out adventuring. In many ways, I feel like this show introduced the whole concept of a series nicely, (though it has some what of my same problems I had with the original where they hardly showed them doing any actual school activities at all.)\\n\\n\r\nNear the end of the series, the story starts to pick up and it feels a lot more like Soul Eater. It transitions a lot more into an action show. Not only that, it also has a few connections to the original series that I think make this a nice prequel overall. \\n\\n\r\nArt(6)\\n\\n\r\nOne of the primary knee-jerk reactions to this show was how much the art style had changed from the original show. The original show had a very unique and funky art sort of art style to it. This one, while still remaining somewhat different to a lot of anime, is mostly a very generic, cute art style. \\n\\n\r\nNow many people see this as a negative, and to some degree I agree, but after a while I noticed that the original art style doesn't really suit this type of show, the same way this new one wouldn't suit the original. They're 2 different shows. While the old style was definitely better, this one works for this type of show and it's nice to see something a little different.\\n\\n\r\nSound(7)\\n\\n\r\nI like the opening and ending while the main BGM wasn't that memorable to me. Voice acting seems solid enough to me and I'm pretty sure most of the characters from the original cast have the same voice actors. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters(7)\\n\\n\r\nAs for the new characters here, they aren't as good or fleshed out as the ones from the original series, and while many would complain that they're very simple, I still enjoyed them I found them over all to be likable and fun. \\n\\n\r\nAs for the returning characters, their cameos are probably a lot of the appeal to fans of the original series, though certain characters get a lot more appearances than others. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment(8)\\n\\n\r\nOverall it kind of had a slow start but as a fan of both Soul Eater and Moe Slice of Life I enjoyed this series a decent amount, especially near the end. \\n\\n\r\nOverall(7)\\n\\n\r\nMany people label this show as a shameless attempt to cash in on the moe fanbase. Whether or not that statement is true, I personally still enjoyed this show. \\n\\n\r\nIf you're a fan of the original Soul Eater and also like or don't mind a moe slice of life type show, I'd say give it a shot.\\n\\n\r\nHowever if you're a fan of the original series and are looking for a more action oriented show and can't stand a cute premise like this, this show probably isn't for you.\\n\\n\r\nBut also if you haven't seen Soul Eater and are interested in watching it, I think this is a nice way to introduce you to the series as by the end, it does transition into a more action type show and answer a few questions of how things happened in the original series. But again, that's only if you're into a moe type of show as well. If you are only interested in Soul Eater, skip this and just watch that. You won't be missing anything TOO important at all.",

            "content": "Soul Eater was an okay show. Soul Eater NOT!, however, is NOT an okay show at all. Hell, even the title is a good indicator. You see the word NOT? Honestly I see it as a sign. Do NOT watch this show. It's NOT worth your time. It's NOT Soul Eater. Okay, let's just move on to the review. \r\nStory: 5/10\r\nThe story is just complete... meh. This girl discovers that she's a weapon, so she goes to this academy so she can sort herself out. She meets some friends and they have adventures together inside of the school. \r\nOkay, that's pretty bland. It pretty muchleaves you wondering, \"Wait, what the hell do they even do in this show then? Is this a slice-of-life?\" Yes, it is. You answered your own question. This is a slice-of-life. The setting isn't particularly bad, I'm not biased against the genre, it's just not very good, either. It doesn't really add anything more than what Soul Eater offered. In fact, I think it offers less than before. There is a conflict (and when I say conflict, I don't mean who ends up with the main character), but honestly it's just pushed to the side until the very last episode. It's like they actually want to make the show more boring for the longest time possible. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 7/10\\n\r\nThe art is nice. Everything's bright and bubbly; it fits perfectly well with the tone of this show. I preferred the old art style, but this one's still okay with me. I don't really have any complaints.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 6/10\\n\r\nThe soundtrack isn't memorable at all. Really I can only remember the opening, and I don't even like the opening all that much. I guess it serves its purpose, and there weren't really any pieces that stuck out to me, but that's the thing; there are none. There's nothing bad, sure, but nothing good either. The only compliment I can give is that it's not bad. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 3/10\\n\r\nThe characters are absolutely the worst part of this show. They're seriously bad. The main character is a clumsy ditz. That's her character. She's just clumsy. She's also the most sensible out of the three main characters, but considering the fact that they're all mental that's really not saying much. Then there's that girl with the big boobs. I can't even remember her name, I think it's Sena, but if you can only remember a character because of her big boobs, that's a big problem. 'Cause, guess what, Sena isn't special either. She's even more clumsy than the main character, and the main character is already pretty freaking clumsy. I think she has short term memory loss too or something. Finally, my least liked character, is that rich snobby girl. Oh yes, the girl that acts like a snob and she's rich. Great. We really needed this type of character. So really, all in all, the characters are boring, there's nothing interesting about them, they're incredibly cliche, there's nothing new that they add to their stereotype, they're just plain bad.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 3/10\\n\r\nUsually with slice-of-life shows, characters don't matter that much. Sure they might be horrible, but it doesn't matter if what they actually do or say is entertaining. Take for example K-ON. All of the characters in K-ON are trash. They're all boring. But, put them in a funny situation, and suddenly K-ON is somewhat nice. Soul Eater NOT!, however, does not do this. They put them in incredibly boring scenarios, and then you have even more boring characters, and what do you get? An incredibly boring show. Sure, mix in some ecchi now and then. That's really gonna reel me in. I think somehow they predicted that Soul Eater NOT! was going to be a horrible show, so they just said, \"**** it, let's just make them lesbians. Who gives a ****!\" And now, along with boring characters, they're now presented with more horrible and unfunny jokes. I honestly gave up in the middle of it. And then I went back after I decided that I might as well finish it. Now, I'm not going to say that that was one of the worst decisions of my life, but it was possibly one of the worst decisions of my life. \\n\\n\r\nOverall:3/10\\n\r\nOverall, Soul Eater Not!, like I said, is not worth your time. The story is average at best while adding nothing new, the soundtrack isn't memorable, the characters are absolute trash, and the comedy is nonexistant. I found nothing funny about this show, except for maybe how hilariously bad this show is. No, really; it's that bad. Take a shot for every time one of the main characters start blushing because of some stupid yuri crap and sooner or later you'll end up in the bathroom of a Denny's. The only, and the only, good thing I can say about this show is the art. It's actually somewhat good. Too bad I can't say the same for, hmm I don't know, literally everything else in the show. Please don't watch this show.",

            "content": "Alright so first let me get rid of the fact that this is taking place as a Soul Eater spin-off and that Soul Eater is even apart of the title because honestly, to be fair the title does say \"Soul Eater NOT\" so the thing you should expect is for it to be NOT soul eater. However I'm not gonna judge it based on that fact, I'm gonna be judging it as an anime as a whole and not some side series to an awesome shounen anime. I'll probably spoil a lot by the way. Grab some popcorn and sit down because I have alot to say. \\n\\n\r\nThe Story (2/10) (Prepare for a butt-ton)\\n\\n\r\nSo before some of you start trying to point fingers at me, I will say right now that the story for this anime was most unexpected. What I expected from this anime was a sorta action, shounen thing going on except from the perspective of the main characters being female teens, I mean after all, the genre does say action and shounen right, to my surprise the first episode actually made me believe that was going to be true as well however, episode 2 is where it all went downhill. Now I am not a fan of slice of life anime such as K-on or Lucky Star at all, I think they are dreadfully boring and nothing but girls screwing around doing random crap amongst themselves, having real life random conversations. I do believe the point of anime is to escape reality, so when I see an anime taking place in an unrealistically awesome place such as Death Weapon Meister Academy, the last thing you'd expect to see is the main action of the anime being the main characters planting pumpkins, going shopping and getting jobs as being maids at Death Bucks Cafe, a lot of this anime is just of them doing regular girl teenage stuff given the environment around them isn't normal at all, the things they do are just too normal for the setting. \\n\\n\r\nNow unlike Lucky Star and other SOL animes, there is an actual plot in Soul Eater Not however, I wouldn't necessarily call it \"Good\" in any way due to the fact that the pacing behind this so called \"Plot\" is god awful, here's my brief summary of the plot pacing: Main girl almost gets killed by witch, goes to get a maid job. Main girl gets attacked by mind controlled man, Fanservicey Physical Exams and Pool Cleaning time! Girl slices her fucking neck open right in front of the main girl, plants pumpkins! I don't think shit like this mixes together at all in my opinion, even when the serious stuff like that does happen, its very brief and barely lasts before going back to the screwing around style, barely any of the story is really explained. It's like just when you think the story is actually about to pick up it slaps a big NOPE in your face.\\n\\n\r\n The last few episodes didn't have much screwing around as it finally started to fully pick up on the background story that the first 9 episodes barely had but there was one problem here, it wasn't the main characters that were involved in the main pick up of the story, it was two side characters that got into the action as the main characters had their own little personal troubles to deal with like Meme being possessed, Anya being escorted back to her home and Tsugumi hurting her leg. Alright so why is the whole show based around these characters then? I know I failed to mention why all them ran into these problems but honestly I don't even care enough to explain. What I will mention though is that near the end, finally Tsugumi and Anya fixed their problems (with the shounen ways of friendship) and now wanna get Meme back from the clutches of the evil antagonist. Oh Yeah! By the way, there's an evil person behind the story, almost forgot. Haha must of not been important enough, maybe if they explained who she was a little better or why she is trying to kill everyone or just something, anything that would make me care to remember at all. The show ends in the most bs and predictable way possible however I won't spoil that much, you'll probably see it coming though. \\n\\n\r\n That was a lot of typing so I'm hoping you got the main reason of why I think this story sounds like it was made by some 12 year old writing a bad Soul Eater fan-fic.\\n\\n\r\nThe Art (6/10)\\n\r\nI'm not gonna say the art is necessarily bad or anything but I'm not gonna say that I liked it. Personally I didn't like it because it made all the soul eater original series characters look like tools but I'll be lying if I said it didn't look polished and clean. Some awkward animation quirks here and there, action scenes really aren't the best either but I wouldn't write it off as \"bad\"\\n\\n\r\nThe sound (8/10) \\n\r\nThe first time I heard that damn opening I just couldn't stop listening to it xD I found it very catchy. The ending theme wasn't my cup of tea but overall the soundtracks in the actual show were nice and fit the moods of the situations. The JP voice actors were also very good at portraying the voices of the characters, especially Anya, they got the snobby rich girl voice right. \\n\\n\r\nThe Characters (1/10)\\n\r\nTwo words, One dimensional. One dimensional characters can be described as characters that have a set personality trait and right from episode 1 you can see that they set up these personality traits like they stamped it on their fucking foreheads. You got your nice but insecure girl Tsugumi. You got your busty air headed girl Meme and you got your snobby tsundere rich girl Anya. Character development is near non-existent, these personality traits stick throughout the entire show. Hell a side character named Kim got more character development then any of the main characters and even that was scarce. I can maybe see some people enjoying the personalities they have but I am not one of those people. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (2/10) \\n\r\nDid I enjoy Soul Eater Not? Yes I did! I enjoyed the parts that didn't include the main characters. I enjoyed the parts that included these two guy side characters and the soul eater main series characters. However since the amount of screen time these characters got ranged around 15 minutes in this entire 12 episodes series, that is not a good thing. To sum it up, I barely enjoyed Soul Eater Not. I didn't like the main characters at all and I didn't like the way they portrayed the show. It was boring. I found myself drifting off while watching it very often. \\n\\n\r\nOverall (3/10)\\n\r\nYou could say I rated this show based on personal preference of anime. If you prefer the kind of anime where there are girls screwing and around doing shit all then by all means I recommend it. If you're like me and don't wanna watch a show that includes girls fooling around, doing barely anything in a place called Death Weapon Meister Acedemy, which by the way I don't think I saw in any point of this anime of them actually training as weapons and meisters but correct me if I'm wrong, then I do not recommend this show as it will just make you love and miss the original Soul Eater series even more (that is if you watched it). Remember though, this is just my opinion and if you disagree that's perfectly okay. Sorta. I mean seriously in any aspect I look at this show I can't call it good. I can't call it good for being a slice of life anime but then again I never liked Slice of Life animes in this style however all I do know about a lot of Slice of Life fans is that they like it for its cute style, well frankly I didn't find it all that cute so I'm gonna throw that out there. I can't call it good for being a action/shounen/supernatural anime because it barely had any of that, maybe the shounen part. For the comedy part well, I didn't find it that funny, only part that made me giggle were the flat chested jokes they were throwing at Tsugumi. Overall 3/10 and I still think I'm being generous about giving it this score.\\n\\n\r\nSitting down every Tuesday to watch this felt like a chore, I thought about dropping this anime numerous times but as I did with K-on, I kept pushing through. Bored out of my mind, I finished. This will most likely be the last Slice of Life anime I watch (In the K-on style at least). Huh, funny. I keep calling it a Slice of Life yet it's not even listed as it's genre. Something must be wrong. Whelp that's my first review done, this was probably written poorly so hopefully I won't have to come across something like this show that I'll have the urge to review.",

            "content": "The original Soul Eater series was a shounen battle romp done right. It was zany, high-energy, and alternatingly funny and adrenaline pumping. It had a distinctive, colorful, and lively art-style that would make Tim Burton jealous, and an off-beat sensibility that separated it from most other shounen. It was a show that bled attitude; simultaneously unique and recognizable as a shounen title. The show is considered a classic of the late 2000\u2019s in some circles, and rightfully so. In stark contrast is its spin-off, Soul Eater NOT, a show that falls firmly into the conventions of its genre; in this case, slice-of-life anime (for themost part). Well, that\u2019s not entirely true, some of the magic that made the original such a blast is still there. However, it doesn\u2019t shine through nearly enough to overcome the decidedly over-treaded tropes that dominate the show. This is perhaps why Soul Eater NOT feels so lukewarm, and why it will likely be a disappointment fans of the original.\\n\\n\r\nThe show isn\u2019t bad for what it is trying to do, and certainly has some nifty things to offer. This spin-off takes place sometime before the main story, so some of the fun comes from seeing the original cast pop up and get a little insight on a few of them. We get to see Liz and Patty\u2019s edges soften as they go from hardened street thugs to the quirky sisters we know from the original Soul Eater series. It\u2019s also neat to see the beginning of Kim and Jacqueline\u2019s partnership, and why Sid is a zombie. However, the most important bit of information that the show offers is that not all the students in Death Weapon Meister Academy are badass fighters. Some weapons and meisters are just learning how to control their powers so they can live normal lives, these students are put into the NOT class.\\n\\n\r\nSome such students are the three heroines of the show: Tsugumi, Meme, and Anya. They\u2019re a rather odd trio in that Tsugumi is the only weapon of the three, while Meme and Anya are both meisters. Since partnerships usually consists of only one meister, though it can have multiple weapons, it\u2019s up to Tsugumi to choose who her partner will be. Of course, with Tsugumi being the archetypical nice yet indecisive heroine that she is, this is one of the central plot-lines of the show. Much of the show\u2019s duration is spent with the trio getting into misadventures and deepening their friendship, with appearances and cameos from the original cast sprinkled in. Needless to say, this means the show is largely light-hearted fair, with tons of silly shenanigans and a lot of quaint scenes of cute girls doing cute things, though of course it has some dramatic moments mixed in. Being set in as zany a place as DWMA, there is no shortage of strange situations for the girls to encounter or colorful personalities for them to meet. It\u2019s light and comfortable and has a quaint charm to it, unfortunately, it also greatly lacks inspiration. Tsugumi, Meme, and Anya are ultimately too plain of protagonists. They don\u2019t have the extremely distinctive quirks and personalities of the original\u2019s cast; it often feels like someone grabbed the protagonists of generic School Comedy A, and dropped them into the Soul Eater universe. The humor can often also come across as uninspired, not necessarily unfunny, but just too commonplace in slice-of-life anime. The material has a feeling of being done before multiple times, which diminishes the show\u2019s charm. It dilutes the twisted weirdness that made Soul Eater so appealing to begin with, watering it down into something inferior. At times, it honestly feels like a waste of the setting.\\n\\n\r\nOf course, this belonging to the franchise that it does, there is a plotline that involves fighting and nefarious schemes, lurking beneath the slice-of-life antics. Citizens of Death City are going on sprees of violence, under the control of a witch. Sid and other DWMA staff are trying to find the witch causing these attacks before things get worse, and while Tsugumi and her friends are blissfully unaware of the unseen threat, they soon find themselves right in the middle of it all. In stark contrast to the fluffiness of most of the show\u2019s material, this plotline is ominous and creepy. The tonal shift is honestly rather jarring, especially when an episode which is mostly contains light-hearted shenanigans has an eerie scene that has a threat written in what can only be assumed to be blood end the episode off. It doesn\u2019t gel well with the rest of the show\u2019s content because tonally it is on the opposite side of the spectrum. Which is sort of a shame, because the best part of the show is this darker plotline. Shaula, the younger sister of Medusa and Arachne from the first Soul Eater series, is a menacing presence. She lurks around in the shadows, plotting chaos and murder, so gleeful in her evil that it\u2019s almost infectious. The show always gets more interesting whenever she makes an appearance to disrupt the typical slice-of-life fluff, and it\u2019s her villainy that provides the show with its most striking and memorable moment: a day at the market that takes horrific turn. It also puts Tsugumi and her friends through an emotional wringer, giving their relationship some much needed conflict. Unfortunately, the show never strikes a balance to make the tones fit together, and it culminates in a less than spectacular final battle, at least for this franchise.\\n\\n\r\nOn the technical side of things, Soul Eater NOT is also a step down from the original series, but it\u2019s still a good looking show for the most part. Character designs are cutesier than before, which is certain to rub some fans the wrong way. However, the world retains the off-kilter and colorful outlandishness that makes it standout as unique, creepy laughing sun and all. The animation concerning characters\u2019 body language and behavior is pretty solid, however, action sequences are spotty. Some fights look good, some look average, and some look genuinely bad. Even at their best, the action sequences here never reach the exhilaration and excitement of those of the first series. The music is pleasant, fits the show tonally in both its silly and serious moments, and is used accordingly. However, it is just not a soundtrack that will be memorable or that supports the content in an exceptional way. It does its job, and little more than that.\\n\\n\r\nI\u2019ve compared Soul Eater NOT to its predecessor quite a bit in this review. While that might not be completely fair, as a show should be judged by its own merits, it isn\u2019t without justification. The sad fact of the matter is that NOT suffers from the same stigma most spin-offs do, it doesn\u2019t live up to the expectations set by the original; both in content and quality. When a show uses the name of a franchise, viewers will have set expectations, fair or not. It\u2019s only when a spin-off adds something substantial or improves upon the material that fans will react positively to it; those kind of spin-offs are a rarity. Unfortunately, Soul Eater NOT is not amongst those rare exceptions. It has problems even when it is not being compared to the original, and ultimately doesn\u2019t add anything of great substance to the much beloved series.\\n",

            "content": "The title of the series speaks for itself. For starters, this is definitely NOT Soul Eater. If fans were eager to wait for a long anticipated Soul Eater sequel or remake, then look elsewhere. It just seems that Bones didn\u2019t decide to do such a project and instead focused on this alternate spinoff, with characters from the original series making cameos but is, and will NOT be a Soul Eater continuation from the same author. Still, this show has its own ways to shine and that\u2019s NOT an understatement.\r\nDespite being a spinoff, the show still takes place in the same universal setting and that\u2019s theinfluential academy of DWMA. One might also label this as a prequel though since many of the events happens before the original series. It could be beneficial to watch original Soul Eater series to familiarize yourself with some of the cameo characters. However, it is not imperative. In fact, this show focuses on a trio of girls that chronicles their daily lives in a strange yet innovative world of spiritual power. \\n\\n\r\nStarting with 14-years old Tsugumi Harudori, we quickly find out in the beginning that she is not a normal girl. After a certain incident involving her realizing the essence of her being as a weapon, she goes to Death Weapon Meister Academy (DWMA) as part of the NOT (Normally Overcome Target) class to discover her potential. The catch is that she is still a beginner and a newbie at the academy, until she meets fellow students Meme Tatane and Anya Hepburn. It\u2019s from here that the trio forges a powerful friendship that tells the story of this show. For Tsugumi though, she is an average girl with average skills. Her ability to turn into a weapon (halberd) may seem admirable but takes effort to pull through. The first episode depicts her transformation the first time as she embraces her destiny. But really, she is just a normal girl with normal traits. Unlike her two other friends, her skills lacks in comparison.\\n\\n\r\nEnter Meme and Anya, the other two protagonists. Although existing as polar opposites, they possesses skills that makes Tsugumi in awe whenever they display their abilities. Meme, a bubbly girl with a short-term memory, is shown as a girl that cares about her friends. And despite being well endowed and sometimes spacing out during class, her athleticism is a testament that people admire. On the other hand, we have Anya, an elegant girl with a more egoistic nature who often choses to refer others as \u201ccommoners\u201d. Her encounter with Tsugumi sticks out as a fascination because she seems Tsugumi as the ultimate commoner. But despite her haughty, tsundere tendencies, and cold behavior towards other people, it\u2019s easy to see that she truly wants to become friends with others. She also shows an antithesis of the classic princess-type character for her boldness to explore; in fact one of her reasons to enroll at DWMA for discovery and learning. Further evidence of her boldness involves her tactics to take risks such as her fight with Tsugumi as a weapon against a fellow student and later on against a real threat. Maybe the trio don\u2019t possesses much in common (hell, even the hair color serves as a gimmick) but they share a bond of unique friendship, forged by their connections.\\n\\n\r\nThe show might have a different cast of main characters but other members from the original Soul Eater does make cameos. Some in fact plays more important roles such as Maka, Soul Evans, and Sid. Other characters such as Black Star, the Liz sisters, and Death the Kid serves more as guidance and progress with the story to evolve. However, this doesn\u2019t work out right for this show on some occasions. This is because the show has a taste of slice of life where some episodes stands out to depict every day events and experiences. And despite the show taking place in a fantasy world, the realism can be related for characters such as Liz and Patty for their pasts. Also, one prominent feature involves Tsugumi as we witness her growth. There\u2019s a contrast between this show and the original Soul Eater in terms of motivations. From the original series, Maka (the main character) already has a dream and what she wanted to be when she grew up similar to most characters. Here, we have Tsugumi, an average girl with potential but yet doesn\u2019t entirely know what to do with it. Throughout the series, she develops more confidence as result of the time she spent with her friends. Yet on various occasions, she still doesn\u2019t stand out too much especially during dire situations when standing beside Meme and Anya. From some points, her progress can feel sappy in a ride that feels off balance, especially compared to its parent series. But do note that the show does have its more grim moments later on involving a dangerous antagonist with a taste for experiments.\\n\\n\r\nTo get full enjoyment from this show is to appreciate the relationship dynamics between the characters. Supporting character also get their own spotlights such as Kim and Jackie, the Liz sisters, among others. Their relationship may differ a bit from our main trio but their purpose remains the same \u2013 to illustrate the nature of characters and how they can build connections with one off another. Otherwise, some nature of the characters can feel a bit of prejudice when the term \u2018witch\u2019 is used. This is evidenced with Kim\u2019s presence in the show as she feels a weight of stress but yet is able to maintain her cherry self. On the other hand though is a weakness in characterization especially with development. Most characters suffers from this either in a lack of background depth or change. To cut to the chase, the show doesn\u2019t do well when it tries to focus itself with character development.\\n\\n\r\nJudging from a standalone point, the show has its many similarities and differences. The similarity involves perhaps the mechanics explained in the beginning such as the NOT and EAT classes. Other terms such as meister, witch, and traitors also become terms with established usages. Classes are taught at the academy in a similar fashion to the original series by experienced instructors. On the other hand, differences expands more than just the style of the story. The comedy is instead influenced by the characters\u2019 gags and gimmicks. On several occasions, the show can even feel like watching a typical \u2018cute girls doing cute things\u2019 with its aesthetics. Here, it\u2019s also expanded by the cutesy relationships, fashionable maid outfits, and occasional fan service. As opposed to a full all out on shounen story, we get a borderline slice of life tale chronicling a trio of cute girls. On the other hand, the story can seem rushed, blend, and feel crammed together at once.\\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s not about recreating the Soul Eater atmosphere again, but the show\u2019s artwork can come as a hit or miss in this category. The standard character designs achieves its purpose to make the girls look adorable and innocent to match their persona. Similarly, the background and fantasy like aura gives off a familiar vibe from Soul Eater. DWMA is designed to give fans that sense of nostalgia along with idyllic dose of its energy. But for what\u2019s worth, it doesn\u2019t feel serious on most occasions. There is enough action on occasions to bring back the Soul Eater shounen feeling. The bad news? Well, it would be the quality. Bones really dropped the ball with its production here as the action feels lifeless and dull. In the beginning though, it had consistency but later on is out of pace. Long story, short: it isn\u2019t a battle shonen anymore so don\u2019t expect high level action. Also expect some edgy fan service on occasions because like mentioned before, the show has a much lighter mood so expect much more goofy moments. \\n\\n\r\nSoundtrack functions as a device to supplement the Soul Eater NOT atmosphere. On most occasions, it is lighthearted with a good complimentary measure. The way is executed has a good balance with its slice of life mood and more ominous scenarios. The OP and ED song has eccentric energy to itself with some catchy dancing sequences. But to top it off are the character voice mannerisms. Character tones have a general yet admirable attribute to them to provide their roles. Anya, for instance, can speak in both a haughty yet caring voice. Other characters, in particular witches, speaks with a noticeable baleful voice to contrast the mood of the story. What you see is what you get though as the show has a clear goal in mind. The soundtrack and voice department achieved that.\\n\\n\r\nThis show might NOT be what the original series offered but it can still be a fun little ride of academic adventure. The trio of our main characters lacks purpose but builds on their connections to forge and tell stories. It is the charming relationships between the characters that paints this show as more than just a SOL ride. But if you\u2019re looking forward to a hardcore story or expansion of what Soul Eater had presented, then it\u2019s the wrong place. The comedy may seem also seem mindless at times but its gimmicks can be attractive when it stands out on its own. It may not be a masterpiece of the coming ages from the Soul Eater world but neither is it gagantous.\\n",

            "content": "First off, I'm not a reviewer.\r\nThis named prequel of the critically acclaimed \"Soul Eater\" has got me cringing and shuffling my hair, even more so than Eureka Seven's Pocket Full Rainbow movie. It surprised me that it did. Those who've read the manga and/or watched the anime series may have mixed feelings or downright hate it or love it, god knows why. \r\nStory, 3: The story had a lot of potential, but it really didn't go into much context at all. The witch comes in to destroy all of DWMA but her motives are devoid and unoriginal. It's just looking for blood and gore forher entertainment with no background or so to back up why to even say how she came to be who she was. The supporting characters are really weak as they feel like they're just there to set up things for the MC until she realizes the situation not until the second to last episode. Yes, throughout the show the MC who is the weapon, I don't remember their name, that's how bad it is, goes on with her slice of life show and while she yearns to become stronger she doesn't really go through much of a training sequence or desire a goal when it's clear that would've made her motive at DWMA much more stronger than the friendship stuff she would've had with it. For the most part, the main cast just strolls around and have fun and then get a friendship boost for the last level....I'll leave the rest to you.\\n\\n\r\nArt, 7: The art isn't really anything original or unique to say. It's similar to almost every anime in the last few years and present. Although it is quite refined and I haven't seen any derpy faces which kind of shows the studio gave the art a lot of time and effort.\\n\\n\r\nSound, 5: You know actually, I was so appalled by the characters every dialogue the sound I couldn't hear at all. Although I did like the opening song it was decent.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter, 1: There is no character. They are a mixture of cliche, generic stereotypes as if they were just created like the Power Puff Girls. The MC strives for nothing. She knows nothing like Jon Snow knows nothing yet he is COOL and does something like a badass. Here the MC, weapon girl, does not do anything. She doesn't even try to realize the situation in DWMA nor cares about anyone else other than her friends. Who cares about fodder. The other two MC, the meisters, are yet again a generic princess who knows martial arts but is useless most of the time until the plot calls for it. The forgetful girl with big boobs and the idiot among them although the weapon girl is also an idiot. if you think about it they are nothing but fan service and I'm okay with fan service but not the way it's presented here. As for the rest, the original cast I was glad to see but they don't represent them as good as the original series even though this is a prequel. I don't believe they were that bland. Everyone else is just used a tool to set everything up.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment, 1: If I cringed and shuffled my hair while moving around weirdly on my chair because of how bad and annoying this show was I'd be either crazy or this show is actually that appalling. There were moments that made me blush a little but it only lasted less than a second. It doesn't have any measure of excitement and the battle animations were terrible.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, 1: This show is the worst show I've ever seen earning itself a 1/10. This show literally SLAPS you in the face if you enjoyed the Soul Eater Manga or anime this show detriments everything the world and character of Soul Eater once was. It tried to give a different take but the way it presented slice of life with some action was god awfully bad. The final fight literally yelled \"PLOT\". Don't joke with me, I love slice of life and if you do too this show does not live up to the Soul Eater series let alone it's own genre. It is NOT worth anyone's time yet already many people watched it or is watching it. I just felt like slapping whoever wrote this. The characters are literally a combination of only cliche and generic things. They don't have a taste of originality like Death the Kid's obsession with symmetry. Now that's called character. And for those rating this show above average should write their own stories and see to themselves they could write an even story just as bad as this or better. The show's main point...there was not point. It's your usual friendship  stuff. The art and stuff was like I was watching any other anime that looked just like it. The conflicts within this story will kill your hype for expectations for the moment because it is a mind manipulation show. And that is my review without talking crap and spoiling anything. Although I actually did talk crap only.\\n\\n\r\nThen again I'm not a reviewer.",

I've read some negative feedback about it, but in truth it's an easy going anime. You don't have to guess or wonder about much, it's not like Hakuouki. The characters are very shallow and there is not much development throughout the 12 episodes. But...Regardless, if you've just finished watching/reading something brutal or brutally cute then Soul Eater Not is just what you need. It's mediocre in plot, but exceptional in quality (I simply love the animation). So go for it, I promise you won't have a mentalbreakdown like you did after the first episode of Attack on Titan or a completely and utterly confused look on your face after watching 3 episodes of Ergo Proxy.",

            "content": "Soul Eater NOT! is difficult to judge because it's hard to pick what standards to judge it from, as well as what demographic it is trying to accommodate. If you come in looking for a slice-of-life anime, the steep, intermittent changes in tone and the general story-arch may be jarring for many. If you are coming in for a story-driven action-fest akin to the original series, this show will disappoint with its sparse and short actions sequences and how few episodes are actually driving the story forward. This show also assumes you have seen the original series, else many of the unique concepts behind thecanon as well as back stories and cameos from the original story will be lost to the viewer. \\n\\n\r\nStory: \\n\\n\r\n    The first half or so of Soul Eater NOT is very episodic with little overarching story to speak of, instead using the time to introduce the characters as they go about their first semester at DWMA. The last six episodes is when the story starts kicking it in to gear, but up through the end I found it somewhat shallow, both in complexity and scale. The anime does offer up some quite entertaining moments, whether its humorous or unsettlingly dark and unexpected, but these are relatively few and far between. Overall, it is a very \"the power of friendship\" kind of story, so be aware. \\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\\n\r\n    There isn't a lot to say about the art except that it was \"okay.\" As a slice of life the colorful and somewhat simplistic nature of the bulk of the animation holds up fine, but the few action sequences were largely hit-or-miss; some scenes were relatively fluid and enjoyable, while others were completely lacking. \\n\\n\r\nSound: \\n\\n\r\nAgain, the sound was okay for the purposes. The voice-acting was decent enough, as I didn't find myself cringing at any particular characters when they spoke. The music was forgettable however; literally I can't remember any of the songs besides the opening...\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: \\n\\n\r\nIn terms of the three main characters, their personalities and motivations are pretty generic; you can pretty much pin them to a T from the first episode or two. You have the main girl who wants to get stronger to protect her friends, one who lived her child-hood in high class and wanted to escape it, and the overly enthusiastic, dim-witted one. Not much else to say. \\n\\n\r\nThe supporting cast is where I believe much of the show's entertainment lies, as long as you are familiar with the original series. Many recognizable faces are present in one way or another, and it was actually very interesting seeing their stories expanded upon from before the events of Soul Eater without any major discrepancies of the overall canon. I feel that I would have enjoyed the show much more if it gave more focus to this pre-story in terms of these recurring characters. There are a few characters, however, that I feel are not given proper justice and/or inconsistent if you are familiar with the original canon. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: \\n\\n\r\nAs I stated before, most of my enjoyment came from the expanded narrative around the supporting cast. I didn't find the show overly bad in any way, but as I am confessedly not a huge fan of the slice-of-life genre, those who are fans may get more out of it than I did. Although I still find the action-side of it lacking, if you are a fan of both genres and aren't afraid of switching between them in the same continuity, I would say go ahead and give it a whirl.",

            "content": "This show definitely does not deserve a 9, but I really enjoyed it so that's what I gave it! (Haters to the left)\r\nSTORY:\r\nAnyways this story centers around Tsugumi Harudori, a 14 year old girl who has found out only recently that she is a weapon. So she goes to the DWMA to learn how to control her newly found power and fight. A very similar story to the actual Soul Eater anime but revolving around the NOT class instead of the EAT class. (Hence the name, Soul Eater NOT)\r\nCHARACTERS:\r\nThe characters in this show were okay. None particularly stood out to me even though I enjoyedthem. The characters I did like however were mainly ones from the original anime like Kid, Maka, Soul, ect. One thing I really loved about this anime though is that they went into the background of a lot of minor characters from Soul Eater. I loved learning about Kim and Jacqueline and how they became partners. Also the fact that Kim is a witch was really interesting because they never mentioned anything about it in Soul Eater.\\n\\n\r\nART:\\n\r\nGorgeous. This is one of the prettiest art styles I've ever seen. I feel like it fit the tone of this show better than the other animation for Soul Eater (don't get me wrong, I love Soul Eater's animation too) would have. \\n\\n\r\nSOUND:\\n\r\nMeh. It was alright. Nothing really stood out to me. I did enjoy the opening though.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT OVERALL:\\n\r\nDefinitely not worth a 9, but I enjoyed it so I keeping it a 9. I'd say only watch this if you're a major fan of the actual anime and are very forgiving XD",

            "content": "Let me get this straight, the reason why I watched this show is to actually view the old characters one last time *cries*. The fact that I miss Death the Kid, Black Star, Maka Albarn, Tsubaki Nakatsukasa, Patty and Liz Thompson, and of course, Soul E. Evans (I'll have you know I placed those names without consulting google and other websites. I memorized them!), immediately I was in cloud nine after receiving a notice that the spin-off of Soul Eater will be released. I actually kind of expected that Not! will not satisfy me but I didn't expect it to disappoint me this much.\r\nThe storyis labeled as decent for score but for me it's unsatisfactory. You want the idea of having a dark and action-packed show like Soul Eater, instead you get a flow of story about teenage girls who can't solve their problems in getting a partner. It is a slice of life rendition of Soul Eater. It shows the everyday life of students INSIDE DWMA. Their lives are different from the former gang, it's less complicated and duller. Their singing is excruciating and this show cannot be K-On. Dear Bones, you cannot be Kyoto Animation! Not ever! The cuteness, plot holes, fillers, and unhelpful shits in the story made me regret watching this show.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is lazy and pathetic. I get the idea of how the characters are younger and cuter but, COME ON!! There is no reason to make the art look so, sluggish and shitty! I do not like how the characters looked like mashed paintings or abstract figures! Have you seen that fight with Eternal Feather? (reference: Youtube) It was the saddest animation I have ever seen in my entire life. It looked like 15 year old kids could do that fighting scene. Setting the fighting scenes aside (which is I think only 3 or 4 scenes), I see how uncomfortable it is to watch huge breasts floating all over my eyes. The only thing that I loved was Shaula's hair and Sid's younger face (which is a bit hot). \\n\\n\r\nThe sound was okay but not good enough, sorry.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters were the worst. the way Atsushi Okubo created them were not what I hoped he'd do. I hate their personalities and their corny and cheesy moments just made me puked. The MC which I don't remember her name anymore was really plain. She has two ponytails which made her look more childish and useless. She also makes this idiotic catchphrases that makes my eyes twitch and for some reason they laugh for the heck of it. The other, with the huge boobs were drastically made for fanservice. She has a short term memory which I guess is not original and I hate how she flirts like a yuri character. The commoner lover which I can remember her name is I think, Anya? She has this uncontrollable personality, the tsundere type. I personally hate most tsunderes. They blush all the time trying to make characters worry and all and they think they're so cute but they actually have a dysfunctional and suckish personality. I'm sorry but this dumb trio is nothing like the group I loved from the first season. Stein, the old characters, and the coffee manager were the only characters that were less disappointing.\\n\\n\r\nI didn't enjoy it, I regret watching it.\\n\\n\r\nI think you guys need to see this first before watching the original Soul Eater to compare the beauty of Soul Eater and the wickedness of this poorly-animated show. I just wanted to see that original characters one last time *sobs mathematically* but I never would've guessed that this show would be a rip-off. \\n\r\n#lame\\n\r\n#iknowthisisnttwitter\\n\r\n#idontcare\\n\r\n#thisanimeisbullshit\\n\\n\r\nI cannot guys, I just can't. I'm just thankful that this became possible because in that way I can see the characters again. So I guess this is goodbye, Soul Eater? *cries so hard that it breaks everything in its path*\\n",

Although, the only likenesses they share is their name and characters.Those who have not read the manga may be in for a bit of a surprise, Soul Eater NOT is a slice of life and lacks much of the action and suspense Soul Eater has. But, what it does is give the audience a great background into the events that transpired before the start of Soul Eater.\r\nArt: 7/10 The artwork in Soul Eater NOT was the only letdown for me. The art is quite different from Soul Eater's. To make the show fit theslice of life genre the producers made all the characters more \"cutesy\". I personally would have rather seen it with the original artwork, but whatever.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 8/10: The characters are showcased well, and some background information is provided to make the characters seem less shallow. I enjoy the interpersonal conflict that persist throughout the show on who Tsugumi will choose as her partner.\\n\\n\r\nOverall I rate it an 8/10. I feel this is fair because, for a slice of life anime, it has its fairly dramatic moments, coupled with other conflicts. I think if you have seen Soul Eater and are a fan, this would be worth your while. NOT really gives good insight into the protagonist from both shows and what led up to the events in Soul Eater. I would not suggest you watch this before watching the original Soul Eater or it will be very hard to follow and you will have very little enjoyment from it. Gagantous!",

The characters were all well thought out. All of them were brilliant, apart from the blasphemous Black Star, but put that behind and then you had a very good show.\r\nI couldn't wait for this series to come out. But I watched through untill the third episode and just decided to chuck a brick at my TV set. We had a well explained well planned show, that got blown to bits though this series, Soul Eater NOT! Thegreat action parts, are gone. All this show is now is a lesbian musical. Not an action show, which by the way, everyone wants.\\n\\n\r\nWhy would you change something that worked so good. This is going to kill the series unlesss they cut out all of the childish crap.... In short your new show is bloody annoying!!!\\n\\n\r\n4/10 Story:  yes there is a story. Through what I've seen and heard, all there really is to it are three 14 year old girls(spoiler alert) who meet, live together, work in a restaurant, annoyed Liz and Patty, then killed a witch... That about it\\n\r\n8/10 Art:  the animation is brilliant. One of the best I've ever seen\\n\r\n2/10 Sound: the squeaking voices and singing... Its really painful to listen to... Very annoying\\n\r\n1/10 Character:  I'm sorry, but there's really nothing to be said here. The characters weren't in my opinion very well thought out. It seems as though these new characters were just plomped into the series\\n\r\n1/10 Enjoyment:  not in the least... Yes there are some funny pieces. But the little amusement you get from this series gets plundered everytime those childish squeaking kids do something\\n\r\n3/10 Overall:  Wouldn't watch this series ever again... Had to buy a new TV set thats how annoying this series is... I would recommend watching the normal Soul Eater series instead\\n\r\nUnless you prefer lesbian musicals...\\n",

            "content": "Definitely a good watch. But, if you are expecting the non-stop action and fights that the OG series has, then you will be let down. It definitely moves at a much slower pace as well.\r\nLearning that there is indeed an \"EAT\" class and a \"NOT\" class, depending on an individuals power and will to fight and the differences between the two,  was enlightening. The story centers around the three MC's, all female students in the \"NOT\" class, and it goes through out their stay at the DWMA as they try to cope with their abilities while trying to still live a regular, normal lifew/o all the fighting that the students in the \"EAT\" class are preparing for. You learn about the daily routines of the students, and the hardships that accompany them as they try to hone their abilities. Being able to see this secondary path the students can take at the DWMA was a great concept. The series definitely focuses on friendship, which the OG series does as well, but in a less coarse way unlike the OG. At times this series does slow to a snail's pace in terms of the plot. But, if you stick with it, it does pick up in intensity towards the latter part of the series.  All of this is done in a very cutesy way. Almost too cutesy at times. (Lol)\\n\\n\r\nYou also get to meet a good amount of the original characters as well, as they make sporadic appearances throughout this series. It was very awesome to see them all in the \"early' years at the DWMA, and how their roles took shape. You also get a good amount of background on them through this series, which answered a fair amount of questions that I had after finishing the OG series. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters are developed very well. You learn almost everything you need to know about the characters in a timely manner, and the relationships between characters are developed very smoothly. The flash backs and back story is all well placed, eliminating a lot of the possible confusion that could've come about if it wasn't. \\n\\n\r\nThe art style/ animation used is very good. Very consistent with what you'd come to expect for a Soul Eater series. Same with the music. Each character has unique physical traits, and definitely all are unique.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, the series provides a good amount of enjoyment. It is a worthy prequel to the OG series, and provides you with some great background. They did a great job in connecting the two series, while not taking away from the originality of this current series.",

The show picks up around episode 4 and is actually relatively decent. \r\nGiven the first 3 episodes you expect this to be a slice of life anime, set in the Soul Eater universe. However, you do eventually get actual plot points, and some interesting things do start to happen. Slowly it starts becoming more and more similar to the original. \r\nPlot: Slow to get started, but ultimately itsfine. \\n\r\nCharacters: We get to see some of the original cast, and they are fine (mostly due to nostaglia) I never really warmed to the new characters).\\n\\n\r\nOverall: Not fantastic and strictly worse than the original, but not a complete waste of your time either.",

            "content": "Soul Eater NOT is arguably the anime equivalent of ice cream on pizza. Two perfectly wonderful foods that when combined create something far less than the sum of its parts.\r\nSoul Eater is without a doubt a cult classic with a unique art style and one of the things that makes it shine as a piece of art is its reluctance to rely on clich\u00e9 tropes to float the narrative that, in this case, stands strong on its own merits. There's nothing to say a sequal/prequal would be inherently bad or disliked and i'm sure fans would welcome such a project providing it honoured the originaluniverse (you could probably deduce from that remark that Soul Eater NOT does not).\\n\\n\r\nSo what makes SE:NOT so bad? Slice of life is often a refreshing change of pace to the otherwise typically fantastical stories that dominate the world of anime, cartoons and TV media in general. I enjoy both action and slice of life so i like to think i am not biased in judging this show on both accounts since i approve of both equally anyway. Simply put, SE:NOT is a failure of juxtaposition and a failure of writing. That is to say it fails to really choose what it wants to be and then fails at both, then trying to fix it after-the-fact with popular tropes rather than making something not broken to begin with. Trying to cash in on both the contemporary \"cutesie\" SoL element that has become popular recently and the rough and raw elements of SE that made it popular back in the day simultaneously.\\n\\n\r\nThe original Soul Eater universe plays such a small and even moot role in this title it begs an obvious question of why they even bothered. The DWMA plot could be replaced by any other similar concept and functioned all the same, if not better. Which makes one consider the likelihood this was simply an attempt to milk an existing popular title to boost views on an otherwise generic, magic themed SoL. The cute generic main characters seem almost injected into a foreign world, slapped on like a sticker or after thought.\\n\\n\r\nIf i were to summarise my thoughts on this title it would be that the authors should have chosen one concept and run with it for the sake of consistency. Either honoured the original title with a proper sequel/prequel instead of a half arsed spin-off with cameo's or stuck with a SoL with magical elements and utilised the typical conventional art style for an original story that would have stood humbly on its own.\\n\\n\r\nThe attempt to try both smacks of laziness, but also a surreptitious money grab and neither sit well with me as a consumer.\\n\\n\r\nIf you like Soul Eater, cameo's and slice of life then you may want to check it out if only to tick it off your list. It's not horrible, but it wont blow you out of the water either.",

Instead, it follows a group of three freshmen students at Death Academy, totally new to the Soul Eater story. Fighting is literally nonexistent in the story. There's more unnecessary ecchi, and the animations have changed to fit a seeming younger audience. The main characters of Soul Eater (Maka, Soul, Blackstar, etc.) show up like once.

            "content": "I have a strong suspicion that I'll ruffle a few feathers when I say that I prefer this short moe spin-off of Soul Eater over the original Soul Eater anime, but I don't feel that that stance is at all unjustified. This review's going to be pretty comparative, as the original series has flaws that, when viewed alongside the spin-off, throw Soul Eater NOT's strong points into sharp relief.\r\nThe big issue with Soul Eater that marks it as a resoundingly average anime series is its delusions of grandeur, its utter conviction that it has coherent context and engaging subtext. In reality, Soul Eater lacks either.It adopts the persona of a broody shounen that uses a madcap style in order to contrast over-the-top comedy with darker storytelling, but that's all pretentious because it makes no effort to effectively deconstruct the majority of its characters and link them to any overt underlying message. The result feels moody without justification, like it wants to be taken seriously despite the fact that it isn't actually saying anything (in a sense, the anime equivalent of Tim Burton's more recent films). The majority of the characters (with the obvious exceptions of Black Star, Crona and Stein) feel more like archetypes or cardboard cutouts than realistic or relatable individuals.\\n\\n\r\n(Before we continue, I would like to assure you that this applies to the anime and not to the manga, which I found to be fairly enjoyable by comparison and much more competently written).\\n\\n\r\nThat's Soul Eater, but what about NOT, the actual focus of this review. It's a weird little series this: smaller in both scale and length, but a lot deeper and much more impactful. It asserts both subtext and context in a manner that the original lacked, and does so without adopting a needlessly pretentious tone tailored to disguise the flatness of the overall experience. Soul Eater NOT is actually good. It's undeniably fanservice for viewers of the original, but it's a good kind of fanservice that adds more to existing plot threads and builds upon the established universe. It explores backstories not seen in SE and outlines aspects of the established setting in greater detail, helping to construct a world that feels much more vivid and engaging. In exploring the pasts of original characters, it fleshes them out further and makes them infinitely more memorable. Rare appearances from the main teams of SE are welcome, particularly in Maka's case because she actually has a role in our protagonist's development. Still fanservice in the end, but not JUST fanservice.\\n\\n\r\nNOT also manages to establish a clear subtext and overarching message about the importance of hard work, friendship and determination (cheesy stuff, but nonetheless effective for it). It does this through actual characterisation that links in strongly to the themes, as well as an appropriate balance of upbeat humour and long-term suspense. Some may find Tsugumi's concerns about her physical fitness much more trivial than the concerns of the protagonists of the original, but given the predominantly teenage audience this is a much more relatable character trait. The protagonists are all endearingly quirky without being archetypes of quirkiness. We come to enjoy the fun times that we spend with them, and we find ourselves concerned for their well-being when danger arises, and thanks to our emotional investment in not just their existence but their own personal struggles, the essential message shines even stronger. The protagonists are relatable; because of that, we worry when things go wrong and we are relieved when they go well. That is the essence of emotional response to film.\\n\\n\r\nLet's step away from the positive for now and think about the negatives a little, for Soul Eater NOT is far from perfect. I suppose animation is the big one: we're lucky enough to have been born in a decade where high-quality animation is the norm, and so it stands out when a show hasn't received a good treatment. The aesthetic itself isn't bad and the character designs complement the upbeat tone well. The issue is that NOT\"s movements are very clunky; character models are inconsistent and at worst can seem blocky and ugly. The problems show the most in the fight scenes, when the actual detailed movements don't feel as smooth as they potentially could've been and the camera stays very fixed, detracting somewhat from the sense of spectacle that would otherwise enhance the cinematic experience. One suspects that Soul Eater NOT didn't get the budget it really deserved.\\n\\n\r\nAt other times, some of the characters do end up feeling like they're left by the wayside a bit. Our protagonists - Tsugumi, Anya and Meme - are fleshed out fairly well, but the series  does have a bad habit of establishing characters who have only brief roles and treating them as if they are significant. The villain is your average \"embodiment of evil\", the bread-and-butter of the Soul Eater animated universe. The story actually does give some engaging backstory to characters that the original series forgot to explore (which is nice), and these characters do end up having strong overarching presences, but one does wonder whether they should've simply been explored in depth as part of the original itself (though obviously, this isn't NOT's issue).\\n\\n\r\nTo finalise:\\n\r\n+Simple but effective overarching themes.\\n\r\n+Strong development in core characters, who are all relatable and endearing.\\n\r\n+Builds upon the established context and creates a more vividly real setting.\\n\r\n+A much more appropriate tone than the original.\\n\r\n+NOT actually incorporates the first major protagonist death in the animated franchise.\\n\r\n-Mediocre animation.\\n\r\n-Arbitrary side characters.\\n\\n\r\nAll-in-all, Soul Eater NOT is good. It deserves your time if you've seen the original series, but don't bother to power your way through the original simply for NOT's sake. It doesn't have a standalone existence, but is a much stronger contribution to the franchise than its big brother.",

            "content": "The main problem I have with this show isn't that it's a slice of life Yuri show. In fact, if that's what it was I probably wouldn't even be bothering to write this review. It wouldn't be worth it. \r\nWhat makes me angry about this show is that it's a spin-off of one of my favorite shows of all time, and it manages to COLOSSALLY SCREW EVERYTHING UP! \r\nStory/Character: The story is meh. It gets okay near the end once the actually pretty cool and menacing villain shows up. And at least some things got decent explanation. My main problem with the characters though isthat they are not the main characters from the original show. The protagonist is basically a Maka fangirl, blushing and stuttering whenever she's around (the original cast does show up, but only every now and then and only in cameos, except the Thomson sisters, who are BARISTAS AT A CAFE). Meme is basically just an idiot with short-term memory loss. And even characters from the original show are not as interesting or compelling as they used to be. And many events that are obviously supposed to have some kind of emotional impact have none because the original show exists. The only half-decent new characters are, in my opinion, the villain and Anya. At least Anya is semi-consistent and actually seems to have reasons for her actions. And the villain is a total discount Medusa, but Medusa was an AWESOME villain, so... if it ain't broke, don't fix it?\\n\\n\r\nArt/Sound: The op is catchy. The rest of it is entirely forgettable. The art is probably the best part of the show. It's definitely cute and appealing and actually conforms more to how the characters look in the manga than the original show. This makes me hate how the original cast looks. I love the art of the original show. And it bugged me. Though the new characters are cute. And for a show like this, having cute characters is a must. Therefore I can say that the show delivers there. \\n\\n\r\nThis show sucks. It has no real target audience. And it sucks. If you're a fan of the original, give it a shot, but you'll probably hate it. If you didn't like the original, don't bother.",

            "content": "Soul Eater NOT!  Is not a sequel to the original Soul Eater, it is considered a side story with different characters, but the same setting. However, the actions take place before the events in the original series. \r\nIn the title - Soul Eater NOT!, NOT stands for Normally Overcome Target, but it might be a wordplay since the anime has almost nothing to do with the serious battles and action of the original. \r\n\u2022\tSTORY \r\nAs I said the focus of the story are not the characters from Soul Eater (Maka, Soul, Kid, Death Star, etc.), even though they do make a few appearancesin the show and Maka certainly has a role in the plot. \\n\r\nThe story revolves around three girls entering the NOT class. The focus is put on the things students in DWMA do in their free time \u2013 when not in class. It shows a bit more of Death City, the girl dorm and a caf\u00e9 in the city. Even though the story is quite more relaxed and slow paced, lack of action is compensated for in the final 2-3 episodes. A witch with strong mind control powers \u2013 Shaula Gorgon - makes an appearance and is the main villain in the show. In overall, the show might remind you of the original in its final two or three episodes where an actual fight erupts and important decisions are made.\\n\r\nBasically, the show lacks the action of the original and the focus in on the daily lives of DWMA students. \\n\r\n\u2022\tCHARACTERS \\n\r\nThere are three main characters, all of which are girls. Harudori Tsugumi, a weapon, lacks self confidence and is very indecisive. However Maka manages to encourage her not to give up and defend her friends with all means possible. Anya Hepburn, a meister, actually a princess who came to DWMA to study the life and manners of commoners. Meme Tatane, another meister, who tendst to be very forgetful and clumsy, but in the same time skilled in battles. \\n\r\nThe three girls meet on the first day of school and easily become friends. The interesting thing is that we are showed two meisters using one weapon for the first time. \\n\r\nAs you can probably tell, there is strong character development for all the girls. They experience a lot together and manage to overcome everything with a lot of effort which certainly helps them evolve. \\n\r\nTwo boys from the EAT (especially advanced talents) class take part of the action \u2013 Akane Hoshi and Clay Sizemore. They have a few very important tasks to do in the plot. \\n\r\nAlso, there appears to be a witch in DWMA, called Kim Diehl(those who have read the Soul Eater might recognize her, since she appeared there and had interactions with Kid). However she is not a spy or anything like that and helps DWMA however she can. She has an interesting personality and tends to take money for everything, which makes her a really fun and enjoyable character to observe.  \\n\r\nAs I said the main characters from Soul Eater do make an appearance, even though just for a little bit. However, the focus is far away from them. The one thing that disappointed me a lot was that Shinigami-sama never made an appearance in the show. I think it is important to show him at least once since he is the most important character for the entire city, not to mention the school. \\n\r\n\u2022\tART \\n\r\nThe art of Soul Eater NOT!  Has almost nothing to do with the art in the original. However, I found it really enjoyable. Everything was well drawn and animated, attention was paid to every detail. Everything typical for a 2014 anime show. And it is not one of those censured animes, which don\u2019t show blood, there is a normal amount of blood for that kind of a show. For those wondering, the producers of Soul Eater NOT! Include Bones, FUNimatio, TV Tokyo and Square Enix. \\n\r\nMUSIC\\n\r\nThe music is also good, for that kind of show. There weren\u2019t many intense moments with tense music, but everything was suitable for the setting. Tense music, however, appeared when necessary. \\n\r\nThe opening and ending themes are performed by Haruka Chisuga, Aoi Yuuki, Saori Hayami and Dancing Dolls!!. The music itself is by Yuki Hayashi and Atsami Tachibana. \\n\r\nI usually don\u2019t pay much attention to the opening and ending of an anime after the first episode, so I can\u2019t say much, but I was not annoyed by them at all. \\n\\n\r\nIn overall, Soul Eater NOT!  Puts the focus on the other side of DWMA, the daily lives of students and the NOT class. If you are looking for a show with a lot of action and intense battles you won\u2019t find it in Soul Eater NOT!. However, the show is interesting and makes the environment around Death City and DWMA more clear. \\n\r\nIt is a nice show and a good way to relax and maybe slightly remember about the original Soul Eater.  \\n",

            "content": "Britt: Jeez. I don't even....Golly gee. This was....something. \r\nI know I just did a review, but I felt like doing another before I forget about all the complaints I have with this series. \r\nLet me tell you that I watched up to episode 9 and didn't really want to watch more. There's 12 episodes in total, so I really think I watched more than I thought I actually would. Because I um....this anime was....weird. I guess.\r\nLet's uh, start with the story:\r\nStory: \"Soul Eater NOT! is a spin-off and side story that takes place one year prior to the events of the original Soul Eater. Atthe Death Weapon Meister Academy, humans born with the power to transform into weapons and those with the power to wield these weapons (Meisters) train to hone their natural talent. The characters of the main series are enrolled in the Especially Advantaged Talent class, where they train to become warriors of justice capable of defeating what threats prey on innocent lives\u2014or even the entire world.\\n\\n\r\nOther students at the DWMA are less talented. Members of the Normally Overcome Target class focus less on being warriors of justice and more on controlling their powers so they don't hurt themselves or anyone around them. Tsugumi Harudori, a new halberd-transforming student, meets Meisters Meme Tatane and Anya Hepburn and quickly grows indecisive about which of the two new friends should be her partner. As they learn to use these powers and settle in, their lives as everyday students will be far from normal.\"\\n\\n\r\nAs I said, I didn't finish this anime because I didn't want to. I was watching ERASED originally, but then I got my boyfriend into it and we decided to watch the rest of it together. While I'm waiting to watch it with him again, I decided to try and find another anime to watch in the mean time. I honestly couldn't decide on something I wanted to watch that had a dub. My mind kept coming to this anime, and I was actually trying to avoid it. So I decided to try watching Kim Possible or the second season of Miraculous Ladybug. The website I used for Ladybug didn't have episode 4 for some reason. It literally skips 4 and goes onto 5 and 6. So I thought \"this is stupid\" and moved onto Kim Possible....I loved KP when I was little, but after watching the first episode it's not as good as I remember it. (Nostalgia is a very powerful thing.) Soooo, I settled on this...anime. The story is really nothing to write home about. If you're a fan of the original Soul Eater, this probably threw you off. I'm not one of those \"hardcore Soul Eater fans\" who hate this anime simply for not being like the original. I read like, 3 volumes of the manga and thought it was cute. Had no problem with the change of tone it had from the original series. Nah, my problem with this anime lies in it's dull, cliche nature that is very inconsistent. Seriously. I don't think the author knew what he wanted this anime to be. At first it just seems like a slice-of-life. So I'm like \"yeah. I dig slice-of-life.\" But...Slice-of-life isn't even one of it's tags on MAL. So I'm like OK...There's also a lot of Yuri bait going on in this anime, yet....Yuri isn't in the tags either. OK.........2 tags that it does have however are Shounen and Action. And yeah...there's some action in this anime (very badly choreographed action), but it's so minimal that it's pretty much misleading. And this honestly feels more like a freaking Shoujo than a Shounen, and I feel like whoever added the tags to this thing reeeeally wanted people actually looking for that kinda stuff to be pissed off and/or disappointed. Really though, this anime tries to do too much. It wants to be dramatic in one scene, then RIGHT after that it's back to the Yuri bait. I can't tell if we're supposed to take any of this seriously or not. Are you trying to be an action drama or a slice-of-life? I don't know, and I don't think the author knows. So I give the \"story\" a 6 outta 10. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nI don't really....like any of the characters. Tsugumi was actually kind of annoying, even if she's the character I probably relate to the most. Anya was OK. She's a Tsundere, and I'm not really a fan of those. Meme was a freaking moron and her constantly stripping off her clothes and sneaking into Tsugumi's bed at night actually made me a little uncomfortable. The side characters are pretty \"meh\" at best. Kim is a b*tch. She could have the saddest backstory she wants to, but at the end of the day, making someone pay you money every time they use your cheap baseball equipment is pretty low. Jacqueline was meh. Just more Yuri bait cause of her \"crush\" on Kim. Eternal Feather is probably the only side character I actually cared about. And she was \"meh\" too. The guy characters, Akane and blonde haired dude (forgot his name) were also \"meh\". The characters from the original series didn't do much of anything at all. Except when Eternal Feather got possessed. And I guess Maka made sort of an impact on Tsugumi since she started wearing her hair like hers (even though she kinda looks like a mini Black Rock Shooter with that hair.) Otherwise, their cameos were a little meaningless. Kanna (I think her name is) was cute, but didn't do anything. Sid was OK, boss guy who they called \"Master\" (creepy) was OK, Liz and Patty....were OK....The villain........What were her motives again? Long story short, the characters are pretty boring, one dimensional, archetypes and I didn't really care if they lost or succeeded in...anything really. I don't have much else to say about the characters, so I guess they get a 6 too.\\n\\n\r\nArt/Animation:\\n\r\nEeeeeeh....The characters are cute. And the only time the animation looked off was when characters were fighting. The fighting was sooo weird here. Like, I know the original Soul Eater was action packed and had some pretty cool fights, but they really weren't needed here. They looked so stiff and unnatural. It was kinda cringy really. Other than the fight scenes, the animation was fine. Nothing spectacular or anything. Just decent. The character designs were more unique in the original, and looked a bit more generic here. But not terrible. Honestly....just take another 6. I really don't even know anymore.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nGENERIIIIIIC. *Ahem* Sorry. I'm not gonna spend a lot of time on this section. The Opening and Ending were both extremely generic. I don't even know if I can say they fit the show since everything is so inconsistent. Both songs are cutesy and cheery. And it seems like the anime wants to be more than that at times. I don't remember any of the background music or sounds, but the voice acting was fine. Just....take a 5 or whatever. I've given up.\\n\\n\r\nOverall Enjoyment:\\n\r\nEeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeh. It's probably....really difficult to tell, but I didn't hate this anime. I enjoyed some bits and pieces of it, but I thought it was mostly boring and cliche. The story is all over the place. One minute it's Yuri pandering and the creator can't even tell himself if Tsugumi is straight or homosexual since she switches between having a crush on Akane (which obviously won't go anywhere. How old is she again?) and being touchy feely with her gal pals. It wants to be an action anime one second then a slice-of-life. The characters are boring, the sound is generic, and the animation is average. All in all it's just a very VERY average anime. I wouldn't recommended it to fans of the original Soul Eater, but if you're bored (like I was) and just want an average, cute anime to watch, then maybe you'll enjoy this. \\n\\n\r\nOverall score is.......a 6. I honestly can't rank it any higher, but I'd feel bad if I rated it any lower (not including the sound portion where I gave it a 5.) Nothing is spectacular about this anime. I won't compare it to the original because that wouldn't be fair. \"Soul Eater\" isn't a masterpiece by any means, but it was better than this. More entertaining. Try watching both and see which one you prefer.",

            "content": "Ok, so I know alot of people have already ripped on this anime but I just wanted to add my thoughts on it. Yes Soul Eater NOT! is just a horrible anime- even looking at the anime by itself without treating it like a spin off this anime is just horrible (not the worst I have seen but still bad).\r\nIt is scraping the bottom of fanservice- with cute girls doing cute things for whatever reason (if you are into that stuff watch any Kyoto animation's anime you will probably have a better time) \r\nI can't even tell what the demographic for this girls? (but thethe number of fanservice shots and everything most girls will be turned away from), guys? (to cutsey), old soul eater fans?( to cutesey!, no action!, with almost NOTHING having to do with what made the original soul eater great)\\n\r\nIt's like a shallow shell of a cutesey slice of life anime TRYING to disguise itself as a action anime? Relying heavily on cameos of the original cast.\\n\r\nStory: 2\\n\r\nOk it starts off interesting as our main character suddenly finds out she's a weapon- interesting as in the original Soul Eater we mostly see the mesiters side of what's going on. It then takes a nose dive as the anime tries to take itself serious without really building on anything but relies heavily on fanservice, and character cameos. The only time I thought the story was going to go anywhere was with the eternal father episode but that whole thing gets dropped like a sack of potatoes.\\n\r\nAlso...it seems like the story was thought up with no real ending in mind. I mean the main girl is going to have to pick one partner at the end of it.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 5\\n\r\nNothing special.  There are bits of pieces were the animation shined but overall the animation looks very average.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 3\\n\r\nThe music is either trying to be cutsey or not noticeable at all. Although the sound effect and background noise is ok. Nothing special\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 1\\n\r\nVERY BAD. They are just one note characters with no taste. The anime just throws you these character without building any relationship or reason I should care. Do they have goals? Hobbies? Why are they at this school? What was there homelife like? (The closest we get is the fact that the rick girl lives with a rich family and that's it.)\\n\r\nI admit we do get some inner turmoil about the main girl who is a weapon- doubting herself, her powers, even who she should be partners with and questioning if she should have come to this school. Which is good but...we never really go deep into it with all this build up amounting to nothing.....getting no resolution.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 2\\n\r\nI can't help comparing this to the original Soul Eater- which it pails in comparing in EVERY SINGLE WAY. Even without comparing it, this anime is just bland. I know some people are seeing I completed this and wondered why the heck I actually continued watching this train wreck? Well I don't know either. I guess because I am a huge fan of Soul Eater and was hoping for this spin off to have something! Sadly I just feel like I wasted my time\\n\r\nI would not recommend this for anyone, even if they are a fan of soul eater- just go rewatch Soul Eater.",

            "content": "I rarely write reviews on here, but I'm going to now because I think this series gets a bad rap when plenty of people would really enjoy it.\r\nIf you love Soul Eater but dislike cute things, sure, it might not be for you. And if you love moe but don't want a bit of a dark side to your shows, you might not like it either. But if you're like me and you love both? You're in for a treat.\r\nSoul Eater NOT! is ADORABLE. But as it turns out, adorable things can be cool too! A lot of SE fans lamented Maka's appearance in thisseries, and I can see how it might be jarring compared to the super-slick style of the original, but I find this style appealing, too. And just because she's gotten a little squishier doesn't mean she can't still kick some ass! The cameos of characters from the main series alone make this series worth it for me.\\n\\n\r\nBut what I really love about this series is that it's an honest-to-goodness love triangle between three girls, not to mention the adorable side romance with Kim and and Jacqueline. Sure, there's no kissing, but it's still pretty damn gay, and incredibly sweet. \\n\\n\r\nI won't say the plot and its pacing are perfect, but they're fitting for a Soul Eater side story, and it fills in a lot of blanks from the main series (more information on Sid-sensei, for one). The OP and ED are super cute, although the OST itself isn't nearly as exciting as that of Soul Eater. \\n\\n\r\nSo overall, it's not for everyone, but it's definitely for me! And if you like your yuri/moe/slice-of-life with a bit more action, and especially if you like Soul Eater as well, I think you'll enjoy it.",

As a slice of life type of anime it was pretty enjoyable, and it did have a yuri feel though out the anime. The little fight scenes in the last half were pretty sick, but nothing too crazy or intense. It was also really cool to see the original characters make appearances every now and again,which made me want to rewatch all of Soul Eater. It would also be really sick to see a whole new series with all of the characters from both anime incorporated into a new story. The openings and ending were okay, but i liked them. Overall it's worth watching if you have nothing better to watch.\\n\\n",

            "content": "Contains minor character arc spoilers. But you'd probably see them coming, this isn't an M. Night Shyamalan-style anime.\r\nOne theme that stands out from this anime is \"normalcy\". This anime makes the otherwise hyper-violent, zany world of Soul Eater and makes the world, the art, the characters, the base concepts seem completely \"normal\". This is a lighthearted anime that's great for burning 4 hours.\r\nStory (7): \"Normal\". Very. We see very low-stakes situations that feed a minor inter-personal conflict between our main trio, eventually leading up to a final confrontation and resolution that takes place alongside a final boss-battle. At least stuff happens in some sort ofarc, they're not just sitting around talking about boys. Or bread. A lot of slice-of-life shows fail to deliver a narrative arc. This one's not terrible.\\n\\n\r\nArt (7): The art was technically competent and totally \"normal\". Nothing unusual in the art at all, nothing experimental. The stitched-up zig-zags from Soul Eater are gone, replaced with \"normal\" looking buildings. Even the cartoonish-looking school is drawn through normal eyes, as if the viewer/narrator has not witnessed the raw insanity that is present in this world.\\n\\n\r\nThere were no weird shot compositions, or at least none that stand out in my mind. The animation was decent, I didn't notice any significantly stuttering areas. The action scenes MAY have had some stutter due to the inherently non-action focus of the anime, but I wasn't overly aware of it. The quality was consistently \"good\". The \"outside\" backgrounds were a typical school-esque design, and the inside of the main trio's room was well detailed. As the seasons change, the trio puts decorations on their walls and desks that let you know they are way too excited about Halloween.\\n\\n\r\nThe character designs were unique within this series. The world's amazing lack of dress code means that each member of the trio is able to be fully expressed artistically in the day-to-day interactions, as opposed to the mere \"accessorizing\" that a lot of slice-of-life anime characters seem to do.\\n\\n\r\nSound (7): I'm not particularly familiar with voice-actors or bands. I can't speak to the particular voice-actors' histories, or the particular bands' histories in relation to their work here or anything along those lines.\\n\\n\r\nWhat I can say is this: The opening and ending songs fit with the overall theme, opening on an upbeat number about... something. It wasn't subtitled. The ending was a slower that closed down the show well, singing about friendship and togetherness, people being there for each other. I don't think either song was incredibly memorable or inspirational, but they fit the theme.\\n\\n\r\nThe character's voices fit similarly well, and there were no oddities in the voice portrayal of the character that would either hint that there was more to their character than their face value or hint that the VA simply didn't understand the character.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter (9): Each member of the main trio is appropriately unique, and the side characters are fairly fleshed out. Characters that appear here from Soul Eater reprise their roles and typical interactions, with one exception. Liz and Patty differ quite notably from their main-line selves, but their role given here fits into the story without any oddities.\\n\\n\r\nOf the main trio, we see all of them develop somewhat over the course of the series. It's not a particularly huge development arc in each case, but one can't expect too much from a fluffy show like this with only 12 episodes to work with.\\n\\n\r\nWe're introduced to our main, Tsugumi, a \"weapon\", who discovers her powers after putting her spear-leg through a kitchen cabinet. She reacts to this as most normal people would, and after she goes to the school, she reacts to the school situations as most people would. She's not \"cowardly\" by any stretch of the imagination, and after a confrontation with some baddies, she worries about her inability to act. At the end of the series, she comes into her own, obtains her resolve and picks her meister.\\n\\n\r\nThe other two members of her trio face minor troubles, one having to face her royal identity head-on and make her own choices instead of being sheltered, and the other having to face her own inability to remember even the most recent thing she's done. They also have to face off against each other, as they both want Tsugumi as their own weapon.\\n\\n\r\nOur main villain is villain-ey enough for an SOL anime that happens to have a violent conflict sub-plot mixed in at the end. The only motivation this character could realistically need is given to us all throughout the show. \"Shibusen and witches are natural enemies.\" She doesn't see much of an arc, she's merely there to drive the interpersonal conflict in the trio to an accelerated conclusion. It works, I guess, but in the end, it serves to remind us that this IS Soul Eater's world, where violent conflict between these two groups is \"normal\", one side doesn't really need a valid reason to hate the other, that's just how it's always been.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (10): Yeah. I liked it. I marathon'd it in the middle of a school week. It's a light, fluffy anime that delivers a dose of everyday life into the insane world of Soul Eater. I saw this 4 years after I saw the original Soul Eater, so I wasn't expecting a whole lot of Soul Eater in this anime. If you expect an explicit prequel to Soul Eater that matches in tone and themes, then you'll likely hate this anime.\\n\\n\r\nOne point I'd like to properly make: This anime showed me that weapons are people, too. Soul Eater FAILED to establish that in any way, shape or form for me. Soul Eater's characters are so incredibly zany, we see them mostly in weapon form (as it is an action show), and we very rarely see them doing normal, \"boring\" human things that it's easy to miss out on significant aspects of the weapons as human characters. Conversely, Tsugumi's default is her human form, and we see her interacting with people in human ways and not in combat situations. We see her react to stressful situations as most people would as well, lending some credibility to her character as a human in a very human-focused show.\\n\\n\r\nThis show will be pretty memorable for me, not for the story, but for the characters and the alternate-take on an already very memorable show.\\n\\n\r\nOverall (8): It's not too bad, just don't go into it expecting Soul Eater. It's only 4 hours, and there are certainly worse anime you could drop 4 hours on.",

Maybe I can make some sense of it that way. Probably not, though.\\n\\n\r\nExecutive A: Hey, so Soul Eater\u2019s been out for like five years and it\u2019s got a pretty good fanbase. What say we put out some sort of spinoff to keep the brand name strong?\\n\\n\r\nExecutive B: That sounds like a very good idea. So, what kind of spinoff? A sequel could be a good idea, you get to see the characters you love a bit more grown up and going on to new challenges.\\n\\n\r\nA: No, a prequel makes far more sense. We get to explore the world more fully and talk about all those ancillary environmental details that were only in the background before. Like, we can explore the city more fully!\\n\\n\r\nB: You sure? It feels like we\u2019re missing a lot of opportunities that way, considering how well-formed the world and characters already were at the start of Soul Eater. Our audience already knows the layout well enough, we don\u2019t need to get stuck in pedantic detail-mongering. Also, if it\u2019s a prequel, we don\u2019t get to use Crona, a.k.a. the best character in the show by far.\\n\\n\r\nA: That\u2019s okay, we\u2019ll just make up some original characters and tell a completely new story with them! And the main cast can act as cameos so they don\u2019t wear out their welcome.\\n\\n\r\nB: I... feel like that could still work as a sequel, but okay. Prequel it is. So, who are our new characters?\\n\\n\r\nA: Well, they\u2019re a trio of cute girls. Tsumugi, the lead, says \u201cGagantous!\u201d a lot. Meme forgets literally everything. Anya is a spoiled rich girl obsesses with commoner stuff.\\n\\n\r\nB: Okay, what else?\\n\\n\r\nA: That\u2019s it. That\u2019s the extent of their characters.\\n\\n\r\nB: What? Why? They\u2019re all so thinly sketched, defined by cheap gimmicks rather than goals and personalities people can get attached to. How is our audience supposed to care about them when there\u2019s nothing to care about?\\n\\n\r\nA: Because they\u2019re in a lesbian love triangle.\\n\\n\r\nB: ...really? So we\u2019re going the yuri route?\\n\\n\r\nA: Yeah, I was thinking it should be a yuri slice-of-life. Maybe get a little action-y and classic Soul Eater for the climax, but this should be its own thing. Also, we\u2019ll see Jacqueline and Kim from the original show, and they\u2019ll be gay for each other too.\\n\\n\r\nB: Huh. Well, that\u2019s definitely a risk. Our audience is used to the shonen action spectacle stuff, they might not like such a vast departure. But hey, if we pull it off well enough, might make for a nice change of pace! What kinds of cool things will out characters do?\\n\\n\r\nA: Work at a cafe.\\n\\n\r\nB: You\u2019re shitting me.\\n\\n\r\nA: Nope.\\n\\n\r\nB: That\u2019s, like, the laziest possible thing they could do.\\n\\n\r\nA: But maid uniforms!\\n\\n\r\nB: Who cares about maid uniforms? Soul Eater isn\u2019t a fanservice vehicle. I mean, there was a little of it in the early parts, but we made a conscious effort to tone that stuff down to avoid alienating a broader audience, remember?\\n\\n\r\nA: Listen, audiences want to be pandered to. So in this spin-off, not only will there be maid uniforms, there\u2019ll be plenty of panty shots too! And the girls won\u2019t be able to stop talking about each other\u2019s boobs! That\u2019s what everyone wants!\\n\\n\r\nB: No, it isn\u2019t! That spits in the face of the admirable restraint we showed making Soul Eater! Is that the only reason you want it to be yuri, so you can contrive excuses for the girls to get all touchy-feely with each other for dudes to drool over?\\n\\n\r\nA: Yup! What, you thought we were actually gonna try to get some good, honest LGBT representation in there?\\n\\n\r\nB: Kind of, yeah!\\n\\n\r\nA: Well, you\u2019re wrong. We want the dudes who think lesbian action is hot to enjoy this, but still imagine making it with them. That\u2019s why we\u2019ll make all the ecchi feel as contrived un-genuine as possible so they aren\u2019t scared off thinking these girls might legitimately not be available to them. Also, we\u2019ll half-heartedly pretend Tsugumi\u2019s got a crush on a dude for a bit just for backup.\\n\\n\r\nB: That feels so disrespectful in every conceivable sense. And stupid. You think people are gonna enjoy such half-hearted measures?\\n\\n\r\nA: But wait! There\u2019s more!\\n\\n\r\nB: Oh god, what now?\\n\\n\r\nA: We\u2019ll also animate this entire show in the most boring, pedestrian way possible with shitty, generic backgrounds and plasticky, sub-Love Live faces. No crative cinematography or editing, just bland and vapid static shots over bland and vapid locations and dialogue.\\n\\n\r\nB: Oh, FUCK that! No! That\u2019s enough! That is the stupidest idea I ever heard! Soul Eater was such a great show because of how stylish it was! It had a unique and expressive aesthetic that was full personality and creativity! Every shot had something interesting happening! Every visual choice was carefully made to make every single moment stick out in your mind! It had some of the most consistently engaging, kinetic visual storytelling ever, even outside of the action scenes! Replacing all that with shitty, sub-basement moe aesthetics completely destroys the core appeal of the show we\u2019re supposed to be honoring here!\\n\\n\r\nA: But moe is very in now! That experimental, creative stuff is all passe. Everyone will love it!\\n\\n\r\nB: No. No one will love it. Yuri fans will hate that it doesn\u2019t commit to the yuri, slice of life fans will hate that there isn\u2019t any creativity in the scenarios, Soul Eater fans will hate how different it feels from the show they\u2019ve come to love, and casual anime watchers who stumble across it will hate how lazily put together it is. Soul Eater managed to appeal to pretty much everyone. The spin-off you\u2019re describing appeals to NO ONE.\\n\\n\r\nA: You sure? Because I already got funding approved for it and we\u2019ve started production.\\n\\n\r\nB: HOW?!?!?!\\n\\n\r\nA: Hey, calm down. Tell you what, since you\u2019ve got so many opinions on it, I\u2019ll at least let you name it. That can be your contribution.\\n\\n\r\nB: *long, beleaguered sigh* Okay, fine. I guess we\u2019re doing this. But mark my words, this is going to be a massive flop that everyone should stay away from. And to make sure the audience knows what to expect, we\u2019re gonna call it Soul Eater NOT, because they should NOT watch it.\\n\\n\r\nA: Wow, that\u2019s a little mean, don\u2019t you think?\\n\\n\r\nB: Trust me, they\u2019ll thank us for warning them.\\n\\n\\n\r\nYeah, that\u2019s how I imagine it went down. It\u2019s the only way I can make sense of how wrong-headed this entire production was. Soul Eater NOT fails as yuri, it fails as slice-of-life, it fails as a Soul Eater property, and it fails on its own merits by being lifeless, inert, and vapid every step of the way. Don\u2019t bother watching it; it\u2019s not worth it, even for the irony. Now to watch Soul Eater episode 21 to wash the taste out of my mouth.",

I would be lying if I said I wasn't happy when I found out that another edition to Soul Eater was a thing, I just never would have expected it to be so disappointing. The title you would think is just another weird anime title, but it actually forewarns the viewer what they're in for. The whole plot was total garbage that could've been executed much better. There was a lot more room for character development other than these three idiots. Literally the only reason I finished watching thiswas because of how much I liked Soul Eater, and it's unfortunate that the OG characters had to even be put in this garbage fire of fan service.\\n\\n\r\nFavorite Character: Prof. Stein\\n\r\nI hated all the new characters just because of spiting this show in general.

            "content": "When the first episode came out, most people were ambivalent to the series since they thought it was going to have the same style as the Soul Eater anime, but it did not. I only read the manga and I did not watch the anime. However, I found the series to be enjoyable as it focused more of the slice days of life than rather than action\r\nPlot\r\nThe main character Tsugami has been chosen to go to Soul Eater Academy since she can turned into a weapon. There she meets two meinster candidates in which she has to choose one of them to be her weaponmaster. The rest of the series focuses on daily lives of those three plus more character development for some characters who did not get that much in the main soul eater series. Plus, it seems that there is a mysterious enemy brewing trouble in the academy.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters\\n\\n\r\nYou got the optimistic girl Tsugami, tsundere princess Anya, and a forgetful girl Meme. These three girls form a tight relationship as they sleep in the same dorm and work together. One of the main problems that Tsugami has that she has to choose a meinster candidate either from Anya or Meme. It is a tough choice since they become really good friends over the course of the series, and it gets harder and harder for her to choose, as one of them is going to go let down. Some of the original Soul Eater characters get a cameo like Moka. Another unique thing is that  some of the side characters from the main series get more character development and more screen time in this series. We learn more about them more in this series before the main story Soul Eater comes later.\\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\\n\r\nI loved the Op of this series. It gives the watchers a good senses of what the series is going to be, a lot of fun, but a sense of danger.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation\\n\\n\r\nThe animation has been fairly standard, and nothing too crazy from the original Soul Eater Anime. However, there could have more action scenes, and action could have been better animated. I found the character designs unique and resembles the wackiness of Soul Eater Not!\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment\\n\\n\r\nIn all, I found the series to be really enjoyable. Some of the negatives I found was that the the main antagonist could have done more in the beginning and not everything at the very end. The show went very lighthearted to some grim moments at the end. Otherwise, it has been a good ride.\\n",

There's definitely a LOT less Black Star, which is a definite plus. It also gives you a closer look into the past lives of the Thompson sisters. This show definitely strayed away from the mystery and action of Soul Eater and added a lot more of the slice oflife feel but it's definitely worth watching.",

However, i like it even more than the original series, because it not only gave me actual details on how a lot of the supernatural mechanics worked, but came from the prospective of someone completely new to weapons and meisters and all that nonsense.\r\nStory: 7: This is a Moe/Sol deal, not your action/shounen like the original series... And you know what? I loved it. The MC discovers she has the ability to transform into a weapon and transfers to DWMA, Where she finds herself quickly befriending Maka-sempai and two other new students, both meisters, some stuff happensand some very surprising plot twists take place. The later parts VS the witch are quite a lot like the regular Soul Eater, but it still always feels slightly more lighthearted.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8: It's NOT Soul Eater!!!! While the style of the original series fit it's themes very well, i still hated it. This style fits this anime better and doesn't look terrible, which is always good.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 7: Never really stood out, either for better or worse... The OP is pretty good though\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 8 : This is a character-focused show, so naturally the characters are all really detailed, maybe slightly above average for a 12-episode show, but these guys are LIKABLE, which is a really important trait many shows are missing. Even the character following the dumb, forgetful stereotype for most of the anime, never pushes it far enough to annoy even me, someone who loathes stupid characters almost as much as i do arrogant ones.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9: Much like Fate/Prisma Ilya, there is a strong yuri vibe in the 'downtime', when annoyances such as the plot are taking a rest, and to a slightly lesser degree this exists for the same purpose as Kaleid: Fun. The story isn't supposed to move you to tears or anything, it's supposed to just be a fun, interesting show with a touch of action and yuri.",

            "content": "Well, what can I say? The guidelines told me to focus on the anime and not comment on the reviews of others, but I think that will be pivotal in writing a review straight from the soul. I'm honestly bad at being a critique since I ramble and sometimes let my biases get the best of me, but keeping that in mind let's get started.\r\n  I genuinely like Soul Eater Not. It is a cute slice of life version of Soul Eater equipped with a new cast of main and side characters while still retaining appearances of old characters with cameosnow and then despite it being a prequel. The story wasn't anything spectacular. In fact it had trouble fitting some plot points in and sewing everything neatly together since it only had 12 episodes to work with, not uncommon. It was fairly smooth for the most part, but of course mixing a slightly comedic slice of life-esque genre with the more supernatural action that was the main installment of Soul Eater is no easy feat. It requires the right balance which they didn't seem to nail, but weren't completely off with. The art and animation was nothing out of the ordinary or unique either it seemed, but it was beautiful and clean nonetheless. I never pay much attention to the OST, but I always give the opening a try, can't say much for endings (I usually jump right to the next episode). What I can say is that it was very lighthearted and accentuated the cute style they had. It was a nice song when paired with the visuals even made someone like me feel for it a bit. Though the amount of sweetness in the anime was close to giving me diabetes I have seen far worse. The characters were for the most part unique and flowed well together. Noticing how each step of the story was all about building bonds and friendship was both stale and enjoyable at the same time somehow. Though they didn't have enough time to completely draw these highlights out. I can say that it was weird watching an anime like this, however I didn't necessarily dislike it. Usually in a more action based anime (which is what I prefer) I get bored with the dialogue and interactions between the characters for the most part. This anime was obviously more dialogue than action, but I enjoyed the interactions between characters regardless of whether I liked them or not, as that also plays a factor in my interest in dialogue. When the action came along too it was flatter as to be expected of the less action oriented anime, but that wasn't bad either. It felt rushed and had a bit of ass pull in there, but by the end I had fun with it. It was a mixed box of surprises, plot, and emotion. That's what you should expect when walking into this anime. (This is the part where I talk about other things) \\n\r\n   If you are a Soul Eater fan or if you are a slice of life fan it shouldn't matter too much. It seems like everyone is picking sides with this anime and that's exactly why I decided to write this. It's an anime so you should look at it as an anime fan. I think as a Soul Eater anime it is lacking, I think as a slice of life it is passable (though I don't watch too many of those). However as an anime I think it is a breathe of unique air doing it's own thing and it should be respected for it. It doesn't seem to fit in if you are trying to put a label on it, but maybe somewhere down the line it will have a label all it's own. I hope more anime decide to take liberties like this and be something special, something on it's own regardless of how rushed or half-assed or whether it technically belongs to a specific franchise. Anime should be viewed as it is and it itself should be seen not the critiques or the overcasting forebearers that set the stage for it. Soul Eater Not is a unique though not outstanding anime, but it sure makes it's own individual footprint on the long beach of anime in front and behind us. I hope you give it a try if you want to watch something sweet and new.\\n\\n\\n\r\n(spoiler)\\n\r\nAlso to those who complained about the \"winning with friendship\" cliche at the end, keep in mind if you are a returning fan of Soul Eater that that's how that series ended too! So shut it. Soul Eater is all about friendship is magic among other cliches that inhabit both the original and Not. If you can't put up with that, don't watch it.",

            "content": "Unpopular opinion: Soul Eater NOT! gets more hate than it deserves. \r\nI understand most were looking forward to watching something strongly related to the original series, but even the tittle suggests it's NOT happening. I mean you get a warning STRAIGHT AWAY, so why even bother if you already know it's NOT what you're expecting to find?\r\nStory: 6/10\r\nThe story is quite distant from the original Soul Eater, and is much more laid back, less packed with action and, unlike the original, aimed rather at the female audience. In my opinion, the creators intentionally aimed at the lighter themes and slice of life genre, given thefact the story takes place before the main series, when things in Shibusen get quite tense. It would seem the story starts developing only by the end, but when you give it a second thought, you realize things were leading towards the final along the entire anime. Only, ugh, it was so vague you have to dig in quite deep to figure those things out. It's not necessary a bad thing, but with the animes that don't ask much of thinking, I prefer not to think much over. \\n\\n\r\nOn one hand, I'm keen to think it would be more plot driven had it the similar amount of episodes as the first Soul Eater did, but then I highly doubt I'd have patience to watch 50 bloody episodes of it. 12 is probably the best number after all. The story is so light and almost non-existent I was cleaning my laptop with Soul Eater NOT! playing as a background, yet I followed the plot. It's only two last episodes that demanded my full attention. Here comes the confusion of mine - theoretically, I'm glad it demanded so little dedication - it's been a while since I'd watch a relaxing anime which would allow me to go brain numb and giggle at silly jokes. On the other hand, I love plots and Soul Eater NOT! had not really developed any until a couple of the last episodes.  Rating story is quite difficult with this one due to near absence of it. But, meh, it did follow some pattern and covered most of things, so I guess it deserves a medium score.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nAlthough I LOVED the original Soul Eater, the drawing style there was constantly pissing me off. ESPECIALLY how little effort they put into character shoes, making them look just like lumps of colors and lines, not to mention being terribly disproportional. The colouring was an entire different story...Therefore Soul Eater NOT! actually pleased me with the art quality. Say all you want about how it was no longer unique, but I seriously preferred it over the original style. Remember, kids - unique does not mean good, and in this case I prefer the generic anime style of popular shite rather than the original Soul Eater art. This season had most of the original characters hanging around casually (although I definitely missed the reaper himself), and that was truly flattering to see them keep the unique traits only in the better quality. Usually, when upgrading quality, animes tend to redesign the characters and it ruins them most of time, so I'm grateful to the old gods and the new for regarding the old designs in here.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nThe opening matched the theme of the anime very well. It was as light and carefree as the series themselves. Just like the tittle, it suggested it won't be exactly the Soul Eater we'd expect to find, and rather something of a filler season. The song itself was quite addictive, although I did not take liking in it at first. The ending was fine. Most of time I watch both, but here I was skipping the ending, because meh. It's one of the animes I'd watch at home and not while working out, so ending was optional, unlike most of time. What made me truly happy was music in the anime itself. Usually I get annoyed when characters start singing (Guilty Crown, ugh.), but for once I've changed my views. The songs were not so irritating and the voice actors performed them well, therefore it actually turned into a pleasant experience. Heads up for that! \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 4/10\\n\\n\r\nHere I will agree with the most of people - it sucked. The only concept I liked was Tsugumi defining herself as a \"girl who's in love with love\", as it's rare for the main characters to acknowledge their problems. I liked Anya's outfit and her fetish of buying crap, but that's about it. Her being all noble and then tearing up the other moment for a silly reason was ehh? But the worst of them all was Meme. I don't give a flying heck that she was possessed and it caused her dumb behaviour - it was getting on my nerves, along with the slow talking manner and general denseness. A person like this would not survive and ffs, people like this don't make friends, not as easily at least. I did enjoy the episode of her winning in casino, but that's about it - all the other time I was annoyed with her, and actually yelled \"YES\", when Tsugumi finally snapped at her. The other characters were shite as well. No one expects development in this kind of anime, but leaving nothing but blank shells roaming around the anime, such as Clay, Akane or Cana is no good. Explain me purpose of Cana, someone? Well, there is none. She's just a random very young character who does \"fortune telling\" no one cares about and it makes no sense. Is she even a student? No one knows. AND THIS IS NOT OKAY. The only thing that sorta saves the score from being fully negative is the original characters of Soul Eater. Stein alone brings it to a new level. He is generally my babe, but in this season he was a star. Also I liked how much Sid was featured and how this sub-story merged into the original series....Which still wasn't too smooth, as although we see Sid die by the end (which happens in the early episodes of Soul Eater), his death reasons named in the earlier series are different. In Soul Eater, he dies by hands of a witch and on a mission, while in Soul Eater NOT! the story of his death is quite different.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nI followed my own advice and opened my mind to not expecting the series to even resemble the original anime. It helped a big time. Usually I watch anime in gym, but I saved this one for home viewing, mostly when doing house chores as it did not demand for my full attention yet I was capable of following it. I did enjoy it to quite some extent, although usually I struggle with animes of the kind and end up suffering whilst attempting to complete it. Surprisingly, Soul Eater NOT! went very smooth with me and I did not experience hardships completing it. It's easy to say I did enjoy it, but had it required more of a focus, I'd probably not. Hence why I can't really rate it very high, but a lower score would be uncalled for as I experienced no discomfort either.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nAs I've said in the beginning, this anime gets more hate than it deserves. It's definitely not perfect, but let's face the fact the most seem to dislike it for it doesn't meet their expectations of being a proper prequel of Soul Eater. And that, my friends, is why the tittle says 'NOT' in the capital letters and even has an exclamation mark - so you know that what you expect is NOT what you should be expecting. The anime was not designed to be of the same genre as the original franchise, even if it takes place in the same universe. It lacked action and was more focused on slice of life on purpose. The original series did not tell us much about life in Shibusen nor the universe itself, did they? And this season did. Instead, unlike Soul Eater, it did not have much tension and fights. While those two animes are related, they should not be viewed as the same for they are different in so many aspects. Embrace the fact. Open your mind. Maybe then you can find something good about it. \\n\\n",

            "content": "Soul Eater NOT! is an anime that's not particularly good but receives much more flack than it probably deserves thanks to its relation to the far superior Soul Eater. \r\nStory: 6/10\r\nThe plot is... okay. It doesn't really break any new ground, with the whole \"two girls want to be with me and I can't decide which one I want\" plot-line being established in episode 1. Oddly enough, this plot-line is established minutes after the main character, Tsugumi, meets her suitors, so to speak. She's had a short conversation with Meme and a rather unpleasant interaction with Anya, hardly basis for such a dilemma. As theplot moves on it gets reasonably interesting, with Tsugumi learning how to become a weapon, something we never got to see in Soul Eater, and a villain, which I didn't expect in an anime that tries to emulate slice-of-life. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 7/10\\n\r\nI quite liked the art style. The main characters from Soul Eater don't change much other than Maka's eyes, and the fight scenes are mostly pretty good, discounting an embarrassing moment near the end of Episode 7. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 5/10\\n\r\nI didn't notice other than the opening theme. I'm bad at the sound department. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 5/10\\n\r\nThe characters are characters. Tsugumi has the most variation, though she has an annoying habit of saying she's \"In love with love\" despite never actually showing that. She just kind of says it and expects us to accept it as truth. Meme is forgetful. Now you know Meme. Anya is a tsundere rich girl who knows martial arts. Admittedly, she does get some cool scenes here and there but her personality when she's not fighting pretty much amounts to \"I don't know the value of money and also I am the tsundere archetype.\" There are a few other minor characters, with my favorite being Clay, the guy who's smart but not very quick on his feet so whenever someone asks him what he's doing and he has to come up with an excuse, he says he's in love with someone. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 6/10\\n\r\nI happened to be in the mood for a cute slice-of-life anime with action thrown in there, and Soul Eater NOT! largely delivered on that. It's not a particularly good anime, but it gave me what I wanted in a decent manner.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 6/10\\n\r\nSoul Eater NOT! is not a particularly good anime. At the same time, it's not really as bad as everyone makes it out to be. It has its upsides and it shows some stuff that Soul Eater never got around to. None of the main characters in Soul Eater ever have trouble learning how to turn into weapons, they know how at the beginning of the series. Seeing a character learn how to do that was pretty nice. It shows how Sid became a zombie and what the Thompson sisters were doing before Kid officially partnered with them. It also goes a long way toward showing what the other students at the school do, since looking at Soul Eater's main characters is like looking at the Justice League and saying \"that's what humans are.\" Seeing the NOT class has its merits. Overall, Soul Eater NOT! is a great way to get yourself motivated to watch Soul Eater again. That's pretty much what it does best.",

I'm going to go out on a limb  and say this could have been so much better if the writers actually had more episodes to work with. They set up a lot of potentially intriguing character development only to be abruptly cut off in the end. The development of the new characters thus felt choked, and it's hard to be invested in any of them, especially since ample screen time was given to cameos from the original series. A lot of the plot points were also interesting,  but alas, came outhalf baked because of the limited format. 8 more episodes and these writers could have wrapped up something special, but when life gives you lemons...\\n\\n\r\nThe inexplicably large proportion of yuri moe fluff felt forced at times, especially in light of how the series ended. It had to have been some bizarre upper management mandate to force itself into a market it didn't exactly fit in. I didn't even mind the art style change, which I thought would have been an interesting choice, had the series turned out better. As a huge fan of the original series, I can see that a lot of talent went into this work, but ultimately it was dulled by what can only be described as a money grab by the owners of the IP to start selling merchandise to the moe market. Disappointing,  but there's definitely enough there for fans of the series and Manga to enjoy.",

Is nothing like Soul Eater, which is probably the main reason it gets such a bad rep, as most people are expecting another Soul Eater, it is not. Soul Eater NOT! Is the cutesy, moe. mahou shoujo story based in the Soul Eater universe. \r\nIt revolves around three adorable girls, one is a weapon and the other two are meisters. The three characters have really likeable personalities, and you become attached to them. Meme is a forgetful meister whosleepwalk,, and Anya is a Princess trying to live the life of a \u201ccommoner\u201d. While watching I could not decide which character I wanted Tsugumi, the cute weapon who is nervous about going to DWMA, to choose as her meister. \\n\r\nThe villain in Soul Eater NOT! is a very interesting, beautifully designed witch, and I thought it was a very cool addition to the show. \\n\r\nThe characters from Soul Eater who showed up were all thrown in in really cool ways, for example Tsugumi and her two meisters met Patty and Liz before they were Death the Kids weapons. I love that friendship, creating more dimensions to the Soul Eater world while still creating something that is its own entity. \\n\r\nI only like Soul Eater, it was not one of my favorite animes.

            "content": "As you can see from the title itself, this is not soul eater in both story and mood.\r\nStory wise it was (7/10)\r\nSoul Eater NOT! takes place before main series focusing on the weapon Tsugumi Harudori, who befriends two other meisters, Meme Tatane and Anya Hepburn. All three take part in the NOT classes, as opposed to the battle-oriented EAT class taken by Maka and her friends.\r\nThis anime shows the life of NOT students who are not involved in the witch fighting and becoming a death scythe but just learning how to control their powers, especially the weapons.\r\nPretty boring compared to Soul Eater, true but assomeone who is reading the manga, it is actually enjoyable and cute. Do not compared this to Soul Eater because of its completely different genre and mood. NOT! is more of a highschool (well middle school, the characters are only 14) life with lots of cutesy feelings and figuring out who you are, rather than fighting witches like Maka were. \\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately, this was a big mediocre at best because of its forced cutesy moments. As someone who is reading the manga, these moments are flow naturally in the manga but seems kinda forced in the anime. For example, extending the cutesy moments when it probably work better like this, cute moment and snap gone. While this time, they make cute moment goes on forever and lose the comedy and cute effect.\\n\\n\r\nART (6/10)\\n\\n\r\nThis anime was also was just put into a meat grinder, stomped with a poo covered heel, then throw in with a bunch of filthy trash to launched to the sun for it can be incinerated. That's how bad the animation was for me. While it is more of school life anime, it is related to soul eater and it needs a plot! Fighting and cool ass moves with weapon was guaranteed, but with not enough budget; soul eater not! suffered badly with its really awful animation. The art looks pretty and cute though, so that's how they kinda can covered their awful animation.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND (7/10)\\n\r\nSoul eater not! sound tracks are also mediocre.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS (8/10)\\n\\n\r\nCharacters are filled with cute girls, who are most likely in love with each other for it does contain girl/girl kiss. And there is nothing wrong with that! But I'm putting it here so people won't bash the anime for the wrong reason, bash it for the awful animation but not for the not straight moment they put.\\n\\n\r\nOnce again, our main characters are very cute and likeable but the true highlights of this anime was the Thompson sisters and Kim and Jacqueline backgrounds. Soul Eater NOT! main characters (maka, soul, kid, black star, Tsubaki, Ox) also make appearances. These were the one of the few things that makes this anime enjoyable.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL (7/10)\\n\\n\r\nFor those who read the manga or watched/read soul eater, do not expect much of this. The anime did mediocre at best.\\n\\n\r\nFor those who knows nothing about soul eater, expect the same but because you know nothing of the main series, you will most likely enjoy the characters and story more because you won't be moaning for the originals characters to come back.",

            "content": "Soul Eater NOT! was actually a pretty good series. A lot of people were dissapointed going into the actual series, as it was NOT Soul Eater. But remember, it's Soul Eater Not, it is NOT Soul Eater. \r\nStory- 4: The story... was fairy decent. Nothing outstanding, and it was pretty slow and standard, but I thought that for the amount of episodes the actual series had, and the kind've series it was, the story was pretty alright.\r\nArt- 8: The series might not have had the original artsyle that the main series had, but if this series had the original artstyle, then I don't think Iwould've liked the art near as much. The art from this series is great, and it fits with the overall theme of the story. Also the backgrounds were super pretty and I really quite liked the character designs. All the characters had nice looking clothes and color schemes and I really love how the three main characters looked together on screen. Their color schemes complimented each other nicely.\\n\\n\r\nSound- 10: I have NO complaints about the sound of this series, the background music was amazing, and the opening and ending were also very nice. They fit the series very nicely. Also the voice acting was super good, and even the english dub was very nice! I really liked how everyone sounded. The voice actors made the series feel complete. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters- 7: The characters in this series were great. Tsugumi, Meme, and Anya were all super fun to watch on screen and I really liked how Liz and Patty got a bit more development in this series as they were arguably the least developed main characters in the original series. I also liked Maka's role in this series as a \"senpai\" for Tsugumi. The characters were nice, although pretty tropey. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment- 8: I never really had to force myself to watch any of these episodes although they could get kind've boring at times. I quite liked every single episode.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I rate this series as a 7. Not the best, but still worth watching. It's quite cute.",

            "content": "Soul Eater NOT, a show most people cringe to when they simply hear the title. Now is the show really as bad as most people want to claim it is; Well yes and no. No it's not as bad because the show has some fights as well as a semi interesting plot. Yes because it just simply isn't Soul Eater (but aside from that), and the characters can be the generic moe driven scum that we have all seen and are familiar with.\r\nStory:\r\nSo I know people probably want to give every aspect of this show a hard time, but the story is actually pretty funif you are a fan of Soul Eater. The story is a girl one day half way transforms into a weapon and now she has been sent to a special school so she can learn more about her new skill. The show is mainly about her befriending two other girls as partners, but the show doesn't just focus on that. Soul Eater NOT also has elements from Soul Eater; Since this show is a prequel, you get to see how some characters were before the main show Soul Eater starts. As well as background for characters, you do get to learn about some of the lore from Soul Eater which I thought was pretty neat\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nSo if you enjoy slices of life and moe culture then this show may be your cup of tea. Sure the characters are predictable and generic, but I think they were actually designed that way for comedic purposes, as in to make fun of the generic moe characters we see in every show ever. There were times when this joke did go a little too far however, and it made me want to claw my eyes out. For the most part though they were tolerable, and sometimes it was pretty funny where they took the stereotype. \\n\\n\r\nI also want to add that the main character from Soul Eater are side characters, and some of the side characters are now main characters.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nThis was one of the very few things that really bothered me with this show. Now, the art is not bad, but it is very different from it's parent show. Seeing some of the characters from Soul Eater stylized to look different was kinda a bad touch, but in defense they didn't look bad, just different is all.\\n\\n\r\nOverall; \\n\r\nIf you enjoyed Soul Eater and also enjoy slices of life, this show might be worth a watch, as long you don't mind pure unfiltered moe moments.\\n\\n\r\nAlso since it's a prequel, it might be fun to watch this then re-watch Soul Eater, since that show is worth watching multiple times.",

Original Soul Eater is action/comedy and this is slice of life/comedy. I read few reviews before watching this so I was prepared for the genre change.\r\nThe only similarities between these two series are DWMA and people turning into weapons. Soul Eater NOT! is a relaxing anime you can watch without sitting at the edge of your seat and biting your nails off. It has a pleasant amount of humor but the story isn't that deep which you canexpect from a slice of life anime. The art-style is nice and the animation is smooth but there should have been something deeper in this anime.\\n\\n\r\nFinal verdict: If you have watched the original Soul Eater and want something more relaxing and fun to watch or just happened to like slice of life animes in general... try this and I think you won't be disappointed.",

            "content": "I don't understand why so many people disregard this series. There is absolutely nothing bad about it. I thought it was a lot of funEater story, and we learn some things like how Sid died in Soul Eater, and about the lives of Liz, Patty, Kim, etc. before hand. The last few episodes were really intense, and I really wanted to see everyone turn out okay! And one of the episodes when one character was possessed by the main villain at the town festival had me so hyped up and I was really scared for her safety. \\n\\n\r\nWell, yeah, the story isn't always this intense. Most of it is slice of life stuff, but you learn a lot about Liz and Patty's situation, Kim's personality, and how she befriends Jackie. I give it an 8/10 . \\n\\n\r\nArt and Sound: Both 8/10\\n\r\nThe art style is moe and very cute. It definitely fits the tone of the beginning of the story, and even hen everything was dark and intense, the colors and the sound did well to make us feel worried or scared. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 9/10\\n\r\nThis rank is mostly based on the supporting characters and the things we learn about them, as well as the main trio obviously. So I'll go individually, kind of. Tsugumi is a typical protagonist. She's determined, kind of shy, but very friendly and has a good heart. Nothing spectacular, but you can see the worry she has trying to make the big decision in the show, and you feel sorry for her when she puts herself down because of her more athletic friends. So she's not boring, just kind of typical. Anya is a typical tsundere rich girl. She wants to learn about \"common life\" but doesn't really like showing her vulnerable side. She's a fun and really cute character. Meme is my favorite of the three. She's funny, kind of stupid, really cute, and just brings a lot of the comedy between the three. Plus once you find out why she forgets so many things, it really does make sense and tie into the main plot. She really makes the trio so interesting for me. \\n\\n\r\nAs for supporting characters, they're great. Liz and Patty are shown as their previous rebellious selves that care about nobody and will pick a fight with anyone they see on the street. You slowly see them turn to their more well known selves and it's really heartwarming. There are a few other characters in the show, like Akane and Clay, who guide Tsugumi through learning more about herself and what she wants to accomplish at the DWMA, and are really fun as well. \\n\\n\r\nKim and Jackie are awesome too. You get to see Kim go from a total bully to a more cool, yet compassionate girl. You also get to see Jackie try to figure out of she loves Kim romantically, or just as a close friend and possible partner. Both of them work well of each other, and I ship it REALLY hard. \\n\\n\r\nThe other main characters are not in it much other than Maka and Soul, but they are all the same as usual, so there isn't much to say. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, I really like this anime. I do not understand why so many people think it's bad, but I feel as though people are just angry because the art is different from the original and so is the tone. But it's really not. It gives good characters, a good story, and it keeps very faithful to the things within the cannon. The ending is even pretty good, maybe not great, but it still wraps the story up really nicely. I recommend any Soul Eater fans to at least give the show a chance and form their own opinions.",
