            "content": "Well, well, well, look what we have here?  Can anyone say \"under-appreciated\" and \"under-watched\"?  Those words would probably describe Valkyria Chronicles very well.\r\nAt first glance, this anime probably doesn't look like anything special.  Originally based on a tactical role-playing game of the same name for the PS3, this anime might look like a couple of things.  At first glance, it might just look like a military anime that wants to chock itself full of violence and gunplay.  However, this is a serious, serious misconception.  Let's get to the review and see why, shall we?\r\nStory:  The story that encompassesValkyria Chronicles is as follows.  It takes place in the year 1935, in an alternate history where two opposing military factions, the Empire and the Federation, wage war against one another on the continent of Europa.  It's an alternate WWII inspired-setting, and one of the things that surprised me the most about this anime was a lack of giant robots.  Instead, their roles are taken by all manner of tanks, artillery pieces, and other standard military fare, all a-la-Advance Wars.  This, I felt, made the anime stronger, as they got by without using a concept used in so many other animes.  Continuing with the story, it kicks off in a small town called Bruhl in the neurtal territory of Gallia, where a young girl on town watch, Alicia Melchiott, happens to cross paths with the son of a Gallian General, whose name is Welken Gunther.  After this fateful meeting, the two are cast into the military life, where they battle for their lives and lives of their comrades, all while trying to stay relatively sane.  Unsurprisingly, there is a lot of romance in this anime, and it is some of the best I've seen.  In general, the plot is pretty amazing in my opinion, and from what I can tell, it follow the game pretty well.\\n\\n\r\nArt:  I believe that the art was good, though it could have been done just a little better.  I wasn't a big fan of the use of 3D effects in this anime, though I admit it was probably necessary for some parts.  Nevertheless, the character designs are awesome, and remain very close to their game counterparts.\\n\\n\r\nMusic:  A seriously amazing aspect of the series, in my opinion.  Both the OP and ED of the first half were awesome, and the second half, while not as on par, was also good in terms of the musical content.  All songs in the anime are definitely iPod worthy, and they easily fit the dramatic mood of the anime.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:  Definitely one of my favorite parts of the entire series.  All the characters make up a pretty diverse cast.  Welken and Alicia remain to be my favorites, mostly for their personalities and mannerisms when around one another.  Even still, the other members of the cast didn't end up just being placeholders.  I would warn all who watch this though.  Being a dramatic anime, I would expect some important character death.  Even still, it doesn't detract from the series at all, and instead strengthens it greatly.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:  Seriously, I believe this anime was extremely enjoyable, to the degree where I couldn't stop watching for a day straight.  It definitely, definitely deserves a spot on your DVD shelf, or on your hard drive.\\n\\n\r\nThere's not much else to say about Valkyria Chronicles.  In short, I believe it to be one of the most under-appreciated anime around.  In my book, I believe it deserves a perfect 10/10, as it was I believe to be a shining example of what SHOULD be done in an anime series.  In all honesty, this anime is highly, highly recommended, and a definite example of a diamond in the rough that should be dug up just a little more often.",

            "content": "Valkyria Chronicles went down in the Guinness Book of World Records as the best strategy-rpg on the PS3 and, having played it, I can't disagree. So when I found this anime (finally) I was pretty revved up.\r\nI looked for this anime a while ago but I could never find it, either because it hadn't been released or I simply didn't look hard enough. The fact that it has been adapted from a game shouldn't bother the ones who have played the game because it's a pretty faithful adaptation. The emphasis has simply shifted slightly, from the more war-oriented action game to a more character-driven story.\r\nStory- 9\\n\r\nYeah like I said the story and its basics are carried over from the game. If you know the game, you'll know how this ends up. If you haven't played the game, think of WWII, with the Imperials representing Germany (Does anybody else notice how disturbingly Aryan they all are? Gregor and Maximillian in particular), the Federation representing the Allies and France, the poor country representing Gallia, caught between the two. Unlike Hitler who seemed to start World War 2 just because he could, the Imperials decide to start a war over the mineral Ragnite, the lifeblood of that world. The story follows the exploits of Lieutenant Welkin Gunther and his Merry Men, Women and a Winged Pig, as they fight to protect the homeland from the Imperials.  Expect plenty of action and drama, comedy and the the odd love triangle. \\n\\n\r\nArt - 10\\n\r\nDefinitely can't decide if it's a step up or a step down from the game. However it's still quite beautiful to watch, because it almost literally is art. You can see where the pencil strokes have fallen. It won't be to everyone's tastes but I like it.\\n\\n\r\nSound - 9\\n\r\nBoth Intro and End themes are charming enough and the recycling of the game's soundtrack will be a pleasant addition for the gamers who watch this and even if you haven't played the game, you'll learn soon enough what each piece of music foretells.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters - 8\\n\r\nThe characters are plain awesome, from the romanticist Faldio, to Marina the Lone Wolf, to Selvaria the busty general of the Imps. Not all of them are prominent but they all feel unique, unlike your generic run-of-the-mill anime crowds. \\n\r\nWhy do I only give them an 8? I miss their English voicings. I know, I know but Welkin's \"SQUAD 7! MOVE OUT!\" and Largo's battle cry of \"ARGH VEGETABLES!\" became almost iconic to me and my friends, so it's disappointing I don't get to hear them in the anime.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 10\\n\r\nOh yes! To see the epic war for Gallia's survival without having to suffer through annoyances such as ridiculously agile enemy soldiers and my Edelweiss exploding for no apparent reason satisfied me to no end.\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 10\\n\r\nThis is the first 10 I've given to an anime. Maybe I'm slightly biased, I don't know (I probably am), but I genuinely can't ever remember enjoying a cross-media adaptation of something more. If you're a fan of the game WATCH THIS! It gives more insight into Squad 7 and it may or may not enhance your gaming experience. If you haven't played the game WATCH THIS! It's an enjoyable romp with a band of weirdo's and a tank that could probably do the donut.",

            "content": "Overview:\r\nValkyria Chronicles is not only one of my favorite games for PS3, but one of my favorite games of all time! So how does this anime live up to its video game inspiration? Well...it certainly isn't bad, but it also could have been a lot better. Give me just a few paragraphs and I will try to explain my thoughts. \r\nBackground:\r\nAs you are well aware, unless you have been living under a rock, there is a genre of fiction called \u201calternate history\u201d. Alternate history is basically imagining a separate timeline if one or 2 major events went differently. It is widely used across all formsof media from novels to anime to video games. A common sub-genre of alternate history is fantasy alternate history in which magic and different laws of physics exist, so we have to imagine how that would impact the events of history and shape the world. Both Fullmetal Alchemist and Code Geass are within this sub-genre, with FMA taking place in an alternate Nazi Germany and Code Geass also taking place in an alternate WW2 with Japan fighting against the Britannian (American) invaders. Valkyria Chronicles at first just looks like yet another WW2 fantasy alternate history, but it actually does many things quite differently and still feels rather unique. \\n\\n\r\nNote:\\n\\n\r\nThe next 3 paragraphs are talking about the game Valkyria Chronicles on which this anime was based. If you are already a fan of the game and only wish to read about the anime adaptation, you can just skip these paragraphs and start reading at the Story Section.\\n\\n\r\nFirstly, the alternate technology is powered by a fuel source called \"ragnite\", which has its own constraints and drawbacks. These realistic technological limitations prevent limitless asspulls, so it doesn't get as absolutely ridiculous as some other examples of alternate tech... like the original alternate WW2 story, \"The Man in the High Castle\" by Philip K Dick. A novel where by 1950 the Nazis have completely terraformed and colonized Venus and by 1960 have colonized every planet in the Solar System! It is fortunate for us Americans and our national pride that the SS Sturmbannf\u00fchrer, Wernher von Braun never saw a copy of High Castle. He would have died laughing and we would have lost the moon race as a result! Thanks a lot Philip K Dick! \\n\\n\r\nSecondly, the writers of the game really did some history research and managed to fit a bunch of obscure and interesting WW2 facts into the game\u2019s story. Here are just a few examples. Remember the absurdly giant tank during the last battle that used naval artillery and was like a battleship on treads? That was based on real blueprints for a German tank called the Landkreuzer P-1000 that ThyssenKrupp pitched to Hitler, who actually greenlit the project! The project was cancelled though in 1943 because the Nazi architect and weapons designer Albert Speer realized that it would be insanely vulnerable to aerial bombardment and suffer the same fate as other absurdly large \u201cwunderwaffen\u201d like the Schwerer Gustav Railway Cannon (which also appears in the game). In the world of Valkyria Chronicles, airpower doesn\u2019t exist so the plan went ahead. The Valkyria in the game\u2019s story are an extremely powerful, ancient race of warriors that came from a now sunken island in the farthest north. Their mystical powers are the result of a special energy that only their race can use, but it is believed they lost their abilities by intermixing with the physically weaker southern races. This backstory was actually taken from the insane beliefs of Nazi occultism espoused by Heinrich Himmler. On a less fun and far more tragic note, The genocidal campaign carried out by the Eastern Europan Empire to exterminate the \u201cDarcsen\u201d race actually follows sequence of the Holocaust fairly accurately with massive propaganda first, then forced labor camps and ghettos, then extermination squads that closely follow and collaborate with the invading Imperial Army to exterminate any Darcsen villages in newly conquered areas, and finally fully operational death camps. Interestingly, in America our experience learning about Nazi genocide consists of reading \u201cNight\u201d, \u201cThe Diary of Anne Frank\u201d, \u201cNumber the Stars\u201d, and maybe watching \u201cSchindler\u2019s List\u201d. Our school history textbooks only focus on the Western Front, so most Americans believe that the Holocaust was the murder of 6 million Western European Jews who almost entirely died in extermination camps. In reality only 60% of the victims ever saw a camp, with 30% killed by death squads and ghettos making up the remaining 10% of deaths. However, these paramilitary \u201ceinsatzgruppen\u201d only operated on the Eastern Front where 5.5 million of the 6 million Jewish deaths occurred, so they have been erased from America\u2019s popular history and collective memory. If you actually visit the Holocaust Museum in Washington DC or talk to history scholars you will learn about them of course, but in American movies, Television, books, comics, games, you will almost never hear a word about them. Yet in this somewhat obscure JRPG they actually get this detail right! As I said earlier, these are just a few examples.\\n\\n\r\nLastly, Valkyria Chronicles avoids 2 common mistakes that are often made by lesser quality historical fiction. Valkyria Chronicles always remembers to show war principally as suffering, death, and loss. Many civilians and at least 1 of your main characters will die no matter which actions you choose in the game, or how skilled you become at it. By portraying war as fundamentally inglorious by its very nature, it manages to avoid the jingoistic bullshit that convinces a new generation that war is about an awesome display of patriotism and manliness. War is not something to embrace and look forward to! Valkyria Chronicles also has a diverse cast of characters displaying the good and bad on all sides. Real war is never a simple matter of good vs. evil with an army of noble elves vs. bloodthirsty orcs. In terms of nation, your side has plenty of bastards on it, and the East Europan Empire is given some sympathetic characters. In terms of ethnicity, the main villains are ethnic Germans, but so are many of the heroes including the main hero. Basically, it is a very good game and one I would highly recommend playing, even if you aren\u2019t really into strategy RPGs.\\n\\n\r\nStory: \\n\\n\r\nValkyria Chronicles takes place as previously mentioned in an alternate timeline during a period that roughly corresponds to our timeline\u2019s World War 2.The main story of Valkyria Chronicles is that war has broken out between 2 massive factions over control of a vital mineral resource called \u201cragnite\u201d. The East Europan Empire decides to invade the small, neutral country of Gallia for its resources and because they believe it wouldn\u2019t really be able to fight back. However, Gallia is home to an extremely brilliant tactical commander named Welkin Gunther, whose father was a revered tank commander from the First Europan War. Welkin\u2019s father was also close friends with a Darcsen engineer that built him a revolutionary new tank model called the Edelweiss. After the famous tank engineer was killed in a car accident, the Gunther family adopted his young daughter Isara, who clearly inherited her father\u2019s brilliance for engineering and revolutionary designs. Welkin teams up with his adopted sister Isara along with a local town watch member in order to escape his hometown with the Edelweiss. Since he brought his own tank and was the son of a national hero, Welkin is given command of a small squadron that soon becomes the absolute bane of the Empire\u2019s existence.\\n\\n\r\nThe first half of the anime very closely followed the game\u2019s story, but later a number of really head-scratching changes are made. Every time the anime changed a plot point from the game, they came up with something that wasn\u2019t as good. Why bother changing something if you are just going to make it worse, especially when you have all the time and resources on your side?! The game was complete, so they weren\u2019t forced to go their own route. Basically they changed some things for absolutely no reason and ended up making it worse. The anime also decided to censor itself and really tone down the brutality, which badly undercut important elements of the presentation and themes that the game had. The racial ideology of the Empire and their hatred for the \u201csub-human\u201d Darcsen race is extremely downplayed in the anime. For example, the labor camp that squad 7 tries to liberate is in far more humane condition in the anime and the Empire only fires artillery at the camp when squad 7 refuses to halt an attack after several warnings. In the game, the Darcsen in the labor camp are herded into a building and set on fire regardless of Squad 7\u2019s actions because the Empire absolutely refused to risk the possibility that Squad 7 succeeds in freeing the Darcsen prisoners. The mobile killing squads (einsatzgruppen) that in the game collaborated with the Imperial Army to exterminate Darcsen villages were completely left out of the anime. No explicit mention of genocide is ever even made in the anime! What is most puzzling of all is that the game was only rated T, so it wasn\u2019t as if the anime needed to make changes to avoid a high rating and release to a wider audience. Basically, the anime self-censored in a way that damaged the product for reasons that don\u2019t even make financial sense! Maybe the marketing team for the anime thought that Neo-Nazis would be the core demographic and they needed to avoid offending them?!\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\\n\r\nThe main character is Welkin Gunther, who is an extremely gifted battle strategist, but detests war and actually just wants to be a teacher. He continues to command only to protect the live\u2019s of his squad. He is extremely quirky and socially awkward, but has a very high standard of morality and leadership. Basically just picture Yang Wenli from Legend of the Galactic Heroes. It\u2019s the same damn character! There is also the shy and brilliant engineer Isara and the fiery love interest Alicia, who has many \u201ctsundere\u201d traits but isn\u2019t constantly punching Welkin for perceived perversion and isn\u2019t extremely obnoxious\u2026unlike most tsundere characters. In the game, Squad 7 has 56 characters that are each given at least 3 paragraphs of backstory, a dozen unique lines of dialogue, and the game actually contains some interesting minor characters. The anime had 26 full episodes and a LOT more time to flesh out the characters, so that\u2019s what they did right? WRONG! The anime actually scraps the vast majority of Squad 7 and decides to focus solely on the main few characters, however it doesn\u2019t even do that well! It would have been at least acceptable if the main 7 characters were given more interesting development and better dialogue, but that doesn\u2019t happen either. In most adaptations like Game of Thrones, there are characters that were more developed and better in the source material (Asha) and characters that were better in the adaptation (Rob Stark). In Valkyria Chronicles, I can\u2019t think of a single character that was better in the anime, despite the massive advantage in time and resources that the anime had over the game. They really fucked up here! There is just no getting around that fact!\\n\\n\r\nMusic:\\n\\n\r\nThe music in the anime is almost entirely music from the game. Why is this a problem? If this was an adaptation of a Final Fantasy game with an amazing soundtrack, it would be perfectly acceptable to use symphonic adaptations of the game\u2019s OST. However, Valkyria Chronicles was NOT a very high quality soundtrack. Although video game soundtracks have come a long way from a 30 second repeating loop being acceptable, an entirely different standard exists for TV shows and movies. What was at least an acceptable soundtrack for an early, sleeper hit PS3 game is a very lackluster soundtrack for a fairly large budget anime. This anime had the money, so why not get better music? You changed the plot and characters for no reason and made them worse, so why bother keeping the 1 thing that could have easily been improved??! Anime director - \u201cNope, we must keep completely faithful to the original game soundtrack! People love that soundtrack so much that they would never forgive us if we changed it!\u201d\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\\n\r\nThe art is good. If I had to say 1 nice thing about this anime and figure out what the hell happened to all the budget, the answer is the art and animation.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\\n\r\nIs Valkyria Chronicles ultimately a bad anime? No. It still has plenty of positive elements and although it is a very watered down adaptation it still manages to be average or slightly better than average compared with the quality of other anime of its year. What frustrates me so much about this anime is that it was a large budget adaptation of an absolutely phenomenal game and SHOULD have been amazing! Instead it was just\u2026meh. So does it fail as an adaptation relative to expectations and budget? You bet your ass it does! I was divided on whether to give it a 6 or a 5 out of 10, but I ultimately went with a very generous 6.\\n",

            "content": "Valkyria Chronicles\r\nWhat would make you go to war? Everyone has some line that can't be crossed. Weather it is your home being taken away, your family and friends are in danger, or your lover is also going to war. In \u201cValkyria Chronicles\u201d a small country is pushed into a war that they most likely will not win. Now the people of that country need to ask themselves that very question. \r\nWhen the show starts out the thing is a mess. The story was slowly paced and had filler episode thrown in so it took forever to tell anything. Slow pacing I could have dealt withbut it felt like it didn't even know what it wanted to do. The story felt disconnected and it jumped from trying to push focus on the story to the characters and back again. Trying to develop characters and a story is great but the way it was done the whole thing felt unnatural and forced. On top of that I couldn't tell what kind of mood the show was trying for. Sometimes it felt easy-going and comical well other times it felt dark and dramatic. Maybe the show was trying to blend the two or it was purposely going back and forth. Whatever the case, it didn't work.\\n\\n\r\nDespite all these problem somewhere along the way the show managed to pull itself together. First the show decided it wanted to be a drama. A joke will pop-up now and then, but the show firmly places itself on the dramatic side of the line. The balance between characters and story development is also solved. Storyline elements help develop characters now and the show no longer has to forcibly insert some small story element just to get a little character development for someone. This also made the story feel much stronger and flow more nicely. By the time the show ends almost every problem I had at the beginning is fixed. \\n\\n\r\nThe story takes an interesting mix a fantasy and WWII-ish fighting. Never relying too much on one over the other. The weapons of war are along the lines of rifles and tanks, but at the same time almost everything in the world is power by a material called \u201cRagnite\u201d. This material also ties in with the legend of the Valkyrian, and I bet you can guess that the Valkyrian ends up making an appearance by the end. Changing the setting from the usual futuristic or sword and sorcery gives the show a different feel them many others.\\n\\n\r\nThe show manages to create and develop a terrific cast on both sides of the war. Each person has his/her reasons for entering the war and a great back story that goes along with that reason. In some cases these reasons lead to strong social issues that are not easy to overcome for the character even when they know they are in the wrong. \u201cValkyria Chronicles\u201d really strives to make you care about these characters and by the end it really pays off. The show pulls off some truly emotional moments between these characters; weather it be between characters on the same or apposing side, friends or lovers.\\n\\n\r\nBeyond the main cast there is a bunch of soldiers under the various commanders. Really they are all just there to fill the void of the squad. However everyone of these characters is pulled from the video game. Like the video game each has their own distinct name and personality. This is good because it gives the squad more personality then just a bunch of nameless faceless soldiers. This is not so good because they are all just glorified extras. By giving them a personality it kind of feels like the show is going to do something with them. They don't really get any development and the only part they play in the story is that you can't win a battle with one person you need a whole squad. The show also through in a few inside jokes between the squad members that only people who have played the game will get.  These are never important enough that someone who hasn't play the game will not get the full experience but it is a nice little extra for those who have. All and all I think this is preferable to a bunch of nameless soldier just don't expect too much from them.\\n\\n\r\nThe art style has something of a pencil drawn look to it (for lack of any better way of explaining it). This is an attempt to try to copy the art style of the video game. Personally I think it fails in this respect but none the less I like it. It manages to keep a traditional anime look and at the same time can stand out in a crowd.\\n\\n\r\nI have a lot of bad things to say about the beginning and a lot of good things to say about the end. If you can make it through the not so good beginning, you will have a great story and cast waiting for you. However part of me cannot forgive the show for taking so long to get there.",

            "content": "Valkyria Chronicles ends up being a bland, predictable anime, full of tired cliches and one dimensional characters. While it's epic setting and relative industry quality art make it seem like it has potential, it ends up becoming more disappointing as it fails to live up to those standards in any other area.\r\nValkyria uses a fictional historical setting roughly mirroring a World War 2 style conflict, then ends up spoiling the humanity of the story by adding in fantastical ancient powers just waiting to be awoken that trump the actions of any hero, general, or army. It's cast of characters might as well come from oneof those doll templates from the 90s, click, click, click, new hairstyle, different color eyes, one personality trait (tough guy, mean girl, gay guy, shy girl, you get the picture) and you have Squad 7, a cast of characters I can't even get worked up about if any or all of them were to catch a bullet. The male lead is a bad clone of Yang Wenli (see Legend of the Galactic Heroes if you're interested in a real war anime), and the female lead is just every \u201cgood girl\u201d you've seen in every anime ever. The main villian is one of the most stupid I have ever seen in an anime and is a real letdown in terms of being a threat in any manner other than a frontal assault. More is promised in terms of court intrigues on both sides, but this too ends up being a real letdown. Don't get me wrong \u201cwarrior spirit\u201d has it's place in anime...it just isn't in an anime in this setting based on a tactical RPG. There's a few tactical tricks near the start of the series, but after that tactics and strategy take a backseat to the tired \u201cwho has the most to protect\u201d style emotional combat. The soundtrack is nothing special and desperately wants to be Final Fantasy Tactics. \\n\\n\r\nAll that said, I couldn't bring myself to hate Valkyria, I was just bored and more than a little disappointed by it. If you are younger and haven't watched much anime I can see some people really getting into this. If you have watched any great anime that you can compare it to, the shallowness of the story and the wasted potential should be obvious. There are worse animes out there, but this one doesn't deviate from the standard formula at all, and isn't even a great example of that standard formula either. I guess if you lower your expectations going in, you'll be able to get through this, but if you let you hopes get up (like I seem to have) over the setting and the potential within it you'll just end up disappointed like me. There's literally nothing new here, and no characters I ended up caring about.",

But sure, one thing, I realized..the serious tone doesn't get fine along with the anime, its plot holes are easily seen..Bwahahaha!! But don't care anymore, Romantic + Comedic = Uber SATISFACTION!!\r\nBwahahaha!!\r\nWell, what can I say without any spoilers??? Hmmmm....It ended with a happy ending...You'll already know it!! Although very averag-y and cheesy, I still can't get enough of happily ever after. I got what I want, although I might say I was, of course, been surprised about some unpredictable turn of events. But nevertheless, itadded to the sweetness of the story. \\n\\n\r\nWelkin - sama deserves my highest respect!! I truly love him, that's why I would want to see more of his weird expressions and statements. He truly belongs in a unique category of heroes!! Wushu!!\\n\\n\r\nWell, anywayz.... I could say that Valkyria Chronicles isn't perfect. You'll easily spot its weak points. The good thing is, when enjoyment factor would be on discussion, it will surely deliver. \\n\\n\r\nSo to all my fellow Otakus --- I would want to share with you the cute moments I felt during my sojourn in the world of Gallia and Empire. I hope you could feel its special aura!! Hehehehe...\\n\\n\r\nGambatte!!\\n\\n\r\nFrom someone-who-want-to-meet-Welkin-in-the-real-world,\\n\r\nMe\\n\\n\\n\r\n^_^\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\n********************14/26 episodes seen***************************\\n\\n\r\nI don't care how many plot holes this anime has!! and with cliche~ish moments every now and then...no need to bother them as I am already satisfied...because VALKYRIA CHRONICLES --- oozes with COOLNESS FACTOR to the bones!! Bwahaha!! Because of this one, I felt faith again!! There are still hope in the Anime Community. Bwahahaha!!!\\n\\n\r\nAhermmm...Sumimasen...\\n\\n\r\nAnyways, back to the topic. I accidentally fell over with this one. I saw its title from somewhere then immediately rushed to myanimelist to check. I was surprised that it received good reviews, because I believe this hasn't received much talkings (or am I Wrong?) Well, anyways..I was actually hesitant at first because I thought it might be a very lousy war title and I just might be put into a suicidal chair. But, GOOD THING...I wasn't blessed with a perfect intuition! Bwahahaha!!!\\n\\n\r\nI easily fell in love with it! It wasn't as heavy as what  I thought at first. It actually has nice balance of themes which a good anime could offer: Has a light approach, but with a serious tone; Not bloody, could totally be enjoyed by everyone even children; funny yet touching (kinda reminds you of the holocaust); and of course, the most important ingredient..hihihihi....the ROMANTIC BLINGY that has been circulating my hypothalamus ever since. \\n\\n\r\nBwahahaha!! Yeah, I'm writing this one because of my undying emotion towards the love pyramid that the main characters have.!! I am not even half the series, yet I already feel this unstoppable urge to say something about my new found love duo!! Wushu! I always find my new dream love team, they are already so many, now I can't even remember them. Don't mind me, I'm talking to myself..hehe ^_^\\n\\n\r\nAnyhowzz..I could say that Valkyria is quite similir with Code Geass, well yeah, of course, since they are of both war type. But good thing, my comparison would be in favor with this one..hehehe.. I enjoyed Geass, but not like this smiling - wholeheartedly enjoyment for Valkyria. => Unlike Code Geass, Valkyria has a soft nature which could give you a relaxing feeling. Although, it's in the middle of a war, you still can't help but be ...happy! Tee hee! I don't know..Happiness is the name of the game. Well, I don't blame Geass, because of course, it is written that way, the plot is very serious and dark. But what I am pointing is that...well,,,hehehe...just to make Valkyria shine...whatever...don't mind me...hehehe...\\n\\n\r\nWhere am I? Okay. May I tell you something about the characters? I'm still on episode 14, so I do not know what's still gonna happen next, but from my initial observation, I could say that...WELKIN GUNTHER is totally KAKKOI!! **nosebleed** He's totally a weirdo, but of course, a genius in disguise. Who wouldn't like him? A very naive guy, but is totally an incredible man. He fights with a very sure-to-win plan! And even though, how great and smart his oppenents are, he, of course, outlasts them! Nyarhahahahahah!! (kinda fishy, he always wins no matter what)\\n\\n\r\nThen we also have, Alicia. I was so happy that Marina Inoue voices her. My golly, Marina-san always receive good roles but I felt she was already typecasted with this kind of roles..but anywhoozz, so great of her! Back to Alicia, well, she's your typical strong natured female personality whose prowess captures the hearts of men..Bwuhuhuhu!! I am now being jealous of her..Argh..but I know Welkin-sama and Alicia would be a perfect love team, so I'll let them be.! So that means, noooooooooooooooooooo other partiesss!!! (but this makes the story more interesting..tee hee!)\\n\\n\r\nThen we also have.. I won't tell it anymore. Since I felt my ramblings had been so out-of-town already. Gomen!\\n\\n\r\nOver all, I am still keeping my hopes high! I know there are more happy episodes to come. I just hope that they don't disappoint. ! **always fingers crossed**\\n\\n\\n\r\nFrom someone-who-can't-get-over-with-the-romantic-affair-of-this-Anime-100%,\\n\r\nMe\\n\\n\r\n^_^",

            "content": "One of the more garbage anime I have ever watched. Unbelievable that the top 2 rated reviews are 10's. I wanted to stab myself with a writhing swordfish and vomit blood everytime the estrogen for brains MC showed his lack of testicular fortitude.\r\nI'll start with the story. The story is awful. I didn't play the PS3 game so I'm not going to judge this through any biased lense, nor am I going to necesarilly blame the animators if they were just sticking with the source material, but trash is trash no matter how much you sugar coat it with Alicia's subtle yet blazing hot zettairyuoiki. The premise is basically just a highly fictionalized version of WW2 where darcsens = jews. Most of the plot developments are highly predictable cliche scenarios, ie: corrupt superiors and war time violence. Nothing is wrong with this, troupes and genericism are fine in my book if the execution is good, sadly the execution in Valkyria Chronicles is essentially analogous to dying horribly of starvation and disease in a concentration camp which ironically enough is literally a partial description of this anime's shambles of a plot. Without spoiling, the WW2 parallels get thrown out the window a little over halfway through and this somehow devolves into a more cliched ridiculous pisstake than it already was.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is okay. I say that because the art style itself is very good in my opinion. Alicia and Selvaria are so cute my pocket rocket does a shaft neck tilt every time one of them gets a second of screentime. The character designs as a whole are a strong point in this anime, but thats pretty much all I can say thats good about the art. The animation quality is decent, but very poor during the action scenes. I actually spit out my drink at one sequence during a later episode that looked straight out of MS Paint. The backgrounds were boring but okay for the most part. Also there was this stupid shading pattern that looked like random streaks they used which served no purpose whatsover except to make it look like they actually did something unique and admirable in the animation style. really pissed me off and made me lightly cut my wrist a few times. Overall the art is pretty bad and makes u want to gougue your eyes out like everything else in this anime.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound was largely trash and by trash I mean decent material. Both OP's were okay & both ED's were okay. Nothing standout but at least it didn't make me want to jump off a cliff like the recycle bin storytelling. It had a generic video game/action flick soundtrack during the actual epsiodes, so basically just trash.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters were the equivalent of ur neighbor's kid taking a voracious dump on your porch and I mean that in the most detestable way possible. The only reason its not a 1 is because the invading antagonists were actually pretty interesting characters up until the end where they all devolved into  cliche riddled wank-stains. Our MC here, Welkin, is probably the worst MC of all time in any medium. He's a total softy and continually fails to do anything heroic or respectable beyond the most intrinsic required level of MC heroism. He acts like the corrupt military's lapdog and does everything in his power to cower out of the romance plotline. bruh literally tried to get friendzoned. he also gets finessed at every turn & this trash heap of an anime tries to frame it admirably ike being a babyback bitch is actually a redeemable quality. Ignoring the MC (which is impossibru because hes the MC lol), the characters are mostly stale one-note token characters. These issues become exponentially more prevalent when whatever edgefest overlord wrote this story reveals his fetish for \"permanent consequences\" for some of the more interesting characters in the show, which I won't elaborate any more on to avoid spoilers. basically the characters made me want to kill myself in a number of ways. Also the facial expressions were absurdly predictable, moreso than in any other anime I've seen. So yeah characters are truly awful in this anime - 0/10. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment? Whats that? Never heard of it, or maybe im suffering temporary trash-induced amnesia because enjoyment seems like a foreign concept at the moment. i dont know how else to word it, but this anime is trash. if you want to watch an anime that makes u want to carve out your own heart with a steak knife than Valkyria Chronicles is the anime for you. \\n\\n\r\nOverall this anime is complete trash i give it a -4/10 but MAL forces you to use absolute values so 4/10 aka it sucks!",

            "content": "The Valkyria Chronicles series is a set of tactical RPGs based on the second world war and created by Sega in 2008 for the Playstation 3. I have never played it, not having a PS3 personally. I just wanted to put that out there since there's an anime adaptation and I've been asked to review it. So if they screw up the game's story, I'm not going to know it. What I'm goint to be looking at is whether or not the anime holds up on its own. It should, since it's an adaptation of the game's story. Let's take a look at Valkyria Chroniclesthe anime and see if it manages.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is pretty simple. There's a war between the Imperial Alliance and the Federation. Naturally, the Enterprise gets called in to... Wait, wrong federation. The story focuses on a small principality called Gallia that gets caught up in the war on the Federation's side due to its resources. The main focus is on the Gallian Militia's squad seven as they fight various campaigns and the war advances. There are some issues with the series. The first is the pacing. The beginning is pretty slow, and then they start running out of time towards the end so they run through the material left without giving the audience much time to have a reaction. The second problem is the ending, it's cheesy and not in a good or endearing way. There's also a plot element that doesn't make sense. All I can say without giving away major spoilers is that there's a character with a power. This character knows they have this power, it is a power that could give their side a huge advantage, but this character doesn't use it until near the end. There is no reason given for why this is the case. I could speculate, but it really should have been explained within the narrative. There are some good aspects as well. There are some really well done emotional moments. I can't really talk about them in detail without giving spoilers though. You'll know them if you've seen them. Possibly if you've played the game, assuming the plots are the same. The series also manages its tone really well. It blends serious moments with more light-hearted ones without diminishing either. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters in this fall into two categories. The developed ones and the ones who are there and have names but you know virtually nothing about except for a few basic details. To use squad seven as an example, the developed characters are Welkin, Alicia, Isara, Rosie and Largo, who don't even make up half the group. Maybe the game spends more time with everyone else and benefits from it, I don't know. I'm tempted to call the cast size unwieldy, but they had to have a large cast. A story about a massive armed conflict wouldn't work if you only saw a dozen or so people. The scope would be screwed up. But this does have the unfortunate effect of making a lot of characters read as stereotypes of one kind or another. Another problem is the romance. A lot of it does not work very organically and comes off as contrived or forced. Still, the developed characters do make for some interesting dynamics and good tension. \\n\\n\r\nThe art in this is pretty nicely done. The characters look good and most of the action scenes are effective. The reason I say \"most\" is that there are some fight scenes towards the end that just look absurd and are kind of difficult to follow.\\n\\n\r\nThis has a really good cast. You have Takahiro Sakurai, who seems to appear in a major role in a lot of game-based anime. You also have Kuwashima Houko, Otsuka Akio, Oohara Sayaka, Fukuyama Jun and Inoue Marina, among others. Some of the music is really good and some of it is kind of forgettable. \\n\\n\r\nThe yuri factor is a 3/10. There are some scenes that read as kind of homo-erotic. Although they don't really go anywhere in the end. \\n\\n\r\nAnd that was Senjou no Valkyria: Gallian Chronicles. When everything is taken into account, it's a decent anime. My final rating is going to be a 6/10. If you enjoy war stories that aren't too serious or you're a fan of tactical RPGs you'll probably appreciate it. I can't really speak for fans of the original game, the anime might have gotten something egregiously wrong that infuriates them. Alternatively, they could consider it an excellent supplement.  All I can say for certain is that it's decent as a stand alone work, but not really good.",

For any of you out there looking for adventure/action bit of fantasy and romance together, here is your anime. \r\nThe first three episodes are sort of slow, but once you get passed those, the anime keeps getting better and better. \r\nThe story in itself is not that original, but the way it is portrayed in the anime itself, makes it orignal.  It is a story about war, and why one fights. \r\nOne outstadning point of this anime are the characters. Even if it is justa side character, all of them are given personalities and little side stories, and the main characters have odd, but wonderful personalities. \\n\\n\r\nThe anime is funny at the beginning, but turns into a drama later on, and at some point will even make those who cry at sad parts ( like me ) cry. \\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed this anime very much, and recommend it to anybody who loves action mixed with drama comedy fantasy and war stories!",

            "content": "Intro: I must confess, I was quite disappointed with this anime adaptation.  I first heard of it when I was playing the game (which, by contrast, is amazing) and a friend happened to look over my shoulder and said that he recognized it.  I asked if he played, but he said that only knew it because he had watched the anime.  As a big fan of the game, I was immediately interested and enthusiastically searched for a way to watch \"Senjou no Valkyria\".  You mean, there's MORE of the awesomeness and adorableness that is Valkyria Chronicles?!  HELL YEAH!However, what I watched did not meet my expectations, nor did it rise to meet them.  Granted, I will be the first to admit that I expected the anime to follow the game, even build upon its preexisting greatness; however, to my immense chagrin, the anime went in different direction, and not a good one.  Here's why beginning from least to greatest:\\n\\n\r\nSound (6/10): In the game, I thought that the sound/music was its weakest point, as there was not much of variety of osts, nor did they differ much in tone.  However, I thought the sound effects were decent and the voice-acting was good.  Conversely, this was, in my opinion, the least problematic part of the anime.  It used the soundtrack from the game, and did not add much to it.  It certainly did not significantly contribute to my condemnation of this anime, nor was it sufficient to increase my opinion of it either.  Never underestimate the effect of a well-placed, powerful ost...or a sniper round...\\n\\n\r\nArt (6/10): Second, I would like to discuss the artwork.  While it irked me at times during the game thanks to its minimalist direction, really only showing facial expression and dialogue during majority of the game's cut-scenes, I can appreciate their ability to stick to their guns (pun intended).  The game remained true to the story-book motif, and while it would have been nice to have seen more of the characters' interactions, I can respect the reasons why they chose that idea and how it made the player pay more attention to what the characters were saying and how they felt.  Additionally, the cell-shaded water-color graphics were really quite beautiful.  Certainly, I can understand why the director chose to retain the art style from the game (which was really the only thing the two have in common), since the anime does not use the story-book motif, the cell-shade art style, though pretty, seemed out of place.  Additionally, since the anime was not bound by that motif, I felt that they could have done more with it than they elected to do.  Furthermore, (I'm not a pervert, I swear) why did they make noticeable alterations in the proportions of the female characters for the anime?  The women warriors of the game were already beautiful; was that really necessary?\\n\\n\r\nStory (3/10): The above categories were simply slight irritations; now we are getting to crux of my complaints against this anime and I shall endeavor to be a spoiler-free as possible (although this anime is already quite spoiled in my opinion).  Yes, whenever any form of media is adapted to another, there will ALWAYS be at least minor discrepancies.  I knew to expect at least some differences, but in my view, the story veered too far from what Valkyria Chronicles is (to me at least) supposed to be.  The game, as well as the anime, spend a large portion of time on the character interactions rather than the battles.  While the action sequences in the anime were decent, even I (who places a stronger emphasis on story over action) felt that the battles scenes were too brief.  In my view of the anime, they would spend about 90% of the episodes on nonsensical character interactions (more on that later) and only include maybe a 1 - minute battle scene.  As an anime based (loosely) off a strategy game, I can understand why they would chose to axe the tactical discussion and planning portion of \"Senjou no Valkyria\" first to avoid boring a casual fan of the anime and to make room for more important components, though I felt that each of the quite short battle sequences just happened randomly without much forethought.  The tactics and strategy of Valkyria Chronicles is an integral part of its essence and what made it so good; the anime might have been better if they included a little more of that essential essence.  To a degree that I didn't expect, they changed so many plot details and occurrences that the anime only vaguely follows the progression of the game.  While the plot of the game was not its strongest point either (evil empire attacks and underdog wins), it did not behoove the anime to stray too far from what was established, because it worked.  Furthermore, the anime's light-hearted, campy tone differed from the game, which was mostly serious broken by sweet and/or funny moments.  At the same time, the majority of the anime's story focuses on overly-dramatized character interactions, whereas, the game keeps the interactions simple, yet profound.  No unnecessary fluff.  Perhaps my main knock against the anime storyline was its lack of cute Welkin x Alicia moments (c'mon, that was hardly a spoiler).  Part of what made the game so charming and memorable was the relationship-building moments during the bite-sized cut-scenes.  I had (wrongly) hoped that that adorable moments I was denied in the game due to the minimalist art direction would at least show up in full-picture during the anime; to my great disappointment, most did not cross over into the anime.  Since Valkyria Chronicles is, at heart, a love story; those small, but vital moments being absent from the anime really soured the series for me.  I will admit though, that the anime did two things better than the game: Zaka's appearance and Character X's death.  In the game, Zaka kind of just shows up after Fouzen and is like, \"Well, looks like I'm joining your squad now as a support tank!\"  Wait...what?  At least in the anime, his transition make more sense and is smoother.  Additionally, in the game, when Character X dies, there's about two scenes that deal with their death and then everyone is like, \"Well, this is sad, but we still have a war to fight.  Let's go.\"  ...ouch...cold...  The anime storyline does improve later in the series, but it is too little, too late.  i could point out many example of divergences between the game and the anime, but that would take even longer and I don't believe it's that worth it.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter (2/10): Okay, so this is my biggest and fiercest grievance against \"Senjou no Valkyria\": they screwed up the characters, completely!  I usually care more about the overall plot than the characters whenever I engage in any sort of media, but Valkyria Chronicles the game is a rare exception.  While certainly a classic, the underdog-beats-big-bad-empire plot line is hardly novel, but its the characters and their interactions are what make Valkyria Chronicles spectacular.  I'm very critical of main characters, because it's very easy to make them generic, but I really liked game Welkin.  He's a decisive, and brilliant military officer, and as a fellow 22-year-old ecologist, I thought he was extremely relateable guy.  Though a LITTLE spacey and awkward, especially when entering eco-geek mode, (game) Welkin is an honest, calm, and caring man more-than-deserving of Alicia.  I really respected him as the game's protagonist and consider him one of my favorites.  In contrast, anime Welkin has to be one of my most hated protagonists.  They greatly exaggerated the spacey and oblivious aspects of his personality, made him incredibly indecisive (which is a huge no-no for a supposed military commander/war hero), and dense.  Episode 11: \"Oh...I didn't notice that Alicia was cute.  I just saw her as a subordinate (insert head-knock and tee-hee here).\"  YOU IDIOT!!  In the game, we've established that you think Alicia is cute by the beginning of chapter 3 (and vice versa)!  That was perhaps the most painful and inaccurate thing to watch in the anime.  Ah, yes, speak of the devil (angel?): Alicia.  I was greatly saddened by how they chose to portray her in the anime.  As a video game character, Sgt. Alicia Melchiott is probably one of my favorites, she's a beautiful, bad-ass warrior woman who still has cute, thoughtful, and sweet aspects to her persona; when I heard that I could get more of her in anime form, I was like \"YES!\"  But what did I (and perhaps many other fans) get instead?  A generic tsundere.  Okay, I confess, that the tsundere is my favorite anime girl archetype (it's n-not like I l-like it or anything, baka!  SO CUTE!  YES!), but Alicia is NOT one of them (or isn't supposed to be).  Alicia is only hostile towards Welkin during the Prologue of the game because of the CIRCUMSTANCES; she arrests him because she thinks he's an Imperial spy.  After she's convinced he's not, Alicia is nothing but warm, friendly, supportive, and sweet towards him (except when he says she's \"beetle-tastic\" or makes hold hold the goat excrement) because that's her personality is like.  One cannot be a tsundere of circumstance; it's either part of a character's preexisting personality (perhaps influenced by circumstances) or not, and Alicia has too sweet a natural overall personality to be a tsundere.  The decision to portray her in the series as a tsundere   Finally, good things, (and bad things) come in three, let's get the finale of this unholy trinity: Faldio.  He seemed like a fairly okay and chill sort of fellow in the game, but aside from plot-related stuff, he didn't factor into the story much.  In the anime, though, he plays a much more prominent role, and not in a good way.  Once again, they took a minor aspect of his personality, which is only mentioned in his personal file, and blew it out of proportion.  Yes, the game says he a flirt with the ladies, but he NEVER hits on Alicia, EVER.  Hell, that is not even implied at any point during the story; Alicia is Welkin's girl from day one and Faldio is enough of a bro to respect that boundary (of course, game Welkin isn't a blithering baka either).  Instead, in the anime, they focus the majority of the story on this tired love-triangle trope and push this weird Alicia x Faldio development and the rivalry that ensues between him and Welkin because of it, effectively reducing one of the best video game romances (and possibly one of the best fantasy romances) to nothing more than cheap, generic, angsty drama!  NO, THAT IS NOT OKAY!!  Everyone else I don't even care enough to comment on.  Oscar was kind of cool though.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (2/10): I know that when watching an anime is feels like chore, I'm not enjoying it.  I trusted the words of the friend who recommended it to me and kept hoping it would get better, but that hope was in vain.  If I haven't already made it clear why I think \"Senjou no Valkyria\" was not enjoyable, then I think you, dear reader, have missed the point of everything I have said up until now.\\n\\n\r\nOverall (4/10): Most disappointing, and a waste of my time.  You know an anime is bad when its best aspects are its art and music.  Yes, I knew the anime was going to be at least somewhat different from the game, but I was unprepared for discrepancies of this magnitude.  Even as I tried (I really did) to not compare it to the game, \"Senjou no Valkyria\", as a stand-alone anime series is, at best, mediocre.  If you are a fan of the game, I would strongly urge to not watch this anime, as you may be as disappointed as I was.  Sega and Sony are surely not lacking in monetary resources, so they had every means at their disposal to make \"Senjou no Valkyria\" something truly amazing as an anime, perhaps even better than the game.  Instead, as a fan of Valkyria Chronicles, the result greatly pained me.  That is why, dear reader, I spent two hours longer of my life on this sad excuse for anime adaptation of a fantastic game so that you, dear reader, can avoid falling into the same trap that I did.  I can only pray that my words do not fall upon deaf ears (eyes?)...and that you even bothered to read this far (which if you, you are to be commended, thanks :D).  If you truly want to experience the splendor, and awl, and absolute adorableness that IS Valkyria Chronicles, don't subject yourself to this anime.  Instead, play the game, because you, dear reader, deserve better than this.",

            "content": "(as written on The Hateful Anime Truth on Facebook)\r\nGames turned into Anime are almost equivalent to Hollywood's curse of bringing games to the big screen; It usually NEVER works, and you get a botched version of the game that you liked so much that you wished it never was born. For example, Tsukihime was a well-known Type-Moon RPG filled with many different paths, but in anime form, the director thought taking the BAD END of everything would work. Not entirely.\r\nIn came Valkyria Chronicles. An anime adaptation of the video game of the same name, starring Welkin Gunther, Isara Gunther, Alicia Melchiott and other important memberstaken straight from the game. Although a select few from the game were made of any importance to the anime, the rest happens to be in the back of the anime the whole time, or don't exist at ALL. But I'm getting a little sidetracked here. Let's start with the story aspect!\\n\\n\r\nStory:\\n\\n\r\nNormally, accuracy doesn't get you anywhere in animes, but this anime happens to follow the game's MAIN story. Emphasis on the word 'MAIN' in that one, because the game had many side-stories that also cover the main meat of some of the characters and gave a bit more backstory to some of the characters. The anime offers a straight-to-the-point, linear storyline that focuses mostly on the war and the war alone.\\n\\n\r\nBut hey, the main storyline really caught the attention here, so I'm giving that a 10 for linearity, smoothness, and accuracy to the game.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\\n\r\nHoly cow I never thought Selvaria couldn't get any hotter when she went into the anime front! Um-- I mean-- FORGET I SAID THAT!\\n\\n\r\nThe artists really did good work catching the very detail of Gallia, from the Gallian Army's clothing, to the tanks, weapons and armor of both armies.\\n\\n\r\nAnd dear god those jugs of Selvaria's are huge... UMM, MOVING ON!\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\\n\r\nAs one would have it, most, if not ALL the music was taken straight from the game. I was surprised when I heard Desperate Fight in one of the episodes, but it made that one battle scene way more epic.\\n\\n\r\nAnd that's about all I can say about sound.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\\n\r\nEvery character has their own personality. It's human nature. Valkyria Chronicles is no exception. Squad 7 is intentionally the most weird bunch of the whole army because of its quirky character choices, from the very introverted Susie, to the Lone Wolf Marina.\\n\\n\r\nThe villains have that 'calm-before-the-storm' type deal. The look cool, calm and collected, but at war, they become completely different people. It really did bring the best out of this anime.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL (since I can't think up of anything in the enjoyment factor and this review is taking too long):\\n\\n\r\nI'd highly recommend it to anyone whether they have played the game or not. The story is highly intriguing, keeps you at the edge of your seat, you don't know what's gonna happen until it does, and hell, it has its own tearjerker moments as well.\\n\\n\r\nWell done, Valkyria Chronicles, you've withstood the Game to Anime test.",

I dont understand why after reading many peoples comments on forums, their number 1 complaint would be that the anime is too different from the game.\r\nMany  viewers of this anime have also played or own the game while there are few who just happened to stumble upon Valkyria Chronicles. The ones that have watched this anime for the first time have nothing but praise for this anime. What I fail to understand is why people would want the anime adaption completely identical to the game? It baffles me.\r\nMyinterest level wasnt very high for this anime to begin with since I imagined it to follow the game directly. After a few episodes it greatly surprised me by focusing more on relationships and character development absent in the game... even taking whole episodes to explore. I found that extremely refreshing since I knew what was going to happen and this also hooked me into watching more episodes. Gallian chronicles added new dynamics to an already great story by adding a love triangle, different personalities of characters from the game, and a more drama type feel.\\n\\n\r\nAnother popular complaint was that the action and battles were secondary. This makes me question again why people and fans of the game dont appreciate the in depth character studies. I found that the action scenes had an appropriate amount of time and it wasnt necessary since the game was also based off of how love and friendship blooms during war.\\n\\n\r\nI found this anime had an assemble of characters and sub characters with very interesting personalities of their own and a gripping new storyline that diverges itself from the game to stand on its own. The ending seemed a little rush but I figured the show wasnt getting a green light for a 2nd season which is a huge shame... I just wish this series had more exposure and is appreciated for what it is. A rarity indeed.\\n\\n\\n",

The character developments are subtle, but well made.  The downside to this is that subtleness sometimes makes casual watchers with less than average emotional understanding puzzled.  \r\nThe characters started off as some of the worst personalities I've ever seen.  However, as the serie progress, an understanding is formed for these uniquepersonalities who may come off as a big pain in the ass.  The main character however is one of the most interesting male lead up to date.  As far as I can remember, masterminds like Lelouche, Kira (Light) is in a way much like him in term of intelligence.  Unlike Kira and Lelouch however is that, instead of being cool bad ass, he is very laid back.  This, I think is a great touch.  Most of us anime watchers really is fed up with terrible male leads in many ways, such as spineless, dumb, ugly, or completely overblown personality.  The main character here is one of the most intriguing male leads up to date.\\n\\n\r\nTo be quite honest, I wanted to give this show a 7-8, but a particular set of episode really changed my mind.  Without giving anything away, this show had great emotional moments where if you are watching with an unbiased mind, it's something we can really come to appreciate.  \\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion, this show is interesting, different, but not for everyone.  Long story short, if you watched through 5 or so episode without getting bored, completely enraged, your most likely going to enjoy this anime.\\n\r\nI hope this review is helpful in some way, feedback and criticism are welcome.",

            "content": "The Playstation 3 game Valkyria Chronicles has fun gameplay and an epic story, so I enjoyed every minute of it (unfortunately, the original and its PSP sequel hasn't sold enough enough to warrant a release for VC3 in the west). While its admirable that the anime tries to add a few things of its own to the story and characters, ultimately it only succeeds in becoming a rather loose adaptation that's inferior to the source material.\r\nThe opening of Valkyria Chronicles is engrossing  and contains elements similar to real-life conflicts such as World War I or II. The small country of Gallia, and its Squad7 militia, are basically underdogs stuck in a tug-of-war between two massive nations for its vast resources, and you're compelled to see how they will survive the war. Some of the drama in VC (such as discrimination against the Darcsen people) is executed very well, and certain aspects of war such as death is portrayed realistically, perhaps with enough impact to make you shed a tear or two. The pacing of the game was okay in terms of how it was separated into chapters, with several story cutscenes interwoven between various playable battles. Unfortunately, the pacing of the anime is relatively uneven with respect to how a sense of urgency is criminally absent in many episodes despite the aforementioned war; this is perhaps due to misplaced comedy, too much dialogue in certain places, or plot developments which drag for too long. The epilogue to the series, although perfectly welcome, lacks details from the game that would have made it amazing.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is solid and includes excellent action sequences during battles, especially the awesome abilities of the Valkyria. Character designs for the majority of the cast in VC is pretty much spot on, except Alicia looks younger and much less mature than in the game. The background art is nice and appropriate; there's a darker tone used to reflect the destruction and devastation caused by fighting, and brighter colours for the peaceful countryside scenery that's reminiscent of watercolour graphics used in the game (shame they couldn't replicate this in the anime).\\n\\n\r\nThe opening songs are sung by people with strong voices, especially the first one. Sound effects such as bullets firing and explosions are very clear. Voice acting is decent for the most part. There are several cool action sequences shown in the opening credits, so it's unfortunate that more of them aren't present in the series itself. Speaking of this, it's difficult but try to avoid watching the second opening; it contains massive spoilers that ruin surprising twists!\\n\\n\r\nA new character created for the anime, Ramal, is well-developed and provides interesting interactions with the others. The background stories of key characters such as Alicia, Selvaria and Rosie are well-told despite slight alterations from the game. And then there's General Damon; the anime does a fantastic job of making you hate this guy. There's a feeling of wasted potential when it comes to developing the remaining members of Squad 7; not enough focus is placed on them and instead it seems as if they're in the anime just to make up the numbers and take part in missions.\\n\\n\r\nThen there's the presence of a love triangle involving the main characters, and it's difficult to see why it was necessary in the first place. All that it manages to accomplish is ripping the spotlight away from Welkin, the son of a war hero and commander of Squad 7, and thrusting it onto his best friend Faldio (who's part of the same militia but in a different squad). Ironically this makes Faldio a more well-rounded and intriguing character, but Welkin becomes the opposite; at least in the game you get to control him in a tank and blow stuff up! Of course, this means Welkin is indecisive for large parts of the anime and his chemistry and communication with Alicia is severely lacking. The main leads, Welkin and Alicia, were a fantastic part of Valkyria Chronicles but are nowhere near as likeable in the anime. As a bonus insult the pacing of the story is badly affected by the love drama, and the time it takes up could have been put to better use developing the supporting cast.\\n\\n\r\nValkyria Chronicles is a more than average series with its focus on war, friendship and teamwork that deserves a solid 7 for those who have no knowledge of the game. I'd actually give it a 6 instead but only due to the fact that I've played the game, and while it's not a train wreck the anime adaptation doesn't compare well.\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Valkyria Chronicles (The PS3 game which is the source material of the anime) is a piece of art with it's immersive storytelling, humane and multi-dimensional representation of the main, and a certain part of the secondary cast of characters, and with it's subtle way of conveying about the \"\"two sides of the coin\", portraying the lack of solid difference between the warring factions of your ordinary soldier on either sides, all displayed on a background, unraveling the war-torn, even if fictional world of Europa.\r\n  And despite it's interesting premise, the anime adaptation of that material \"Senjou no Valkyria\", crashes down in allthe beforementioned highlights, which made this franchise different from the other similar ones, shoving in our face chewed up, and weirdly twisted story, altered with too much plot-holes, one dimensional characters, bearing resemblance to the original cast, but having their definitive traits hyperbolized to, in the most cases, abnormal and absurd scales. In the same way, the flow of the storyline in the source material, with it's ebbs and flows of relaxing adventures, followed by relatable and well-written personal struggles and political conflicts, from various perespectives is smashed up with the anime adaptation's almost seemingly two distinctive parts - the first episodes, giving you feel of watching teen rom-com with seemingly zero interest of the characters upon the current problems of the war (while it's assumed they're army recruits) and the second part, very hard trying to be more mature and serious, which by itself is step in the right direction, but in the current case, trying to build up tension and feeling of relateableness with the beforementioned \"haapy go lucky\" portrayal of the characters, which are dwarfed to the well-known archetypes (the Tsundere, the overly generic main character, the third wheel in the romance) is plain tragic to watch, and it also feels very awkward at times.\\n\\n\r\n  One of the important messages of the source material was, by showing us the sorrows and the horrors of the war, seen from the point of the common soldier, combined with his own personal struggles, reshapes his perception of right and wrong, but in the same time, by being in touch with his dreams and wishes, gives him will to prevail and move forward, which could also be an inspiration for us as well in our own lives.On the other hand, the major focus of the anime was mostly about the romantic relationships, and the unwavering unity of the squad, aka \"Friendship Power\" which sounds much more cheesy than developing actual plot and clever tactical strategies to outmaneuver and outwit their opponents, which makes any feeling of actual gritty combat non-existent in the anime. An also, the romantic aspect (which is one of the main themes here, it seems) is very poorly and unoriginally executed.\\n\\n\r\n  There is overall character development, but it's far from realistic and mostly relying on tropes, with the sole exclusion of Faldio, who gets far more screentime than in the source material, and he has his own developed story, which is a small breath of fresh air considering the others. The other good sides of the anime are the art and it's sound, although they're not really lifesaving for this adaptation in my opinion, since the story and character departments are handled horrible and almost parodically. \\n\\n\r\n  To summarize my thoughts - Senjou no Valkyria is not horrible anime by itself, although it's quite generic and average by any standards, which had great potential, if the source material was handled well, to be one of the best animes, depicting the feelings of hope and despair in wartime, which instead decided to be this light-hearted, bright-coloured goofy action which is good for killing time, but oblivious in any other serious aspect.\\n\\n",

From the start, I could predict EVERYTHING that was going to happen in the next five minutes, so when a battle started I was already bored, since it had justended in my mind. I kept watching on the hope that the love interest might amount to something instead of continuing to be a love triangle right to the end (what can I say, I like happy endings, not awkward, status quo endings), and there was a side love story that was fun to watch progress.\\n\\n\r\nThen episode 19 or 18 or something came around. Without giving too much away, there was a scene where someone was going to die, and it was playing out in slow motion for suspense. I made my prediction, and I felt it was the only obvious choice, when, oh snap! That was unexpected. Then sometime later it happened again! Just at the end the show managed to save itself with with a series of unexpected and interesting events.\\n\\n\r\nAlso, although I should have seen it  coming, I would have been completely surprised by something had it not been revealed in the OP 5 EPISODES TOO EARLY.",

But unfortunately, that was the high point of the anime for me. The art work and animations were both of very high quality. The sounds were also high in terms of technical quality. The voice acting went very well with the characters (although it was not necessarily a good thing, read below about my impression of the characters), and the music I did not take note of, but this is a indication of good music, according Feng Zhu(conceptartist) in one of his videos.\\n\\n\r\nMany of the characters, especially the main ones, felt like the overused, virtuous archtypes that -at least for me- made for some very bland characters. As a result, I felt myself enjoying the bad guys far more than the good guys', haha. The story wasn't very engaging to me either, but I did end up finishing the series hoping that the story will pick up and build to the main characters epiphanies where they shed their moral obligations as they reconciled with the world. \\n\\n\r\nNeedless to say, if those types of characters are what you are looking for, this should be a very enjoyable anime for you, as I think this also had some effect on the story for me. It was not an enjoyable anime series for me.",

            "content": "Well, well, well, look what we have here?  Can anyone say \"under-appreciated\" and \"under-watched\"?  Those words would probably describe Valkyria Chronicles very well.\r\nAt first glance, this anime probably doesn't look like anything special.  Originally based on a tactical role-playing game of the same name for the PS3, this anime might look like a couple of things.  At first glance, it might just look like a military anime that wants to chock itself full of violence and gunplay.  However, this is a serious, serious misconception.  Let's get to the review and see why, shall we?\r\nStory:  The story that encompassesValkyria Chronicles is as follows.  It takes place in the year 1935, in an alternate history where two opposing military factions, the Empire and the Federation, wage war against one another on the continent of Europa.  It's an alternate WWII inspired-setting, and one of the things that surprised me the most about this anime was a lack of giant robots.  Instead, their roles are taken by all manner of tanks, artillery pieces, and other standard military fare, all a-la-Advance Wars.  This, I felt, made the anime stronger, as they got by without using a concept used in so many other animes.  Continuing with the story, it kicks off in a small town called Bruhl in the neurtal territory of Gallia, where a young girl on town watch, Alicia Melchiott, happens to cross paths with the son of a Gallian General, whose name is Welken Gunther.  After this fateful meeting, the two are cast into the military life, where they battle for their lives and lives of their comrades, all while trying to stay relatively sane.  Unsurprisingly, there is a lot of romance in this anime, and it is some of the best I've seen.  In general, the plot is pretty amazing in my opinion, and from what I can tell, it follow the game pretty well.\\n\\n\r\nArt:  I believe that the art was good, though it could have been done just a little better.  I wasn't a big fan of the use of 3D effects in this anime, though I admit it was probably necessary for some parts.  Nevertheless, the character designs are awesome, and remain very close to their game counterparts.\\n\\n\r\nMusic:  A seriously amazing aspect of the series, in my opinion.  Both the OP and ED of the first half were awesome, and the second half, while not as on par, was also good in terms of the musical content.  All songs in the anime are definitely iPod worthy, and they easily fit the dramatic mood of the anime.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:  Definitely one of my favorite parts of the entire series.  All the characters make up a pretty diverse cast.  Welken and Alicia remain to be my favorites, mostly for their personalities and mannerisms when around one another.  Even still, the other members of the cast didn't end up just being placeholders.  I would warn all who watch this though.  Being a dramatic anime, I would expect some important character death.  Even still, it doesn't detract from the series at all, and instead strengthens it greatly.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:  Seriously, I believe this anime was extremely enjoyable, to the degree where I couldn't stop watching for a day straight.  It definitely, definitely deserves a spot on your DVD shelf, or on your hard drive.\\n\\n\r\nThere's not much else to say about Valkyria Chronicles.  In short, I believe it to be one of the most under-appreciated anime around.  In my book, I believe it deserves a perfect 10/10, as it was I believe to be a shining example of what SHOULD be done in an anime series.  In all honesty, this anime is highly, highly recommended, and a definite example of a diamond in the rough that should be dug up just a little more often.",

            "content": "Valkyria Chronicles went down in the Guinness Book of World Records as the best strategy-rpg on the PS3 and, having played it, I can't disagree. So when I found this anime (finally) I was pretty revved up.\r\nI looked for this anime a while ago but I could never find it, either because it hadn't been released or I simply didn't look hard enough. The fact that it has been adapted from a game shouldn't bother the ones who have played the game because it's a pretty faithful adaptation. The emphasis has simply shifted slightly, from the more war-oriented action game to a more character-driven story.\r\nStory- 9\\n\r\nYeah like I said the story and its basics are carried over from the game. If you know the game, you'll know how this ends up. If you haven't played the game, think of WWII, with the Imperials representing Germany (Does anybody else notice how disturbingly Aryan they all are? Gregor and Maximillian in particular), the Federation representing the Allies and France, the poor country representing Gallia, caught between the two. Unlike Hitler who seemed to start World War 2 just because he could, the Imperials decide to start a war over the mineral Ragnite, the lifeblood of that world. The story follows the exploits of Lieutenant Welkin Gunther and his Merry Men, Women and a Winged Pig, as they fight to protect the homeland from the Imperials.  Expect plenty of action and drama, comedy and the the odd love triangle. \\n\\n\r\nArt - 10\\n\r\nDefinitely can't decide if it's a step up or a step down from the game. However it's still quite beautiful to watch, because it almost literally is art. You can see where the pencil strokes have fallen. It won't be to everyone's tastes but I like it.\\n\\n\r\nSound - 9\\n\r\nBoth Intro and End themes are charming enough and the recycling of the game's soundtrack will be a pleasant addition for the gamers who watch this and even if you haven't played the game, you'll learn soon enough what each piece of music foretells.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters - 8\\n\r\nThe characters are plain awesome, from the romanticist Faldio, to Marina the Lone Wolf, to Selvaria the busty general of the Imps. Not all of them are prominent but they all feel unique, unlike your generic run-of-the-mill anime crowds. \\n\r\nWhy do I only give them an 8? I miss their English voicings. I know, I know but Welkin's \"SQUAD 7! MOVE OUT!\" and Largo's battle cry of \"ARGH VEGETABLES!\" became almost iconic to me and my friends, so it's disappointing I don't get to hear them in the anime.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 10\\n\r\nOh yes! To see the epic war for Gallia's survival without having to suffer through annoyances such as ridiculously agile enemy soldiers and my Edelweiss exploding for no apparent reason satisfied me to no end.\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 10\\n\r\nThis is the first 10 I've given to an anime. Maybe I'm slightly biased, I don't know (I probably am), but I genuinely can't ever remember enjoying a cross-media adaptation of something more. If you're a fan of the game WATCH THIS! It gives more insight into Squad 7 and it may or may not enhance your gaming experience. If you haven't played the game WATCH THIS! It's an enjoyable romp with a band of weirdo's and a tank that could probably do the donut.",

            "content": "Overview:\r\nValkyria Chronicles is not only one of my favorite games for PS3, but one of my favorite games of all time! So how does this anime live up to its video game inspiration? Well...it certainly isn't bad, but it also could have been a lot better. Give me just a few paragraphs and I will try to explain my thoughts. \r\nBackground:\r\nAs you are well aware, unless you have been living under a rock, there is a genre of fiction called \u201calternate history\u201d. Alternate history is basically imagining a separate timeline if one or 2 major events went differently. It is widely used across all formsof media from novels to anime to video games. A common sub-genre of alternate history is fantasy alternate history in which magic and different laws of physics exist, so we have to imagine how that would impact the events of history and shape the world. Both Fullmetal Alchemist and Code Geass are within this sub-genre, with FMA taking place in an alternate Nazi Germany and Code Geass also taking place in an alternate WW2 with Japan fighting against the Britannian (American) invaders. Valkyria Chronicles at first just looks like yet another WW2 fantasy alternate history, but it actually does many things quite differently and still feels rather unique. \\n\\n\r\nNote:\\n\\n\r\nThe next 3 paragraphs are talking about the game Valkyria Chronicles on which this anime was based. If you are already a fan of the game and only wish to read about the anime adaptation, you can just skip these paragraphs and start reading at the Story Section.\\n\\n\r\nFirstly, the alternate technology is powered by a fuel source called \"ragnite\", which has its own constraints and drawbacks. These realistic technological limitations prevent limitless asspulls, so it doesn't get as absolutely ridiculous as some other examples of alternate tech... like the original alternate WW2 story, \"The Man in the High Castle\" by Philip K Dick. A novel where by 1950 the Nazis have completely terraformed and colonized Venus and by 1960 have colonized every planet in the Solar System! It is fortunate for us Americans and our national pride that the SS Sturmbannf\u00fchrer, Wernher von Braun never saw a copy of High Castle. He would have died laughing and we would have lost the moon race as a result! Thanks a lot Philip K Dick! \\n\\n\r\nSecondly, the writers of the game really did some history research and managed to fit a bunch of obscure and interesting WW2 facts into the game\u2019s story. Here are just a few examples. Remember the absurdly giant tank during the last battle that used naval artillery and was like a battleship on treads? That was based on real blueprints for a German tank called the Landkreuzer P-1000 that ThyssenKrupp pitched to Hitler, who actually greenlit the project! The project was cancelled though in 1943 because the Nazi architect and weapons designer Albert Speer realized that it would be insanely vulnerable to aerial bombardment and suffer the same fate as other absurdly large \u201cwunderwaffen\u201d like the Schwerer Gustav Railway Cannon (which also appears in the game). In the world of Valkyria Chronicles, airpower doesn\u2019t exist so the plan went ahead. The Valkyria in the game\u2019s story are an extremely powerful, ancient race of warriors that came from a now sunken island in the farthest north. Their mystical powers are the result of a special energy that only their race can use, but it is believed they lost their abilities by intermixing with the physically weaker southern races. This backstory was actually taken from the insane beliefs of Nazi occultism espoused by Heinrich Himmler. On a less fun and far more tragic note, The genocidal campaign carried out by the Eastern Europan Empire to exterminate the \u201cDarcsen\u201d race actually follows sequence of the Holocaust fairly accurately with massive propaganda first, then forced labor camps and ghettos, then extermination squads that closely follow and collaborate with the invading Imperial Army to exterminate any Darcsen villages in newly conquered areas, and finally fully operational death camps. Interestingly, in America our experience learning about Nazi genocide consists of reading \u201cNight\u201d, \u201cThe Diary of Anne Frank\u201d, \u201cNumber the Stars\u201d, and maybe watching \u201cSchindler\u2019s List\u201d. Our school history textbooks only focus on the Western Front, so most Americans believe that the Holocaust was the murder of 6 million Western European Jews who almost entirely died in extermination camps. In reality only 60% of the victims ever saw a camp, with 30% killed by death squads and ghettos making up the remaining 10% of deaths. However, these paramilitary \u201ceinsatzgruppen\u201d only operated on the Eastern Front where 5.5 million of the 6 million Jewish deaths occurred, so they have been erased from America\u2019s popular history and collective memory. If you actually visit the Holocaust Museum in Washington DC or talk to history scholars you will learn about them of course, but in American movies, Television, books, comics, games, you will almost never hear a word about them. Yet in this somewhat obscure JRPG they actually get this detail right! As I said earlier, these are just a few examples.\\n\\n\r\nLastly, Valkyria Chronicles avoids 2 common mistakes that are often made by lesser quality historical fiction. Valkyria Chronicles always remembers to show war principally as suffering, death, and loss. Many civilians and at least 1 of your main characters will die no matter which actions you choose in the game, or how skilled you become at it. By portraying war as fundamentally inglorious by its very nature, it manages to avoid the jingoistic bullshit that convinces a new generation that war is about an awesome display of patriotism and manliness. War is not something to embrace and look forward to! Valkyria Chronicles also has a diverse cast of characters displaying the good and bad on all sides. Real war is never a simple matter of good vs. evil with an army of noble elves vs. bloodthirsty orcs. In terms of nation, your side has plenty of bastards on it, and the East Europan Empire is given some sympathetic characters. In terms of ethnicity, the main villains are ethnic Germans, but so are many of the heroes including the main hero. Basically, it is a very good game and one I would highly recommend playing, even if you aren\u2019t really into strategy RPGs.\\n\\n\r\nStory: \\n\\n\r\nValkyria Chronicles takes place as previously mentioned in an alternate timeline during a period that roughly corresponds to our timeline\u2019s World War 2.The main story of Valkyria Chronicles is that war has broken out between 2 massive factions over control of a vital mineral resource called \u201cragnite\u201d. The East Europan Empire decides to invade the small, neutral country of Gallia for its resources and because they believe it wouldn\u2019t really be able to fight back. However, Gallia is home to an extremely brilliant tactical commander named Welkin Gunther, whose father was a revered tank commander from the First Europan War. Welkin\u2019s father was also close friends with a Darcsen engineer that built him a revolutionary new tank model called the Edelweiss. After the famous tank engineer was killed in a car accident, the Gunther family adopted his young daughter Isara, who clearly inherited her father\u2019s brilliance for engineering and revolutionary designs. Welkin teams up with his adopted sister Isara along with a local town watch member in order to escape his hometown with the Edelweiss. Since he brought his own tank and was the son of a national hero, Welkin is given command of a small squadron that soon becomes the absolute bane of the Empire\u2019s existence.\\n\\n\r\nThe first half of the anime very closely followed the game\u2019s story, but later a number of really head-scratching changes are made. Every time the anime changed a plot point from the game, they came up with something that wasn\u2019t as good. Why bother changing something if you are just going to make it worse, especially when you have all the time and resources on your side?! The game was complete, so they weren\u2019t forced to go their own route. Basically they changed some things for absolutely no reason and ended up making it worse. The anime also decided to censor itself and really tone down the brutality, which badly undercut important elements of the presentation and themes that the game had. The racial ideology of the Empire and their hatred for the \u201csub-human\u201d Darcsen race is extremely downplayed in the anime. For example, the labor camp that squad 7 tries to liberate is in far more humane condition in the anime and the Empire only fires artillery at the camp when squad 7 refuses to halt an attack after several warnings. In the game, the Darcsen in the labor camp are herded into a building and set on fire regardless of Squad 7\u2019s actions because the Empire absolutely refused to risk the possibility that Squad 7 succeeds in freeing the Darcsen prisoners. The mobile killing squads (einsatzgruppen) that in the game collaborated with the Imperial Army to exterminate Darcsen villages were completely left out of the anime. No explicit mention of genocide is ever even made in the anime! What is most puzzling of all is that the game was only rated T, so it wasn\u2019t as if the anime needed to make changes to avoid a high rating and release to a wider audience. Basically, the anime self-censored in a way that damaged the product for reasons that don\u2019t even make financial sense! Maybe the marketing team for the anime thought that Neo-Nazis would be the core demographic and they needed to avoid offending them?!\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\\n\r\nThe main character is Welkin Gunther, who is an extremely gifted battle strategist, but detests war and actually just wants to be a teacher. He continues to command only to protect the live\u2019s of his squad. He is extremely quirky and socially awkward, but has a very high standard of morality and leadership. Basically just picture Yang Wenli from Legend of the Galactic Heroes. It\u2019s the same damn character! There is also the shy and brilliant engineer Isara and the fiery love interest Alicia, who has many \u201ctsundere\u201d traits but isn\u2019t constantly punching Welkin for perceived perversion and isn\u2019t extremely obnoxious\u2026unlike most tsundere characters. In the game, Squad 7 has 56 characters that are each given at least 3 paragraphs of backstory, a dozen unique lines of dialogue, and the game actually contains some interesting minor characters. The anime had 26 full episodes and a LOT more time to flesh out the characters, so that\u2019s what they did right? WRONG! The anime actually scraps the vast majority of Squad 7 and decides to focus solely on the main few characters, however it doesn\u2019t even do that well! It would have been at least acceptable if the main 7 characters were given more interesting development and better dialogue, but that doesn\u2019t happen either. In most adaptations like Game of Thrones, there are characters that were more developed and better in the source material (Asha) and characters that were better in the adaptation (Rob Stark). In Valkyria Chronicles, I can\u2019t think of a single character that was better in the anime, despite the massive advantage in time and resources that the anime had over the game. They really fucked up here! There is just no getting around that fact!\\n\\n\r\nMusic:\\n\\n\r\nThe music in the anime is almost entirely music from the game. Why is this a problem? If this was an adaptation of a Final Fantasy game with an amazing soundtrack, it would be perfectly acceptable to use symphonic adaptations of the game\u2019s OST. However, Valkyria Chronicles was NOT a very high quality soundtrack. Although video game soundtracks have come a long way from a 30 second repeating loop being acceptable, an entirely different standard exists for TV shows and movies. What was at least an acceptable soundtrack for an early, sleeper hit PS3 game is a very lackluster soundtrack for a fairly large budget anime. This anime had the money, so why not get better music? You changed the plot and characters for no reason and made them worse, so why bother keeping the 1 thing that could have easily been improved??! Anime director - \u201cNope, we must keep completely faithful to the original game soundtrack! People love that soundtrack so much that they would never forgive us if we changed it!\u201d\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\\n\r\nThe art is good. If I had to say 1 nice thing about this anime and figure out what the hell happened to all the budget, the answer is the art and animation.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\\n\r\nIs Valkyria Chronicles ultimately a bad anime? No. It still has plenty of positive elements and although it is a very watered down adaptation it still manages to be average or slightly better than average compared with the quality of other anime of its year. What frustrates me so much about this anime is that it was a large budget adaptation of an absolutely phenomenal game and SHOULD have been amazing! Instead it was just\u2026meh. So does it fail as an adaptation relative to expectations and budget? You bet your ass it does! I was divided on whether to give it a 6 or a 5 out of 10, but I ultimately went with a very generous 6.\\n",

            "content": "Valkyria Chronicles\r\nWhat would make you go to war? Everyone has some line that can't be crossed. Weather it is your home being taken away, your family and friends are in danger, or your lover is also going to war. In \u201cValkyria Chronicles\u201d a small country is pushed into a war that they most likely will not win. Now the people of that country need to ask themselves that very question. \r\nWhen the show starts out the thing is a mess. The story was slowly paced and had filler episode thrown in so it took forever to tell anything. Slow pacing I could have dealt withbut it felt like it didn't even know what it wanted to do. The story felt disconnected and it jumped from trying to push focus on the story to the characters and back again. Trying to develop characters and a story is great but the way it was done the whole thing felt unnatural and forced. On top of that I couldn't tell what kind of mood the show was trying for. Sometimes it felt easy-going and comical well other times it felt dark and dramatic. Maybe the show was trying to blend the two or it was purposely going back and forth. Whatever the case, it didn't work.\\n\\n\r\nDespite all these problem somewhere along the way the show managed to pull itself together. First the show decided it wanted to be a drama. A joke will pop-up now and then, but the show firmly places itself on the dramatic side of the line. The balance between characters and story development is also solved. Storyline elements help develop characters now and the show no longer has to forcibly insert some small story element just to get a little character development for someone. This also made the story feel much stronger and flow more nicely. By the time the show ends almost every problem I had at the beginning is fixed. \\n\\n\r\nThe story takes an interesting mix a fantasy and WWII-ish fighting. Never relying too much on one over the other. The weapons of war are along the lines of rifles and tanks, but at the same time almost everything in the world is power by a material called \u201cRagnite\u201d. This material also ties in with the legend of the Valkyrian, and I bet you can guess that the Valkyrian ends up making an appearance by the end. Changing the setting from the usual futuristic or sword and sorcery gives the show a different feel them many others.\\n\\n\r\nThe show manages to create and develop a terrific cast on both sides of the war. Each person has his/her reasons for entering the war and a great back story that goes along with that reason. In some cases these reasons lead to strong social issues that are not easy to overcome for the character even when they know they are in the wrong. \u201cValkyria Chronicles\u201d really strives to make you care about these characters and by the end it really pays off. The show pulls off some truly emotional moments between these characters; weather it be between characters on the same or apposing side, friends or lovers.\\n\\n\r\nBeyond the main cast there is a bunch of soldiers under the various commanders. Really they are all just there to fill the void of the squad. However everyone of these characters is pulled from the video game. Like the video game each has their own distinct name and personality. This is good because it gives the squad more personality then just a bunch of nameless faceless soldiers. This is not so good because they are all just glorified extras. By giving them a personality it kind of feels like the show is going to do something with them. They don't really get any development and the only part they play in the story is that you can't win a battle with one person you need a whole squad. The show also through in a few inside jokes between the squad members that only people who have played the game will get.  These are never important enough that someone who hasn't play the game will not get the full experience but it is a nice little extra for those who have. All and all I think this is preferable to a bunch of nameless soldier just don't expect too much from them.\\n\\n\r\nThe art style has something of a pencil drawn look to it (for lack of any better way of explaining it). This is an attempt to try to copy the art style of the video game. Personally I think it fails in this respect but none the less I like it. It manages to keep a traditional anime look and at the same time can stand out in a crowd.\\n\\n\r\nI have a lot of bad things to say about the beginning and a lot of good things to say about the end. If you can make it through the not so good beginning, you will have a great story and cast waiting for you. However part of me cannot forgive the show for taking so long to get there.",

            "content": "Valkyria Chronicles ends up being a bland, predictable anime, full of tired cliches and one dimensional characters. While it's epic setting and relative industry quality art make it seem like it has potential, it ends up becoming more disappointing as it fails to live up to those standards in any other area.\r\nValkyria uses a fictional historical setting roughly mirroring a World War 2 style conflict, then ends up spoiling the humanity of the story by adding in fantastical ancient powers just waiting to be awoken that trump the actions of any hero, general, or army. It's cast of characters might as well come from oneof those doll templates from the 90s, click, click, click, new hairstyle, different color eyes, one personality trait (tough guy, mean girl, gay guy, shy girl, you get the picture) and you have Squad 7, a cast of characters I can't even get worked up about if any or all of them were to catch a bullet. The male lead is a bad clone of Yang Wenli (see Legend of the Galactic Heroes if you're interested in a real war anime), and the female lead is just every \u201cgood girl\u201d you've seen in every anime ever. The main villian is one of the most stupid I have ever seen in an anime and is a real letdown in terms of being a threat in any manner other than a frontal assault. More is promised in terms of court intrigues on both sides, but this too ends up being a real letdown. Don't get me wrong \u201cwarrior spirit\u201d has it's place in anime...it just isn't in an anime in this setting based on a tactical RPG. There's a few tactical tricks near the start of the series, but after that tactics and strategy take a backseat to the tired \u201cwho has the most to protect\u201d style emotional combat. The soundtrack is nothing special and desperately wants to be Final Fantasy Tactics. \\n\\n\r\nAll that said, I couldn't bring myself to hate Valkyria, I was just bored and more than a little disappointed by it. If you are younger and haven't watched much anime I can see some people really getting into this. If you have watched any great anime that you can compare it to, the shallowness of the story and the wasted potential should be obvious. There are worse animes out there, but this one doesn't deviate from the standard formula at all, and isn't even a great example of that standard formula either. I guess if you lower your expectations going in, you'll be able to get through this, but if you let you hopes get up (like I seem to have) over the setting and the potential within it you'll just end up disappointed like me. There's literally nothing new here, and no characters I ended up caring about.",

The good thing is, when enjoyment factor would be on discussion, it will surely deliver. \\n\\n\r\nSo to all my fellow Otakus --- I would want to share with you the cute moments I felt during my sojourn in the world of Gallia and Empire. I hope you could feel its special aura!! Hehehehe...\\n\\n\r\nGambatte!!\\n\\n\r\nFrom someone-who-want-to-meet-Welkin-in-the-real-world,\\n\r\nMe\\n\\n\\n\r\n^_^\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\n********************14/26 episodes seen***************************\\n\\n\r\nI don't care how many plot holes this anime has!! and with cliche~ish moments every now and then...no need to bother them as I am already satisfied...because VALKYRIA CHRONICLES --- oozes with COOLNESS FACTOR to the bones!! Bwahaha!! Because of this one, I felt faith again!! There are still hope in the Anime Community. Bwahahaha!!!\\n\\n\r\nAhermmm...Sumimasen...\\n\\n\r\nAnyways, back to the topic. I accidentally fell over with this one. I saw its title from somewhere then immediately rushed to myanimelist to check. I was surprised that it received good reviews, because I believe this hasn't received much talkings (or am I Wrong?) Well, anyways..I was actually hesitant at first because I thought it might be a very lousy war title and I just might be put into a suicidal chair. But, GOOD THING...I wasn't blessed with a perfect intuition! Bwahahaha!!!\\n\\n\r\nI easily fell in love with it! It wasn't as heavy as what  I thought at first. It actually has nice balance of themes which a good anime could offer: Has a light approach, but with a serious tone; Not bloody, could totally be enjoyed by everyone even children; funny yet touching (kinda reminds you of the holocaust); and of course, the most important ingredient..hihihihi....the ROMANTIC BLINGY that has been circulating my hypothalamus ever since. \\n\\n\r\nBwahahaha!! Yeah, I'm writing this one because of my undying emotion towards the love pyramid that the main characters have.!! I am not even half the series, yet I already feel this unstoppable urge to say something about my new found love duo!! Wushu! I always find my new dream love team, they are already so many, now I can't even remember them. Don't mind me, I'm talking to myself..hehe ^_^\\n\\n\r\nAnyhowzz..I could say that Valkyria is quite similir with Code Geass, well yeah, of course, since they are of both war type. But good thing, my comparison would be in favor with this one..hehehe.. I enjoyed Geass, but not like this smiling - wholeheartedly enjoyment for Valkyria. => Unlike Code Geass, Valkyria has a soft nature which could give you a relaxing feeling. Although, it's in the middle of a war, you still can't help but be ...happy! Tee hee! I don't know..Happiness is the name of the game. Well, I don't blame Geass, because of course, it is written that way, the plot is very serious and dark. But what I am pointing is that...well,,,hehehe...just to make Valkyria shine...whatever...don't mind me...hehehe...\\n\\n\r\nWhere am I? Okay. May I tell you something about the characters? I'm still on episode 14, so I do not know what's still gonna happen next, but from my initial observation, I could say that...WELKIN GUNTHER is totally KAKKOI!! **nosebleed** He's totally a weirdo, but of course, a genius in disguise. Who wouldn't like him? A very naive guy, but is totally an incredible man. He fights with a very sure-to-win plan! And even though, how great and smart his oppenents are, he, of course, outlasts them! Nyarhahahahahah!! (kinda fishy, he always wins no matter what)\\n\\n\r\nThen we also have, Alicia. I was so happy that Marina Inoue voices her. My golly, Marina-san always receive good roles but I felt she was already typecasted with this kind of roles..but anywhoozz, so great of her! Back to Alicia, well, she's your typical strong natured female personality whose prowess captures the hearts of men..Bwuhuhuhu!! I am now being jealous of her..Argh..but I know Welkin-sama and Alicia would be a perfect love team, so I'll let them be.! So that means, noooooooooooooooooooo other partiesss!!! (but this makes the story more interesting..tee hee!)\\n\\n\r\nThen we also have.. I won't tell it anymore. Since I felt my ramblings had been so out-of-town already. Gomen!\\n\\n\r\nOver all, I am still keeping my hopes high! I know there are more happy episodes to come. I just hope that they don't disappoint. ! **always fingers crossed**\\n\\n\\n\r\nFrom someone-who-can't-get-over-with-the-romantic-affair-of-this-Anime-100%,\\n\r\nMe\\n\\n\r\n^_^",

            "content": "One of the more garbage anime I have ever watched. Unbelievable that the top 2 rated reviews are 10's. I wanted to stab myself with a writhing swordfish and vomit blood everytime the estrogen for brains MC showed his lack of testicular fortitude.\r\nI'll start with the story. The story is awful. I didn't play the PS3 game so I'm not going to judge this through any biased lense, nor am I going to necesarilly blame the animators if they were just sticking with the source material, but trash is trash no matter how much you sugar coat it with Alicia's subtle yet blazing hot zettairyuoiki. The premise is basically just a highly fictionalized version of WW2 where darcsens = jews. Most of the plot developments are highly predictable cliche scenarios, ie: corrupt superiors and war time violence. Nothing is wrong with this, troupes and genericism are fine in my book if the execution is good, sadly the execution in Valkyria Chronicles is essentially analogous to dying horribly of starvation and disease in a concentration camp which ironically enough is literally a partial description of this anime's shambles of a plot. Without spoiling, the WW2 parallels get thrown out the window a little over halfway through and this somehow devolves into a more cliched ridiculous pisstake than it already was.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is okay. I say that because the art style itself is very good in my opinion. Alicia and Selvaria are so cute my pocket rocket does a shaft neck tilt every time one of them gets a second of screentime. The character designs as a whole are a strong point in this anime, but thats pretty much all I can say thats good about the art. The animation quality is decent, but very poor during the action scenes. I actually spit out my drink at one sequence during a later episode that looked straight out of MS Paint. The backgrounds were boring but okay for the most part. Also there was this stupid shading pattern that looked like random streaks they used which served no purpose whatsover except to make it look like they actually did something unique and admirable in the animation style. really pissed me off and made me lightly cut my wrist a few times. Overall the art is pretty bad and makes u want to gougue your eyes out like everything else in this anime.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound was largely trash and by trash I mean decent material. Both OP's were okay & both ED's were okay. Nothing standout but at least it didn't make me want to jump off a cliff like the recycle bin storytelling. It had a generic video game/action flick soundtrack during the actual epsiodes, so basically just trash.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters were the equivalent of ur neighbor's kid taking a voracious dump on your porch and I mean that in the most detestable way possible. The only reason its not a 1 is because the invading antagonists were actually pretty interesting characters up until the end where they all devolved into  cliche riddled wank-stains. Our MC here, Welkin, is probably the worst MC of all time in any medium. He's a total softy and continually fails to do anything heroic or respectable beyond the most intrinsic required level of MC heroism. He acts like the corrupt military's lapdog and does everything in his power to cower out of the romance plotline. bruh literally tried to get friendzoned. he also gets finessed at every turn & this trash heap of an anime tries to frame it admirably ike being a babyback bitch is actually a redeemable quality. Ignoring the MC (which is impossibru because hes the MC lol), the characters are mostly stale one-note token characters. These issues become exponentially more prevalent when whatever edgefest overlord wrote this story reveals his fetish for \"permanent consequences\" for some of the more interesting characters in the show, which I won't elaborate any more on to avoid spoilers. basically the characters made me want to kill myself in a number of ways. Also the facial expressions were absurdly predictable, moreso than in any other anime I've seen. So yeah characters are truly awful in this anime - 0/10. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment? Whats that? Never heard of it, or maybe im suffering temporary trash-induced amnesia because enjoyment seems like a foreign concept at the moment. i dont know how else to word it, but this anime is trash. if you want to watch an anime that makes u want to carve out your own heart with a steak knife than Valkyria Chronicles is the anime for you. \\n\\n\r\nOverall this anime is complete trash i give it a -4/10 but MAL forces you to use absolute values so 4/10 aka it sucks!",

            "content": "The Valkyria Chronicles series is a set of tactical RPGs based on the second world war and created by Sega in 2008 for the Playstation 3. I have never played it, not having a PS3 personally. I just wanted to put that out there since there's an anime adaptation and I've been asked to review it. So if they screw up the game's story, I'm not going to know it. What I'm goint to be looking at is whether or not the anime holds up on its own. It should, since it's an adaptation of the game's story. Let's take a look at Valkyria Chroniclesthe anime and see if it manages.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is pretty simple. There's a war between the Imperial Alliance and the Federation. Naturally, the Enterprise gets called in to... Wait, wrong federation. The story focuses on a small principality called Gallia that gets caught up in the war on the Federation's side due to its resources. The main focus is on the Gallian Militia's squad seven as they fight various campaigns and the war advances. There are some issues with the series. The first is the pacing. The beginning is pretty slow, and then they start running out of time towards the end so they run through the material left without giving the audience much time to have a reaction. The second problem is the ending, it's cheesy and not in a good or endearing way. There's also a plot element that doesn't make sense. All I can say without giving away major spoilers is that there's a character with a power. This character knows they have this power, it is a power that could give their side a huge advantage, but this character doesn't use it until near the end. There is no reason given for why this is the case. I could speculate, but it really should have been explained within the narrative. There are some good aspects as well. There are some really well done emotional moments. I can't really talk about them in detail without giving spoilers though. You'll know them if you've seen them. Possibly if you've played the game, assuming the plots are the same. The series also manages its tone really well. It blends serious moments with more light-hearted ones without diminishing either. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters in this fall into two categories. The developed ones and the ones who are there and have names but you know virtually nothing about except for a few basic details. To use squad seven as an example, the developed characters are Welkin, Alicia, Isara, Rosie and Largo, who don't even make up half the group. Maybe the game spends more time with everyone else and benefits from it, I don't know. I'm tempted to call the cast size unwieldy, but they had to have a large cast. A story about a massive armed conflict wouldn't work if you only saw a dozen or so people. The scope would be screwed up. But this does have the unfortunate effect of making a lot of characters read as stereotypes of one kind or another. Another problem is the romance. A lot of it does not work very organically and comes off as contrived or forced. Still, the developed characters do make for some interesting dynamics and good tension. \\n\\n\r\nThe art in this is pretty nicely done. The characters look good and most of the action scenes are effective. The reason I say \"most\" is that there are some fight scenes towards the end that just look absurd and are kind of difficult to follow.\\n\\n\r\nThis has a really good cast. You have Takahiro Sakurai, who seems to appear in a major role in a lot of game-based anime. You also have Kuwashima Houko, Otsuka Akio, Oohara Sayaka, Fukuyama Jun and Inoue Marina, among others. Some of the music is really good and some of it is kind of forgettable. \\n\\n\r\nThe yuri factor is a 3/10. There are some scenes that read as kind of homo-erotic. Although they don't really go anywhere in the end. \\n\\n\r\nAnd that was Senjou no Valkyria: Gallian Chronicles. When everything is taken into account, it's a decent anime. My final rating is going to be a 6/10. If you enjoy war stories that aren't too serious or you're a fan of tactical RPGs you'll probably appreciate it. I can't really speak for fans of the original game, the anime might have gotten something egregiously wrong that infuriates them. Alternatively, they could consider it an excellent supplement.  All I can say for certain is that it's decent as a stand alone work, but not really good.",

For any of you out there looking for adventure/action bit of fantasy and romance together, here is your anime. \r\nThe first three episodes are sort of slow, but once you get passed those, the anime keeps getting better and better. \r\nThe story in itself is not that original, but the way it is portrayed in the anime itself, makes it orignal.  It is a story about war, and why one fights. \r\nOne outstadning point of this anime are the characters. Even if it is justa side character, all of them are given personalities and little side stories, and the main characters have odd, but wonderful personalities. \\n\\n\r\nThe anime is funny at the beginning, but turns into a drama later on, and at some point will even make those who cry at sad parts ( like me ) cry. \\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed this anime very much, and recommend it to anybody who loves action mixed with drama comedy fantasy and war stories!",

            "content": "Intro: I must confess, I was quite disappointed with this anime adaptation.  I first heard of it when I was playing the game (which, by contrast, is amazing) and a friend happened to look over my shoulder and said that he recognized it.  I asked if he played, but he said that only knew it because he had watched the anime.  As a big fan of the game, I was immediately interested and enthusiastically searched for a way to watch \"Senjou no Valkyria\".  You mean, there's MORE of the awesomeness and adorableness that is Valkyria Chronicles?!  HELL YEAH!However, what I watched did not meet my expectations, nor did it rise to meet them.  Granted, I will be the first to admit that I expected the anime to follow the game, even build upon its preexisting greatness; however, to my immense chagrin, the anime went in different direction, and not a good one.  Here's why beginning from least to greatest:\\n\\n\r\nSound (6/10): In the game, I thought that the sound/music was its weakest point, as there was not much of variety of osts, nor did they differ much in tone.  However, I thought the sound effects were decent and the voice-acting was good.  Conversely, this was, in my opinion, the least problematic part of the anime.  It used the soundtrack from the game, and did not add much to it.  It certainly did not significantly contribute to my condemnation of this anime, nor was it sufficient to increase my opinion of it either.  Never underestimate the effect of a well-placed, powerful ost...or a sniper round...\\n\\n\r\nArt (6/10): Second, I would like to discuss the artwork.  While it irked me at times during the game thanks to its minimalist direction, really only showing facial expression and dialogue during majority of the game's cut-scenes, I can appreciate their ability to stick to their guns (pun intended).  The game remained true to the story-book motif, and while it would have been nice to have seen more of the characters' interactions, I can respect the reasons why they chose that idea and how it made the player pay more attention to what the characters were saying and how they felt.  Additionally, the cell-shaded water-color graphics were really quite beautiful.  Certainly, I can understand why the director chose to retain the art style from the game (which was really the only thing the two have in common), since the anime does not use the story-book motif, the cell-shade art style, though pretty, seemed out of place.  Additionally, since the anime was not bound by that motif, I felt that they could have done more with it than they elected to do.  Furthermore, (I'm not a pervert, I swear) why did they make noticeable alterations in the proportions of the female characters for the anime?  The women warriors of the game were already beautiful; was that really necessary?\\n\\n\r\nStory (3/10): The above categories were simply slight irritations; now we are getting to crux of my complaints against this anime and I shall endeavor to be a spoiler-free as possible (although this anime is already quite spoiled in my opinion).  Yes, whenever any form of media is adapted to another, there will ALWAYS be at least minor discrepancies.  I knew to expect at least some differences, but in my view, the story veered too far from what Valkyria Chronicles is (to me at least) supposed to be.  The game, as well as the anime, spend a large portion of time on the character interactions rather than the battles.  While the action sequences in the anime were decent, even I (who places a stronger emphasis on story over action) felt that the battles scenes were too brief.  In my view of the anime, they would spend about 90% of the episodes on nonsensical character interactions (more on that later) and only include maybe a 1 - minute battle scene.  As an anime based (loosely) off a strategy game, I can understand why they would chose to axe the tactical discussion and planning portion of \"Senjou no Valkyria\" first to avoid boring a casual fan of the anime and to make room for more important components, though I felt that each of the quite short battle sequences just happened randomly without much forethought.  The tactics and strategy of Valkyria Chronicles is an integral part of its essence and what made it so good; the anime might have been better if they included a little more of that essential essence.  To a degree that I didn't expect, they changed so many plot details and occurrences that the anime only vaguely follows the progression of the game.  While the plot of the game was not its strongest point either (evil empire attacks and underdog wins), it did not behoove the anime to stray too far from what was established, because it worked.  Furthermore, the anime's light-hearted, campy tone differed from the game, which was mostly serious broken by sweet and/or funny moments.  At the same time, the majority of the anime's story focuses on overly-dramatized character interactions, whereas, the game keeps the interactions simple, yet profound.  No unnecessary fluff.  Perhaps my main knock against the anime storyline was its lack of cute Welkin x Alicia moments (c'mon, that was hardly a spoiler).  Part of what made the game so charming and memorable was the relationship-building moments during the bite-sized cut-scenes.  I had (wrongly) hoped that that adorable moments I was denied in the game due to the minimalist art direction would at least show up in full-picture during the anime; to my great disappointment, most did not cross over into the anime.  Since Valkyria Chronicles is, at heart, a love story; those small, but vital moments being absent from the anime really soured the series for me.  I will admit though, that the anime did two things better than the game: Zaka's appearance and Character X's death.  In the game, Zaka kind of just shows up after Fouzen and is like, \"Well, looks like I'm joining your squad now as a support tank!\"  Wait...what?  At least in the anime, his transition make more sense and is smoother.  Additionally, in the game, when Character X dies, there's about two scenes that deal with their death and then everyone is like, \"Well, this is sad, but we still have a war to fight.  Let's go.\"  ...ouch...cold...  The anime storyline does improve later in the series, but it is too little, too late.  i could point out many example of divergences between the game and the anime, but that would take even longer and I don't believe it's that worth it.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter (2/10): Okay, so this is my biggest and fiercest grievance against \"Senjou no Valkyria\": they screwed up the characters, completely!  I usually care more about the overall plot than the characters whenever I engage in any sort of media, but Valkyria Chronicles the game is a rare exception.  While certainly a classic, the underdog-beats-big-bad-empire plot line is hardly novel, but its the characters and their interactions are what make Valkyria Chronicles spectacular.  I'm very critical of main characters, because it's very easy to make them generic, but I really liked game Welkin.  He's a decisive, and brilliant military officer, and as a fellow 22-year-old ecologist, I thought he was extremely relateable guy.  Though a LITTLE spacey and awkward, especially when entering eco-geek mode, (game) Welkin is an honest, calm, and caring man more-than-deserving of Alicia.  I really respected him as the game's protagonist and consider him one of my favorites.  In contrast, anime Welkin has to be one of my most hated protagonists.  They greatly exaggerated the spacey and oblivious aspects of his personality, made him incredibly indecisive (which is a huge no-no for a supposed military commander/war hero), and dense.  Episode 11: \"Oh...I didn't notice that Alicia was cute.  I just saw her as a subordinate (insert head-knock and tee-hee here).\"  YOU IDIOT!!  In the game, we've established that you think Alicia is cute by the beginning of chapter 3 (and vice versa)!  That was perhaps the most painful and inaccurate thing to watch in the anime.  Ah, yes, speak of the devil (angel?): Alicia.  I was greatly saddened by how they chose to portray her in the anime.  As a video game character, Sgt. Alicia Melchiott is probably one of my favorites, she's a beautiful, bad-ass warrior woman who still has cute, thoughtful, and sweet aspects to her persona; when I heard that I could get more of her in anime form, I was like \"YES!\"  But what did I (and perhaps many other fans) get instead?  A generic tsundere.  Okay, I confess, that the tsundere is my favorite anime girl archetype (it's n-not like I l-like it or anything, baka!  SO CUTE!  YES!), but Alicia is NOT one of them (or isn't supposed to be).  Alicia is only hostile towards Welkin during the Prologue of the game because of the CIRCUMSTANCES; she arrests him because she thinks he's an Imperial spy.  After she's convinced he's not, Alicia is nothing but warm, friendly, supportive, and sweet towards him (except when he says she's \"beetle-tastic\" or makes hold hold the goat excrement) because that's her personality is like.  One cannot be a tsundere of circumstance; it's either part of a character's preexisting personality (perhaps influenced by circumstances) or not, and Alicia has too sweet a natural overall personality to be a tsundere.  The decision to portray her in the series as a tsundere   Finally, good things, (and bad things) come in three, let's get the finale of this unholy trinity: Faldio.  He seemed like a fairly okay and chill sort of fellow in the game, but aside from plot-related stuff, he didn't factor into the story much.  In the anime, though, he plays a much more prominent role, and not in a good way.  Once again, they took a minor aspect of his personality, which is only mentioned in his personal file, and blew it out of proportion.  Yes, the game says he a flirt with the ladies, but he NEVER hits on Alicia, EVER.  Hell, that is not even implied at any point during the story; Alicia is Welkin's girl from day one and Faldio is enough of a bro to respect that boundary (of course, game Welkin isn't a blithering baka either).  Instead, in the anime, they focus the majority of the story on this tired love-triangle trope and push this weird Alicia x Faldio development and the rivalry that ensues between him and Welkin because of it, effectively reducing one of the best video game romances (and possibly one of the best fantasy romances) to nothing more than cheap, generic, angsty drama!  NO, THAT IS NOT OKAY!!  Everyone else I don't even care enough to comment on.  Oscar was kind of cool though.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (2/10): I know that when watching an anime is feels like chore, I'm not enjoying it.  I trusted the words of the friend who recommended it to me and kept hoping it would get better, but that hope was in vain.  If I haven't already made it clear why I think \"Senjou no Valkyria\" was not enjoyable, then I think you, dear reader, have missed the point of everything I have said up until now.\\n\\n\r\nOverall (4/10): Most disappointing, and a waste of my time.  You know an anime is bad when its best aspects are its art and music.  Yes, I knew the anime was going to be at least somewhat different from the game, but I was unprepared for discrepancies of this magnitude.  Even as I tried (I really did) to not compare it to the game, \"Senjou no Valkyria\", as a stand-alone anime series is, at best, mediocre.  If you are a fan of the game, I would strongly urge to not watch this anime, as you may be as disappointed as I was.  Sega and Sony are surely not lacking in monetary resources, so they had every means at their disposal to make \"Senjou no Valkyria\" something truly amazing as an anime, perhaps even better than the game.  Instead, as a fan of Valkyria Chronicles, the result greatly pained me.  That is why, dear reader, I spent two hours longer of my life on this sad excuse for anime adaptation of a fantastic game so that you, dear reader, can avoid falling into the same trap that I did.  I can only pray that my words do not fall upon deaf ears (eyes?)...and that you even bothered to read this far (which if you, you are to be commended, thanks :D).  If you truly want to experience the splendor, and awl, and absolute adorableness that IS Valkyria Chronicles, don't subject yourself to this anime.  Instead, play the game, because you, dear reader, deserve better than this.",

            "content": "(as written on The Hateful Anime Truth on Facebook)\r\nGames turned into Anime are almost equivalent to Hollywood's curse of bringing games to the big screen; It usually NEVER works, and you get a botched version of the game that you liked so much that you wished it never was born. For example, Tsukihime was a well-known Type-Moon RPG filled with many different paths, but in anime form, the director thought taking the BAD END of everything would work. Not entirely.\r\nIn came Valkyria Chronicles. An anime adaptation of the video game of the same name, starring Welkin Gunther, Isara Gunther, Alicia Melchiott and other important memberstaken straight from the game. Although a select few from the game were made of any importance to the anime, the rest happens to be in the back of the anime the whole time, or don't exist at ALL. But I'm getting a little sidetracked here. Let's start with the story aspect!\\n\\n\r\nStory:\\n\\n\r\nNormally, accuracy doesn't get you anywhere in animes, but this anime happens to follow the game's MAIN story. Emphasis on the word 'MAIN' in that one, because the game had many side-stories that also cover the main meat of some of the characters and gave a bit more backstory to some of the characters. The anime offers a straight-to-the-point, linear storyline that focuses mostly on the war and the war alone.\\n\\n\r\nBut hey, the main storyline really caught the attention here, so I'm giving that a 10 for linearity, smoothness, and accuracy to the game.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\\n\r\nHoly cow I never thought Selvaria couldn't get any hotter when she went into the anime front! Um-- I mean-- FORGET I SAID THAT!\\n\\n\r\nThe artists really did good work catching the very detail of Gallia, from the Gallian Army's clothing, to the tanks, weapons and armor of both armies.\\n\\n\r\nAnd dear god those jugs of Selvaria's are huge... UMM, MOVING ON!\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\\n\r\nAs one would have it, most, if not ALL the music was taken straight from the game. I was surprised when I heard Desperate Fight in one of the episodes, but it made that one battle scene way more epic.\\n\\n\r\nAnd that's about all I can say about sound.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\\n\r\nEvery character has their own personality. It's human nature. Valkyria Chronicles is no exception. Squad 7 is intentionally the most weird bunch of the whole army because of its quirky character choices, from the very introverted Susie, to the Lone Wolf Marina.\\n\\n\r\nThe villains have that 'calm-before-the-storm' type deal. The look cool, calm and collected, but at war, they become completely different people. It really did bring the best out of this anime.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL (since I can't think up of anything in the enjoyment factor and this review is taking too long):\\n\\n\r\nI'd highly recommend it to anyone whether they have played the game or not. The story is highly intriguing, keeps you at the edge of your seat, you don't know what's gonna happen until it does, and hell, it has its own tearjerker moments as well.\\n\\n\r\nWell done, Valkyria Chronicles, you've withstood the Game to Anime test.",

It has the Love/Hate complex to it which also makes it a great anime. The Artistic view and the Directing view compliment each other well. A must see for anyone.\r\nThe only underlying problem i had really found with this anime, is that it kind during the middle of the story, one of the best characters die and you get stuck debating \"Should i continue watching or stop?\". Personally i chose to keep watching because i figured it would get better but it felt like adamn knife wound that was getting pushed and pulled over the next view episodes after the fact.\\n\\n\r\nIn the end, this anime is great for just about anyone to see. The first glance isn't that great but after you get past the first 2 or 3 episodes your either and addict by then...or you just suck.",

            "content": "This has to be the best game to anime adaption I have ever seen hands down. I dont understand why after reading many peoples comments on forums, their number 1 complaint would be that the anime is too different from the game.\r\nMany  viewers of this anime have also played or own the game while there are few who just happened to stumble upon Valkyria Chronicles. The ones that have watched this anime for the first time have nothing but praise for this anime. What I fail to understand is why people would want the anime adaption completely identical to the game? It baffles me.\r\nMyinterest level wasnt very high for this anime to begin with since I imagined it to follow the game directly. After a few episodes it greatly surprised me by focusing more on relationships and character development absent in the game... even taking whole episodes to explore. I found that extremely refreshing since I knew what was going to happen and this also hooked me into watching more episodes. Gallian chronicles added new dynamics to an already great story by adding a love triangle, different personalities of characters from the game, and a more drama type feel.\\n\\n\r\nAnother popular complaint was that the action and battles were secondary. This makes me question again why people and fans of the game dont appreciate the in depth character studies. I found that the action scenes had an appropriate amount of time and it wasnt necessary since the game was also based off of how love and friendship blooms during war.\\n\\n\r\nI found this anime had an assemble of characters and sub characters with very interesting personalities of their own and a gripping new storyline that diverges itself from the game to stand on its own. The ending seemed a little rush but I figured the show wasnt getting a green light for a 2nd season which is a huge shame... I just wish this series had more exposure and is appreciated for what it is. A rarity indeed.\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "This is the classic example of terrible start and great finishing touch.  \r\nThis show start off with irritable, hard to relate characters that you are almost constantly face palming or imagining yourself teaching them a lesson.  \r\nThe show however gradually picks up, in a very steady uphill climb.  The character developments are subtle, but well made.  The downside to this is that subtleness sometimes makes casual watchers with less than average emotional understanding puzzled.  \r\nThe characters started off as some of the worst personalities I've ever seen.  However, as the serie progress, an understanding is formed for these uniquepersonalities who may come off as a big pain in the ass.  The main character however is one of the most interesting male lead up to date.  As far as I can remember, masterminds like Lelouche, Kira (Light) is in a way much like him in term of intelligence.  Unlike Kira and Lelouch however is that, instead of being cool bad ass, he is very laid back.  This, I think is a great touch.  Most of us anime watchers really is fed up with terrible male leads in many ways, such as spineless, dumb, ugly, or completely overblown personality.  The main character here is one of the most intriguing male leads up to date.\\n\\n\r\nTo be quite honest, I wanted to give this show a 7-8, but a particular set of episode really changed my mind.  Without giving anything away, this show had great emotional moments where if you are watching with an unbiased mind, it's something we can really come to appreciate.  \\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion, this show is interesting, different, but not for everyone.  Long story short, if you watched through 5 or so episode without getting bored, completely enraged, your most likely going to enjoy this anime.\\n\r\nI hope this review is helpful in some way, feedback and criticism are welcome.",

            "content": "The Playstation 3 game Valkyria Chronicles has fun gameplay and an epic story, so I enjoyed every minute of it (unfortunately, the original and its PSP sequel hasn't sold enough enough to warrant a release for VC3 in the west). While its admirable that the anime tries to add a few things of its own to the story and characters, ultimately it only succeeds in becoming a rather loose adaptation that's inferior to the source material.\r\nThe opening of Valkyria Chronicles is engrossing  and contains elements similar to real-life conflicts such as World War I or II. The small country of Gallia, and its Squad7 militia, are basically underdogs stuck in a tug-of-war between two massive nations for its vast resources, and you're compelled to see how they will survive the war. Some of the drama in VC (such as discrimination against the Darcsen people) is executed very well, and certain aspects of war such as death is portrayed realistically, perhaps with enough impact to make you shed a tear or two. The pacing of the game was okay in terms of how it was separated into chapters, with several story cutscenes interwoven between various playable battles. Unfortunately, the pacing of the anime is relatively uneven with respect to how a sense of urgency is criminally absent in many episodes despite the aforementioned war; this is perhaps due to misplaced comedy, too much dialogue in certain places, or plot developments which drag for too long. The epilogue to the series, although perfectly welcome, lacks details from the game that would have made it amazing.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is solid and includes excellent action sequences during battles, especially the awesome abilities of the Valkyria. Character designs for the majority of the cast in VC is pretty much spot on, except Alicia looks younger and much less mature than in the game. The background art is nice and appropriate; there's a darker tone used to reflect the destruction and devastation caused by fighting, and brighter colours for the peaceful countryside scenery that's reminiscent of watercolour graphics used in the game (shame they couldn't replicate this in the anime).\\n\\n\r\nThe opening songs are sung by people with strong voices, especially the first one. Sound effects such as bullets firing and explosions are very clear. Voice acting is decent for the most part. There are several cool action sequences shown in the opening credits, so it's unfortunate that more of them aren't present in the series itself. Speaking of this, it's difficult but try to avoid watching the second opening; it contains massive spoilers that ruin surprising twists!\\n\\n\r\nA new character created for the anime, Ramal, is well-developed and provides interesting interactions with the others. The background stories of key characters such as Alicia, Selvaria and Rosie are well-told despite slight alterations from the game. And then there's General Damon; the anime does a fantastic job of making you hate this guy. There's a feeling of wasted potential when it comes to developing the remaining members of Squad 7; not enough focus is placed on them and instead it seems as if they're in the anime just to make up the numbers and take part in missions.\\n\\n\r\nThen there's the presence of a love triangle involving the main characters, and it's difficult to see why it was necessary in the first place. All that it manages to accomplish is ripping the spotlight away from Welkin, the son of a war hero and commander of Squad 7, and thrusting it onto his best friend Faldio (who's part of the same militia but in a different squad). Ironically this makes Faldio a more well-rounded and intriguing character, but Welkin becomes the opposite; at least in the game you get to control him in a tank and blow stuff up! Of course, this means Welkin is indecisive for large parts of the anime and his chemistry and communication with Alicia is severely lacking. The main leads, Welkin and Alicia, were a fantastic part of Valkyria Chronicles but are nowhere near as likeable in the anime. As a bonus insult the pacing of the story is badly affected by the love drama, and the time it takes up could have been put to better use developing the supporting cast.\\n\\n\r\nValkyria Chronicles is a more than average series with its focus on war, friendship and teamwork that deserves a solid 7 for those who have no knowledge of the game. I'd actually give it a 6 instead but only due to the fact that I've played the game, and while it's not a train wreck the anime adaptation doesn't compare well.\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Valkyria Chronicles (The PS3 game which is the source material of the anime) is a piece of art with it's immersive storytelling, humane and multi-dimensional representation of the main, and a certain part of the secondary cast of characters, and with it's subtle way of conveying about the \"\"two sides of the coin\", portraying the lack of solid difference between the warring factions of your ordinary soldier on either sides, all displayed on a background, unraveling the war-torn, even if fictional world of Europa.\r\n  And despite it's interesting premise, the anime adaptation of that material \"Senjou no Valkyria\", crashes down in allthe beforementioned highlights, which made this franchise different from the other similar ones, shoving in our face chewed up, and weirdly twisted story, altered with too much plot-holes, one dimensional characters, bearing resemblance to the original cast, but having their definitive traits hyperbolized to, in the most cases, abnormal and absurd scales. In the same way, the flow of the storyline in the source material, with it's ebbs and flows of relaxing adventures, followed by relatable and well-written personal struggles and political conflicts, from various perespectives is smashed up with the anime adaptation's almost seemingly two distinctive parts - the first episodes, giving you feel of watching teen rom-com with seemingly zero interest of the characters upon the current problems of the war (while it's assumed they're army recruits) and the second part, very hard trying to be more mature and serious, which by itself is step in the right direction, but in the current case, trying to build up tension and feeling of relateableness with the beforementioned \"haapy go lucky\" portrayal of the characters, which are dwarfed to the well-known archetypes (the Tsundere, the overly generic main character, the third wheel in the romance) is plain tragic to watch, and it also feels very awkward at times.\\n\\n\r\n  One of the important messages of the source material was, by showing us the sorrows and the horrors of the war, seen from the point of the common soldier, combined with his own personal struggles, reshapes his perception of right and wrong, but in the same time, by being in touch with his dreams and wishes, gives him will to prevail and move forward, which could also be an inspiration for us as well in our own lives.On the other hand, the major focus of the anime was mostly about the romantic relationships, and the unwavering unity of the squad, aka \"Friendship Power\" which sounds much more cheesy than developing actual plot and clever tactical strategies to outmaneuver and outwit their opponents, which makes any feeling of actual gritty combat non-existent in the anime. An also, the romantic aspect (which is one of the main themes here, it seems) is very poorly and unoriginally executed.\\n\\n\r\n  There is overall character development, but it's far from realistic and mostly relying on tropes, with the sole exclusion of Faldio, who gets far more screentime than in the source material, and he has his own developed story, which is a small breath of fresh air considering the others. The other good sides of the anime are the art and it's sound, although they're not really lifesaving for this adaptation in my opinion, since the story and character departments are handled horrible and almost parodically. \\n\\n\r\n  To summarize my thoughts - Senjou no Valkyria is not horrible anime by itself, although it's quite generic and average by any standards, which had great potential, if the source material was handled well, to be one of the best animes, depicting the feelings of hope and despair in wartime, which instead decided to be this light-hearted, bright-coloured goofy action which is good for killing time, but oblivious in any other serious aspect.\\n\\n",

From the start, I could predict EVERYTHING that was going to happen in the next five minutes, so when a battle started I was already bored, since it had justended in my mind. I kept watching on the hope that the love interest might amount to something instead of continuing to be a love triangle right to the end (what can I say, I like happy endings, not awkward, status quo endings), and there was a side love story that was fun to watch progress.\\n\\n\r\nThen episode 19 or 18 or something came around. Without giving too much away, there was a scene where someone was going to die, and it was playing out in slow motion for suspense. I made my prediction, and I felt it was the only obvious choice, when, oh snap! That was unexpected. Then sometime later it happened again! Just at the end the show managed to save itself with with a series of unexpected and interesting events.\\n\\n\r\nAlso, although I should have seen it  coming, I would have been completely surprised by something had it not been revealed in the OP 5 EPISODES TOO EARLY.",

But unfortunately, that was the high point of the anime for me. The art work and animations were both of very high quality. The sounds were also high in terms of technical quality. The voice acting went very well with the characters (although it was not necessarily a good thing, read below about my impression of the characters), and the music I did not take note of, but this is a indication of good music, according Feng Zhu(conceptartist) in one of his videos.\\n\\n\r\nMany of the characters, especially the main ones, felt like the overused, virtuous archtypes that -at least for me- made for some very bland characters. As a result, I felt myself enjoying the bad guys far more than the good guys', haha. The story wasn't very engaging to me either, but I did end up finishing the series hoping that the story will pick up and build to the main characters epiphanies where they shed their moral obligations as they reconciled with the world. \\n\\n\r\nNeedless to say, if those types of characters are what you are looking for, this should be a very enjoyable anime for you, as I think this also had some effect on the story for me. It was not an enjoyable anime series for me.",

            "content": "Senjou no Valkyria is one of those animes that I can't help but give credit to. Not only is this a nice series that represents video game to anime adaptions well, but does well as an anime in its own right. Granted (and I am speaking through here say since I have not played the game), there are differences between the game and anime, it is still a superior adaptation compared to it's competition. Video game to anime adaptions tend to be pretty awful in most cases, however, this is one case where it is definitely not. It proves to be a good advertisement forthe game since now I am interested in playing the game as well. \\n\\n\r\nHowever, since this is about the anime, I can tell you what this anime did right. It set the tone extremely well. Characters were likable and through their actions, you can get a strong vibe for what they are thinking and feeling. I felt this translated very well. The story itself was extremely strong, especially for a video game adaptation. The narrative also did a nice job of fleshing out both sides, getting a sense of what Gallia was trying to accomplish as well as the Empire. The character interaction was fantastic. Watching Squad 7 (as well as Faldio and Ramal) come together and interact was fun to watch. You could feel the camaraderie even though not all the characters got along. It did a great job of building character relationships (such as the love triangle between Alicia with Welkin and Faldio) as well as the dramatic tension (such as with Rosie and Isara). \\n\\n\r\nAs far as it's production is concerned, the artwork was fantastic. The character models were well drawn and even the atmospheres were fairly well captured. The artwork did a nice job of capturing that 1930s warfare style. If I thought there was a weakness to the artwork, it was that the action sequences seemed somewhat choppy, perhaps a little too slow-paced. I felt as though the artwork should've been a little faster paced when there were sequences of someone getting shot at or tanks firing. The composition in my opinion was solid. The songs seemed to fit the mood quite well and the insert songs were great. My only gripe about the composition was it seemed to repeat a little too much. It seemed that the producers were dealing with a limited soundtrack throughout the series. The voice acting was superb. Sushumu Chiba captured the role of Welkin Gunther perfectly and Marina Inoue played Alicia Melchiott extremely well. Even the supporting roles I have to consider second-to-none, in fact, probably some of the best supporting voice acting work I have ever heard in an anime. \\n\\n\r\nNow, as much as I want to admit how much I loved Senjou no Valkyria, there were flaws. I felt this anime didn't do a very good job with back stories. Due to this hindrance, it resulted in some awkward scenes within the anime. For example, the first episode when Alicia met (and captured) Welkin. Due to a flaw that the video game was able to explain, Welkin was away from Bruhl for 8 years and that is why Alicia considered him a traitor at first. Due to not knowing that fact in the anime, it makes it confusing to the viewer as to why Alicia doesn't know both Welkin and Isara (Alicia and Isara's relationship is yet another flaw that the video game explains). It isn't just here either. There is another scene where Welkin is thinking about the battles he fought in and makes a reference that he told his father that he'd never get involved in the same business he got in. However, the anime doesn't do a very good job of explaining that back story and why he didn't want to get involved in General Gunther's business. Even the history of the Gunthers, their tragic past and the fate of both General Gunther and his wife were not well hashed out. Even the adoption of Isara was not well hashed out either. The anime generally explains that General Gunther and Isara's parents had some sort of affiliation but it wasn't properly explained. There are MANY flaws surrounding the Gunthers and their back story that was severely lacking. For being one of the main protagonist (including Isara with this), their back stories were just not hashed out well. Perhaps it was that this anime didn't have enough time to explain these back stories? I'm not sure but it felt as though some of these episodes were wasted with unnecessary character development that we already know about the characters as well as I mentioned earlier, the too slow pacing of the fight scenes. As much as the lack of back story bothered me, it wasn't enough to completely deter me from watching this show with complete interest.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I cannot stress enough how much of an underrated series this is. I never even heard of this anime (even though I heard of the video game) before a friend recommended it to me and after completing the series, I cannot believe this series hasn't received more praise and recognition. This series had a little bit of everything you'd want in a war-type anime and even the much expected death scenes (expected in the sense that it's war, you expect people to die) had a heavy feel to them. The likability of the characters certainly helps in that regard. While I admit this anime isn't perfect, it is still a fantastic series and the one anime I'd recommend for a video game adaptation done right. I understand it is an adaptation and not everything is going to be perfect. However, as I said, video game adaptations are difficult to translate to the anime realm and this series did a solid job of representing Valkyria Chronicles. If you like war and strategic battles, this is a great watch. If you like romance and great character interaction, this is a great watch. This series isn't quite as gritty or violent as a typical war-type anime but still seems to capture the atmosphere extremely well. I will admit that Senjou no Valkyria is the best war anime I have ever seen.",

The battles tend to feel cut short and skipped over. (akward transition)\r\nThe protagonists, Alicia Melchiott and Welkin, can also be a bit annoying. Alicias character is portrayed as more tsundere than in the game. Welkin is also made to be a bit of a moron who can\u2019t take a hint. While the protagonists aren\u2019t the greatest, the supporting cast is very well done. They aren\u2019t given a lot of focus, but their likeable personalities are shown though short dialogue sceneswhich are satisfying. The portrayal of the these supporting characters really helps to invest you in the story of squad 7.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSpoilers: The villains in this anime dont get enough screen time though. Each single one of the villain's aside from berthold gregor who is a stereotypical destroy the good guys villain. The others have their motivations and its believable. Selvaria is a rescued valkyria from the main villain maximilian. She has an everlasting bond with him because he saved her from experimentation and abuse. Little did she know he had no feelings for her and was just using her for her power. She did not know this which is why she blindly defended him ( life debt ). Jaeger was the comic relief villain, he only fights for the empire because he is guaranteed to have his home city returned if he performs his duties well as a general. He is not evil at all like maximillian who is hell bent on conquering from his narcissism. \\n\\n\r\nThere is alot to like about this anime along with a few problems with the main characters and shortened battles. The soundtrack is good too and the supporting roles are very likable. \\n\\n\r\nStory: 8\\n\r\nArt: 7\\n\r\nSound : 8\\n\r\nCharacters: 8\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8\\n\r\nOverall: 8.\\n",

This is only natural, a game can't possibly do as good of a job in the character development department as an anime. Well, it can if it's an RPG, but VC is a tactical game with very few RPG elements. \r\nAnyway, I have already named the best aspect of the anime - character development. Watching the characters come together over the course of the war feels great. It's not like they all like each other, it's more like they're siblings - they may even hateeach other, but they'd also die for each other. This is very realistic, the special bond between people is something most soldiers talk about , and VC portrays it in a very convincing way. The characters are very diverse, though at times quite cliche - but enjoyable nonetheless. \\n\r\n9/10 for me, they are close to perfection.\\n\\n\r\nStory - I think I have a pretty unique approach to this anime/game, I don't really focus on the grand aspect and the whole war, as this part of the story would come down as a generic war story. It's just another story of a ragtag group of unlikely heroes defeating a great empire. Not very original. It is, again, thanks to the characters and their background story that it comes a great show. I want to give it a 9/10 based on that, but it wouldn't be fair because of how cliche the overall theme is. There's also the matter of the story being sort-of washed down compared to the game, there's a lot less battles shown. The most important battles are left intact, though. As such, 8/10 is a fair score. \\n\\n\r\nArt and sound. It's a 7 years old anime, but more importantly, it's quite clear it was never a high budget show. The art and animation are quite poor. They are not really bad looking, but don't take a single step above average. Pretty much same can be said about the sound, but the dubbing is good, so it would be unfair to rate it the same as graphics. 6/10 for art and 7/10 for sound seems fair. \\n\\n\r\nIt was a VERY enjoyable anime. It covers a variety of themes and shows a convincing picture of regular grunts fighting in a dirty and unncecessary war, some themes are very harsh (for example the treatment of Darcsens), some are light-hearted. I don't think there's a single boring moment if you enjoy watching anime that are not all about action, but also about character development. I would like to rate it more than 8/10, but I really can't. 8/10 is a bit of a stretch as well, but I'm willing to do this since, despite the small flaws, it's one piece of a good anime. Definitely worth watching at any time.",

There is even freaking romance that isn't terrible.\r\nCharacters: 10\r\nI found the characters to be very unique, minus the main bad guy who reminded me of Lelouch from \"Code Geass\". You feel like you have really bonded with the chractersby the end.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 9\\n\r\nThe story is not your typical kid goes off and saves the world or has magic powers, or the typical kid who drives a mech. No, this story is much better than that. It doesn't rilie on mechs at all, instead you get a badass tank and a awesome squad that fights little by little to fight of the invasion that is taking place in their country.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10\\n\r\nI am going to get straight to tthe point.\\n\r\nGo and watch this anime and witness the pure-awesomness of it.\\n\r\nYour missing out big time if you don't!",

            "content": "A scene is set. A continent is at war, and a small country is caught in the mix of it all, Gallia. This surrounds a make-believe Second World War, where it is between the Federation in the west and the Empire to the East. Caught in the middle of those two, the small country of Gallia is caught up in the war because of its rich amount of Ragnite, an essential fuel source within the universe of the anime. The anime follows Welkin Gunther, the son of the late General Gunther, who was a war hero in the First Europan War, and his adventures andoperations as a commander. This anime sets the stage for an awesome anime, and without a doubt, it delivers, but not fairly well in some areas.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is set within a universe much like our own, and with the same social problems, political corruptness, etc. Discrimination is a big theme here that the story portrays very well, especially considering the fact that the Darcsen remind us SO much about the discrimination that the Jews received back before and during World War II. The anime was going to be a 10 in terms of story, if it had not been for the change of direction and focus right around episode 16, which switched from majorly being a show about how a war is affecting the squad as a whole, to how it is affecting the characters individually. Now, this doesn't sound bad at first, but the way it is done focuses WAY more on the main characters of Squad 7 and Squad 1, than of the side characters, where they were almost not focused much at all, except for a tender moment or two. Art was a bit worse. Overall: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nArt tended to be fairly good until up till about episode half way through the anime, where the opening and closing themes changed to a much more enjoyable turn of events. This is where the art style and animation went down hill, and started to become clunky at times and sometimes very unnatural and disproportionate. Furthermore, the anime focuses on the aspects of war and combat in general, which a lot of times was very lackluster. I mean, come on. If you are a military based anime, you should focus on the combat, and also make it look good. That is all I am saying. Sound was actually really good. Overall: 6/10\\n\\n\r\nNow, this may sound weird to you all, but I really liked the music. It helped to set the tone of the different scenes. Sure, it doesn't have TOO much in terms of variety, but it uses some of the songs and modifies them to create a different atmosphere nearly perfect for the scene. Now, some that read this might notice that the music is very similar to the game, which I know, since I own the game and have played some of the game. However, the music is used differently, as opposed to the game having a more repetitive way of using the music. Also, this is only barely a 9 because sometimes, there were problems, more of nitpicks, but the voice actors were a little bit weird sounding, but I was able to deal with it. Characters were a bit off, but solid. Overall: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacters were fairly strong, because it showed us the struggles the squad went through. Their hardships. Their pains. Their joys. Their laughter. it was all great. Also, I will note that sometimes, I felt like punching Welkin in the face for making stupid decisions or saying stupid things that weren't appropriate to the situation, but that was part of this likeability. Also, there was another change in the behaviors of the characters and their development at around episode 16, especially with all the events that preceded them, and you will have to find out what I am talking about because it is spoiling things. Also, I do not like Faldio. Period. He does necessary things, but you don't really get to see how much of a human being he really is until the latter half of the anime. He seemed just there to be a plot convenient character. Furthermore, in terms of the focus, I didn't like the way the anime used the squad. I can understand the fact that you need to focus on the main characters, but other than a few instances within the anime, you don't get to see much of the squad on a personal and understandable basis. I am excluding a lot of the banter, because the banter usually happened during heavy moments or just important moments in general. I was hoping to see more of the side characters get more of a perspective as well, so that we could see their struggles and their triumphs. and also, Faldio didn't really get much attention when it came to his past, other than his time at the University. Last but certainly not least, I have a problem with the direction used for the Imperials side, more along the way of the change at the halfway point. In episode 9, you get at least some sense of the imperials and their motives, and that is great. They should have rolled with it. By the last few episodes of the anime, the imperials were beginning to look more like assholes and big jerks, especially Maximilian. He looked like a cold-hearted person, but he then just became an asshole who had no reason to do anything anymore except be an asshole and try to gain more power, which ultimately lead to his downfall. *surprise surprise* General Jaegar and Silvaria were the only two relatable Imperials, who had their own stake in the war and reasons to fight in the war. They could have focused a little bit more on just different issues, but they did a very solid job on characters. Overall: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment of this anime was very high, mostly because I am a history buff and I love things that give off the historical flare, along with the militaristic flare, and this show really did just that. I really enjoyed this anime through and through, and I would love to watch it again. Overall: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nThis is an 8/10 because it switched focuses in terms of art style, characters and the story, especially characters and art style. I freakin loved this anime. It was so enjoyable, even with the shift in focus. I would definitely recommend this anime to whomever wants to see it.",

Senjou no Valkyria is based off a video game under the same name, and it follows the story of Alicia and Welkin as they fight together in a war brought on by the empire.   I highly recommend playing the game first, but if not, then watching the anime first, is fine.    If I had to pick one thing about this show thatstood out the most to me, then it would be that this is one of the best game-to-anime adaptions I have ever seen.     While there is no OP or ED with this show, the quality is very much there.   The characters are likeable, the sounds are good enough, the art style is very pleasing, the story is great, and overall, its an enjoyable military-style anime.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nSo in summary, this is one amazing videogame-to-anime adaption that I've seen and I highly recommend it for those who enjoy a country side of things and military.   Oh, and check out the video game as well.",

            "content": "At this point in time, you're likely coming here to see how the anime was after playing or hearing about the game.  More people will likely have their curiosity piqued with the remaster on PS4, and still some with the usual Steam sales. Personally after playing the game again on PC, I wanted to see those awesome scenes and battles I played in animated form. Many are likely wanting the same thing...and does this deliver? Yes and no.\r\nStory - 7 (Good)\r\nThe story I can sum up from just the game's description itself:\r\n\"Set in a fictitious continent reminiscent of the 1930s, Valkyria Chronicles depicts Europa,divided and ruled by two super powers: the Empire and the Federation. The Empire has set its sights on invading the principality Gallia, which shares its borders with the two superpowers, in an attempt to secure an invaluable natural resource, Ragnite. Within this struggle a hero named Welkin, and his fellow soldiers of the Gallian Militia, \u2018Squad 7\u2019 are fighting back against the invasion and the Empire\u2019s attempts to unify the continent under its power. \\n\\n\r\nDuring the ensuing war, Squad 7 discovers that the Empire possesses a secret weapon, known as the \u201cValkyrur\u201d \u2013 an ancient race with special powers thought to exist only in legends. With this new discovery, the fate of Gallia\u2019s ability to defeat the Empire and save the lives of the Gallian citizens\u2026\"\\n\\n\r\nThe game's synopsis is essentially the same as the anime here. For the most part it follows the OVERALL story pretty faithfully. Having said that though, it changes up quite a few of the details to fit the alternate narrative. I won't get into too much for fear of spoilers, but otherwise significant parts(in my opinion) are completely absent or replaced with other things for the sake of it here. Examples include a certain cabin scene in the game versus the anime, the Princess and her appearance, or even the introduction/beginning in the first city.\\n\\n\r\nDon't get me wrong now, some of the changes are welcome additions. Some of the changes make more sense, only serve to flesh out those scenes even more, and give certain characters more development. Someone like Largo, who's a main part of Squad 7, gets plenty of screen time and growth. However, certain changes just end up making you scratch your head and ask \"Why?\" when the game depiction did it so much better and wasn't lacking whatsoever. One such example is with Zaka, who doesn't even get the Shamrock featured whatsoever(when it was a huge addition to Squad 7 in the game).\\n\\n\r\nRegardless of my personal taste there, the story still follows the same plot points and even includes a good majority of the game's battles. I liked the game's story, so needless to say I thought the story here was very good as well.\\n\\n\r\nArt - 7 (Good)\\n\\n\r\nThe art style of this anime attempts to capture the sketching-like quality of the game to a certain degree, and it's serviceable. It's a nice homage to the original material, and even without the pseudo-filter the art is all animated well and it flows nicely in even the action scenes. The world, characters, settings, backdrop, and all the little details are nicely done in this anime making it very pretty to look at. I didn't find myself straining to keep watching because of artistic hiccups like in Dragon Ball Super, nor did I find myself checking if I accidentally installed a SweetFX or ENB profile as was the case with No Game No Life.\\n\\n\r\nSome characters also look noticeably better(in my opinion) in this anime versus the game. Rosie looks far more vivid and colorful, than her washed out game variant for example. The only character in comparison that I would say looks \"worse\" would be Largo, as they made him look a tad different, but nothing that someone would have any real gripe over. Plus...you get to see Selvaria in quite the sexy dress during one banquet scene. <Insert Lenny Face> \\n\\n\r\nSound - 10 (Outstanding)\\n\\n\r\nThe strong point of the anime. From the sound effects of the tanks, to the pops of the guns when they shoot, it's there and gets you immersed when wearing a headset. What really takes this to the next level, is that they included bits of the OST from the game and integrated it pretty seamlessly into the anime. On top of this they even included the original Japanese voice actors/actresses from the game to reprise their roles here. This is flat out awesome. I jump from the game world, and go into the anime and don't miss a beat whatsoever. Top notch stuff, especially when there's a death in the anime it will sometimes play the game over theme from the game(and I shouldn't smile or laugh at that, but I usually did).\\n\\n\r\nCharacter(s) - 3 (Poor)\\n\\n\r\nThis is the big failing of the anime, in my opinion. It changes the personalities of some of the characters completely, especially Welkin and Alicia the two main characters. This is one of those moments where as I said before it begs the question of \"Why?\" Welkin in the game is depicted as an oddball at times, but when it comes to leading his squad he is very much about the business. Sure he's quirky, but when it's time to lead his troop, fire upon the enemy or give orders, his tone and demeanor change completely.\\n\\n\r\nIn the anime? Welkin is beta as all get out and never stops being the airhead interested in nature, bugs, and biology. They also make Faldio quite the ladies man, who flirts with Alicia, creating this weird love triangle when I don't recall him and her having much interaction in the game to begin with outside of 1 side chapter. This can only be a change done for the sake of drama, but it doesn't sit well with me whatsoever due to having played the game first. They also add in characters I don't recall AT ALL from the game into the anime, such as a guy named Ramal who shows interest in Isara. He doesn't really serve a purpose in the anime, and because he wasn't in the game in any manner he just feels forced.\\n\\n\r\nThat said, are the characters and their portrayals themselves bad? No, not at all. You still get antics from Largo with his usual boasts on vegetables, or the daydreaming of sexy muscles from Jann so it keeps the spirit of certain things... But it just changes some characters I came to expect as one thing, and replaces some of them with something else. For example, they randomly make Alicia generic tsundere anime archetype character, and Rosie a huge cuntbag in the anime(she wasn't THAT bad in the game). Are they bad portrayals? No, it's just more out of place concerning the characters that did get changed, than anything else honestly.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 6 (Fair)\\n\\n\r\nObjectively speaking, if I never had the game to base my experience or introduction to this world on, I would say there's some enjoyment to be had here. This is especially true if you like WW2 and/or military anime. There's lots of character development, an intriguing little alternate universe, and a good blend of drama, humor, storytelling/world building, and action here. The pacing can be a bit off at times, but honestly can be supplemented and explained with having played the game.\\n\\n\r\nPlaying the game can be a double-edged sword in that aspect, however, as mentioned there are noticeable differences that might irk you(as it did me). All in all though, it isn't enough to detract from a decent enough anime. It ends up being a solid watch, and I can't say that I regret it even if it went off from the source material in some aspects.\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 6 (Fair)\\n\\n\r\nI can see myself recommending this anime out there to people who haven't played the game. It can stand alone by itself, and on the flip side only helps to get you back in the world of Valkyria Chronicles if you thoroughly enjoyed the game world and want another go at it with your favorite characters.\\n\\n\r\nHaving said that though, the game is far and away the better and true depiction of the original story here.",

            "content": "\"Valkyria, Valkyria May the bloodline live forever. Valkyria, Valkyria Bless and protect our fertile land\" -excert from the anthem of Gallia\r\nSenjou no Valkyria is a tough one to review. For one, I have to say that the show is really enjoyable I can call it the best military anime I've seen. On the other hand, I think that if some thing were done a little differently, we could be watching an even better anime, that could be praised by a lot of people, not just a small group of us.\r\nLet's start with the best part of the anime, the story. Of course, this series isan adaptation of a videogame, so the original premise comes from there. The creators took that premise, and created a much better and widely expanded version of it. They gave a lot of time to scenes, that didn't have that much in the game and also improved the emotinal moments by ton. They also introduced some new characters, which helped with the enjoyment of the overall story. With these things said, the story is really interesting from start to finnish, and picks up the pace as the show goes on.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters in this one are something, that you have to see on your own. I know a lot of people dont like the characters, and I can see why. They are kinda dumb, and the main guy doesn't get a lot of things. There are also some debatable personalities, which can be loved by some, but hated by others. I personally like the characters. They are not something special, but not bad either. I didn't really find somebody too annoying or badly written, but I also didn't find anybody that great, with the exception of Isara.\\n\\n\r\nBefore I talk about the art, I have to say that this anime has a lot of real life similarities. That itself can sound boring, but the fact is that these similarities are very well done and things like discrimination and concentration camps are happening while the story continues.\\n\\n\r\nAnd now about the art, and I have a perfect word for that - beatiful. Seriously, I've loved the art in the game aswell, but seeing it now, fully animated is something completely different. The art-style is great and it makes Valkyria one of the best looking anime's I've seen.\\n\\n\r\nThe level of the overall enjoyment was high, but like I said, there were some things that were bugging my mind while watching. One of them is that the characters actually sometimes were annoying. Especially at the beggning. Other thing is that the first half of the anime was just too nice. Once you were not on a battlefield, everyone was smiling and laughing, like there was no war at all, which really hurt the level of enjoyment at the start. This thing, luckily got better in about the half of the anime, thanks to a certain 'event'. And once the atmosphere got darker, the anime was actually much much better. Last thing I didn't really like was the ending. The things leading to the ending were great. But the true ending, the last battle, was a little disappointing.\\n\\n\r\nSenjou no Valkyria is a great piece of work, that is sadly pushed down by some smaller, yet impactful mistakes. But even then it's one of the more under-appreciteated and one of the best military shows out there.",

            "content": "(I am about halfway through the series as I cannot get myself to enduring more episodes, but if I finish it and my opinion changed I will update this review.)\r\nThis anime is based on the game \"Valkyria Chronicles\", which I personally really liked. Now the series deals with the same story as the game and starts off with much potential, the art style also stays true to the original.\r\nBUT: sadly, this does not keep up.\r\nThe anime has much more unnecessary fanservice, random anime clich\u00e9es are thrown in which the game did not have, some characters act completely different than in the game (Alicia suddenly becamea Super Tsundere, and sadly that's not all that has changed).\\n\r\nFurther, in addition to the original romance subplot, several other romances are inserted without much thought and they seem totally out of place. I mean, they made one character a love rival (in the series he had no romantic interests at all!!!), just to make the relationships more \"intersting\". They became more ridiculous, that's all.\\n\r\nSome plot elements are also altered. I know it's not easy to make a series based on a game, but most changes were not necessary.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nTo conclude, it is REALLY REALLY hard to watch this if you liked the game and impossible to take it seriously (they even inserted a panty joke). \\n\r\nI would not recommend this for anyone. If you want to enjoy a good story, play the game.",

            "content": "If you have played the game that this is based on then you are going to know the main characters Welkin,Alicia,Isara,Rosie and Largo (AKA the characters that appear in most of the games cut scenes) with the rest of squad 7 being made up of characters from the character of the DLC Edy\u2019s Mission: Enter the Edy Detachment (although all of these characters can be recruited into the squad anyway in the game) most other members of squad 7 are either placed into Faldio's squad 1 or are shown as side characters. Anyway moving on the anime makes away with the games beautiful water pasteldesign in favour of a more standard art style although disappointing it still looks pretty good. Another thing to note is that many things occur differently to the game including plot points and character development The characters for the most part are very similar to their game counterparts but Alicia is a bit mire tsundere in this one. A thing i did enjoy was the soundtrack as a large portion of it is directly from the game which gives a good sense of nostalgia for those who have played it and had enjoyed the soundtrack Anyway if your looking for a decent war anime this is for you and if your looking for a brilliant strategy rpg with 3rd person elements and squad mechanics i would recommend the game which is available on both ps3 and steam.",

            "content": "Well, this is my first review, so I will try to make something of it\r\nSomething that you hear people say so know and then is: I died watching this anime, well, maybe that's something I did, because it was so well made.\r\nStory 10/10\r\nThe story is about a girl and a boy (well, they're not so young anymore..) who are in a war. A lot of drama is there actually,well, for the romance part to be more precisely. A complicated romance but that's maybe just because Welkin is a bit stupid at times. Their are more romances than just of Welkin and Alicia by the way,but it's not that obvious all the time and some of then.. well, it's just not finished because they don't survive, which made me cry again... Well, actually the whole part about the military just thinking it was so true, it made me realise again how awful war is and how crazy the people are who started it. (You can see it from Maximillian who just goes crazy). In the beginning, I didn't like it very much, just thinking about the action that I expected, which was there, but I felt like I missed something, maybe more reality. And that came, it did indeed! I got the feeling that is was touching, I cried so much. Well, it's just how real war is, you'll lose friend... That's what I didn't actually like about this anime, but that's just the reality.. But the the story as one was really good, actually it was great. I was really moved when I was watching and finished watching this, it actually stayed in my mind for a long time...\\n\\n\r\nArt 10/10\\n\r\nI have to say the art was really good, but I've seen just a little better.. but I won't talk much about it, it was just great :)\\n\\n\r\nSound 9/10\\n\r\nActually, I don't have to say a lot about this, just thinking it was pretty good, but the sound just is something that is important to an anime, but when I watch an anime, I don't listen just precisely to the music, it just flows into you.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 10/10\\n\r\nAlicia has a great personality, she is strong and has her own opinion, of course, she has her girl-side to, and she is caring. Well, I think this is what I liked about her.\\n\r\nWelkin is a bit... well, he wanders away with his thoughts and is just weird at times. But he knowes what to do if it's nescessarry. But what about the romance part of this story, yes, he was not good at that part, to slow to see things, in the end, it was good though.\\n\r\nHe is not the main-main person, but I also want to say something about Faldio. He's the guy that is a good friend of Welkin and also falls in love with Alicia. But he's the kind of guy who knows what to do when it comes to love. He teases her now and then which I actually liked.\\n\r\nThe other characters... well, every character had their personallity and I didn't hate a single one of them. (Maybe that's not true, but I disliked only 2 people or something like that) From their movements you can exactly know what kind of persons they are and they actually have a nice side, well, most of them. I lied the story's of everyone of them, and I didn't mind that they also put these stories in the anime.\\n\r\nOne thing I want to say is that I also loved Ramal and Isara, well, I loved almost all the characters..\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 9/10\\n\r\nWhy 9 out of 10, well, it's good, funny at some times, I liked the action, the romance part, the drama at some parts but the whole part that made me cry, is, well, not really that much of enjoyment... that's why I gave it a 9.\\n\r\nIt's just so sad to watch so many people die. And, I have to say that when some people did die, I was just like, well, that person died, so that other person also doesn't really have a meaning anymore, and a few episodes later it was like, that other person died too... and I cried a lot, AGAIN, really, this was just an anime that made me cry, and cry, of course, a lot of good moments, I wouldn't say that this anime is just one big one of a tragedy.. I won't tell who it was, but the one person that died before the last one, just thinking that wasn't fair at all! Actually, all the deaths weren't fair, that's why I cried so much. Just true so I had to say it...\\n\\n\r\nI already told that I liked this anime very much, even because of the very sad moments, I thought it was really good, and it changed my way of thinking a bit. Again made it realise me that war is horrible. The only thing I want to say in the end is that, the very-very end, so the last part when the fighting is over, is happy, so don't be afraid of that :)\\n",

I would recommend it to anyone interested in a well told war story that is not \"all\" about combat, and also you will enjoy it even more if you have played the game of the same name.",

Given  that, however, both the game and the anime versions have successfully deliver the emotions in terms of the relation of the characters to the audiences/gamers, despite of its aces and flops. \r\nThe soundtrack is also phenomenal, and there's also lots of memorable moments that will leave you sniffing out lots oftissues.

            "content": "Wow. Just... Wow. I don't really know where to start with this one. Imagine an anime that was the perfect blend of military action, drama, and romance, combined with a superb cast of characters, and you have Senjou no Valkyria in a nutshell. \r\nStory: 8\r\nArt: 8\r\nSound:8\r\nCharacter: 10\r\nEnjoyment: 10\r\nOverall: 9\r\n     Gah. I really like the story, but it is a hard one to explain. So refer to the synopsis. It's not very original, but the way it balances action, drama, and romance sets it apart from other anime. \r\n     Note: It doesn't really say so on this website,but the second half of this anime does take on a sci-fi/fantasy twist. This twist made the story unique, but also created a lot of questions that don't exactly get answered. Despite this, the story wraps itself up nicely, with a definitive ending. \\n\r\n     One thing that kinda irritated me was the enemy's ability to fire one last bullet before dying. It happens CONSTANTLY throughout the series. Enemy gets shot, assumed dead, enemy isn't dead, enemy shoots one last bullet, bullet hits friendly, enemy gets shot again. Besides this one minor flaw, the story is great.\\n\\n\r\n     The anime was created in 2009, so the visuals are crisp. Not much else to say about the art. \\n\\n\r\n     The OPs were catchy in their own way. The ED for the first half was an upbeat autotuned song, matching the first half of the anime's carefree nature. On the other hand, the ED for the second half was melancholic and dramatic, matching the second half of the anime's... well... melancholic and dramatic nature.  So no complaints. \\n\\n\r\n     The characters are definitely the highlight of this anime. The main character, Welkin, is as unique as they get. He's just one of those awkward characters that you can't avoid cheering on. \\n\r\n     Alicia, the main heroine, is fairly basic. Mean towards Welkin from the start, but slowly starts to understand him, ends up falling in love with him, etc, etc. \\n\r\n     Isara, Welkin's adopted sister, is a Darcsen, a race of people who are frowned upon. Welkin tries to protect Isara from the hate, since they are each others only family. She is another char you can't help but love.\\n\r\n     Faldio, Welkin's best friend. His role changes multiple times throughout the series, for good and for bad. \\n\r\n     Then there is the rest of the members from Squad 7(including, but not limited to, a flamboyant guy, a bear of a guy, an all-work-no-play woman, a priss of a girl, and teenage brothers) all of which play a role in the series, whether you remember their names or not.\\n\r\n     Last but not least, a handful of bad guys. There's Maximilian, the main bad guy, and all he wants is power and he'll stop at nothing to achieve it blah blah blah. He's just someone who is really easy to hate. Then there's Selvaria, his closest partner. Her loyalty to him throughout the series is staggering. Then there's Jaeger, a ladies man who I actually liked throughout the show, since he never really felt like a bad guy. Lastly, there's Gregor, the cold blooded, merciless commander. Another easy person to hate. \\n\r\n     What makes this cast so great is how real they feel. So real that some episodes were a pain to watch, because of what our main 4 characters were going through. And yes, one manly tear was shed during this show. Just one. But it was when one of the characters died. And it was flippin' devastating. \\n\\n\r\n     As far as enjoyment goes, I give it a 10. I feel obligated to give it a 10 here, since I started the show at 12:30am and finished it at 11:00am. Yes. I watched the entire show in one setting, skipping sleep in the process. I just couldn't pull myself away from the show. \\n\\n\r\nOverall is a 9. I definitely recommend this show to anyone who appreciates military action, drama, and romance. \\n",

            "content": "Valkyria Chronicles, one of my favorite video games, taken to the big screen. I know it's easy to hate an adaption that crushes your exception, but this is not the only anime to ruin a video game adaption by rushing through the plot and adding alternate. Guys you don't have to follow the video game as a textbook, but please taking liberation that ruin the characters and the morals itself?\r\nStory: 6\r\nValkyria Chronicles focuses on a war based off WW2 where the son of a famous general's son, Welkin, a member of the watchmen group, Alice, and his Jewish based adopted sister, Isara, are drafted tohelp their small country fight against the Imperials. Outside the war story, Welkin and Alice's growing romance is a major theme, and the origin of the hatred of Darscen surrounded by the supernatural warriors known as Valkyria. That's the game's plot.\\n\\n\r\nThe anime is the love story of Welkin and Alice during an occasional war story, as they bond and fight with their soldiers. This wouldn't be a problem but the game is about the war and the people dealing with it, but the anime is about the people (Welkin and Alice in particular). The show doesn't dedicated it's time to the war which is the main purpose of the game. You don't have to go balls to the walls but don't causality brush it aside as if no one cares about it.\\n\\n\r\nThe only time you'll get plot is when the characters talk in overly long sentences. Show don't tell. It makes it worst that some of the scenes weren't even in the game and is just there to pad time.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 4\\n\r\nThe art in the game has a distinct artistic style based off sketches giving a beautiful and serene feeling to the game that provides the perfect mood in a game about war. However, be wary, don't play the game then watch the anime in a close time span: you will question your sanity.\\n\\n\r\nThe direction seems to me to be \"MOE. THIS SHOW JUST ISN'T MOE ENOUGH.\" The animation reminds you that your watching the wrong type of show starring in making Tsundere Alice blush and making war look clumsy and bulky as possible. I get that game animation would probable go over budget, but cant you follow a less generic art style? It's easy to catch mistakes and the background is decent nothing special. Guys I know your trying to draw episodes in a short of time, but I think it takes more time to destroy a style and start anew than copy it.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound: 7\\n\r\nThe sound track is the best part of the show because it's the game's original soundtrack. That's it.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 6\\n\r\nThe characters are themselves, and everything is not on fire. The anime's good point is giving characterization to side characters while in the game only Welkin, Alice, Rose, and Largo get the spotlight. However I will not agree with the creation of Tsundere Alice, who is this character? No one asked for this as far as I know as. In the game Alice is a claim reasonable girl with deeper issues while the anime she's an annoying tsudere; the only thing they have in common is being a baker and falling in love with Welkin.\\n\\n\r\nAlso why is their an annoying love triangle, there was no love triangle in the game. Why this may be nick picking, but this triangle causes derailing character moments. The love triangle gives Faldio benefits by having more scene time and an interesting look at his motives, but Welkin and Alice come off irresponsible soldiers especially when the anime makes Welkin indirectly responsible for a character's death which the game displays as a tragedy of war.\\n\\n\r\nIn the game Welkin pushes his feelings aside knowing he can't lose his cool and receives closure with the help of Alice and returns the favor, but in the anime Welkin becomes distance and cold bawling his eye out to Alice. This comes off as a cheap trick of sympathy to get Alice rather than emotional.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 4\\n\r\nI didn't like what I was watching, I couldn't believe what I was watching. I came for the action and character, but got of flat characters spitting plot sentences in my face. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 5\\n\r\nDon't watch this as a fan or as a newcomer, it's an insult to the game and the moral of the game. I'm not judging it based on comparison to the game.\\n\\n\r\nVideo games and anime are two different medias they don't have to be the same, but when use the name of one work your expected to provided an experience you can only get from that media. \\n",

            "content": "You have the chance to go to war, represent your country and possibly even win it and get a medal of honor, but have a high chance of dying in battle or stay at home, doing nothing to contribute to the war and live a normal, boring life, staying at home and playing computer games, meeting up with friends and watching movies at the nearest cinema, though it's a very low chance that you would die. One would change your life forever, the other, well maybe it'll stay the same.\r\nLet that sit in your mind for a while.\r\nStory: 9/10\r\nThis story is based on something likeWorld War I/II, but with some supernatural history to it. Since this was based on a game, I thought that the anime wouldn't drag out too much and yes, I was right. Neither did it rush through the whole story too quickly, nor did it drag out. The story was explained without leaving questions in your mind like, \"Why did that happen? Who was that? What happened before?\". For me, the anime had some emotional value in it, because there was a character in the anime that died and I did tear up a bit. If a story can manipulate your emotions, then damn sure will it be good. The only thing I didn't like in this anime was the romance. The female character in the anime was teasing the audience so much that it annoyed me. Though, that stopped around the end. The action scenes were actually quite good. In fact, I wanted to see Welkin Gunther in action more, though he is only a commander and doesn't have a lot of physical strength.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nThe art was superb. I like to see new things, and I don't think I've seen art like this. The animation was smooth and the colors were nice and bright.  The art for the eye isn't like your standard anime eye, it was more of a realistic look. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nThe OST was nice and fit the scene, but sometimes it was a bit too loud when a character was speaking. There was also the sound of the rain which sounded like it was off RainyMood, which actually made the scene very relaxing, since I like the sound of rain. It wasn't overused and the whole soundtrack was so relaxing that I could listen to it without the speaking and fall asleep. The OP wasn't introduced until episode 6, which was a bit weird, but hey it sounded nice. Not the best OP, but it's better than most that I've heard. The 1st OP played for about 8 episodes, and no OP played until the 22nd episode. The 2nd OP in my opinion was as good as the 1st one, because it sounds nice. Though, I'd expect them to get a male singer since it is military, but hey I can't ask for anything else. The 1st ED was really funny to me, since it was auto-tuned (REALLY HEAVILY) but it was nice and was a happy song. The 2nd ED is more of a sad song and if you look at the lyrics, it's about love. Both of the ED also follow the OP's 'play for this much episodes and play a new one at the end' rule.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nWelkin Gunther, the protagonist of the story and the commander of Squad 7. He was introduced as an empty-minded character and he was really random. People also started saying on how he has a fetish for animals, because he really likes animals. People also question his logic, but in battle he can be smart. Outside he is tough and looks like he will never be depressed, but inside his mental ability is as weak as any average human. \\n\\n\r\nAlicia Melchott, the aide-commander of Squad 7. She was introduced as the town watch for Bruhl and is a happy cheerful character. She is a baker and one old lady even praised her that she is on a master-level. Personally, she did annoy me because of her teasing, but after that she became a likable character.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed this anime, mainly because this was the only thing I watched when I was bored. The action scenes were nice, but not enough that it'll give you goosebumps. It also gives you a view on what the soldiers see in the battlefield, what they experience and what they feel.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nThis anime was very nice, but I wish it was continued a bit more. It needs to put an arc about the Valkyrians and the Darcsens, but I guess it was very unpopular and didn't get enough sales. Would I re-watch this? If I'm really bored, sure.\\n\\n",

But after watching a few episodes and immediately something clicked. I definitely didn't know what was coming. It's an fairly addicting Anime for it being \"non-popular\". It is definitely not a show to miss out on. \r\nStory: 9\r\nThe story seems to be slow at the beginning, but after a while, it'll make you watch it until you need to sleep. This was a interesting blend of good action, romance, drama, and comedy as well (the winged pig'sshort appearances was extremely enjoyable). Everything seemed to mix together really well to make a unique delicious bread. There are good twists that makes it especially amusing. The drama in this Anime is especially enticing, and strongly delivered. It strikes you to the heart so much as if you are a fellow friend of the characters. Be ready to shed tears.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9 \\n\r\nThe art in this is good, nothing special but not bad. It was almost perfect.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8\\n\r\nThe opening songs and ending songs are ear-candy, and addicting. It's good music to capture the mood of the Anime. However, the in-show background music didn't stand out much, which can be a positive or negative. The background music could have been better. Sound effects are good though.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9\\n\r\n3-D characters. Loveable and down-to-earth characters. Even some of enemy characters were loveable. Character development was good but could have been better. There were slight rushing of some of the character developments.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10 \\n\r\nI enjoyed watching every episode and had a great feeling after each episode. After finishing mostly every episode, I would think \"wow, that was a good episode!\" The whole Anime was really a enjoyable journey where it felt like I have been with the characters throughout the whole series.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9\\n\r\nThe only thing that was lacking throughout the whole show was probably the ending scene, but it was satisfying enough. Definitely a good Anime to watch, and I have no regrets on watching this. \\n\\n\r\nHopefully more people will discover this wonderful Anime and share the bread!",

            "content": "Valkyria Chronicles is set in an alternate Europe around 1940s. With the timeline, it\u2019s obvious that the overall theme will be World War 2-esque. This means that the primary target of the anime are either military & dieselpunk fans or those who have played the game. The sad reality is, it\u2019s neither packed in combat actions nor gives us \u2018fanservice\u2019 (not ecchi panty shots and the others, but as in we could see more of our favorite character development outside of the game and see him/her got more spotlight, etc). So all in all, this anime can be considered a flop in its execution butstill, it has potential if it was done in another way (like making it slice of life in the military base or comedy rather than the usual melo-war movie that is plot-focused with a little bit of romance).\\n\\n\r\nHere we can see the five main characters and also the ones who hog the entire spotlight on them. We have the power-hungry demagogue Maximilian, the devout servant because of lifelong obligation Selvaria, the ditzy genius Welkin, the girl next door Alicia, and the womanizer but at the same not empty-brained Faldio. The other characters are simply side-swept with the occasional highlighted in the filler episode after a tragedy and maybe an arc like Rosie and Isara. But other than that, the focus returns back to the five-O. What\u2019s redeeming though, is that the character varies a lot and there are several of the somewhat rare types in anime like Jann.\\n\\n\r\nThe colors present here are mostly pastel and dull which gives us the impression of experiencing a fantasy yet tragedy-engulfed world. This is great in theory but the longer we watch, of course the more dull and boring it gets. Both 2D and 3D are okay and there\u2019s only a few of the awkward movements.\\n\\n\r\nThe VA did a good job and suits their role. The soundtracks aren\u2019t too memorable but at least that means they\u2019re also not annoying. In the version of VC in which I watched (Coalgirl), the OP and the ED were not present until the last two episode so no comments. This might be special in my case because of I've only recently downloaded ep 25 & 26 yet the other 24 episodes had been downloaded for like two years ago\\n\\n\r\nPersonal experience here, take with a grain of salt; this is by far the anime in which I took a very long time to finish it. I\u2019ve played the game (only for several hours though) and become interested it in so I decided to look at the anime hoping that it will satisfy me more. I started watching in December 2015 up until episode 12 and then took a long hiatus until it is already almost one year (end of November or Early December 2016) before I pick it up for 6 more episodes and then it\u2019s back on-hold. It\u2019s until now, May 2017 that I manages to finish the whole 26 episodes (not including the 10 OVAs). Looking at my record in watching animes, either I binge-watched an anime in a period of one day to one week, or watch it by batches of 3-6 episodes per seating and then took around 1-2 months to finish it. But this anime is a record-setter with a whopping ~17 months to finish. That may tell us a lot that this anime is both disappointing and boring. The concept of the universe was great (like in the masterpiece game) but the execution of this anime gone very awry. Could\u2019ve take a different concept or genre and give a lot of characters spotlight and specials rather than making a plot-focused anime while the game itself already has already had the story.\\n",

            "content": "Valkyria Chronicles like so many game adaptation anime suffers from plot holes, pacing problems and underdeveloped characters. I never played the RPG and evaluate this as anime first.\r\nStory - 3:\r\nAn alternate timeline setting that somewhat resembles WWII Europe and lost civilization quickly spikes the interest of the viewers. And just as fast causes confusion for everyone who haven't played the game. Series makes huge leaps from one development to the next, never truly uncovering the desired depth of the story line. This is the plague that haunts game adaption anime time and time again. You don't get the gradual exposure to the story line likeyou would by progressing through hours and hours of gameplay. Instead it stretches into 24 episode of unnecessary fillers followed by rushed 4 episode ending which is forced so much that 20 episodes that came before it appear irrelevant.\\n\\n\r\nArt - 8:\\n\\n\r\nFor 2009 the art is incredible. The color palette is well balanced and creates realistic feel the studio obviously aimed for.\\n\\n\r\nSound - 3:\\n\\n\r\nVoice acting and soundtrack felt like an afterthought the entire series. Just a few days after finishing the series, I second guess myself if there really was any sountrack to begin with and voice acting is so bland you can hardly remember what each character sounded like.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters - 1:\\n\\n\r\nOne of the most irritable MC's ever. Full of herself Alicia under the impression that the world revolves solely around her, and denser than a diamond Welkin who took 24 episodes to arrive at the most predictable outcome. Supporting cast is so bleak you will not remember any of them after a week. Most, if not all, the characters are very frustrating and one dimensional. Even key roles are underdeveloped, forced, cliche and frankly have 0 impact on the story as a whole.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 3:\\n\\n\r\nThe series were unnecessarily long, not justifying the time invested in 24 episodes. It would have been a better fit for a short 12 episode show. Past episode 5 you start to wonder if there is a meaning behind short side-stories presented in rapid succession, but realize that it would have been better to skip to episode 21 and wrap up the series. Never truly understanding the point of those 20 episodes in between. But it is once again the downfall of all the game adaptation anime.\\n\\n\r\nTL:DR;\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 3:\\n\\n\r\nUnless you ran out of anime to watch I would not recommend wasting your time on this series. Just go ahead and play the game, judging from all the reviews it is a very good title and I'm sure it tells the story in a better manner than the anime.\\n",

With a wide cast of supporting characters that play an important part in developing the story, it was quite nice in showing bonds developed in the midst of war. I'd give the story a 10 out of 10, flawless.\r\nArt: 9\r\nThe art was great, but there was a couple moments here andthere where it fell a bit but overall it was quite detailed and flowing. I enjoyed the character designs for everyone in squad 7, very suiting with their personalities, on that note...\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 10\\n\r\nThe characters in Valkyria Chronicles were outstanding, each unique in their own way.

From the first episode of being accused as a spy to the very end. Strategy, battles, gaining trust and developing bonds, Valkyria Chronicles had it all. I believe that Valkyria Chronicles is very underrated, (which may be due to the fact of it being an adaption to a game)\\n\\n\r\nOverall : 10\\n\r\nValkyria Chronicles was almost a flawless masterpiece, I enjoyed it to the very end.

It isn't leave a plot hole (well. maybe a little bit but you can just ignore it lol).\r\nStory 9:\r\nThe story is pretty mainstream and simple actually. It is about war of two nations. Then the two main characters that was meet accidentally become a friend and determined to stop the war. That's it. So why I gave 9? Well because there are many other things that make the story great and fun to watch. Theromance is well made and one of the best romance recently. The character development also good. And somehow the squad 7 remember me of Gekkostate from Eureka 7. The story is fun and also with a bit of twist.\\n\\n\r\nArt 10\\n\r\nThe graphic is simply amazing. It is unique and pretty much same with the game's. the color is great. the character design is captive, y=the effect also well made.

            "content": "one of the worst shows i have ever seen i expected a gritty show about totally not ww2 but what i got instead is a incredibly cheesy and generic love story instead of a show about war if you whould remove the terrible romance part and focus more on the actual war this show whould be much much better thats why im only giving it a 1 /10\r\nit really did have potential but it sadly failed in that department and i could swear that i fell asleep a few times. definitely one of the few if not the only anime that i outright hate anddespise",
