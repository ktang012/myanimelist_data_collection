            "content": "This is my first review :D\r\nFirst of all , Akatsuki no yona where have you been all this time? Where have you been HIDING dammit!\r\nSound : Im specifically starting with this , because lets face it , the soundtrack is absolutely amazing in this anime. Starting with the opening , Its only instrumental! ( How much time has it been since we  got AN INSTRUMENTAL OPENING?)and yet you don't skip it and listen to it every damn time. The second opening isnt as great but is still awesome!\r\n( seriously it gives you chills everytime there's a fight/emotional moment and the traditional music goes in).\r\nStory: Princess Yona leads a peaceful life. Her only \"worries\" is whether or not her hair colour suits her and if she's gonna be able to marry her beloved childhood friend Soo-won. Well lucky for her ! He stops by the castle for a week. However her father forbids their marriage for reasons beyond her understanding. THEN BAM! beloved Soo-Won drives a blade through the chest of the king while she runs into the room to talk to him about her marriage. Heartbroken and stripped of her status as royalty, Yona  lives as a fugitive on the run, accompanied only by one of the king's trusted shogun : Haku!.\\n\\n\r\nArt : The animation is freaking good , yona hime face expressions are really well detailed ( I mean look at those fierce gorgeous eyes man) , and the art may seem typical but its beautiful! And hey for once the main dude isnt a 100% bishounen shining armored prince like dude his eyes are more like ''dont mess with me'' type.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: The side characters ( Yona companions) are amazingly well developped ( better than any shojo I watched) , you get to see a very detailed past of some of them. ALSO CAN WE PLEASE TAKE A MOMENT for the first non-cry baby female lead since those 5 last years? Yes Yona hime is a typical princess , fragile , who only cares for nobles things and dont know how to cook her own food. HOWEVER she blooms into a strong female lead , who is aware of her weakness and wants to learn how to protect herself and save her country!. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: You know it's a good anime when you know the release date of the next episode and wait for it the whole week. You know its a good anime when you prepare food for it and set all yourself up. Akatsuki no yona combines Humour , serious-badass-moments , Mother of typical shojo moments ( which means even if its typical they are still better introduced than other animes of the same type).It's the type of anime that will give you chills in every single episode. Honestly if you are the kind of person who was desperate to find an amazing shojo with Strong female lead (like me) or just a passing-by person who never seen a shojo in her/his life , or just a curious person ! THEN DONT MISS AKATSUKI NO YONA. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "By the end of this show, you will love it, its really something worth your time. Out of many shows airing today this show is really something to look forward to each week, now it can be enjoyed in its full glory even though the show does need a second season, dammit. Akatsuki no Yona is definitly a show you won't forget.\r\nAt first, this show seems like your average run of the mill shoujo reverse harem, but by the end of the first episode as the story goes on, it seems to be more than that, its really a well written story which focuses onvengence and betrayal, it blow other shoujos away. The pacing at times when getting dragons to join may seem a little slow and does drag on here and there. Sure it does focus on finding the dragons but get to the point already, sure there may be a sidestory but can we just get these people coming in?\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are done well and are beautifully developed, Yona is pretty much one of my faviroute female characters of all time, she starts off weak and fragile like a little kitten and develops on to be something big, a brave independent creature awaiting its prey, its done in a way that developing her is spot on. If I'd rate Yona alone it would be an easy 10. Hak is Yona's first protector, being known since childhood, Hak is goddamn badass, he helps Yona and keeps her safe from danger, he'll use himself as a tool to protect her. The other dragons are pretty good characters each with their own backstories and being well developed to Yona. The problem i have here is that some of these characters might say a serious speech and then revert to comedy, at first its a good ol'joke but it keeps getting used so much that its just a pain in the ass at times. \\n\\n\r\nThe Art is pretty good for the most part, it has some well done character designs and sometimes has some well detailed characters. Same goes for sound, its great to listen, both OPs and EDs are goddamn beautiful and the OSTs fit the shows theme.\\n\\n\r\nThe show is a blast to watch, it leaves no plotholes (from my point of view) and has dialouge that seems useful. The problem is that sometimes this show is a serious adventure fantasy and then converts to a shoujo comedy and usually this transition feels unatural and ruin the tense moments. At times its pretty funny but at times, I can't even.\\n\\n\r\nStory:9\\n\r\nArt:8\\n\r\nSound:8.5\\n\r\nCharacter:9\\n\r\nEnjoyment:9.5\\n\\n\r\nAkatsuki no Yona is a goddamn pleasure to watch and I'm glad I didn't ignore it. At first the plot sounds generic, but give the show a chance and you'll experience some of the most well done developements in anime in years. This show deserves a Season 2, hell it needs ne. And this all comes from Studio Pierret... how about putting this effort in Tokyo Ghoul? But besides jokes, you should seriously start watching Akatsuki no Yona right now.\\n\\n",

            "content": "At some point in the show, Yona mentioned something about escaping from her bubble of a spoiled princess, learning about the difficulties of life and such. Ironically, this show never managed to escape from its bubble of a shoujo-pandering, unbearably sappy, politically shallow, purposeless mess of tropes and forced superficial development. \r\nBeware of spoilers used as discussion points\r\nFeaturing a middle ages Korea kingdom apparently in turmoil; Yona stars as a completely clueless princess with already 2 incredibly hot young men who can\u2019t resist to \u201cprotect\u201d her. A coup occurred, for reasons still unclear after 24 episodes, killing the king and forcing Yona to take flightwith her Boyfriend #1 (Hak) after finding out the identity of the perpetrator being Boyfriend #2.Thus ensues a long winded journey as Yona travels and develops as a person and a benevolent, charismatic ruler, reaching for that ultimate goal with also a lot opportunities for romantic development, or so you\u2019d think.\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe premise of this series is definitely very promising and allows room for political intrigues, epic battles exploring the qualities of an ideal ruler, discussing the problems with a lenient ruler and how discipline is integral to order. Unfortunately a meager 2 episodes is spent on these issues, making it a huge waste of potential. It\u2019s mentioned many times that the previous reign wasn\u2019t effective, but it\u2019s hardly shown through the show; in fact the blame is all placed onto generic one-dimensional bad guys for doing bad things. The people perspective is nowhere to be found, their \u201csuffering\u201d is hardly discussed, there are no exact problems to be fixed; this makes the show\u2019s whole foundation completely empty and so does Yona\u2019s claim on learning about suffering. In comparison, Rose of Versailles beautifully portrays an oppressed society with plenty of civilian perspectives to display the problems with incompetent governance. On a wider scale, it\u2019s also mentioned that the kingdom is at risk of impending attack in an attempt to give the show some kind of direction; but it\u2019s so diluted and underpresented it\u2019s difficult to appreciate as world building. Furthermore, it doesn\u2019t really help that the show utilizes silly slapstick comedy; much like Shitgatsu Kimi ga Uso, these kills off any tension and make the show somehow even more bubbly than it already is. \\n\\n\\n\r\nOn an episode to episode basis, the show doesn\u2019t fare too well either. Most episodes focus on Yona\u2019s journey to find the \u201c4 dragons\u201d based on a prophecy told by a random drunk priest lying half dead on the side of the road. As if that isn\u2019t silly fantasy enough, these dragons are bound to her by DESTINY, meaning the moment she caught their eyesight, they become a harem member. Yep, she doesn\u2019t even need to convince them. Most of the arcs dont have much depth and doesn\u2019t contribute to the big picture. Additionally, they also try to get the audience to sympathise to the autistic, utterly stereotypical and forgettable dragons that become irrelevant the moment they join the harem.Boyfriend #5 (Blue dragon) arc in particular had a lot of issues that should really have been touched on like why are soldiers attacking the villagers? Why do the little kids keep dying? Why do they fear something that saves them? Instead it focused on the superficial \u201csuffering\u201d of the hot boy. And of course, Yona saves the day in the most stupid way possible \u201cbecause his hands are gentle, so I\u2019ll trust him\u201d, right. The Boyfriend #6 (green dragon) arc got a bit closer to what the show should have been but collapsed when it became yet another generic beat the big fat evil guy who oppress people out of his greedy desires (and really want to put his hands on Yona), joining awkwardly righteous pirates too nonetheless.  \\n\\n\\n\r\n It\u2019s funny how the show realizes the complete lack of purpose in trying to gather up these bishounen on the last episode due to Yona still being completely clueless and a failure in story writing discussed earlier. In attempt to correct this she is given a \u201cpurpose\u201d but it\u2019s clear the author still have no idea how to advance the plot and neither does the show become any less superficial. \\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacter wise, the show features a very generic cast of forgettable characters to poorly developed ones. Yona is often said to have developed greatly, which is nothing short of phony. Physical strength is not the equivalent of mental fortitude; and her excessive plot armor only further depreciates any signs of growth she has. There was only one instance in which she actually realizes she did not want to lose anything else, which was real development. All other instances are just the plot forcing her to take action in an attempt to fool the audience of any real substantial development. For example, when she shot said big fat evil guy, there was hardly any real change in her character or way of thinking, in fact she did it just to get patted on the head. The show tries to make it sounds fancy it but in reality it is exactly just that. And with this much \u201cgrowth\u201d as a human she has gathered in 24 long episodes, her development as a ruler is completely pointless to discuss.\\n\r\nBoyfriends #1-7 suffers heavily from being bogged down to tropes, wish fulfillment and shoujo pandering. They aren\u2019t really allowed to have any thoughts other than about Yona (and protect her because DESTINY). Boyfriend #2 (Su-won) is a potentially interesting character as a young mastermind of a coup but completely butchered by facetious \u201cna\u00efve boy\u201d behavior towards important head figures for reasons I can\u2019t think of besides pandering. His lack of screentime completely denies any chance of development, adding to long list of disappointment in this show.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOn the positive side, the production value of the show doesn\u2019t suffer very badly from being animated by Studio Pierrot infamous for low budget and conservative animation. Art is generally acceptable without noticeable problems. The chibi slapstick art hurts my eyes but other than that it\u2019s pretty average. The instrumental first opening sounds like something from a cheap Chinese MMO and the second is an okay jpop. \\n\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion, Akatsuki no Yona is yet another generic shoujo story masked by a deceptive exterior. Potential interesting plot development and political discussion are replaced by a pointless journey to find hot boys. Every character is inexplicably obsessed about Yona because she\u2019s the designated main character and tropes take up more time than character development. It\u2019s not necessarily the worst thing; in fact it\u2019s just overly mediocre rather than outright horrible. However, it is highly disappointing considering what it could possibly have been, making it excruciating to watch. If you had to watch this series it\u2019s best to keep your expectations low.\\n",

            "content": "I'm a female and I usually watch shounen/seinen animes, not because I'm a tomboy or whatever that is called, I'm just not into animes that focus too much on cute little love stories, which is, probably, most shoujo animes? I mean, really? REALLY? \r\nAnyway let's talk about this shit. Not shit in a bad way - I found Akatsuki no Yona THE shit. So far.\r\nStory:\r\nI dig the story. It sounds a bit like Nanatsu no Taizai's but here we have the four dragons instead of the seven sins, and Yona is not stupid and clich\u00e9 as Elizabeth, in my opinion.\r\nArt:\r\nThe art is pretty and classic.I love the characters designs. The animation is pretty good.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nIs there someone who cares about sound? You do? Well, I don't... sorry. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nI just love all of the characters so far. Hak is probably the funniest, but all of them have their funny moments, something I really dig. When I say all, I do mean ALL. Heck, even Ki-ja's grandma had hers. Their personalities are great and unique. Yona is a strong female lead, and I love that. She's charismatic, bubbly and brave. She really cares about Hak. She doesn't want to be always the one who needs protection, she actually wants to be strong, and to fight. I just love her character development. Yun is like totally awesome at everything he does, and I find it super cute/funny when he praises himself. He's really nice but also an ass. Yes, both at the same time. Hak is an awesome character. He's hella funny and strong. I love his personality.  Ki-ja behaves very politely and prince-like and is really loyal. I love his scenes with Hak. Ki-ja gets so easily annoyed by Hak, it's so funny (plus I must confess Ki-ja looks really cute when annoyed). Ik-su is also such a nice character and has a cute personality. Su-won was so nice and kawaii when younger, but now I just want to murder him.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I totally recommend it. There's a lot of action (fights and blood hell yeaaaah), humor, adventure and still there's a spot there reserved for romance. Everything very well-balanced.\\n\r\nSo far, I find Akatsuki no Yona a really awesome and unique shoujo, and I think there should be more shoujos like this since I'm freaking sick of the same old crap with these dumb little romances and imbecile characters and I know I'm not the only one.",

            "content": "What would you do if you lost everything to the one person you thought you cared about the most? Trust is easily extended when you live a sheltered life, and it makes the betrayal all that much more bitter of a pill to swallow. Yet it is not revenge that spurs on our heroine ultimately \u2013 for the line between love and hate is thin and the subsequent balancing act is, in the end, a chaotic mess of feelings too tangled and difficult to boil down to one simple word.\r\nRare is the series that introduces a seemingly weak and sheltered female lead, who undergoes greattragedy only to come out fierce and respectable at the end after the most well-paced development I have had the pleasure of viewing. Were that not enough, we are also blessed with a delightful supporting cast of varied and sometimes unexpected characters. While it\u2019s not without some flaws, Yona is absolutely amazing as a historical shoujo series.\\n\\n\r\nAlthough this season only acts as a starting point for what is to come, it introduces our cast and it develops our heroine. One of the strongest points about the plot is that it begins with a bang \u2013 we first establish a background and we are quickly endeared to the characters before it successfully guts us with the promise our premise gave. Betrayal.\\n\\n\r\nOne of the weakest points of many series is that while our protagonist may be likeable and receive depth and development, our antagonist is lacking in all areas \u2013 not so for Su-won. While he may be easy to despise for his hand in essentially ruining Yona\u2019s life, we quickly learn his motivation and while at first it may be easy to dismiss him as your stereotypical bad guy, episodes down the road clue us in to his real intentions.\\n\\n\r\nThe plot isn\u2019t without its flaws; it follows the stereotypical pattern of our hero finding a  \u201cwiseman\u201d who presents her with a mission which includes the collection of certain \u201citems,\u201d or in this case, the dragons. The backstory is not necessarily uninteresting but not entirely original either. In this way, Yona follows a lot of mythological stories  as inspiration but that doesn\u2019t make it unlikeable \u2013 in fact it\u2019s because it follows a pattern we are used to that it grips us and carries us with it every step of the way.\\n\\n\r\nOur cast is comprised primarily of Yona, Hak, Yun, and the four dragons. For Yona\u2019s part, she makes the biggest impact as an initially \u201cweak\u201d (but come on the girl wants to handle weapons and stuff she has the makings for bad assery from the start) but most certainly sheltered princess. She grows quickly as the loss of her status and family, coupled with Su-won\u2019s betrayal, takes a huge toll on her. Not to mention the wilderness which she is completely unaccustomed to, which requires her to eat food she may never have thought edible before, to sleep outside without proper shelter, and to deal with all sorts of wild animals and insects. She doesn\u2019t deal with it flawlessly \u2013 she struggles, like a real human being, and she gradually recovers then proceed to fight tooth and nail.\\n\\n\r\nHak admittedly starts out as a fierce defender that initially makes decisions based on his aim to protect Yona, but eventually he grows to respect her strength and determination and defers to her judgment the majority of the time. He even softens a bit over time, but in the end he goes from just wanting to keep Yona alive to having a more vested interest in protecting the kingdom with her.\\n\\n\r\nI won\u2019t provide extraneous details about the rest of the cast; suffice to say that introductions are by and large the biggest priority for the series when it comes to the dragons so the time period for development for their characters is rather minimal. Granted they do certainly receive it as Yona\u2019s presence impacts their lives, but I suspect additional development is in store for them in a coming season.\\n\\n\r\nFor the part of the animation, Yona is nothing if not consistent with a muted palette that at times is vibrant but always vivid in the detail of the characters and the landscape. Most enjoyable are the detailed character designs for each of them, thoroughly nuanced and symbolic. The action scenes are exciting, suspenseful and by and large, as realistic as one can expect for a fantasy series.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound is probably a bit more on the average front for the series, but is not necessarily a weakness. The initial opening fits the mood of the anime and the addition of lyrics halfway through makes it a catchy song that really foreshadows what is to come in the rest of the series and represents the development of our heroine. Although not particularly memorable, the insert songs match the general mood of the scenes that they accompany. All of the voice acting is solid, but as always the stars of the show are Saito Chiwa and Maeno Tomoaki who respectively as Yona and Hak really flesh out and bring their characters to life.\\n\\n\r\nFor all of my praise, I have to mention several drawbacks that bring down the rating a bit for this series. Make no mistake that it is stand-out, but its biggest issue is slow pacing near the beginning of the series. This can put off some potential viewership, but more than anything there are some episodes that just drag a bit. This happens at the beginning and at one point in the middle of the series. On the whole it\u2019s fairly well-paced but it\u2019s not perfect. \\n\\n\r\nThe other issue is that the series is advertised as romance \u2013 problem being, where is it? There is certainly romantic tension between characters but there is minimal development on that front even by the end of the series. If you are looking for a series about love, Yona focuses far more heavily on action and adventure \u2013 and it seems unfair to classify it as romance, as that\u2019s only a peripheral aspect of the story.\\n\\n\r\nAkatsuki no Yona is an incredible series that does so many things right that most are unable to \u2013 and it does it with an amazing female lead supported by an equally stellar cast of male characters. It proves that the shoujo/historical combination isn\u2019t dead, can be successful and well-done, and ultimately it\u2019s a heartfelt series manages to combine tragedy and comedy in an entertaining, colorful package.",

Not leaving a single detail behind, making sure that the watcher fully understands and appreciate a work of art when he sees it. It truly sends shivers down my spine.\r\nArt: 10\r\nI can hardlyguess the amount of time it would take to draw and perfect this anime, but theres no doubt that the producers didn't leave a single detail behind. From the leaves on the trees to the expressions of the characters. It is truly amazing that they managed to hit spot on as well as they did.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10\\n\r\nOne of the key factors to making an anime successful is the sound used in it, and it can be really hard to manage to find the perfect song, but yet again I am not disappointed. By using half old japanese songs with not much instruments in it and not too fancy, you find yourself sent back to another time and it makes it even easier to follow the story than ever before.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 10\\n\r\nNo details were skipped when they made the characters. From funny, to serious, to clever and smart, to strong, to weak and to plain dumb. This anime does not leave any information unsaid, from the past of the characters, to the way they act. Hell, I feel like I know Hak, Yun, Yona, Ki-Ja, Shinah and Jaeha (apart from Zeno, that guys a real mystery) better than i know my own family. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10\\n\r\nApart from the lack of romance I would have wished for to see and the first episode that pretty much  is a spoiler to the end, the amount of raw anime perfection leaves all that in the dust. I simply see no reason as to why I would rate this anime any lower than a 10. \\n\r\nIf you love romance, fantasy, action, comedy, adventure, well as long as you love anime THIS is the anime for you. \\n\\n\r\nThis year is filled with animes that I can hardly wait too see, and I believe that this was only one out of many 10 I will be giving out in the future. What a start on the year Akatsuki no Yona.",

            "content": "I came to this anime having been a huge fan of the manga beforehand, and to tell the truth the first few episodes felt a little choppy for me... plenty of places where I thought that the flow could have been better, that weird \"forward flash\" thing in the first couple episodes, and so on. It felt like they were so impatient to get to the good bits that they tried to fit too many flashbacks into the first hour and a half, spoiling the future events of the series instead of slowly revealing them as time went on.\r\nBut it settles down later and reallygrows on you. I particularly love what they've done with the soundtrack - it really reminds me of Juuni Kouki (makes sense since it's the same composer). I was expecting the usual sort of Japanese pop songs, and it never occurred to me that they would go the traditional instrumental route! How utterly gorgeous.\\n\\n\r\nWhat to say about the story and and characters? They are awesome as always. Hak's gigantic Bodyguard Crush was a bit disconcerting at first as it seemed to come out of nowhere (I remember it being more along the lines of the reader discovering it gradually), but he is hilarious otherwise. Yona's Heroic BSOD could have been a little clearer, but she is becoming as badass a princess as one could hope for.\\n\\n\r\nOverall a good anime. Unfortunately I'm still a bigger fan of the manga, but it was a great addition and I'm satisfied.",

            "content": "Lion Tamers Rejoice!\r\nI have found a good one. \"Akatsuki no Yona\", a 24-episode masterpiece, with a flair for political entanglements, and the stress of personal loss; makes for a great watch in almost every category.\r\nFirst I wish to make some comments about this show, in the historical sense. While this anime, like many; places itself in an alternate universe, it still manages to stay fairly accurate to Feudal China. I find this quirk, very interesting in the light that the entire production is mainly Japanese origin.\r\nAfter all, all the weapons used are Chinese (straight swords versus the curve Katana Blade, etc), and the costumes mightfool people, but most are truly Chinese. We see that mostly in the male apparel, but even the female dress is mostly Chinese.\\n\\n\r\nWhile I wanted to take points off for the very poor habit of Japanese artists drawing people who are supposed to be oriental, with almost entirely caucasian features; in the end I gave it a break, because in the end (like most anime I watch) story is everything.\\n\\n\r\nStory\\n\r\n-----\\n\r\nThe story is spectacular, and while I wish I had time do a long summary of it; I think I will just mention a few items that grabbed my interest, in the vein of waiting impatiently for Season-2!\\n\\n\r\nThis story is of emotional loss, love unrequited, peace and the search for it, war and the difficulty of avoiding it, fear of friends, fear of enemies, class struggles, political usurpation; but most of all 'Akatsuki no Yona' is about finding a reason to believe in the future, when the past has destroyed what was intended. Including our faith in basic goodness, and in the trust we have in relatives.\\n\\n\r\nWow, what a story. While on the surface, \"Akatsuki no Yona' is a \"I need to find an army\" style struggle; in the interior is a struggle to relegate incongruities of one relative versus the same things from another.\\n\\n\r\nFor example, Yona watches while the person she most loves and admires (Su-Won) takes a sword to her father (Il, the emperor of her country), while this same individual points out that her father murdered his. This point is only mentioned once, but it is the reason for most of the tension in Yona's mind; as she travels as a refugee, and if found will probably be murdered or worse; forced to support the new regime, to give it legitimacy.\\n\\n\r\nThe other side of the coin is, Su-Won becomes King and is seen as a worthy successor by almost everyone. Even begrudgingly, Yona. The man actually seems to know what he is doing, trying to clean up the corrupt parts of the kingdoms' administration, keep good leaders in place, build up resistance to neighboring kingdoms which have designs on conquest.\\n\\n\r\nAnd a third side, Yona travels through the kingdom, only to find that her father is almost universally disliked by almost everyone. And for pretty good reasons. A moral and ethical weakling, Emperor Il has apparently allowed virtually every corrupt administrator to run hog-wild, the damage to the public incalculable; many injured physically, mentally, and financially. Some of these even stooping to create a slave-trade from places that are supposed to be lawfully run entities.\\n\\n\r\nIn such cases, we see what some people would call \"color of law\", without actually having any. The parallels in comparison to our own world is obvious.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters\\n\r\n---------\\n\r\nYona is so well developed, starting as a scatter-brained idiot, to an evolution of personality bordering on heroic; she is designed with intelligence by the authors, and evolved subtly and with great charm. There is even the notions that she forces herself to improve, even within the context of the interest of her friends to keep the more gruesome parts of true-life and conflict from her.\\n\\n\r\nThe conflicts within her, dealing with her obvious misgivings surrounding Su-Won; are nothing less than tragic horror. How does she relegate her hatred for her fathers murderer, while also knowing that Su-Won acted in both revenge and statesmanship.\\n\\n\r\nHak, is a tragic character all by himself. He keeps a promise to protect Yona (no matter what), even though he gave his word to a man who is now dead by the hand of his friend and rival for Yona's attention, Su-Won. Hating Su-Won, not knowing as much as Yona does about everything, fighting to preserve the last vestige of the old order; Yona. While trying not to think about how much he loves this tiny red-haired beauty.\\n\\n\r\nAll the rest of the characters are either secondary characters, or tools of Yona's choosing (I don't mean this in a bad way).\\n\\n\r\nSound & Music\\n\r\n-------------\\n\r\nAll the Japanese voices are outstanding. Understanding their characters on screen, emoting relative to each scene with easy grace, interacting via the dialog with correct timing and pacing. Excellent in almost every way.\\n\\n\r\nThe music is something to rejoice, at least the soundtrack. OP1 and ED2 are excellent. The OP2 and ED1 are not relevant to the anime, and are an attempt to interject a more modern and therefore rhythmic musicality, to a production that is otherwise near perfection. Sorry about this but the latter half of the anime has non-relevant thematic music. Damages an otherwise outstanding production.\\n\\n\r\nArtwork\\n\r\n--------\\n\r\nNothing less than stunning. As good as period-piece anime ever get. Artwork is drawn with a clear intent to help move the story, and indicate nuances to the viewer that otherwise might be missed in all the dialog. This a good anime, drawn well.\\n\\n\r\nIs it as 3d as Unbreakable Machine Doll, or Girls-Und-Panzer? No, but it's subtle coloring and paint-ins, are excellent, and gives it a period look that is hard to put your finger on, but relevant just the same.\\n\\n\r\nI want to make a point about female artwork in anime. There are times when I begin to tire of girls being drawn with great big eyes. Believe me folks, a story can help me overlook this point very quickly. If the story is good, and the artist wants me to see a girl with very large eyes, as an attempt to show youthfulness, or apparent simplicity, then this becomes an artistic decision. And I can overlook it. But when there is too much of it, and it has little to do with story-content, then I cringe. This is not one of those times. Yona is drawn cute, very pretty, a bit simple-minded in the beginning, and with big eyes which tend to stare right through your face and see the working of the inner mind. She shares this gift with her friends, and all see its value.\\n\\n\r\nSo do I. So no subtraction, in this case, because she is drawn almost oriental-big-eye. I have no criticism in this case. She is true to the character, and therefore the big-eye look actually has a constructive meaning for the story.\\n\\n\\n\r\nWith that I end my review of Akatsuki no Yona. It is an unfinished work, as it is the first part of a story I wish to see the end of. Season-2 is in production, and my wish is that it will continue an excellent first season.\\n\\n\r\nSo hooray for Akatsuki no Yona, a first class introduction for a much larger story. I give this effort a solid 9!\\n\\n",

            "content": "Betrayal. That\u2019s a word I\u2019m sure that evoke a lot of feelings. In these days, betrayal is a word that destroys friends, alliances, and in worst cases, relationships. For a young girl named Yona, she personally finds out the meaning of that word. Make no mistake. Akatsuki no Yona (Yona of the Dawn) doesn\u2019t just revolve around the betrayal of someone (Soo-Won) that is close to Yona. It also chronicles the journey of this girl and the timeless efforts she goes to recreate the life she once had lost; figuratively speaking of course.\r\nAkatsuki no Yona (Yona of the Dawn) adapts the manga of the samename. The setting takes place in a fictional world with some fantasy elements and a lot of emotions. One of the more interesting facts is that the show is actually a 2 cour running consecutively for 24 episodes. For a shoujo title of recent years, that\u2019s a major plus. It gives more time to flesh out the story, characters, themes, and whatever mission it\u2019s on to adapt a proper show. Just be aware that certain characters may be introduced later than expected and not everything will end the way you may expect them to be. Even as a 2 cour show, it\u2019s hard to adapt a manga that runs over 100+ chapters and still ongoing.\\n\\n\r\nThe first few episodes establishes the premise quite well. In fact, the pilot episode (more specifically the second half of it) really marks its turning point when we find out Soo-Won\u2019s dark ambitions. What really stands out about him is the words he says. While he seems to be playing a fa\u00e7ade at first, and then turning 180 degrees into a monster, there\u2019s also a bit of confusion at what he truly wants. It\u2019s during the tense moments that viewers may find his intentions to be conflicting since he wants to kill Yona for discovering his motives but also a part of him does not. The flashback transitions are fairly well done to set up the way things are played out here. This is because Yona\u2019s bodyguard, Hak (whom shares a history with Soo-Won) comes to her recuse at a timely manner. It\u2019s easy to guess what happens next as battles ensures. Nonetheless, the show painfully stabs Yona in the heart as it gives the audience a glance at her reaction. Yona\u2019s betrayal as a character here is a feat and portrait of a girl who realizes that she lost almost everything. Now luckily, the show makes its come back with the journey that Yona undertakes and that\u2019s where it truly shines.\\n\\n\r\nDuring their journey, the show makes it clear that Yona and Hak\u2019s lives are in danger. Not only are pursued by Soo-Won\u2019s lackeys in a cat-and-mouse like game but also the pure essence of Mother nature and her new circumstances takes a toll on Yona. It doesn\u2019t take long for the series to unfold and begin to give development for Yona. This is especially evident in one of the early moments when she realizes the reality of her changed life. From there, Yona also accepts her new life and realizes how she must make up for her loss. To say the last, the show crafts her development in a profound way. From cutting her famous scarlet hair to learning how to use a bow, the show makes her less and less of a damsel in distress and more so as an independent heroine. It\u2019s what sets this show a bit different than most shoujo as romance is not its main focus. Still, romance does exist although less emphasized as you may think. Character relationships becomes a pivotal focus though especially with her body guard Hak. In fact, it\u2019s really interesting to see his interactions with Yona. There\u2019s a peculiar connection between the two as they seem to be annoyed at each other yet deep down is willing to risk their lives to protect each other. This is clearly illustrated by Hak\u2019s actions where he sometimes takes reckless risks with consequences. Also an important part about Hak is that his actions is a stark contrast to Soo-Won. Hak is a man of loyalty to both Yona and her father. Soo-Won on the other hand betrays all of three of them in pursue for his twisted goals. It stands out to make the show realize how different the two main leads are and how actions can speak so much louder than words.\\n\\n\r\nAnother success the show achieves is a fairly well balanced characterization. Yona and Hak aren\u2019t the only characters that takes every spotlight during their journey. In fact, they meet both foes and allies from their world. It also brings diversity into the mix as the show is intelligent enough to introduce other clans, kingdoms, and even races. The allies that joins them has a wide degree of personalities whether it\u2019s the apprentice Yun or White Dragon descendent Ki-Ja. What stands out about most of these characters is that the show makes time to give their backgrounds with effective use of flashbacks. It also makes it clear at what they want during their journey as they don\u2019t just join without a purpose. Furthermore, they also play pivotal roles in developing Yona. For instance, Yona learns more about the origins of survival from Yun while we also see her selfless side during her conversation with Shin-Ah. This sharply contrasts with her early introduction when she seems to act like a brat during her sweet 16 birthday. It\u2019s more and more that each episode turns Yona into a mature woman during their journey.\\n\\n\r\nEven with all this is going on, the show still has time to make room for comedy. Every episode has some of it that expresses a lighthearted mood of the show. It\u2019s a message that gives the audience an ease and breath of fresh air to craft a lighter side of the story when characters makes jokes. Although some of these jokes can feel cheesy, they are effectively timed without distracting the viewers too much. What\u2019s more is how every episode also fleshes out each of our characters with the dialogues. Not only do they portray their personalities effectively but also their relationships improves the tone of the show. Themes are also accurately delivered with human emotions. It\u2019s through the flashbacks of the past to transitions with events in the present that really carry out this creative story.\\n\\n\r\nNow, Akatsuki no Yona is far from perfect. Perhaps this show might not be something you\u2019re used to or the first few episodes might take some patience to get through. Take a closer glance, it\u2019s also easy to label Yona as an annoying brat from the beginning. Her words and actions are like a spoiled princess and while she isn\u2019t entirely selfish, her behavior is still immature. The first impressions of her character could sway some viewers into pursuing the show further. Additionally, some of the romance feels flat. The endless teasing between Hak and Yona seems to go nowhere on many occasions. Furthermore, the pacing can feel quite dragged sometimes in terms of flashbacks and plot progression. There are also occasional times when the show seems to try a bit too hard on the comedy which comes out in an unfashionable way.\\n\\n\r\nOn the visual front, Akatsuki no Yona is beautiful. The show\u2019s vivid landscapes illustrates the fantasy realm that is fitting for the setting. Character designs are also well crafted ranging from Yona\u2019s scarlet hair to Hak\u2019s fierce eyes. The show could also be quite a treat for the ladies since most of the guys has a bishonen-like design. Action on most parts is coordinated well with concise timing on the fierceness and brutality. There\u2019s little censorship when it comes to blood so those dreadful black bars, circles, or whatever shapes are no worries. The show also has almost no fan service except some scenes early on that can be easily forgettable. Not bad Pierrot and I do have to say that their effort in this should be called out for some praise.\\n\\n\r\nSimilarly, soundtrack is also pleasant and fitting throughout the entire show. OST is played to depict each scene with concise detail whether it\u2019s emotional, climatic, or tension. The first OP song is noticeable for its lack of lyrics but has a fantasy vibration that is hard to deny. The second OP song shows Yona\u2019s change and seemingly a bit of foreshadowing of one of the later arcs. For most parts, I find most of the character voices to fit quite well. Soo-Won gets some praise especially for his manipulative personality as his voice can contrast sharply in tone to hide his true self. Yona\u2019s voice also deserves some attention throughout the show as she matures from a spoiled brat to a mature woman. Her voice is just one symbol of her growth and I think the VA nailed her role quite well. \\n\\n\r\nThis show is about a journey. For fans of fantasy/shoujo, it takes it to new levels with characterization especially with our redhead princess, Yona. A powerful effort with skillful timing and development is required to flesh out her character and I am pleased to say that the show did just that. We see this journey unfold as our characters fight and challenge themselves to limits like never before. It reminds us that hardship can fall on anyone from wherever you come from. The show\u2019s craftsmanship with its technical features of both artwork and soundtrack are also outstanding. For such an adaptation, Akatsuki no Yona is an accomplishment of what a fantasy shoujo should be.\\n",

            "content": "This is my first review so I hope I can convince some people and give a reasonable, accurate review on this anime. Lets jump right in. (Contains a spoiler of the first episode)\r\nStory: The story is about three childhood friends who have grown up. One, a young princess named Yona. Second, a young man who later becomes the bodyguard of Yona and a general in the army, Hak, and a handsome man named Su-won who Yona is madly in love with. Yona has arguments with her father, the king, about Su-won and her desire to marry him, but her father rejects the idea while Hakencourages it. On the night of her sixteenth birthday, she goes to her father to try and convince him one more time to let her marry su-won, she finds that her father had been assassinated, and the only one in the room other than her and her now dead father, was her lover, su-won. Now on the run, Hak and Yona must escape the forces of her old kingdom and find a way to take down their former childhood friend.\\n\\n\r\nArt: The art is typical for an anime but it still is pretty good. In a way, it kind of stands out when it comes to the character's design and it's creative.\\n\\n\r\nSound: The background noise is absolutely great. The music and sound effects are spot on and set the mood perfectly.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: The characters, Yona, Hak, Su-won and some other side characters introduce themselves perfectly and you will get an attachment and understanding to them just fine. Yona is a fragile, spoiled girl at first but she blooms into a fierce, proud young woman later on. Hak is a strong willed warrior who will do anything to protect the princess. Su-won was a cheerful, bright kind of guy to be around. He was always smiling and gave people comfort just being around them, he soon becomes the opposite of that later on.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: This is a pretty enjoyable anime. It has its serious moments but also has incredible humor mixed in to lighten the mood most times. This is a great anime for those into drama/action/adventure. It's still unsure how many episodes this show will have, but lets hope for those who enjoy it (including myself) it doesn't end anytime soon.\\n\\n",

            "content": "WOW. This anime just BLEW my expectations out of the water. Writing this review doesn't give it justice...if you are wondering whether or not it is worth to watch this anime, trust me. IT IS. So go now. \r\nStory 9.58/10\r\nSo supposedly this is a \"Reverse harem\" anime. But I didn't quite see it as that...in fact, I saw it as so much more. This anime goes far beyond any average romance anime. It has truly deep moments of sadness, hilarious moments of comedy, beautiful romance (between the two characters that I think are actually going to get together), it has GREAT action and actually hasa pretty dark undertone to it for being a \"Romance\" anime. The story itself was quite intriguing. I actually finished this anime in a day and a half because the story is THAT compelling. At times, it CAN be a bit slow which is the reason for the deduction of points, but again for the genre that it is in, it kept me on the edge of my seat. Because not only is this a romance anime, but it is a romance anime with PLOT. Honestly, the \"reverse harem\" or romance portion of the anime isn't the main focus, it's the plot, the romance comes second which is what makes this anime so successful. \\n\\n\r\nArt 10/10\\n\r\nAbsolutely stunning visuals. I don't like it when animes go over the top with extra ordinary hair styles and hair colors but I think that the balance this anime had with the character looks was great. The styles seemed realistic for an anime of that time period and for the style that it was in. The backgrounds where quite stunning and the action sequences, especially the ones where they go in slow motion are great. The animation is also extremely great in capturing the raw emotion the characters are goign through, especially Yona. They really capture the fear, sorrow, and sadness in the eyes when necessary which I really appreciate. Plus, i'm absolutely in love with Hak. \\n\\n\r\nSound 8.52/10\\n\r\nThis is one of the few anime's in which I actually enjoy both of the OP's. It changed in the middle, which I actually wasn't expecting, but I did like it. The first one was without any lyrics which I didn't like at first but after watching with the story it fit. However the second one is a complete opopsite to the first. It starts out a little almost like dubstep (but it gets so much better) I wondered why they would do that and I think I understand. The second OP I feel relates to Yona maturing as a human and a warrior...the OP is tougher just like Yona. The songs during the show where nice but I just thought that they were odly placed in my opinion, however it wasn't too distracting. \\n\\n\r\n*SLIGHT SPOILERS*\\n\r\nCharacter 11/10\\n\r\nFor me this is the best part of the whole anime. The characters. Hak and Yona are probably two of my favorite male and female characters in ALL of anime. First let us start off with Yona. She is a naiive princess who has never been outside the castle and is foolishly in love with Soo - won. Next she WITNESSES her love of 16 years killing her dad and is then she narrowly escapes being murdered. She is in absolute shock and cannot do anything on her own. However in her travels she see's the flaws in her dads ruling, see's how Hak is barely keeping her alive and hidden and decides to do something about it. She doesn't stay the damsel in distress, heck she seems to hate it. She wants to be reliable, to be a fighter, and to help her kingdom in ways her dad couldn't. Her character development is absolutely phenomenal and I really enjoyed seeing it. Next is Hak. Hak is already a warrior and reliable but he also progresses as Yona does - he grows stronger as she does. He gets inspired by her and I he is definitely driven by her. Now lets talk about his obvious love for Yona. He has loved her since they were kids BUT BECAUSE YONA WAS SO IN LOVE WITH SOO - WON HE SUPPRESSED THOSE FEELINGS AND TRIED TO SUPPORT HER AS MUCH AS HE COULD. But it doesn't stop there, while they were on their own COUNTLESS times he would surpress himself from showing Yona his true feelings because this isn't the time. That is a great male character. As for the rest of the characters I'm not going to go into too much detail but all of them were very well developed. Usually in \"Reverse harems\" there are characters I don't care for but I truly cared for all of these. Some of them had very tragic backstories that shaped them into the persons that they are today and they all are very enjoyable to watch. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyement 10/10\\n\r\nThis anime was phenomenal. I fell in love. During the first episode I was thinking, idk if i can watch this but as soon as Soo won betrayed Yona I was hooked. I immediately wanted to know what happened next and again, finished this in less than 2 days. I loved it. I cannot give the show enough credit just by talking about it just PLEASE do me a favor an dwatch it. It will be worth your while. I believe there is goign to be a second season, just the way things where left it seems VERY possible but until then I'll be reading the manga because I cannot wait to see what's next.",

Yet anime like Full Metal Alchemist have done it better beyond comparison but do we need a revenge story, dragon binging and some cringe-worthy comedy and not be mediocrity play? Not really recommended.\r\nYou guessed it: 80% of these characters are often defined by two dimensions but mostly consisting of boy scouts with an additional trait that makes them \u201cslightly\u201d shine towards the others. Exclude the 80% and that antagonists that caused that anarchy are simply pseudo one dimensional douche bags becausepeople like the fire clan leader take their job seriously; yet we still need to at least have one, one male psycho for a lousy excuse to fear the damn audience \u2013 and oh I am flipping screaming!\\n\\n\r\nThen how is there nothing wrong with this show? It makes sense how Yona is fuelled for this epic quest, it makes sense on why the medic wants to join the party (though a bit cheesy with being book obssesed) it makes sense why the main antagonist wanted kingship and yet it becomes mediocre drama that no one cares about, with the most amazing example with the four ranger dragons boasting at how sad their past was until they meet Miss.Read-Head.\\n\\n\r\nConsequently not a complete time killer, yet it is no Uro trainwreck intellectually stupid pretentious pile of gold! Its a decent watch for a decent adventure story. Though I must admit those comedy scene were \u201cSO\u201d funny! Those random moments of Chibi moments was kind of face palm worthy...\\n\\n\r\nWhat the hell is there else to say?!

            "content": "\"Yes, King Il. Nobody has said that the princess' hair is strange. But if I may be so bold to say, there is definitely something wrong with her head.\"\r\n- Hak, Akatsuki no Yona\r\nAfter considering at length how best to begin reviewing Akatsuki no Yona (Yona of the Dawn), I decided to quote the series squirrel mascot: \"PUK KYUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU~!\"\r\nI WILL explain the squirrel hilarity behind \"puk kyu\", but first of all: What - beyond untranslated Japanese - is Akatsuki no Yona? \r\nThe answer is a period piece with a HEAVY ancient China / Korea influence, set in the fictional kingdom of Kouka--a nation held together bythe fragile alliances of tribes rather creatively named after each element... which, of course, is surrounded by threatening nations that could invade. Half a war epic with a princess-to-zero-to-hero narrative driven by betrayal; half a spazzy comedy involving the single greatest squirrel character in the history of squirrels. It also has a fantasy aspect involving reincarnating dragons-in-human-forms and shares striking similarities (the same composer, even!) with another of Studio Pierrot's anime, 'The Twelve Kingdoms', which any discerning viewer with an affection for medieval-fantasy and/or red-haired heroines should go watch. Right now.\\n\\n\r\nAkatsuki's titular heroine, Yona, begins the series as the sort of empty-headed pampered princess that you/I have to repress the desire to want to slap repeatedly. Initially, she cares more about her hair and love than... well, anything. But - OPENING EPISODE SPOILERS ahoy - by the end of the first episode, she is forced to confront reality for the first time when her childhood friend and the prettyboyman that she loves, Su-won, kills her father in cold-blood before her very eyes during a coup-d'etat. What follows is a shell-shocked Yona escaping death herself only because Hak - another of Yona's childhood friends and her bodyguard - stays loyal and protects her. From then onwards, the series becomes a journey, both in terms of traversing the nation (thankfully, with the 'A-to-B' cut!) and for Yona as a character.\\n\r\nBy the end of Yona's anime wanderings, there is a moment where she is in danger. The Yona from the beginning of the show would have lacked mental strength, but after all she has experienced and suffered though, her intimidating glare drove home the point: she has been irreversibly changed and will no longer be an ignorant passenger in her own life. The arrow she later shoots without hesitation only confirmed what I already knew:  by the end of the story, she will be a true queen and leader. Aided by the squirrel that has happily made its new home on her shoulder, Yona's path is set. \\n\\n\r\nMANY males were no doubt put off by the reverse harem stigma the series unfortunately has (and many more reading his will be put off by my CUTE SQUIRREL obsession). This is because the focus of the series eventually becomes a quest to find four very shoujo-convenient male reincarnating dragon warriors that serve Yona's bloodline, as she attempts to survive and get justice against Su-won. But the 'harem' does not even fully form until the end of the series, and nearly half of the series simply has Yona with only Hak as her protector. This is not the sort of series that throws ten hairless pretty 'male' suitors at viewers from the get-go. Not at all. What is more, it is tasteful... aside from Hak deciding he likes fingers with honey on them and invading Yona's personal space occasionally, and only Hak/Su-won are treated as potential love interests. \\n\\n\r\nMost people will be disappointed to learn that the future tease at the very beginning will have to wait for a second season, with the first season serving as a foundation for what SHOULD follow. On the plus side, Yona's growth into a mentally stronger, more independent heroine is handled so convincingly that I think a lot of people will come away satisfied... providing there is a sequel. Maybe.\\n\\n\r\n~Squirrel & Tone~\\n\\n\r\nEvery great story has at least one defining moment people's minds will automatically drift towards, even years after watching. In Akatsuki's case, most people would - naturally - single out its first episode: the coup-d'etat betrayal that set the series on its spoiled-princess-to-ruler path. Others would mention the sixth episode's spear swinging sakuga, which highlighted that the series is not just a consistently pretty face devoid of animation, whilst also making clear Yona is not a heroine destined to remain as a mere damsel-in-distress. But my brain may very well be wired differently, for what I will always, ALWAYS remember is the series squirrel mascot waving on Yona's shoulder as it said the now immortal words: \"Puk Kyuuuuu~!\".\\n\\n\r\nIf I could, I would review the squirrel. Just the attention it receives doing its own, usually silly thing in the background speaks volumes about the effort put into the show. Whenever it was not busy distracting me by getting its head stuck in a honey jar as a rare romantic moment was occurring (or, jumping out of Yona's hood after a fall as if to say \"I AM OK/BACK!\"... with a FISH in its mouth), it was - as if responding to the characters - sharing its own thoughts with some choice 'animal-talk' words. \\n\r\nThere I was, lying with a full glass of orange on my bed as you do, when the squirrel started saying \"puk kyu\" as the other characters were talking to each other, and it suddenly hit me that in English it sounds VERY MUCH like the cutest creature you will ever see or hear - complete with a permanently silly, smiling/blushing face - is telling the other characters 'f*** you'. No, really! As if that was the squirrel's contribution to the conversation and its viewpoint. This made me giggle like a school girl uncontrollably and knock the drink all over myself/my bed. If you doubt me, I want you to try to visualise this in your head: there you have the cast discussing serious matters of life and death, then the screen switches to the squirrel's face, as it almost quizzically asks 'puk kyu?'. The moment I saw the squirrel pointing spastically, with daftest face you will ever see, in-sync with its master in the end credits, I knew it was wuv. It took twelve episodes for the damned thing to actually appear in the series proper (every episode I would internally ask myself, \"WHER SQUIRREL!?\"), but once it did, it did not disappoint. But even I was not prepared for the barrage of squirrel random daftness the series had in-store. So, ye' be warned: do not drink and watch! Lesson learned. \\n\\n\r\nNow, as well as questioning my undoubted manliness (and sanity), you might be somewhat curious why I am going on about a squirrel, instead of actually reviewing the series. Well, there is a reason beyond squirrel moe: the tone of the series overall and how the squirrel silliness reflects the combination of depressing subject matter and the \"romantic-panic\" style humour that the author manages to combine with it. When Akatsuki first started airing, it had an average of 7.40. Even I was not terribly excited about it. But with each episode, the average has steadily increased each week. And I think the reason for this is, quite simply, that people were initially unsure what to make of it. The series begins with spazzy humour, with a hint of seriousness, then ends with blood and death. One minute, happy thoughts. The next, hopeless despair. Most people would be put off by this contrast and prefer something more... grim overall. \\n\\n\r\nHOWEVER, the series - and author's - greatest strength is making a story of betrayal and exile into one with a 'feel good' vibe. The oriental-themed instrumental soundtrack does a superb job of adding an epic scope and retaining narrative focus, whilst the humour breaks up what would otherwise be a despairing trudge through a land in political turmoil. I was able to enjoy seeing the Yona's growth as Hak teased her in a manner a sarcastic git such as myself approves of, rather than be weighed down by doom & gloom. And the combination defies common sense by working surprisingly well... once I adjusted to it. It is not as if all of the humour is of typical anime 'freak out' variety, either: my favourite parts being Hak's sarcastic deadpan comments and the dry bits; such as when a character asked someone what will happen if they are not who the other person thinks they are, followed by silence and the other character continuing as if the question had not been asked. Comedy is ALL about timing, and Akatsuki Yona nails that. Mostly.\\n\\n\r\n~Charcterisation~\\n\\n\r\nAkatsuki Yona's positives are not just limited to comic timing and squirrels: the characterisation, which I am happy to report is largely free of the internal monologue NO anime has made me come to hate of late, is a major plus. But, first, I feel a need to point out that A HUUUGE chunk of my affection for the series stems from how similar it is to two entries in the forever loved/unknown video game series, Suikoden. It takes the 'best friends become enemies in a medieval war' plot of Suikoden II, blends that with the 'parents murdered; prince on the run' plot from Suikoden V and also gives a nod towards the main theme of Suikoden: warriors gathering under the one with the power to rule/conquer as decreed by fate. And I can not deny that these links to one of very few things in existence I could be described as fanboy over makes me a tad bias, no matter how critical I am. But there is no denying that Akatsuki's characterisation is very, very good where it matters. \\n\\n\r\nInstead of a pantomime villain that cackles as he murders in order to gain power, Su-won actually wants to make the nation stronger and did what he did for what he perceives to be the greater good. The previous king was opposed to violence/killing and considered a coward, and the neighbouring countries were becoming an increasing threat whilst he did nothing. On the flip-side, the previous king was a good man and loving father, and Yona can not help but feel nothing but hatred for the man she once - and may still - love. Neither of them are truly wrong and both have valid justification for their actions, and that 'greyzone' is what makes the series so compelling and human; even with the anime humour. When the two encounter each other again, much later, I felt the skin on my face prickle as I could almost feel the emotion conveyed by Yona's cold-rage, frozen eyes. Yona can be a crybaby and Su-won's cunning can sometimes get lost behind his Griffith-esque shoujish facade of playful ignorance but, on the whole, their characters and the love/hate relationship they share kept me hooked throughout the show, even as it focused heavily on subplots.\\n\\n\r\nThe supporting cast are far more mixed, ignoring the squirrel's +10 eccentric curiosity. My favourite non-squirrel character, Hak, is always at the ready with playful sarcasm - usually directed at Yona - and fulfills his role as the sarcastic love interest with a heart of gold/silver. His loyalty to Yona as her protector may be a little... shoujo but I do like how he balances his - at this point - one-sided affection for Yona with his role as her bodyguard. The reincarnated dragon warriors are more hit and miss. The author tried to make each one unique, with their own ability and quirk, yet ended up making them a tad stereotypical as a consequence. Ki-ja is the naive, simple-minded hot-head with a claw-arm ability; Shin-ah is the silent masked squirrel master with an eye ability; Jae-ha is the playboy with a kicking ability and, finally, Zeno is introduced in the very last episode in a comical '...after all that searching for the other three, the last finds us straight away?' kind of way. His quirk is eating lots of food and playing the fool in spite of being sharp. Zeno aside, they all receive decent development time - most of the series is, after all, dedicated to finding and recruiting them - but only maybe Jae-ha has a personality worth remembering. \\n\\n\r\nWhat the series did manage to convey well was the difference in circumstance between each of the dragon warriors. where as Ki-ja had a clan formed around himself that worshiped each reincarnation, Shin-ah was treated like a monster by his people and hidden away. I would go as far as to say Shin-ah's unhappy back-story convinced me the series was not going to turn into an artificial shoujo happy place that would make me want to punch myself in the face repeatedly. And Jae-ha's reluctance to have his will dictated by fate and serve someone he did not know impressed... even if the outcome was inevitable. The problem is, it is their roles in the story rather the characters themselves that stand out. They are no more than props with superpowers, at this point. There is another character that joins Yona's 'man-harem' - a ladyboy healer called Yun - but there is little to say about him beyond he looks like a girl and cross-dresses as one, later. Along with the squirrel. Seriously. \\n\\n\r\n~Pacing & Progression~\\n\\n\r\nWhere Akatsuki Yona does sadly fall short is its story... or, more specifically, the pacing of its story. Years ago, I tried reading the manga, and with few chapters translated at the time it just did not grab me beyond the opening shock-twist. Possibly because I was unaware of the squirrel. The lulls between events eventually lead to me marathoning episodes, instead of watching as they aired; in spite of the series being one of the best I have seen in recent years. And this will no doubt be one of the main negatives people view the series as having.  The premise is definitely intriguing but, in 24 episodes, not a whole lot happens. Yona escapes, hides, escapes again, starts her quest searching for dragon warriors, finds them... the end. Sandwiched in-between is a mini-arc for Su-won that explores his character and the setting a little, which was most welcome, but that is basically it. Certainly not as eventful as one would expect after watching the first episode.\\n\\n\r\nOn the surface the story, though compelling, is a fairly plain one, and this is not helped by the complete focus on Yona's characterisation over fleshing out the world and plot progression. For someone like me that values characterisation above all else, it is not something that irks me THAT much, but for others it will be an issue. The few glimpses into the world come from Yona's gradual realisation that her father, whilst a good man, was a weak ruler... but these are handled poorly towards the end. For instance, a corrupt governor is SO corrupt that he openly abuses his people and literally drops beautiful women through trapped doors (safe, that) to sell them as sex slaves. It was great for Yona's character to grow through this encounter but it just felt very one-dimensional and forced; painting the setting as an unrealistic one for the sake of giving her character a straightforward good>evil path. The bad guy was such a bad guy he NEEDED to state how he enjoys women when they are obedient, and other cliched villain arsehole dialogue. And then you throw in pirates that refuse to kill / shouojism and it hurts my head/immersion/makes me want to punch myself. A throwaway plot device villain just does not satisfy when the main plot has yet to inch forward.\\n\\n\r\nAs fond as I am of the series, I am cautious as far as my long-term affection goes. As an example of my concerns, at the start Hak was freely slicing - with blood flying - and presumably killing those trying to kill Yona. But as the series progressed, unless a character is so... one-dimensional evil that there is no recourse but to kill them, the characters seem to have taken on an unrealistically pacifistic approach, simply because the dragon warriors are powerful. Which makes little sense in the context of, say, the corrupt governor mentioned above: the people working for him were aware they were involved in human trafficking and doing generally bad things. Yet they got a free pass. I hope I am wrong but I am getting a shoujoish vibe from that aspect, and the author has previous: in NG Life, the lead was once a gladiator - of all things in the universe - that refused to kill. I frowned. I rated it 10/10 anyway but I most certainly frowned. \\n\\n\r\n~Visuals & Audio~\\n\\n\r\nWhat makes up for the story failings is the presentation. The easiest way to judge the budget a show has - assuming it does not have movie animation - is episode-to-episode art consistency. And Akatsuki Yona is consistently beautiful. When you are told Yona's hair is beautiful, you believe it because of the way the scene uses colour / the dawn theme. And when you see the almost reflective gem-like detail Yona's purple eyes have, there is no doubt she is beautiful enough for Hak to risk his life protecting her. There is also the attention to detail: the almost super-deformed, dot-eyed comedy skits and, in some cases, things like a JRPG 'lost in dungeon' parody. Those in charge of the anime were clearly aware the humour is the series' greatest strength, and they did everything they could to enhance it visually as it made the journey from page to screen, whether by having the squirrel doing silly things such as swinging on/attempting to eat earrings in the background or just general creative stylisation. But what truly sold me on the series visually was the wonderful usage of colour. It can look unimpressive when everything is bright, but when there is a contrast during dark scenes - probably intentionally due to the dawn theme - it impresses. What does disappointment me slightly is how the manga art was made to look slightly more... generic shoujo. The author created my favourite manga, so I know her art well, and she draws with a distinctive pointy-chin style, and very SHARP eyes. Yona looks far plainer in the anime, aside from in a few pivotal scenes towards the end. \\n\\n\r\nThe true 'WOW' moment of the show is episode six's sakuga animation. Seeing Hak swing his spear so freely, in such a desperate situation, after previously only seeing speed-lines and limited animation, blew me away. TV budget animation... then, all of a sudden, movie fluidity. Nothing else in the show came close to it, both in terms of the intensity of the fight and animation, but it will remain in my memory as a standout anime moment. Reminiscent of THAT outnumbered spear fight in 'Seirei no Moribito'.  \\n\\n\r\nPerhaps even more impressive than the budget attentiveness, the soundtrack is truly wonderful: capturing the emotion of every single scene whilst not being overwrought. It drives home that you are watching an Asian period piece, rather than a squirrel comedy, with every piece of its instrumental music. Hiring the composer of the more-serious-yet-very-similar 'The Twelve Kingdoms' was a very wise move indeed. The music grounds the series in its setting and carries the emotional undercurrent, whilst the humour prevents the emotionally charged tunes from becoming overbearing. Also, although I initially found Yona's Japanese voice to be annoying and... weird, after awhile it grew on me. The spoiled princess; naive sincerity; cuteness; determination; desperation... all of this is captured perfectly by her voice. One of my favourite Japanese voice acting performances, perhaps. \\n\\n\r\nIn addition, what sold the show to me in the beginning was its first opening. The visual style reminded me of Suikoden II's EPIC still-image montage, and the visuals truly came into their own once the faux-3D effect was randomly added to it as the episodes released. But far more noteworthy was the choice of music: a non-vocal background track, composed for the show. Not some edgy J-Pop theme--something that actually fit. Sadly, later on the first opening was replaced by what I can only describe as a 'GIRL POWA' track designed to appeal more to the target demographic. It was ok, and I liked that the lyrics were wrote for the show, but still somewhat alienating to males such as myself, where as the first opening can only be described as epic. My cheeks tingled with excitement every time I watched it. The two endings were less memorable, with the second fitting the show better than the first. \\n\\n\r\n~Summary~\\n\\n\r\nOverall, the series impressed me to such an extent that it made me review it semi-seriously. And for a lazy one-finger-typing sod such as myself, there can be no higher praise on this Earth. \\n\r\nThe humour transforms what would have been bland into something else entirely; especially when paired with the anime's directional focus on its comedy aspect. What could have been an adventure of misery becomes one that should put a smile on even the coldest of squirrel hating faces, whilst retaining interest in where the political intrigue will eventually - hopefully - lead to; aided by an outstanding soundtrack that fits the series and its setting like a glove. The artwork consistency and squirrel activity convinced me the production was a labour of love for the staff and I am happy that the first manga Kusanagi has had animated was adapted with such care. \\n\\n\r\nIn the author's earlier work, NG Life, she made a reincarnation tragedy about Pompeii's volcanic end into a romantic comedy that was equal parts tear-inducing and amusing. So, a medieval warfare epic that fills one's heart with warmth was a given, really. It has its flaws - chugging along pace-wise and not striking an ideal balance between death/funny - but I am just happy it is not another anime sequel that makes me want to beat my head against the nearest available wall--for that, I eagerly await season 2. But, until then, I shall use my 'squirrel wearing a dress' avatar with pride. \\n\\n\r\nI STRONGLY recommend any males reading this put their reverse harem cringe fears aside and just enjoy hearing a squirrel saying \"puk kyu\". Assume that the squirrel is not quite as happy with his travel party as its face suggests and laugh you shall. That is the path to enjoyment.",

            "content": "Akatsuki no Yona Ramble Review\r\nLike all pieces of media that we use to distract ourselves before the inevitable, there are always some genres you try to steer clear of, like you would social responsibility or German scat porn. One genre that gets this abusive treatment from me is the shoujo genre. But before we continue, the shoujo genre is kinda garbage. Hopefully my negative propensity towards the genre isn\u2019t showing. But in all seriousness, it\u2019s a genre targeted towards teenage girls. The real reason I hold such distaste to this particular genre is due to it consisting of characters that are written by people thathaven\u2019t had sex in a very long time. Meaning, the heroin is apparently so perfect and attractive that the entire male cast gets on their hands and knees and starts to fawn over her (and also the fact most of them are rom coms, but that is for a different time).\\n\\n\r\nSo when my friend through her gags and burbles of her mentally damaged brain would suggest a show for me, I would always reply with \u201cis it one of horrible shoujo anime, that whenever I try to watch it I feels like I\u2019m shitting out a hedgehog that has barbed wires instead of spines?\u201d, which would just lead to more gags and burbles as she rolls on the carpet, trying to improve her noodle impression. But I finally took pity on my poor, retarded, idiot, stupid (maybe I should stop being friends with them) friend and listened to her suggestion and began to watch Akatsuki no Yona. And I will say I was mildly surprised.\\n\\n\r\nAkastsuki no Yona is an anime about a princess Yona, who has the ability of being genetically superior to everyone because she has red hair, and she has the emperor dragons blood. But like every princess story, a great tragedy strikes. The king is killed by her crush, the original \u201cboy toy\u201d, Soo Won. So she escapes with her trusty side \u201cboy toy\u201d, Hak. These two companions have great chemistry and travel the land to collect four more \u201cboy toys\u201d( I\u2019m going to keep calling them boy toys until I get a laugh, you bastard), to build her harem and fill her empty heart. and other orifices. Opps, I mean to take back her kingdom. But these four \u201cboy toys\u201d aren\u2019t  just anyone, no no no, they are special with dragon blood running through their veins with amazing abilities, and just so happen to be a list of character tropes and fetishes for the fujoshi community to argue which would make for the best \u201chusbandu\u201d.\\n\\n\r\nThe series seems to be set in an \u201cancient\u201d China inspired kingdom. Sadly I can\u2019t be certain if it is actually china  because it is never clearly stated, probably because the producers were having a little giggle to see how many racists they can catch by calling it Chinese. But in all seriousness, this simple fact was its biggest pull for me towards the series. In the world of anime, with its overabundant high school slice of life and the countless generic light novel adaptation that gets hacked every year by the uncoordinated hands of a butcher who just stopped giving a fuck, uniqueness is a quality hard to find. So for a shoujo to not have a highschool setting certainly did make me raise an eyebrow and investigate. And regardless of what you think, that is certainly a plus. \\n\\n\r\nBut after my eyebrow reached the top my un-arguably handsome face, my senses slammed on the breaks and came back to me, which lead to the thought \u201cIs it a horrible reverse harem that is so bad it\u2019ll make my throat want to fill out divorce proceedings with my stomach as I vomit a litre of stomach acid?\" \"Um...Kinda.\"\\n\\n\r\nI\u2019ve seen many reviews on people\u2019s thoughts on Akatsuki\u2019s characters, and every god damn single one of the cum gurgling twats that praises this series all seem to say the exact same thing, \u201cThe characters are amazing with intricate back stories and amazing development through the series\u201d. This statement I whole heartedly agree to\u2026 Oh wait scratch that last part. The characters do have an interesting and unique back story, and Yona\u2019s transformation from a scared, timid princess to a strong female heroin is interesting. But as soon as the \u201cboy toys\u201d have joined the harem bandwagon, they devolve into body pillow number 6745 and just become another member of the reverse harem bullshit. This is what I hate and loath about this series and the shoujo genre as a whole. Develop apparently means a character becoming infatuated with the main heroin, until there are enough handsome men to perform their very own bukkake shoot.\\n\\n\r\n What the writer of the series should have done was throw out the love hexagon and make entire series focus on Hak and Yona, and make the rest of the cast just loyal to Yona. But that isn\u2019t going to happen because like I said in my introduction, the characters are written by people that haven\u2019t had sex since they played doctor with Uncle Tom. When I think about it, the characters as a whole, excluding best boy blonde, aren\u2019t that great either. And the other villains the company faces aren't great either. It's like the script writer binged watched a bunch of Disney movies, then she hastily began to write a villain, until I don't know an ice cream truck passed. \\n\\n\r\nTo add to that, the tone of the series swings like a convulsive Gibbon on crack. One minute the heroes will be fighting kidnappers who sell woman and children as slaves, and the next minute it'll change art style to adorable chibi characters, as they tell a joke that falls flat so hard it tunnels into the earth and burns up in its core. It\u2019s just so bad it made me want to pull my teeth out and jam them in my eye sockets so I don\u2019t see that shit ever again. Who thought that was a good idea to implement comedy with murder, other then Punch and Judy? No matter how hard you try it\u2019s like me and relationships, they just don\u2019t seem to work out.\\n\\n\r\n I have other complaints about the series such as the music, animation,the ending and Yona\u2019s sun glare, but this is already getting to long, so I\u2019m will wrap this up. As I wrote this review I realised the mountains of problems the leaked out of the shows pores, like yellow puss from a wound. And every single one them stem from the Shoujo heritage, from the reverse harem, the lack of character development of the male characters, the erratic tonal shifts, and many other complaints and nitpicks I have. But I still found the show mildly entertaining (even if it was for the wrong reasons), from the unique setting, Yona\u2019s development as a character, or just pointing out everything bad about the series. This \u201cenabled\u201d me to claw through the story, in the same way someone \u201cenables\u201d a crippling drug habit. So in conclusion, Akatsuki no Yona turned out to be a slightly above average Shoujo series that surprised me. But keep in mind, for me personally an average Shoujo is about as good as putrefied shit left on black tarmac to cook. So you can gauge my opinion of the series from there. But for a Shoujo fan sure go watch it. But for everyone else, just go watch Arslan Senki.\\n\\n\r\nScore: 4.4\\n\\n\r\n----------------------------\\n\\n\r\nThis Ramble Review was a new idea that I wanted to take a shot at to challenge myself. Hope you enjoyed.\\n\\n\r\nAnd also, I am doing a blog so head on over there for more stuff, including just my thoughts and opinions on anime related stuff.\\n\\n\r\nAnd please, any and all feedback for this review is appreciated. So shoot me a message and tell me any problems you had with the review and ways to fix it. \\n",

            "content": "Story: The point of view is mostly through the eyes of the main character Yona, but it switches to that of Hak or the four dragon warriors occasionally. \r\nI feel it was an easy story line to follow, however I believe if you have any history with watching anime, then you have seen this particular plot before (main character is a witness to a tragic event, and sets out on an adventure for vengeance and gains strength and an impressive following on the way). Sound familiar? \r\nI thought the pacing was quite well. There were moments, especially at the end, that I thought it wasa little too fast paced for my liking. There were full episodes dedicated to back stories of the dragons. I am usually not a fan of these, but they were crucial to character development and all that.\\n\r\nThere was plenty of action and fantasy in the form of sword fighting and the use of awesome supernatural powers that were foreseen through a mysterious legend of powerful beings.\\n\r\nAdventure is a given since they literally travel all over the land and encounter many new people and places along the way.\\n\r\nThe characters had pretty funny moments, especially Hak and the green dragon. The humor was sometimes dry but in all, I thought it felt genuine.\\n\r\nAs far as the romance aspect is concerned, there really was none. Yeah there was a lot of flirting going on, but there was no advancement beyond that. This was pretty disappointing to me because I was looking for a good romantic/fantasy anime, but that did not faze me that much.\\n\r\nThe ending was the main reason this series was not a 9 or even a 10 on my scale. There was no closure what so ever, just a humongous cliff hanger. It felt as if they only showed about half of the story in the short 24 episodes. Hopefully they decide to make a second season sometime in the near future.\\n\\n\r\nArt: I thought the art was very pleasant. You can tell it isn't a super new series, nor a super old one. \\n\r\nThe background looked amazing (especially the ocean and mountain scenes) My favorite was when the sun made her hair look like crimson, or when you could see the fire in her eyes, it was done quite well.\\n\r\nThe characters looked absolutely unique and differentiated quite a bit from one another. You could easily tell who it was just by looking at their shadows or silhouettes. \\n\\n\r\nSound: Honestly, I skipped all the openings, like I usually do, but from what I heard through the fighting scenes, the instrumental music was pretty well conducted and executed. You could feel the emotion, and it hyped me up for the outcome.\\n\r\nAs far as the voice acting is concerned, I watched the English dubbed version and I thought the actors were perfect for their roles, particularly Christopher Sabat as Hak :)\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Just like many series like this one, there were many inhumanely strong characters. The main character is at first perceived as weak and helpless, however she shows what is up as she gets stronger and braver. \\n\r\nYou become so familiar with every character until you can predict how each will react given a certain situation.\\n\r\nThe only side/mainish character that is not given a backstory of any kind, is the yellow dragon which comes in at the very last second, when the plot was sped way up and it ended abruptly.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: If you like fantasy anime with quite a bit of supernatural action and lots of comedic relief, I believe you will enjoy this anime alot. If you are looking for a super romantic series, this probably is not for you.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, I gave this series an 8 out of 10, so it had a couple of flaws but still pretty great nonetheless.",

We, as viewers, are given so much background information- each supporting character has a flashback or two (or a full on episode) of why they're the way they are.

            "content": "First Review, any criticism is welcome! \r\nAkatsuki no Yona, the anime that aired along the big guns such as Parasyte and Your Lie in April,Nanatsu no Tanzai,(and even to an extent Shirobako)\r\nIt's no surprise that this anime was not on the radar for many.But for those who are watching this series, it was a surprisingly enjoyable ride.\r\nStory:7\r\nSo fleeing the palace with the best friend and exploring the lands,looking for people to join the party  ,how many times have we seen that story-line?and\r\nFulfill-your-destiny-MC type of stories  are not rare either,and Akatsuki no Yona is no exception, however being cliched is not necessarily abad thing as long as it was written and done well,and Akatsuki no Yona delivers in spades.Plot was done well, dramatic moments were perfectly done in its timing and execution.Comedy was done once in awhile and sometimes it could be a hit or miss,but in the end still managed to lift the mood when its needed.\\n\\n\r\nThe main thing people like (or is totally worth cringing about to some) is that the pacing in this anime is very slow,some episodes are spent purely watching how the characters interact with each other in their journeys, and even the antagonist gets some screen time,however these episodes are essential to conversations and flashbacks that allows us to be attached to the characters.No episode is meaningless however, as even the very slow episodes bring something to the story,and the plot is driven further,and shed some light on some characters.\\n\\n\r\n I'll just say it here, the ending of Akatsuki no Yona is just the beginning of what potentially is going to be an amazing story.Hardly anything concludes, which of course will tick off some people, but I believe that with an OVA about to be aired and (hopefully) 1 or 2 sequels, the 24 episodes in the series could be just a part of an amazing series,on its own its great but not a Masterpiece.\\n\\n\r\nThese 24 episodes introduces us to the world of Akatsuki no Yona,and leaves us  wanting.\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt :7\\n\\n\r\nThe animation in the anime were decent,but not  great.Its not like the Fate series by ufotable where each strike and slash of the action scenes were animated into the finest of details. Akatsuki no Yona does just enough ,fight scenes weren't just a cloud of smoke,and blood wasn't shown in exaggeration when people are struck. In its dramatic moments though, the characters are drawn extremely well,and [minor spoilers] Yona's eyes are drawn beautifully when she is having her ''moments''.\\n\\n\r\nIn its comedic moments,the characters are drawn into their Chibi versions ,and though in my opinion may seem out of place in this anime,I got used to it as I watched more episodes.\\n\\n\r\nSceneries  in the anime were alright, done enough to depict the atmosphere and mood of situations.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound:8\\n\\n\r\nI LOVED the music and soundtracks, in particular is the first opening, at first I thought there was something wrong with the audio and went to check it out,turns out that it was a soundtrack that fits the setting of the anime perfectly, as Akatsuki no Yona was set loosely in the times of historical Korea. The same melody but different tempo and mood of the same song was also played as soundtracks in most of the emotional and sweet situations,which was a huge bonus point. \\n\\n\r\nBesides the OP and the soundtracks that were similar to it,,the romantic scenes' soundtracks  does not take away any attention from the scenes that were being played.. and complemented the scenes well.\\n\r\nYou could sense the pain the characters have to endure ,when the solemn melodies come in, and know a huge breakthrough for our characters is about to be made when the epic drums come in. Heck,most of the action scene's soundtracks were beautifully made.\\n\\n\r\nThe other ending and openings were good,but not great.Special mention to the second ending which sent me back to memory lane with its traditional Chinese (or Korean) vibes,with traditional instruments playing in the background.\\n\\n\r\nIf you love stringed instruments playing in the background , you would love it, a refresher from the usual electric guitar/bass that we always have.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:9\\n\r\nNow at the cream of the crop, Akatsuki no Yona absolutely shines  in its characters,hardly any of them are  there solely as a plot device, all of them had well made backgrounds and they're personalities weren't  forced and were understandable due to their past. the 5 members of the party that will eventually join Yona and Son Hak though are side characters are given lots of screen time (for the exception of one who only joined in very late into the series).Granted, their personalities aren't unique and could be seen at a handful of animes,but they were very well done.Each of them benefits the party in its own way.And most of them have their own unique reasons for joining Yona, be it being inspired or wanting friends,to wanting to explore the world or even out of sheer loyalty.\\n\\n\r\nSon Hak, the childhood friend and bodyguard of the MC though looked like a typical Gary Stu, is a more complex character that it seems, duty bound to protect the princess, he uses this as an excuse to be always be at her side, suppressing his own feelings.He tends to also be overprotective.However as the anime goes on you could see how he acknowledges Yona,that she has become stronger and allows her to do things that he would never allow her to do if he was still the same person as the first few episodes.He shows weakness and though have a cool exterior, can be swayed on the inside.\\n\\n\r\nSoo-Won,though I personally dislike him is a strange yet refreshing character,though without much to do after the first few episodes,the actions he take with the short screen time he was given  portrays his personality perfectly, though the anime has given him one and a half episodes  of screen time ,a sidetrack from the main story ( which is one of the negatives I find in this anime) it made me realize he wasn't just the typical bad guy who betrayed his friends, but potentially someone much more deep and complex.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOn to Yona, Yes she isn't the first female character ever to be portrayed as a determined character who wants to be stronger,there are many of her type out there.But somehow even as a male I could relate to her. Being in good care all her life, she is bound to be the useless  MC that we see in any other show,who wants to improve herself after knowing how helpless she is,\\n\r\nno surprise there.However,\\n\\n\r\nThe pain that she feels after the twist in the beginning episode was  portrayed very well, she couldn't do anything, and who could?after everything has been taken from her and thrown into the outside world,she was traumatized and couldn't have survive without her bodyguard.She didn't instantly transform into someone who could adapt and with the ''power of her friends''became strong,shes portrayed as a weak and feeble character who always needed  help.Yes she has the huge confidence that most people in anime do, however just like in real life,confidence and motivation does not necessarily deliver results. Yona is still physically weak and relies on the people around her often,even in the later episodes. the motivation for her to improve is wonderful, not unique, but very very relatable , for those of us who think of ourselves as being inferior to others,we can understand how Yona feels whenever she is helped by her bodyguard or other friends,thinking of herself as a burden to others\\n\\n\r\nEven though she has become stronger by just a little, the Yona you see at the end in episode 24 and the Yona you see in episode 1 is very very different,personality wise.You cant help but feel proud of her as you keep rooting for her through each struggle and obstacle, and by the end of the series she has grown to be a very fine person.Unlike a Mary Stu, she struggled and practiced ,and feels helpless from time to time,and she will still continue to struggle through her journey.\\n\\n\r\nAs a person who has a slight inferiority complex I could relate to Yona very well,feeling helpless when you do not want to is a very human emotion, but Yona shows us that having that emotion could be either an asset or a curse for us, depending on whether we want to struggle to improve or brood over it.\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:9\\n\\n\r\nAction, Adventure, Comedy, Fantasy, Romance, Shoujo,\\n\\n\r\n1.)Action? Decent-Good at best,  bad guys weren't that tough to beat and when you know Yona and the gang are around you know the party is going to kick butt, with the exception of maybe the last few episodes where you could see Yona really struggle.\\n\\n\r\n2.)Adventure, not too bad, being set in historical Korea and all, going around to find members of the party and fight the bad guys?not really unique, however this general,cliched storyline could still be great if portrayed well, which Akatsuki no Yona did.\\n\\n\r\n3.)Comedy, sometimes its a hit or miss but it served its purpose,doesn't really stand up except for a fair few\\n\r\n.\\n\r\n4.)Fantasy, yeah  super powers from the members of the party,and the portrayal of some prophecy/legend,pretty much.\\n\\n\r\n5.)Romance,well since the story is just getting started, development isnt complete, though it is going somewhere,those who expect a Maid-sama like ending will be disappointed.\\n\\n\r\n6.)Shoujo,  its obvious that the romance is depicted between Son Hak and Yona.And I'm sure that the manga is continuing with both of them being the official couple, and how these two come together will be an essential part of the story,but with Yona being a dense girl and all the Shoujo aspect in the 24 episodes doesn't really shine.\\n\\n\r\nWith all these mediocrity why does it still get such a high score?Its because of the characters.\\n\\n\r\nOne thing I could say about Akatsuki no Yona is that its much more than the sum of its parts, the characters make this whole show so enjoyable,especially Yona. As I watched the anime I couldn't help but be a supporter of Yona to try to improve herself , and in the end I was very satisfied with a huge grin on my face,thinking that she has done well.And as a Hak X Yona shipper I kept rooting for them and though the story has just about finished its beginning chapters by gathering all members of the party, development between the two is there.\\n\\n\r\nAkatsuki no  Yona is an anime that doesn't look as good as it seems when you take it apart one by one like in the reviews, but when you watch it, you couldn't help but feel how wonderful this anime is, it is definitely slow, no doubt about that, and the cliches are there,but after around 5 episodes ,I was engrossed into the show and despite all its flaws, love it very much.\\n\\n\r\nThough viewed by some as a reverse harem, you already know Hak and Yona has its moments and their romance is one the elements in the series.\\n\\n\r\nSurprisingly when I watched Spirited Away, I couldn't grasp the message that it wanted to portray when I finished it, and read online about how Hayao Miyazaki wanted to portray the message about the growth of a young girl into adolescence, Akatsuki no Yona reminds me of that, the struggles on how to live when everything is taken away, and the path to become stronger could be devastatingly difficult. Watching Yona grow up from episode 1-24 not in terms of age,but personally is a thrilling ride that I don't think anyone should miss.\\n\\n\r\nThough its slow, stick with it, you wont be disappointed.A very refreshing anime.Time to read the manga. \\n\\n",

            "content": "This is my first review :D\r\nFirst of all , Akatsuki no yona where have you been all this time? Where have you been HIDING dammit!\r\nSound : Im specifically starting with this , because lets face it , the soundtrack is absolutely amazing in this anime. Starting with the opening , Its only instrumental! ( How much time has it been since we  got AN INSTRUMENTAL OPENING?)and yet you don't skip it and listen to it every damn time. The second opening isnt as great but is still awesome!\r\n( seriously it gives you chills everytime there's a fight/emotional moment and the traditional music goes in).\r\nStory: Princess Yona leads a peaceful life. Her only \"worries\" is whether or not her hair colour suits her and if she's gonna be able to marry her beloved childhood friend Soo-won. Well lucky for her ! He stops by the castle for a week. However her father forbids their marriage for reasons beyond her understanding. THEN BAM! beloved Soo-Won drives a blade through the chest of the king while she runs into the room to talk to him about her marriage. Heartbroken and stripped of her status as royalty, Yona  lives as a fugitive on the run, accompanied only by one of the king's trusted shogun : Haku!.\\n\\n\r\nArt : The animation is freaking good , yona hime face expressions are really well detailed ( I mean look at those fierce gorgeous eyes man) , and the art may seem typical but its beautiful! And hey for once the main dude isnt a 100% bishounen shining armored prince like dude his eyes are more like ''dont mess with me'' type.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: The side characters ( Yona companions) are amazingly well developped ( better than any shojo I watched) , you get to see a very detailed past of some of them. ALSO CAN WE PLEASE TAKE A MOMENT for the first non-cry baby female lead since those 5 last years? Yes Yona hime is a typical princess , fragile , who only cares for nobles things and dont know how to cook her own food. HOWEVER she blooms into a strong female lead , who is aware of her weakness and wants to learn how to protect herself and save her country!. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: You know it's a good anime when you know the release date of the next episode and wait for it the whole week. You know its a good anime when you prepare food for it and set all yourself up. Akatsuki no yona combines Humour , serious-badass-moments , Mother of typical shojo moments ( which means even if its typical they are still better introduced than other animes of the same type).It's the type of anime that will give you chills in every single episode. Honestly if you are the kind of person who was desperate to find an amazing shojo with Strong female lead (like me) or just a passing-by person who never seen a shojo in her/his life , or just a curious person ! THEN DONT MISS AKATSUKI NO YONA. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "By the end of this show, you will love it, its really something worth your time. Out of many shows airing today this show is really something to look forward to each week, now it can be enjoyed in its full glory even though the show does need a second season, dammit. Akatsuki no Yona is definitly a show you won't forget.\r\nAt first, this show seems like your average run of the mill shoujo reverse harem, but by the end of the first episode as the story goes on, it seems to be more than that, its really a well written story which focuses onvengence and betrayal, it blow other shoujos away. The pacing at times when getting dragons to join may seem a little slow and does drag on here and there. Sure it does focus on finding the dragons but get to the point already, sure there may be a sidestory but can we just get these people coming in?\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are done well and are beautifully developed, Yona is pretty much one of my faviroute female characters of all time, she starts off weak and fragile like a little kitten and develops on to be something big, a brave independent creature awaiting its prey, its done in a way that developing her is spot on. If I'd rate Yona alone it would be an easy 10. Hak is Yona's first protector, being known since childhood, Hak is goddamn badass, he helps Yona and keeps her safe from danger, he'll use himself as a tool to protect her. The other dragons are pretty good characters each with their own backstories and being well developed to Yona. The problem i have here is that some of these characters might say a serious speech and then revert to comedy, at first its a good ol'joke but it keeps getting used so much that its just a pain in the ass at times. \\n\\n\r\nThe Art is pretty good for the most part, it has some well done character designs and sometimes has some well detailed characters. Same goes for sound, its great to listen, both OPs and EDs are goddamn beautiful and the OSTs fit the shows theme.\\n\\n\r\nThe show is a blast to watch, it leaves no plotholes (from my point of view) and has dialouge that seems useful. The problem is that sometimes this show is a serious adventure fantasy and then converts to a shoujo comedy and usually this transition feels unatural and ruin the tense moments. At times its pretty funny but at times, I can't even.\\n\\n\r\nStory:9\\n\r\nArt:8\\n\r\nSound:8.5\\n\r\nCharacter:9\\n\r\nEnjoyment:9.5\\n\\n\r\nAkatsuki no Yona is a goddamn pleasure to watch and I'm glad I didn't ignore it. At first the plot sounds generic, but give the show a chance and you'll experience some of the most well done developements in anime in years. This show deserves a Season 2, hell it needs ne. And this all comes from Studio Pierret... how about putting this effort in Tokyo Ghoul? But besides jokes, you should seriously start watching Akatsuki no Yona right now.\\n\\n",

            "content": "At some point in the show, Yona mentioned something about escaping from her bubble of a spoiled princess, learning about the difficulties of life and such. Ironically, this show never managed to escape from its bubble of a shoujo-pandering, unbearably sappy, politically shallow, purposeless mess of tropes and forced superficial development. \r\nBeware of spoilers used as discussion points\r\nFeaturing a middle ages Korea kingdom apparently in turmoil; Yona stars as a completely clueless princess with already 2 incredibly hot young men who can\u2019t resist to \u201cprotect\u201d her. A coup occurred, for reasons still unclear after 24 episodes, killing the king and forcing Yona to take flightwith her Boyfriend #1 (Hak) after finding out the identity of the perpetrator being Boyfriend #2.Thus ensues a long winded journey as Yona travels and develops as a person and a benevolent, charismatic ruler, reaching for that ultimate goal with also a lot opportunities for romantic development, or so you\u2019d think.\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe premise of this series is definitely very promising and allows room for political intrigues, epic battles exploring the qualities of an ideal ruler, discussing the problems with a lenient ruler and how discipline is integral to order. Unfortunately a meager 2 episodes is spent on these issues, making it a huge waste of potential. It\u2019s mentioned many times that the previous reign wasn\u2019t effective, but it\u2019s hardly shown through the show; in fact the blame is all placed onto generic one-dimensional bad guys for doing bad things. The people perspective is nowhere to be found, their \u201csuffering\u201d is hardly discussed, there are no exact problems to be fixed; this makes the show\u2019s whole foundation completely empty and so does Yona\u2019s claim on learning about suffering. In comparison, Rose of Versailles beautifully portrays an oppressed society with plenty of civilian perspectives to display the problems with incompetent governance. On a wider scale, it\u2019s also mentioned that the kingdom is at risk of impending attack in an attempt to give the show some kind of direction; but it\u2019s so diluted and underpresented it\u2019s difficult to appreciate as world building. Furthermore, it doesn\u2019t really help that the show utilizes silly slapstick comedy; much like Shitgatsu Kimi ga Uso, these kills off any tension and make the show somehow even more bubbly than it already is. \\n\\n\\n\r\nOn an episode to episode basis, the show doesn\u2019t fare too well either. Most episodes focus on Yona\u2019s journey to find the \u201c4 dragons\u201d based on a prophecy told by a random drunk priest lying half dead on the side of the road. As if that isn\u2019t silly fantasy enough, these dragons are bound to her by DESTINY, meaning the moment she caught their eyesight, they become a harem member. Yep, she doesn\u2019t even need to convince them. Most of the arcs dont have much depth and doesn\u2019t contribute to the big picture. Additionally, they also try to get the audience to sympathise to the autistic, utterly stereotypical and forgettable dragons that become irrelevant the moment they join the harem.Boyfriend #5 (Blue dragon) arc in particular had a lot of issues that should really have been touched on like why are soldiers attacking the villagers? Why do the little kids keep dying? Why do they fear something that saves them? Instead it focused on the superficial \u201csuffering\u201d of the hot boy. And of course, Yona saves the day in the most stupid way possible \u201cbecause his hands are gentle, so I\u2019ll trust him\u201d, right. The Boyfriend #6 (green dragon) arc got a bit closer to what the show should have been but collapsed when it became yet another generic beat the big fat evil guy who oppress people out of his greedy desires (and really want to put his hands on Yona), joining awkwardly righteous pirates too nonetheless.  \\n\\n\\n\r\n It\u2019s funny how the show realizes the complete lack of purpose in trying to gather up these bishounen on the last episode due to Yona still being completely clueless and a failure in story writing discussed earlier. In attempt to correct this she is given a \u201cpurpose\u201d but it\u2019s clear the author still have no idea how to advance the plot and neither does the show become any less superficial. \\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacter wise, the show features a very generic cast of forgettable characters to poorly developed ones. Yona is often said to have developed greatly, which is nothing short of phony. Physical strength is not the equivalent of mental fortitude; and her excessive plot armor only further depreciates any signs of growth she has. There was only one instance in which she actually realizes she did not want to lose anything else, which was real development. All other instances are just the plot forcing her to take action in an attempt to fool the audience of any real substantial development. For example, when she shot said big fat evil guy, there was hardly any real change in her character or way of thinking, in fact she did it just to get patted on the head. The show tries to make it sounds fancy it but in reality it is exactly just that. And with this much \u201cgrowth\u201d as a human she has gathered in 24 long episodes, her development as a ruler is completely pointless to discuss.\\n\r\nBoyfriends #1-7 suffers heavily from being bogged down to tropes, wish fulfillment and shoujo pandering. They aren\u2019t really allowed to have any thoughts other than about Yona (and protect her because DESTINY). Boyfriend #2 (Su-won) is a potentially interesting character as a young mastermind of a coup but completely butchered by facetious \u201cna\u00efve boy\u201d behavior towards important head figures for reasons I can\u2019t think of besides pandering. His lack of screentime completely denies any chance of development, adding to long list of disappointment in this show.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOn the positive side, the production value of the show doesn\u2019t suffer very badly from being animated by Studio Pierrot infamous for low budget and conservative animation. Art is generally acceptable without noticeable problems. The chibi slapstick art hurts my eyes but other than that it\u2019s pretty average. The instrumental first opening sounds like something from a cheap Chinese MMO and the second is an okay jpop. \\n\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion, Akatsuki no Yona is yet another generic shoujo story masked by a deceptive exterior. Potential interesting plot development and political discussion are replaced by a pointless journey to find hot boys. Every character is inexplicably obsessed about Yona because she\u2019s the designated main character and tropes take up more time than character development. It\u2019s not necessarily the worst thing; in fact it\u2019s just overly mediocre rather than outright horrible. However, it is highly disappointing considering what it could possibly have been, making it excruciating to watch. If you had to watch this series it\u2019s best to keep your expectations low.\\n",

I mean, really? REALLY? \r\nAnyway let's talk about this shit. Not shit in a bad way - I found Akatsuki no Yona THE shit. So far.\r\nStory:\r\nI dig the story. It sounds a bit like Nanatsu no Taizai's but here we have the four dragons instead of the seven sins, and Yona is not stupid and clich\u00e9 as Elizabeth, in my opinion.\r\nArt:\r\nThe art is pretty and classic.I love the characters designs. The animation is pretty good.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nIs there someone who cares about sound? You do? Well, I don't... sorry. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nI just love all of the characters so far. Hak is probably the funniest, but all of them have their funny moments, something I really dig. When I say all, I do mean ALL. Heck, even Ki-ja's grandma had hers. Their personalities are great and unique. Yona is a strong female lead, and I love that. She's charismatic, bubbly and brave. She really cares about Hak. She doesn't want to be always the one who needs protection, she actually wants to be strong, and to fight. I just love her character development. Yun is like totally awesome at everything he does, and I find it super cute/funny when he praises himself. He's really nice but also an ass. Yes, both at the same time. Hak is an awesome character. He's hella funny and strong. I love his personality.  Ki-ja behaves very politely and prince-like and is really loyal. I love his scenes with Hak. Ki-ja gets so easily annoyed by Hak, it's so funny (plus I must confess Ki-ja looks really cute when annoyed). Ik-su is also such a nice character and has a cute personality. Su-won was so nice and kawaii when younger, but now I just want to murder him.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I totally recommend it. There's a lot of action (fights and blood hell yeaaaah), humor, adventure and still there's a spot there reserved for romance. Everything very well-balanced.\\n\r\nSo far, I find Akatsuki no Yona a really awesome and unique shoujo, and I think there should be more shoujos like this since I'm freaking sick of the same old crap with these dumb little romances and imbecile characters and I know I'm not the only one.",

            "content": "What would you do if you lost everything to the one person you thought you cared about the most? Trust is easily extended when you live a sheltered life, and it makes the betrayal all that much more bitter of a pill to swallow. Yet it is not revenge that spurs on our heroine ultimately \u2013 for the line between love and hate is thin and the subsequent balancing act is, in the end, a chaotic mess of feelings too tangled and difficult to boil down to one simple word.\r\nRare is the series that introduces a seemingly weak and sheltered female lead, who undergoes greattragedy only to come out fierce and respectable at the end after the most well-paced development I have had the pleasure of viewing. Were that not enough, we are also blessed with a delightful supporting cast of varied and sometimes unexpected characters. While it\u2019s not without some flaws, Yona is absolutely amazing as a historical shoujo series.\\n\\n\r\nAlthough this season only acts as a starting point for what is to come, it introduces our cast and it develops our heroine. One of the strongest points about the plot is that it begins with a bang \u2013 we first establish a background and we are quickly endeared to the characters before it successfully guts us with the promise our premise gave. Betrayal.\\n\\n\r\nOne of the weakest points of many series is that while our protagonist may be likeable and receive depth and development, our antagonist is lacking in all areas \u2013 not so for Su-won. While he may be easy to despise for his hand in essentially ruining Yona\u2019s life, we quickly learn his motivation and while at first it may be easy to dismiss him as your stereotypical bad guy, episodes down the road clue us in to his real intentions.\\n\\n\r\nThe plot isn\u2019t without its flaws; it follows the stereotypical pattern of our hero finding a  \u201cwiseman\u201d who presents her with a mission which includes the collection of certain \u201citems,\u201d or in this case, the dragons. The backstory is not necessarily uninteresting but not entirely original either. In this way, Yona follows a lot of mythological stories  as inspiration but that doesn\u2019t make it unlikeable \u2013 in fact it\u2019s because it follows a pattern we are used to that it grips us and carries us with it every step of the way.\\n\\n\r\nOur cast is comprised primarily of Yona, Hak, Yun, and the four dragons. For Yona\u2019s part, she makes the biggest impact as an initially \u201cweak\u201d (but come on the girl wants to handle weapons and stuff she has the makings for bad assery from the start) but most certainly sheltered princess. She grows quickly as the loss of her status and family, coupled with Su-won\u2019s betrayal, takes a huge toll on her. Not to mention the wilderness which she is completely unaccustomed to, which requires her to eat food she may never have thought edible before, to sleep outside without proper shelter, and to deal with all sorts of wild animals and insects. She doesn\u2019t deal with it flawlessly \u2013 she struggles, like a real human being, and she gradually recovers then proceed to fight tooth and nail.\\n\\n\r\nHak admittedly starts out as a fierce defender that initially makes decisions based on his aim to protect Yona, but eventually he grows to respect her strength and determination and defers to her judgment the majority of the time. He even softens a bit over time, but in the end he goes from just wanting to keep Yona alive to having a more vested interest in protecting the kingdom with her.\\n\\n\r\nI won\u2019t provide extraneous details about the rest of the cast; suffice to say that introductions are by and large the biggest priority for the series when it comes to the dragons so the time period for development for their characters is rather minimal. Granted they do certainly receive it as Yona\u2019s presence impacts their lives, but I suspect additional development is in store for them in a coming season.\\n\\n\r\nFor the part of the animation, Yona is nothing if not consistent with a muted palette that at times is vibrant but always vivid in the detail of the characters and the landscape. Most enjoyable are the detailed character designs for each of them, thoroughly nuanced and symbolic. The action scenes are exciting, suspenseful and by and large, as realistic as one can expect for a fantasy series.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound is probably a bit more on the average front for the series, but is not necessarily a weakness. The initial opening fits the mood of the anime and the addition of lyrics halfway through makes it a catchy song that really foreshadows what is to come in the rest of the series and represents the development of our heroine. Although not particularly memorable, the insert songs match the general mood of the scenes that they accompany. All of the voice acting is solid, but as always the stars of the show are Saito Chiwa and Maeno Tomoaki who respectively as Yona and Hak really flesh out and bring their characters to life.\\n\\n\r\nFor all of my praise, I have to mention several drawbacks that bring down the rating a bit for this series. Make no mistake that it is stand-out, but its biggest issue is slow pacing near the beginning of the series. This can put off some potential viewership, but more than anything there are some episodes that just drag a bit. This happens at the beginning and at one point in the middle of the series. On the whole it\u2019s fairly well-paced but it\u2019s not perfect. \\n\\n\r\nThe other issue is that the series is advertised as romance \u2013 problem being, where is it? There is certainly romantic tension between characters but there is minimal development on that front even by the end of the series. If you are looking for a series about love, Yona focuses far more heavily on action and adventure \u2013 and it seems unfair to classify it as romance, as that\u2019s only a peripheral aspect of the story.\\n\\n\r\nAkatsuki no Yona is an incredible series that does so many things right that most are unable to \u2013 and it does it with an amazing female lead supported by an equally stellar cast of male characters. It proves that the shoujo/historical combination isn\u2019t dead, can be successful and well-done, and ultimately it\u2019s a heartfelt series manages to combine tragedy and comedy in an entertaining, colorful package.",

This is what an anime should be all about, forcing its way to your heart and really making the watcher feel emotion after emotion. THIS is a true masterpiece.\r\nStory: 10\r\nThere is absolutely no flaws in the story what so ever, the amount of creativity put into this anime is nothing but pure gold. Not leaving a single detail behind, making sure that the watcher fully understands and appreciate a work of art when he sees it. It truly sends shivers down my spine.\r\nArt: 10\r\nI can hardlyguess the amount of time it would take to draw and perfect this anime, but theres no doubt that the producers didn't leave a single detail behind. From the leaves on the trees to the expressions of the characters. It is truly amazing that they managed to hit spot on as well as they did.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10\\n\r\nOne of the key factors to making an anime successful is the sound used in it, and it can be really hard to manage to find the perfect song, but yet again I am not disappointed. By using half old japanese songs with not much instruments in it and not too fancy, you find yourself sent back to another time and it makes it even easier to follow the story than ever before.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 10\\n\r\nNo details were skipped when they made the characters. From funny, to serious, to clever and smart, to strong, to weak and to plain dumb. This anime does not leave any information unsaid, from the past of the characters, to the way they act. Hell, I feel like I know Hak, Yun, Yona, Ki-Ja, Shinah and Jaeha (apart from Zeno, that guys a real mystery) better than i know my own family. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10\\n\r\nApart from the lack of romance I would have wished for to see and the first episode that pretty much  is a spoiler to the end, the amount of raw anime perfection leaves all that in the dust. I simply see no reason as to why I would rate this anime any lower than a 10. \\n\r\nIf you love romance, fantasy, action, comedy, adventure, well as long as you love anime THIS is the anime for you. \\n\\n\r\nThis year is filled with animes that I can hardly wait too see, and I believe that this was only one out of many 10 I will be giving out in the future. What a start on the year Akatsuki no Yona.",

            "content": "I came to this anime having been a huge fan of the manga beforehand, and to tell the truth the first few episodes felt a little choppy for me... plenty of places where I thought that the flow could have been better, that weird \"forward flash\" thing in the first couple episodes, and so on. It felt like they were so impatient to get to the good bits that they tried to fit too many flashbacks into the first hour and a half, spoiling the future events of the series instead of slowly revealing them as time went on.\r\nBut it settles down later and reallygrows on you. I particularly love what they've done with the soundtrack - it really reminds me of Juuni Kouki (makes sense since it's the same composer). I was expecting the usual sort of Japanese pop songs, and it never occurred to me that they would go the traditional instrumental route! How utterly gorgeous.\\n\\n\r\nWhat to say about the story and and characters? They are awesome as always. Hak's gigantic Bodyguard Crush was a bit disconcerting at first as it seemed to come out of nowhere (I remember it being more along the lines of the reader discovering it gradually), but he is hilarious otherwise. Yona's Heroic BSOD could have been a little clearer, but she is becoming as badass a princess as one could hope for.\\n\\n\r\nOverall a good anime. Unfortunately I'm still a bigger fan of the manga, but it was a great addition and I'm satisfied.",

            "content": "Lion Tamers Rejoice!\r\nI have found a good one. \"Akatsuki no Yona\", a 24-episode masterpiece, with a flair for political entanglements, and the stress of personal loss; makes for a great watch in almost every category.\r\nFirst I wish to make some comments about this show, in the historical sense. While this anime, like many; places itself in an alternate universe, it still manages to stay fairly accurate to Feudal China. I find this quirk, very interesting in the light that the entire production is mainly Japanese origin.\r\nAfter all, all the weapons used are Chinese (straight swords versus the curve Katana Blade, etc), and the costumes mightfool people, but most are truly Chinese. We see that mostly in the male apparel, but even the female dress is mostly Chinese.\\n\\n\r\nWhile I wanted to take points off for the very poor habit of Japanese artists drawing people who are supposed to be oriental, with almost entirely caucasian features; in the end I gave it a break, because in the end (like most anime I watch) story is everything.\\n\\n\r\nStory\\n\r\n-----\\n\r\nThe story is spectacular, and while I wish I had time do a long summary of it; I think I will just mention a few items that grabbed my interest, in the vein of waiting impatiently for Season-2!\\n\\n\r\nThis story is of emotional loss, love unrequited, peace and the search for it, war and the difficulty of avoiding it, fear of friends, fear of enemies, class struggles, political usurpation; but most of all 'Akatsuki no Yona' is about finding a reason to believe in the future, when the past has destroyed what was intended. Including our faith in basic goodness, and in the trust we have in relatives.\\n\\n\r\nWow, what a story. While on the surface, \"Akatsuki no Yona' is a \"I need to find an army\" style struggle; in the interior is a struggle to relegate incongruities of one relative versus the same things from another.\\n\\n\r\nFor example, Yona watches while the person she most loves and admires (Su-Won) takes a sword to her father (Il, the emperor of her country), while this same individual points out that her father murdered his. This point is only mentioned once, but it is the reason for most of the tension in Yona's mind; as she travels as a refugee, and if found will probably be murdered or worse; forced to support the new regime, to give it legitimacy.\\n\\n\r\nThe other side of the coin is, Su-Won becomes King and is seen as a worthy successor by almost everyone. Even begrudgingly, Yona. The man actually seems to know what he is doing, trying to clean up the corrupt parts of the kingdoms' administration, keep good leaders in place, build up resistance to neighboring kingdoms which have designs on conquest.\\n\\n\r\nAnd a third side, Yona travels through the kingdom, only to find that her father is almost universally disliked by almost everyone. And for pretty good reasons. A moral and ethical weakling, Emperor Il has apparently allowed virtually every corrupt administrator to run hog-wild, the damage to the public incalculable; many injured physically, mentally, and financially. Some of these even stooping to create a slave-trade from places that are supposed to be lawfully run entities.\\n\\n\r\nIn such cases, we see what some people would call \"color of law\", without actually having any. The parallels in comparison to our own world is obvious.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters\\n\r\n---------\\n\r\nYona is so well developed, starting as a scatter-brained idiot, to an evolution of personality bordering on heroic; she is designed with intelligence by the authors, and evolved subtly and with great charm. There is even the notions that she forces herself to improve, even within the context of the interest of her friends to keep the more gruesome parts of true-life and conflict from her.\\n\\n\r\nThe conflicts within her, dealing with her obvious misgivings surrounding Su-Won; are nothing less than tragic horror. How does she relegate her hatred for her fathers murderer, while also knowing that Su-Won acted in both revenge and statesmanship.\\n\\n\r\nHak, is a tragic character all by himself. He keeps a promise to protect Yona (no matter what), even though he gave his word to a man who is now dead by the hand of his friend and rival for Yona's attention, Su-Won. Hating Su-Won, not knowing as much as Yona does about everything, fighting to preserve the last vestige of the old order; Yona. While trying not to think about how much he loves this tiny red-haired beauty.\\n\\n\r\nAll the rest of the characters are either secondary characters, or tools of Yona's choosing (I don't mean this in a bad way).\\n\\n\r\nSound & Music\\n\r\n-------------\\n\r\nAll the Japanese voices are outstanding. Understanding their characters on screen, emoting relative to each scene with easy grace, interacting via the dialog with correct timing and pacing. Excellent in almost every way.\\n\\n\r\nThe music is something to rejoice, at least the soundtrack. OP1 and ED2 are excellent. The OP2 and ED1 are not relevant to the anime, and are an attempt to interject a more modern and therefore rhythmic musicality, to a production that is otherwise near perfection. Sorry about this but the latter half of the anime has non-relevant thematic music. Damages an otherwise outstanding production.\\n\\n\r\nArtwork\\n\r\n--------\\n\r\nNothing less than stunning. As good as period-piece anime ever get. Artwork is drawn with a clear intent to help move the story, and indicate nuances to the viewer that otherwise might be missed in all the dialog. This a good anime, drawn well.\\n\\n\r\nIs it as 3d as Unbreakable Machine Doll, or Girls-Und-Panzer? No, but it's subtle coloring and paint-ins, are excellent, and gives it a period look that is hard to put your finger on, but relevant just the same.\\n\\n\r\nI want to make a point about female artwork in anime. There are times when I begin to tire of girls being drawn with great big eyes. Believe me folks, a story can help me overlook this point very quickly. If the story is good, and the artist wants me to see a girl with very large eyes, as an attempt to show youthfulness, or apparent simplicity, then this becomes an artistic decision. And I can overlook it. But when there is too much of it, and it has little to do with story-content, then I cringe. This is not one of those times. Yona is drawn cute, very pretty, a bit simple-minded in the beginning, and with big eyes which tend to stare right through your face and see the working of the inner mind. She shares this gift with her friends, and all see its value.\\n\\n\r\nSo do I. So no subtraction, in this case, because she is drawn almost oriental-big-eye. I have no criticism in this case. She is true to the character, and therefore the big-eye look actually has a constructive meaning for the story.\\n\\n\\n\r\nWith that I end my review of Akatsuki no Yona. It is an unfinished work, as it is the first part of a story I wish to see the end of. Season-2 is in production, and my wish is that it will continue an excellent first season.\\n\\n\r\nSo hooray for Akatsuki no Yona, a first class introduction for a much larger story. I give this effort a solid 9!\\n\\n",

For a young girl named Yona, she personally finds out the meaning of that word. Make no mistake. Akatsuki no Yona (Yona of the Dawn) doesn\u2019t just revolve around the betrayal of someone (Soo-Won) that is close to Yona. It also chronicles the journey of this girl and the timeless efforts she goes to recreate the life she once had lost; figuratively speaking of course.\r\nAkatsuki no Yona (Yona of the Dawn) adapts the manga of the samename. The setting takes place in a fictional world with some fantasy elements and a lot of emotions. One of the more interesting facts is that the show is actually a 2 cour running consecutively for 24 episodes. For a shoujo title of recent years, that\u2019s a major plus. It gives more time to flesh out the story, characters, themes, and whatever mission it\u2019s on to adapt a proper show. Just be aware that certain characters may be introduced later than expected and not everything will end the way you may expect them to be. Even as a 2 cour show, it\u2019s hard to adapt a manga that runs over 100+ chapters and still ongoing.\\n\\n\r\nThe first few episodes establishes the premise quite well. In fact, the pilot episode (more specifically the second half of it) really marks its turning point when we find out Soo-Won\u2019s dark ambitions. What really stands out about him is the words he says. While he seems to be playing a fa\u00e7ade at first, and then turning 180 degrees into a monster, there\u2019s also a bit of confusion at what he truly wants. It\u2019s during the tense moments that viewers may find his intentions to be conflicting since he wants to kill Yona for discovering his motives but also a part of him does not. The flashback transitions are fairly well done to set up the way things are played out here. This is because Yona\u2019s bodyguard, Hak (whom shares a history with Soo-Won) comes to her recuse at a timely manner. It\u2019s easy to guess what happens next as battles ensures. Nonetheless, the show painfully stabs Yona in the heart as it gives the audience a glance at her reaction. Yona\u2019s betrayal as a character here is a feat and portrait of a girl who realizes that she lost almost everything. Now luckily, the show makes its come back with the journey that Yona undertakes and that\u2019s where it truly shines.\\n\\n\r\nDuring their journey, the show makes it clear that Yona and Hak\u2019s lives are in danger. Not only are pursued by Soo-Won\u2019s lackeys in a cat-and-mouse like game but also the pure essence of Mother nature and her new circumstances takes a toll on Yona. It doesn\u2019t take long for the series to unfold and begin to give development for Yona. This is especially evident in one of the early moments when she realizes the reality of her changed life. From there, Yona also accepts her new life and realizes how she must make up for her loss. To say the last, the show crafts her development in a profound way. From cutting her famous scarlet hair to learning how to use a bow, the show makes her less and less of a damsel in distress and more so as an independent heroine. It\u2019s what sets this show a bit different than most shoujo as romance is not its main focus. Still, romance does exist although less emphasized as you may think. Character relationships becomes a pivotal focus though especially with her body guard Hak. In fact, it\u2019s really interesting to see his interactions with Yona. There\u2019s a peculiar connection between the two as they seem to be annoyed at each other yet deep down is willing to risk their lives to protect each other. This is clearly illustrated by Hak\u2019s actions where he sometimes takes reckless risks with consequences. Also an important part about Hak is that his actions is a stark contrast to Soo-Won. Hak is a man of loyalty to both Yona and her father. Soo-Won on the other hand betrays all of three of them in pursue for his twisted goals. It stands out to make the show realize how different the two main leads are and how actions can speak so much louder than words.\\n\\n\r\nAnother success the show achieves is a fairly well balanced characterization. Yona and Hak aren\u2019t the only characters that takes every spotlight during their journey. In fact, they meet both foes and allies from their world. It also brings diversity into the mix as the show is intelligent enough to introduce other clans, kingdoms, and even races. The allies that joins them has a wide degree of personalities whether it\u2019s the apprentice Yun or White Dragon descendent Ki-Ja. What stands out about most of these characters is that the show makes time to give their backgrounds with effective use of flashbacks. It also makes it clear at what they want during their journey as they don\u2019t just join without a purpose. Furthermore, they also play pivotal roles in developing Yona. For instance, Yona learns more about the origins of survival from Yun while we also see her selfless side during her conversation with Shin-Ah. This sharply contrasts with her early introduction when she seems to act like a brat during her sweet 16 birthday. It\u2019s more and more that each episode turns Yona into a mature woman during their journey.\\n\\n\r\nEven with all this is going on, the show still has time to make room for comedy. Every episode has some of it that expresses a lighthearted mood of the show. It\u2019s a message that gives the audience an ease and breath of fresh air to craft a lighter side of the story when characters makes jokes. Although some of these jokes can feel cheesy, they are effectively timed without distracting the viewers too much. What\u2019s more is how every episode also fleshes out each of our characters with the dialogues. Not only do they portray their personalities effectively but also their relationships improves the tone of the show. Themes are also accurately delivered with human emotions. It\u2019s through the flashbacks of the past to transitions with events in the present that really carry out this creative story.\\n\\n\r\nNow, Akatsuki no Yona is far from perfect. Perhaps this show might not be something you\u2019re used to or the first few episodes might take some patience to get through. Take a closer glance, it\u2019s also easy to label Yona as an annoying brat from the beginning. Her words and actions are like a spoiled princess and while she isn\u2019t entirely selfish, her behavior is still immature. The first impressions of her character could sway some viewers into pursuing the show further. Additionally, some of the romance feels flat. The endless teasing between Hak and Yona seems to go nowhere on many occasions. Furthermore, the pacing can feel quite dragged sometimes in terms of flashbacks and plot progression. There are also occasional times when the show seems to try a bit too hard on the comedy which comes out in an unfashionable way.\\n\\n\r\nOn the visual front, Akatsuki no Yona is beautiful. The show\u2019s vivid landscapes illustrates the fantasy realm that is fitting for the setting. Character designs are also well crafted ranging from Yona\u2019s scarlet hair to Hak\u2019s fierce eyes. The show could also be quite a treat for the ladies since most of the guys has a bishonen-like design. Action on most parts is coordinated well with concise timing on the fierceness and brutality. There\u2019s little censorship when it comes to blood so those dreadful black bars, circles, or whatever shapes are no worries. The show also has almost no fan service except some scenes early on that can be easily forgettable. Not bad Pierrot and I do have to say that their effort in this should be called out for some praise.\\n\\n\r\nSimilarly, soundtrack is also pleasant and fitting throughout the entire show. OST is played to depict each scene with concise detail whether it\u2019s emotional, climatic, or tension. The first OP song is noticeable for its lack of lyrics but has a fantasy vibration that is hard to deny. The second OP song shows Yona\u2019s change and seemingly a bit of foreshadowing of one of the later arcs. For most parts, I find most of the character voices to fit quite well. Soo-Won gets some praise especially for his manipulative personality as his voice can contrast sharply in tone to hide his true self. Yona\u2019s voice also deserves some attention throughout the show as she matures from a spoiled brat to a mature woman. Her voice is just one symbol of her growth and I think the VA nailed her role quite well. \\n\\n\r\nThis show is about a journey. For fans of fantasy/shoujo, it takes it to new levels with characterization especially with our redhead princess, Yona. A powerful effort with skillful timing and development is required to flesh out her character and I am pleased to say that the show did just that. We see this journey unfold as our characters fight and challenge themselves to limits like never before. It reminds us that hardship can fall on anyone from wherever you come from. The show\u2019s craftsmanship with its technical features of both artwork and soundtrack are also outstanding. For such an adaptation, Akatsuki no Yona is an accomplishment of what a fantasy shoujo should be.\\n",

            "content": "This is my first review so I hope I can convince some people and give a reasonable, accurate review on this anime. Lets jump right in. (Contains a spoiler of the first episode)\r\nStory: The story is about three childhood friends who have grown up. One, a young princess named Yona. Second, a young man who later becomes the bodyguard of Yona and a general in the army, Hak, and a handsome man named Su-won who Yona is madly in love with. Yona has arguments with her father, the king, about Su-won and her desire to marry him, but her father rejects the idea while Hakencourages it. On the night of her sixteenth birthday, she goes to her father to try and convince him one more time to let her marry su-won, she finds that her father had been assassinated, and the only one in the room other than her and her now dead father, was her lover, su-won. Now on the run, Hak and Yona must escape the forces of her old kingdom and find a way to take down their former childhood friend.\\n\\n\r\nArt: The art is typical for an anime but it still is pretty good. In a way, it kind of stands out when it comes to the character's design and it's creative.\\n\\n\r\nSound: The background noise is absolutely great. The music and sound effects are spot on and set the mood perfectly.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: The characters, Yona, Hak, Su-won and some other side characters introduce themselves perfectly and you will get an attachment and understanding to them just fine. Yona is a fragile, spoiled girl at first but she blooms into a fierce, proud young woman later on. Hak is a strong willed warrior who will do anything to protect the princess. Su-won was a cheerful, bright kind of guy to be around. He was always smiling and gave people comfort just being around them, he soon becomes the opposite of that later on.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: This is a pretty enjoyable anime. It has its serious moments but also has incredible humor mixed in to lighten the mood most times. This is a great anime for those into drama/action/adventure. It's still unsure how many episodes this show will have, but lets hope for those who enjoy it (including myself) it doesn't end anytime soon.\\n\\n",

            "content": "WOW. This anime just BLEW my expectations out of the water. Writing this review doesn't give it justice...if you are wondering whether or not it is worth to watch this anime, trust me. IT IS. So go now. \r\nStory 9.58/10\r\nSo supposedly this is a \"Reverse harem\" anime. But I didn't quite see it as that...in fact, I saw it as so much more. This anime goes far beyond any average romance anime. It has truly deep moments of sadness, hilarious moments of comedy, beautiful romance (between the two characters that I think are actually going to get together), it has GREAT action and actually hasa pretty dark undertone to it for being a \"Romance\" anime. The story itself was quite intriguing. I actually finished this anime in a day and a half because the story is THAT compelling. At times, it CAN be a bit slow which is the reason for the deduction of points, but again for the genre that it is in, it kept me on the edge of my seat. Because not only is this a romance anime, but it is a romance anime with PLOT. Honestly, the \"reverse harem\" or romance portion of the anime isn't the main focus, it's the plot, the romance comes second which is what makes this anime so successful. \\n\\n\r\nArt 10/10\\n\r\nAbsolutely stunning visuals. I don't like it when animes go over the top with extra ordinary hair styles and hair colors but I think that the balance this anime had with the character looks was great. The styles seemed realistic for an anime of that time period and for the style that it was in. The backgrounds where quite stunning and the action sequences, especially the ones where they go in slow motion are great. The animation is also extremely great in capturing the raw emotion the characters are goign through, especially Yona. They really capture the fear, sorrow, and sadness in the eyes when necessary which I really appreciate. Plus, i'm absolutely in love with Hak. \\n\\n\r\nSound 8.52/10\\n\r\nThis is one of the few anime's in which I actually enjoy both of the OP's. It changed in the middle, which I actually wasn't expecting, but I did like it. The first one was without any lyrics which I didn't like at first but after watching with the story it fit. However the second one is a complete opopsite to the first. It starts out a little almost like dubstep (but it gets so much better) I wondered why they would do that and I think I understand. The second OP I feel relates to Yona maturing as a human and a warrior...the OP is tougher just like Yona. The songs during the show where nice but I just thought that they were odly placed in my opinion, however it wasn't too distracting. \\n\\n\r\n*SLIGHT SPOILERS*\\n\r\nCharacter 11/10\\n\r\nFor me this is the best part of the whole anime. The characters. Hak and Yona are probably two of my favorite male and female characters in ALL of anime. First let us start off with Yona. She is a naiive princess who has never been outside the castle and is foolishly in love with Soo - won. Next she WITNESSES her love of 16 years killing her dad and is then she narrowly escapes being murdered. She is in absolute shock and cannot do anything on her own. However in her travels she see's the flaws in her dads ruling, see's how Hak is barely keeping her alive and hidden and decides to do something about it. She doesn't stay the damsel in distress, heck she seems to hate it. She wants to be reliable, to be a fighter, and to help her kingdom in ways her dad couldn't. Her character development is absolutely phenomenal and I really enjoyed seeing it. Next is Hak. Hak is already a warrior and reliable but he also progresses as Yona does - he grows stronger as she does. He gets inspired by her and I he is definitely driven by her. Now lets talk about his obvious love for Yona. He has loved her since they were kids BUT BECAUSE YONA WAS SO IN LOVE WITH SOO - WON HE SUPPRESSED THOSE FEELINGS AND TRIED TO SUPPORT HER AS MUCH AS HE COULD. But it doesn't stop there, while they were on their own COUNTLESS times he would surpress himself from showing Yona his true feelings because this isn't the time. That is a great male character. As for the rest of the characters I'm not going to go into too much detail but all of them were very well developed. Usually in \"Reverse harems\" there are characters I don't care for but I truly cared for all of these. Some of them had very tragic backstories that shaped them into the persons that they are today and they all are very enjoyable to watch. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyement 10/10\\n\r\nThis anime was phenomenal. I fell in love. During the first episode I was thinking, idk if i can watch this but as soon as Soo won betrayed Yona I was hooked. I immediately wanted to know what happened next and again, finished this in less than 2 days. I loved it. I cannot give the show enough credit just by talking about it just PLEASE do me a favor an dwatch it. It will be worth your while. I believe there is goign to be a second season, just the way things where left it seems VERY possible but until then I'll be reading the manga because I cannot wait to see what's next.",

            "content": "YONA IS NOT AN EPIC BONAZA:\r\nUtterly unepic because it feels like a typical action adventure fantasy story that viewers felt like they've already seen. Yet anime like Full Metal Alchemist have done it better beyond comparison but do we need a revenge story, dragon binging and some cringe-worthy comedy and not be mediocrity play? Not really recommended.\r\nYou guessed it: 80% of these characters are often defined by two dimensions but mostly consisting of boy scouts with an additional trait that makes them \u201cslightly\u201d shine towards the others. Exclude the 80% and that antagonists that caused that anarchy are simply pseudo one dimensional douche bags becausepeople like the fire clan leader take their job seriously; yet we still need to at least have one, one male psycho for a lousy excuse to fear the damn audience \u2013 and oh I am flipping screaming!\\n\\n\r\nThen how is there nothing wrong with this show? It makes sense how Yona is fuelled for this epic quest, it makes sense on why the medic wants to join the party (though a bit cheesy with being book obssesed) it makes sense why the main antagonist wanted kingship and yet it becomes mediocre drama that no one cares about, with the most amazing example with the four ranger dragons boasting at how sad their past was until they meet Miss.Read-Head.\\n\\n\r\nConsequently not a complete time killer, yet it is no Uro trainwreck intellectually stupid pretentious pile of gold! Its a decent watch for a decent adventure story. Though I must admit those comedy scene were \u201cSO\u201d funny! Those random moments of Chibi moments was kind of face palm worthy...\\n\\n\r\nWhat the hell is there else to say?!

            "content": "\"Yes, King Il. Nobody has said that the princess' hair is strange. But if I may be so bold to say, there is definitely something wrong with her head.\"\r\n- Hak, Akatsuki no Yona\r\nAfter considering at length how best to begin reviewing Akatsuki no Yona (Yona of the Dawn), I decided to quote the series squirrel mascot: \"PUK KYUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU~!\"\r\nI WILL explain the squirrel hilarity behind \"puk kyu\", but first of all: What - beyond untranslated Japanese - is Akatsuki no Yona? \r\nThe answer is a period piece with a HEAVY ancient China / Korea influence, set in the fictional kingdom of Kouka--a nation held together bythe fragile alliances of tribes rather creatively named after each element... which, of course, is surrounded by threatening nations that could invade. Half a war epic with a princess-to-zero-to-hero narrative driven by betrayal; half a spazzy comedy involving the single greatest squirrel character in the history of squirrels. It also has a fantasy aspect involving reincarnating dragons-in-human-forms and shares striking similarities (the same composer, even!) with another of Studio Pierrot's anime, 'The Twelve Kingdoms', which any discerning viewer with an affection for medieval-fantasy and/or red-haired heroines should go watch. Right now.\\n\\n\r\nAkatsuki's titular heroine, Yona, begins the series as the sort of empty-headed pampered princess that you/I have to repress the desire to want to slap repeatedly. Initially, she cares more about her hair and love than... well, anything. But - OPENING EPISODE SPOILERS ahoy - by the end of the first episode, she is forced to confront reality for the first time when her childhood friend and the prettyboyman that she loves, Su-won, kills her father in cold-blood before her very eyes during a coup-d'etat. What follows is a shell-shocked Yona escaping death herself only because Hak - another of Yona's childhood friends and her bodyguard - stays loyal and protects her. From then onwards, the series becomes a journey, both in terms of traversing the nation (thankfully, with the 'A-to-B' cut!) and for Yona as a character.\\n\r\nBy the end of Yona's anime wanderings, there is a moment where she is in danger. The Yona from the beginning of the show would have lacked mental strength, but after all she has experienced and suffered though, her intimidating glare drove home the point: she has been irreversibly changed and will no longer be an ignorant passenger in her own life. The arrow she later shoots without hesitation only confirmed what I already knew:  by the end of the story, she will be a true queen and leader. Aided by the squirrel that has happily made its new home on her shoulder, Yona's path is set. \\n\\n\r\nMANY males were no doubt put off by the reverse harem stigma the series unfortunately has (and many more reading his will be put off by my CUTE SQUIRREL obsession). This is because the focus of the series eventually becomes a quest to find four very shoujo-convenient male reincarnating dragon warriors that serve Yona's bloodline, as she attempts to survive and get justice against Su-won. But the 'harem' does not even fully form until the end of the series, and nearly half of the series simply has Yona with only Hak as her protector. This is not the sort of series that throws ten hairless pretty 'male' suitors at viewers from the get-go. Not at all. What is more, it is tasteful... aside from Hak deciding he likes fingers with honey on them and invading Yona's personal space occasionally, and only Hak/Su-won are treated as potential love interests. \\n\\n\r\nMost people will be disappointed to learn that the future tease at the very beginning will have to wait for a second season, with the first season serving as a foundation for what SHOULD follow. On the plus side, Yona's growth into a mentally stronger, more independent heroine is handled so convincingly that I think a lot of people will come away satisfied... providing there is a sequel. Maybe.\\n\\n\r\n~Squirrel & Tone~\\n\\n\r\nEvery great story has at least one defining moment people's minds will automatically drift towards, even years after watching. In Akatsuki's case, most people would - naturally - single out its first episode: the coup-d'etat betrayal that set the series on its spoiled-princess-to-ruler path. Others would mention the sixth episode's spear swinging sakuga, which highlighted that the series is not just a consistently pretty face devoid of animation, whilst also making clear Yona is not a heroine destined to remain as a mere damsel-in-distress. But my brain may very well be wired differently, for what I will always, ALWAYS remember is the series squirrel mascot waving on Yona's shoulder as it said the now immortal words: \"Puk Kyuuuuu~!\".\\n\\n\r\nIf I could, I would review the squirrel. Just the attention it receives doing its own, usually silly thing in the background speaks volumes about the effort put into the show. Whenever it was not busy distracting me by getting its head stuck in a honey jar as a rare romantic moment was occurring (or, jumping out of Yona's hood after a fall as if to say \"I AM OK/BACK!\"... with a FISH in its mouth), it was - as if responding to the characters - sharing its own thoughts with some choice 'animal-talk' words. \\n\r\nThere I was, lying with a full glass of orange on my bed as you do, when the squirrel started saying \"puk kyu\" as the other characters were talking to each other, and it suddenly hit me that in English it sounds VERY MUCH like the cutest creature you will ever see or hear - complete with a permanently silly, smiling/blushing face - is telling the other characters 'f*** you'. No, really! As if that was the squirrel's contribution to the conversation and its viewpoint. This made me giggle like a school girl uncontrollably and knock the drink all over myself/my bed. If you doubt me, I want you to try to visualise this in your head: there you have the cast discussing serious matters of life and death, then the screen switches to the squirrel's face, as it almost quizzically asks 'puk kyu?'. The moment I saw the squirrel pointing spastically, with daftest face you will ever see, in-sync with its master in the end credits, I knew it was wuv. It took twelve episodes for the damned thing to actually appear in the series proper (every episode I would internally ask myself, \"WHER SQUIRREL!?\"), but once it did, it did not disappoint. But even I was not prepared for the barrage of squirrel random daftness the series had in-store. So, ye' be warned: do not drink and watch! Lesson learned. \\n\\n\r\nNow, as well as questioning my undoubted manliness (and sanity), you might be somewhat curious why I am going on about a squirrel, instead of actually reviewing the series. Well, there is a reason beyond squirrel moe: the tone of the series overall and how the squirrel silliness reflects the combination of depressing subject matter and the \"romantic-panic\" style humour that the author manages to combine with it. When Akatsuki first started airing, it had an average of 7.40. Even I was not terribly excited about it. But with each episode, the average has steadily increased each week. And I think the reason for this is, quite simply, that people were initially unsure what to make of it. The series begins with spazzy humour, with a hint of seriousness, then ends with blood and death. One minute, happy thoughts. The next, hopeless despair. Most people would be put off by this contrast and prefer something more... grim overall. \\n\\n\r\nHOWEVER, the series - and author's - greatest strength is making a story of betrayal and exile into one with a 'feel good' vibe. The oriental-themed instrumental soundtrack does a superb job of adding an epic scope and retaining narrative focus, whilst the humour breaks up what would otherwise be a despairing trudge through a land in political turmoil. I was able to enjoy seeing the Yona's growth as Hak teased her in a manner a sarcastic git such as myself approves of, rather than be weighed down by doom & gloom. And the combination defies common sense by working surprisingly well... once I adjusted to it. It is not as if all of the humour is of typical anime 'freak out' variety, either: my favourite parts being Hak's sarcastic deadpan comments and the dry bits; such as when a character asked someone what will happen if they are not who the other person thinks they are, followed by silence and the other character continuing as if the question had not been asked. Comedy is ALL about timing, and Akatsuki Yona nails that. Mostly.\\n\\n\r\n~Charcterisation~\\n\\n\r\nAkatsuki Yona's positives are not just limited to comic timing and squirrels: the characterisation, which I am happy to report is largely free of the internal monologue NO anime has made me come to hate of late, is a major plus. But, first, I feel a need to point out that A HUUUGE chunk of my affection for the series stems from how similar it is to two entries in the forever loved/unknown video game series, Suikoden. It takes the 'best friends become enemies in a medieval war' plot of Suikoden II, blends that with the 'parents murdered; prince on the run' plot from Suikoden V and also gives a nod towards the main theme of Suikoden: warriors gathering under the one with the power to rule/conquer as decreed by fate. And I can not deny that these links to one of very few things in existence I could be described as fanboy over makes me a tad bias, no matter how critical I am. But there is no denying that Akatsuki's characterisation is very, very good where it matters. \\n\\n\r\nInstead of a pantomime villain that cackles as he murders in order to gain power, Su-won actually wants to make the nation stronger and did what he did for what he perceives to be the greater good. The previous king was opposed to violence/killing and considered a coward, and the neighbouring countries were becoming an increasing threat whilst he did nothing. On the flip-side, the previous king was a good man and loving father, and Yona can not help but feel nothing but hatred for the man she once - and may still - love. Neither of them are truly wrong and both have valid justification for their actions, and that 'greyzone' is what makes the series so compelling and human; even with the anime humour. When the two encounter each other again, much later, I felt the skin on my face prickle as I could almost feel the emotion conveyed by Yona's cold-rage, frozen eyes. Yona can be a crybaby and Su-won's cunning can sometimes get lost behind his Griffith-esque shoujish facade of playful ignorance but, on the whole, their characters and the love/hate relationship they share kept me hooked throughout the show, even as it focused heavily on subplots.\\n\\n\r\nThe supporting cast are far more mixed, ignoring the squirrel's +10 eccentric curiosity. My favourite non-squirrel character, Hak, is always at the ready with playful sarcasm - usually directed at Yona - and fulfills his role as the sarcastic love interest with a heart of gold/silver. His loyalty to Yona as her protector may be a little... shoujo but I do like how he balances his - at this point - one-sided affection for Yona with his role as her bodyguard. The reincarnated dragon warriors are more hit and miss. The author tried to make each one unique, with their own ability and quirk, yet ended up making them a tad stereotypical as a consequence. Ki-ja is the naive, simple-minded hot-head with a claw-arm ability; Shin-ah is the silent masked squirrel master with an eye ability; Jae-ha is the playboy with a kicking ability and, finally, Zeno is introduced in the very last episode in a comical '...after all that searching for the other three, the last finds us straight away?' kind of way. His quirk is eating lots of food and playing the fool in spite of being sharp. Zeno aside, they all receive decent development time - most of the series is, after all, dedicated to finding and recruiting them - but only maybe Jae-ha has a personality worth remembering. \\n\\n\r\nWhat the series did manage to convey well was the difference in circumstance between each of the dragon warriors. where as Ki-ja had a clan formed around himself that worshiped each reincarnation, Shin-ah was treated like a monster by his people and hidden away. I would go as far as to say Shin-ah's unhappy back-story convinced me the series was not going to turn into an artificial shoujo happy place that would make me want to punch myself in the face repeatedly. And Jae-ha's reluctance to have his will dictated by fate and serve someone he did not know impressed... even if the outcome was inevitable. The problem is, it is their roles in the story rather the characters themselves that stand out. They are no more than props with superpowers, at this point. There is another character that joins Yona's 'man-harem' - a ladyboy healer called Yun - but there is little to say about him beyond he looks like a girl and cross-dresses as one, later. Along with the squirrel. Seriously. \\n\\n\r\n~Pacing & Progression~\\n\\n\r\nWhere Akatsuki Yona does sadly fall short is its story... or, more specifically, the pacing of its story. Years ago, I tried reading the manga, and with few chapters translated at the time it just did not grab me beyond the opening shock-twist. Possibly because I was unaware of the squirrel. The lulls between events eventually lead to me marathoning episodes, instead of watching as they aired; in spite of the series being one of the best I have seen in recent years. And this will no doubt be one of the main negatives people view the series as having.  The premise is definitely intriguing but, in 24 episodes, not a whole lot happens. Yona escapes, hides, escapes again, starts her quest searching for dragon warriors, finds them... the end. Sandwiched in-between is a mini-arc for Su-won that explores his character and the setting a little, which was most welcome, but that is basically it. Certainly not as eventful as one would expect after watching the first episode.\\n\\n\r\nOn the surface the story, though compelling, is a fairly plain one, and this is not helped by the complete focus on Yona's characterisation over fleshing out the world and plot progression. For someone like me that values characterisation above all else, it is not something that irks me THAT much, but for others it will be an issue. The few glimpses into the world come from Yona's gradual realisation that her father, whilst a good man, was a weak ruler... but these are handled poorly towards the end. For instance, a corrupt governor is SO corrupt that he openly abuses his people and literally drops beautiful women through trapped doors (safe, that) to sell them as sex slaves. It was great for Yona's character to grow through this encounter but it just felt very one-dimensional and forced; painting the setting as an unrealistic one for the sake of giving her character a straightforward good>evil path. The bad guy was such a bad guy he NEEDED to state how he enjoys women when they are obedient, and other cliched villain arsehole dialogue. And then you throw in pirates that refuse to kill / shouojism and it hurts my head/immersion/makes me want to punch myself. A throwaway plot device villain just does not satisfy when the main plot has yet to inch forward.\\n\\n\r\nAs fond as I am of the series, I am cautious as far as my long-term affection goes. As an example of my concerns, at the start Hak was freely slicing - with blood flying - and presumably killing those trying to kill Yona. But as the series progressed, unless a character is so... one-dimensional evil that there is no recourse but to kill them, the characters seem to have taken on an unrealistically pacifistic approach, simply because the dragon warriors are powerful. Which makes little sense in the context of, say, the corrupt governor mentioned above: the people working for him were aware they were involved in human trafficking and doing generally bad things. Yet they got a free pass. I hope I am wrong but I am getting a shoujoish vibe from that aspect, and the author has previous: in NG Life, the lead was once a gladiator - of all things in the universe - that refused to kill. I frowned. I rated it 10/10 anyway but I most certainly frowned. \\n\\n\r\n~Visuals & Audio~\\n\\n\r\nWhat makes up for the story failings is the presentation. The easiest way to judge the budget a show has - assuming it does not have movie animation - is episode-to-episode art consistency. And Akatsuki Yona is consistently beautiful. When you are told Yona's hair is beautiful, you believe it because of the way the scene uses colour / the dawn theme. And when you see the almost reflective gem-like detail Yona's purple eyes have, there is no doubt she is beautiful enough for Hak to risk his life protecting her. There is also the attention to detail: the almost super-deformed, dot-eyed comedy skits and, in some cases, things like a JRPG 'lost in dungeon' parody. Those in charge of the anime were clearly aware the humour is the series' greatest strength, and they did everything they could to enhance it visually as it made the journey from page to screen, whether by having the squirrel doing silly things such as swinging on/attempting to eat earrings in the background or just general creative stylisation. But what truly sold me on the series visually was the wonderful usage of colour. It can look unimpressive when everything is bright, but when there is a contrast during dark scenes - probably intentionally due to the dawn theme - it impresses. What does disappointment me slightly is how the manga art was made to look slightly more... generic shoujo. The author created my favourite manga, so I know her art well, and she draws with a distinctive pointy-chin style, and very SHARP eyes. Yona looks far plainer in the anime, aside from in a few pivotal scenes towards the end. \\n\\n\r\nThe true 'WOW' moment of the show is episode six's sakuga animation. Seeing Hak swing his spear so freely, in such a desperate situation, after previously only seeing speed-lines and limited animation, blew me away. TV budget animation... then, all of a sudden, movie fluidity. Nothing else in the show came close to it, both in terms of the intensity of the fight and animation, but it will remain in my memory as a standout anime moment. Reminiscent of THAT outnumbered spear fight in 'Seirei no Moribito'.  \\n\\n\r\nPerhaps even more impressive than the budget attentiveness, the soundtrack is truly wonderful: capturing the emotion of every single scene whilst not being overwrought. It drives home that you are watching an Asian period piece, rather than a squirrel comedy, with every piece of its instrumental music. Hiring the composer of the more-serious-yet-very-similar 'The Twelve Kingdoms' was a very wise move indeed. The music grounds the series in its setting and carries the emotional undercurrent, whilst the humour prevents the emotionally charged tunes from becoming overbearing. Also, although I initially found Yona's Japanese voice to be annoying and... weird, after awhile it grew on me. The spoiled princess; naive sincerity; cuteness; determination; desperation... all of this is captured perfectly by her voice. One of my favourite Japanese voice acting performances, perhaps. \\n\\n\r\nIn addition, what sold the show to me in the beginning was its first opening. The visual style reminded me of Suikoden II's EPIC still-image montage, and the visuals truly came into their own once the faux-3D effect was randomly added to it as the episodes released. But far more noteworthy was the choice of music: a non-vocal background track, composed for the show. Not some edgy J-Pop theme--something that actually fit. Sadly, later on the first opening was replaced by what I can only describe as a 'GIRL POWA' track designed to appeal more to the target demographic. It was ok, and I liked that the lyrics were wrote for the show, but still somewhat alienating to males such as myself, where as the first opening can only be described as epic. My cheeks tingled with excitement every time I watched it. The two endings were less memorable, with the second fitting the show better than the first. \\n\\n\r\n~Summary~\\n\\n\r\nOverall, the series impressed me to such an extent that it made me review it semi-seriously. And for a lazy one-finger-typing sod such as myself, there can be no higher praise on this Earth. \\n\r\nThe humour transforms what would have been bland into something else entirely; especially when paired with the anime's directional focus on its comedy aspect. What could have been an adventure of misery becomes one that should put a smile on even the coldest of squirrel hating faces, whilst retaining interest in where the political intrigue will eventually - hopefully - lead to; aided by an outstanding soundtrack that fits the series and its setting like a glove. The artwork consistency and squirrel activity convinced me the production was a labour of love for the staff and I am happy that the first manga Kusanagi has had animated was adapted with such care. \\n\\n\r\nIn the author's earlier work, NG Life, she made a reincarnation tragedy about Pompeii's volcanic end into a romantic comedy that was equal parts tear-inducing and amusing. So, a medieval warfare epic that fills one's heart with warmth was a given, really. It has its flaws - chugging along pace-wise and not striking an ideal balance between death/funny - but I am just happy it is not another anime sequel that makes me want to beat my head against the nearest available wall--for that, I eagerly await season 2. But, until then, I shall use my 'squirrel wearing a dress' avatar with pride. \\n\\n\r\nI STRONGLY recommend any males reading this put their reverse harem cringe fears aside and just enjoy hearing a squirrel saying \"puk kyu\". Assume that the squirrel is not quite as happy with his travel party as its face suggests and laugh you shall. That is the path to enjoyment.",

            "content": "Akatsuki no Yona Ramble Review\r\nLike all pieces of media that we use to distract ourselves before the inevitable, there are always some genres you try to steer clear of, like you would social responsibility or German scat porn. One genre that gets this abusive treatment from me is the shoujo genre. But before we continue, the shoujo genre is kinda garbage. Hopefully my negative propensity towards the genre isn\u2019t showing. But in all seriousness, it\u2019s a genre targeted towards teenage girls. The real reason I hold such distaste to this particular genre is due to it consisting of characters that are written by people thathaven\u2019t had sex in a very long time. Meaning, the heroin is apparently so perfect and attractive that the entire male cast gets on their hands and knees and starts to fawn over her (and also the fact most of them are rom coms, but that is for a different time).\\n\\n\r\nSo when my friend through her gags and burbles of her mentally damaged brain would suggest a show for me, I would always reply with \u201cis it one of horrible shoujo anime, that whenever I try to watch it I feels like I\u2019m shitting out a hedgehog that has barbed wires instead of spines?\u201d, which would just lead to more gags and burbles as she rolls on the carpet, trying to improve her noodle impression. But I finally took pity on my poor, retarded, idiot, stupid (maybe I should stop being friends with them) friend and listened to her suggestion and began to watch Akatsuki no Yona. And I will say I was mildly surprised.\\n\\n\r\nAkastsuki no Yona is an anime about a princess Yona, who has the ability of being genetically superior to everyone because she has red hair, and she has the emperor dragons blood. But like every princess story, a great tragedy strikes. The king is killed by her crush, the original \u201cboy toy\u201d, Soo Won. So she escapes with her trusty side \u201cboy toy\u201d, Hak. These two companions have great chemistry and travel the land to collect four more \u201cboy toys\u201d( I\u2019m going to keep calling them boy toys until I get a laugh, you bastard), to build her harem and fill her empty heart. and other orifices. Opps, I mean to take back her kingdom. But these four \u201cboy toys\u201d aren\u2019t  just anyone, no no no, they are special with dragon blood running through their veins with amazing abilities, and just so happen to be a list of character tropes and fetishes for the fujoshi community to argue which would make for the best \u201chusbandu\u201d.\\n\\n\r\nThe series seems to be set in an \u201cancient\u201d China inspired kingdom. Sadly I can\u2019t be certain if it is actually china  because it is never clearly stated, probably because the producers were having a little giggle to see how many racists they can catch by calling it Chinese. But in all seriousness, this simple fact was its biggest pull for me towards the series. In the world of anime, with its overabundant high school slice of life and the countless generic light novel adaptation that gets hacked every year by the uncoordinated hands of a butcher who just stopped giving a fuck, uniqueness is a quality hard to find. So for a shoujo to not have a highschool setting certainly did make me raise an eyebrow and investigate. And regardless of what you think, that is certainly a plus. \\n\\n\r\nBut after my eyebrow reached the top my un-arguably handsome face, my senses slammed on the breaks and came back to me, which lead to the thought \u201cIs it a horrible reverse harem that is so bad it\u2019ll make my throat want to fill out divorce proceedings with my stomach as I vomit a litre of stomach acid?\" \"Um...Kinda.\"\\n\\n\r\nI\u2019ve seen many reviews on people\u2019s thoughts on Akatsuki\u2019s characters, and every god damn single one of the cum gurgling twats that praises this series all seem to say the exact same thing, \u201cThe characters are amazing with intricate back stories and amazing development through the series\u201d. This statement I whole heartedly agree to\u2026 Oh wait scratch that last part. The characters do have an interesting and unique back story, and Yona\u2019s transformation from a scared, timid princess to a strong female heroin is interesting. But as soon as the \u201cboy toys\u201d have joined the harem bandwagon, they devolve into body pillow number 6745 and just become another member of the reverse harem bullshit. This is what I hate and loath about this series and the shoujo genre as a whole. Develop apparently means a character becoming infatuated with the main heroin, until there are enough handsome men to perform their very own bukkake shoot.\\n\\n\r\n What the writer of the series should have done was throw out the love hexagon and make entire series focus on Hak and Yona, and make the rest of the cast just loyal to Yona. But that isn\u2019t going to happen because like I said in my introduction, the characters are written by people that haven\u2019t had sex since they played doctor with Uncle Tom. When I think about it, the characters as a whole, excluding best boy blonde, aren\u2019t that great either. And the other villains the company faces aren't great either. It's like the script writer binged watched a bunch of Disney movies, then she hastily began to write a villain, until I don't know an ice cream truck passed. \\n\\n\r\nTo add to that, the tone of the series swings like a convulsive Gibbon on crack. One minute the heroes will be fighting kidnappers who sell woman and children as slaves, and the next minute it'll change art style to adorable chibi characters, as they tell a joke that falls flat so hard it tunnels into the earth and burns up in its core. It\u2019s just so bad it made me want to pull my teeth out and jam them in my eye sockets so I don\u2019t see that shit ever again. Who thought that was a good idea to implement comedy with murder, other then Punch and Judy? No matter how hard you try it\u2019s like me and relationships, they just don\u2019t seem to work out.\\n\\n\r\n I have other complaints about the series such as the music, animation,the ending and Yona\u2019s sun glare, but this is already getting to long, so I\u2019m will wrap this up. As I wrote this review I realised the mountains of problems the leaked out of the shows pores, like yellow puss from a wound. And every single one them stem from the Shoujo heritage, from the reverse harem, the lack of character development of the male characters, the erratic tonal shifts, and many other complaints and nitpicks I have. But I still found the show mildly entertaining (even if it was for the wrong reasons), from the unique setting, Yona\u2019s development as a character, or just pointing out everything bad about the series. This \u201cenabled\u201d me to claw through the story, in the same way someone \u201cenables\u201d a crippling drug habit. So in conclusion, Akatsuki no Yona turned out to be a slightly above average Shoujo series that surprised me. But keep in mind, for me personally an average Shoujo is about as good as putrefied shit left on black tarmac to cook. So you can gauge my opinion of the series from there. But for a Shoujo fan sure go watch it. But for everyone else, just go watch Arslan Senki.\\n\\n\r\nScore: 4.4\\n\\n\r\n----------------------------\\n\\n\r\nThis Ramble Review was a new idea that I wanted to take a shot at to challenge myself. Hope you enjoyed.\\n\\n\r\nAnd also, I am doing a blog so head on over there for more stuff, including just my thoughts and opinions on anime related stuff.\\n\\n\r\nAnd please, any and all feedback for this review is appreciated. So shoot me a message and tell me any problems you had with the review and ways to fix it. \\n",

            "content": "Story: The point of view is mostly through the eyes of the main character Yona, but it switches to that of Hak or the four dragon warriors occasionally. \r\nI feel it was an easy story line to follow, however I believe if you have any history with watching anime, then you have seen this particular plot before (main character is a witness to a tragic event, and sets out on an adventure for vengeance and gains strength and an impressive following on the way). Sound familiar? \r\nI thought the pacing was quite well. There were moments, especially at the end, that I thought it wasa little too fast paced for my liking. There were full episodes dedicated to back stories of the dragons. I am usually not a fan of these, but they were crucial to character development and all that.\\n\r\nThere was plenty of action and fantasy in the form of sword fighting and the use of awesome supernatural powers that were foreseen through a mysterious legend of powerful beings.\\n\r\nAdventure is a given since they literally travel all over the land and encounter many new people and places along the way.\\n\r\nThe characters had pretty funny moments, especially Hak and the green dragon. The humor was sometimes dry but in all, I thought it felt genuine.\\n\r\nAs far as the romance aspect is concerned, there really was none. Yeah there was a lot of flirting going on, but there was no advancement beyond that. This was pretty disappointing to me because I was looking for a good romantic/fantasy anime, but that did not faze me that much.\\n\r\nThe ending was the main reason this series was not a 9 or even a 10 on my scale. There was no closure what so ever, just a humongous cliff hanger. It felt as if they only showed about half of the story in the short 24 episodes. Hopefully they decide to make a second season sometime in the near future.\\n\\n\r\nArt: I thought the art was very pleasant. You can tell it isn't a super new series, nor a super old one. \\n\r\nThe background looked amazing (especially the ocean and mountain scenes) My favorite was when the sun made her hair look like crimson, or when you could see the fire in her eyes, it was done quite well.\\n\r\nThe characters looked absolutely unique and differentiated quite a bit from one another. You could easily tell who it was just by looking at their shadows or silhouettes. \\n\\n\r\nSound: Honestly, I skipped all the openings, like I usually do, but from what I heard through the fighting scenes, the instrumental music was pretty well conducted and executed. You could feel the emotion, and it hyped me up for the outcome.\\n\r\nAs far as the voice acting is concerned, I watched the English dubbed version and I thought the actors were perfect for their roles, particularly Christopher Sabat as Hak :)\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Just like many series like this one, there were many inhumanely strong characters. The main character is at first perceived as weak and helpless, however she shows what is up as she gets stronger and braver. \\n\r\nYou become so familiar with every character until you can predict how each will react given a certain situation.\\n\r\nThe only side/mainish character that is not given a backstory of any kind, is the yellow dragon which comes in at the very last second, when the plot was sped way up and it ended abruptly.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: If you like fantasy anime with quite a bit of supernatural action and lots of comedic relief, I believe you will enjoy this anime alot. If you are looking for a super romantic series, this probably is not for you.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, I gave this series an 8 out of 10, so it had a couple of flaws but still pretty great nonetheless.",

We, as viewers, are given so much background information- each supporting character has a flashback or two (or a full on episode) of why they're the way they are. Plus, the plot is refreshingly original, only loosely reminiscent of other reverse harems. All in all, totally enthralled with the story.\r\nArt: 8\r\nNo qualms here with the art. The openingcredits are beautifully done.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9\\n\r\nThe first opening theme is beautiful, the second one fits the story (though not my cup of tea). Love love love the voice acting, especially for Shinah/Sinha.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10\\n\r\nUndoubtedly a ten. Like I mentioned before, the amount of depth these characters have is exemplary- a shining example of character development. For how short this series is, I have found myself sympathizing with these characters on multiple occasions.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10\\n\r\nDidn't read the manga, still picked it up and loved it. I'm hoping the final episodes don't let me down.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9\\n\r\nGreat anime, highly suggest watching if you're into romantic comedy dramas with action sprinkled in every episode.\\n",

            "content": "Akatsuki no Yona, I was very reluctant to watch. Shojo, all those men, I was all to sure it was something along the awfulness of Tokyo Mew Mew. But boredom got the better of me and my thumb pressed the play button.\r\nIntroduced by an instrumental opening cleared my doubts and I was hooked on this, along with Inou Battle and Legend of Korra.\r\nEveryone says its slow and not for those more acquaintanced with One Piece or Bleach. ITS NOT TRUE! Unlike FMA, it doesn't try to use a pen to outline how all characters behave.Unlike Naruto, it doesn't waterball you into all the things youread in the blurb. One would say, this show is held by the characters. \\n\\n\r\nWhat I expected: She is sad at first, then she gets over it, then she meets the dragons, then she becomes the centre of a harem. \u041a\u043e\u043d\u0435\u0446.\\n\r\nIf only life was that simple. She doesn't get over her father's death. She isn't just sad, she becomes traumatized. At times, the show really explains that you can't just become Luffy D. Monkey and have it your way. She trembles as she accepts troubles. She trembles, but she knows she must accept. Her will isn't powered by friendship or something, her will is on the verge, Yona is on the verge. Of what? I don't know. What I do know is, Yona isn't a clich\u00e9. Yona isn't even another shojo harem. I would recommend anyone looking for some realistic fantasies should watch this.",

            "content": "First Review, any criticism is welcome! \r\nAkatsuki no Yona, the anime that aired along the big guns such as Parasyte and Your Lie in April,Nanatsu no Tanzai,(and even to an extent Shirobako)\r\nIt's no surprise that this anime was not on the radar for many.But for those who are watching this series, it was a surprisingly enjoyable ride.\r\nStory:7\r\nSo fleeing the palace with the best friend and exploring the lands,looking for people to join the party  ,how many times have we seen that story-line?and\r\nFulfill-your-destiny-MC type of stories  are not rare either,and Akatsuki no Yona is no exception, however being cliched is not necessarily abad thing as long as it was written and done well,and Akatsuki no Yona delivers in spades.Plot was done well, dramatic moments were perfectly done in its timing and execution.Comedy was done once in awhile and sometimes it could be a hit or miss,but in the end still managed to lift the mood when its needed.\\n\\n\r\nThe main thing people like (or is totally worth cringing about to some) is that the pacing in this anime is very slow,some episodes are spent purely watching how the characters interact with each other in their journeys, and even the antagonist gets some screen time,however these episodes are essential to conversations and flashbacks that allows us to be attached to the characters.No episode is meaningless however, as even the very slow episodes bring something to the story,and the plot is driven further,and shed some light on some characters.\\n\\n\r\n I'll just say it here, the ending of Akatsuki no Yona is just the beginning of what potentially is going to be an amazing story.Hardly anything concludes, which of course will tick off some people, but I believe that with an OVA about to be aired and (hopefully) 1 or 2 sequels, the 24 episodes in the series could be just a part of an amazing series,on its own its great but not a Masterpiece.\\n\\n\r\nThese 24 episodes introduces us to the world of Akatsuki no Yona,and leaves us  wanting.\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt :7\\n\\n\r\nThe animation in the anime were decent,but not  great.Its not like the Fate series by ufotable where each strike and slash of the action scenes were animated into the finest of details. Akatsuki no Yona does just enough ,fight scenes weren't just a cloud of smoke,and blood wasn't shown in exaggeration when people are struck. In its dramatic moments though, the characters are drawn extremely well,and [minor spoilers] Yona's eyes are drawn beautifully when she is having her ''moments''.\\n\\n\r\nIn its comedic moments,the characters are drawn into their Chibi versions ,and though in my opinion may seem out of place in this anime,I got used to it as I watched more episodes.\\n\\n\r\nSceneries  in the anime were alright, done enough to depict the atmosphere and mood of situations.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound:8\\n\\n\r\nI LOVED the music and soundtracks, in particular is the first opening, at first I thought there was something wrong with the audio and went to check it out,turns out that it was a soundtrack that fits the setting of the anime perfectly, as Akatsuki no Yona was set loosely in the times of historical Korea. The same melody but different tempo and mood of the same song was also played as soundtracks in most of the emotional and sweet situations,which was a huge bonus point. \\n\\n\r\nBesides the OP and the soundtracks that were similar to it,,the romantic scenes' soundtracks  does not take away any attention from the scenes that were being played.. and complemented the scenes well.\\n\r\nYou could sense the pain the characters have to endure ,when the solemn melodies come in, and know a huge breakthrough for our characters is about to be made when the epic drums come in. Heck,most of the action scene's soundtracks were beautifully made.\\n\\n\r\nThe other ending and openings were good,but not great.Special mention to the second ending which sent me back to memory lane with its traditional Chinese (or Korean) vibes,with traditional instruments playing in the background.\\n\\n\r\nIf you love stringed instruments playing in the background , you would love it, a refresher from the usual electric guitar/bass that we always have.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:9\\n\r\nNow at the cream of the crop, Akatsuki no Yona absolutely shines  in its characters,hardly any of them are  there solely as a plot device, all of them had well made backgrounds and they're personalities weren't  forced and were understandable due to their past. the 5 members of the party that will eventually join Yona and Son Hak though are side characters are given lots of screen time (for the exception of one who only joined in very late into the series).Granted, their personalities aren't unique and could be seen at a handful of animes,but they were very well done.Each of them benefits the party in its own way.And most of them have their own unique reasons for joining Yona, be it being inspired or wanting friends,to wanting to explore the world or even out of sheer loyalty.\\n\\n\r\nSon Hak, the childhood friend and bodyguard of the MC though looked like a typical Gary Stu, is a more complex character that it seems, duty bound to protect the princess, he uses this as an excuse to be always be at her side, suppressing his own feelings.He tends to also be overprotective.However as the anime goes on you could see how he acknowledges Yona,that she has become stronger and allows her to do things that he would never allow her to do if he was still the same person as the first few episodes.He shows weakness and though have a cool exterior, can be swayed on the inside.\\n\\n\r\nSoo-Won,though I personally dislike him is a strange yet refreshing character,though without much to do after the first few episodes,the actions he take with the short screen time he was given  portrays his personality perfectly, though the anime has given him one and a half episodes  of screen time ,a sidetrack from the main story ( which is one of the negatives I find in this anime) it made me realize he wasn't just the typical bad guy who betrayed his friends, but potentially someone much more deep and complex.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOn to Yona, Yes she isn't the first female character ever to be portrayed as a determined character who wants to be stronger,there are many of her type out there.But somehow even as a male I could relate to her. Being in good care all her life, she is bound to be the useless  MC that we see in any other show,who wants to improve herself after knowing how helpless she is,\\n\r\nno surprise there.However,\\n\\n\r\nThe pain that she feels after the twist in the beginning episode was  portrayed very well, she couldn't do anything, and who could?after everything has been taken from her and thrown into the outside world,she was traumatized and couldn't have survive without her bodyguard.She didn't instantly transform into someone who could adapt and with the ''power of her friends''became strong,shes portrayed as a weak and feeble character who always needed  help.Yes she has the huge confidence that most people in anime do, however just like in real life,confidence and motivation does not necessarily deliver results. Yona is still physically weak and relies on the people around her often,even in the later episodes. the motivation for her to improve is wonderful, not unique, but very very relatable , for those of us who think of ourselves as being inferior to others,we can understand how Yona feels whenever she is helped by her bodyguard or other friends,thinking of herself as a burden to others\\n\\n\r\nEven though she has become stronger by just a little, the Yona you see at the end in episode 24 and the Yona you see in episode 1 is very very different,personality wise.You cant help but feel proud of her as you keep rooting for her through each struggle and obstacle, and by the end of the series she has grown to be a very fine person.Unlike a Mary Stu, she struggled and practiced ,and feels helpless from time to time,and she will still continue to struggle through her journey.\\n\\n\r\nAs a person who has a slight inferiority complex I could relate to Yona very well,feeling helpless when you do not want to is a very human emotion, but Yona shows us that having that emotion could be either an asset or a curse for us, depending on whether we want to struggle to improve or brood over it.\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:9\\n\\n\r\nAction, Adventure, Comedy, Fantasy, Romance, Shoujo,\\n\\n\r\n1.)Action? Decent-Good at best,  bad guys weren't that tough to beat and when you know Yona and the gang are around you know the party is going to kick butt, with the exception of maybe the last few episodes where you could see Yona really struggle.\\n\\n\r\n2.)Adventure, not too bad, being set in historical Korea and all, going around to find members of the party and fight the bad guys?not really unique, however this general,cliched storyline could still be great if portrayed well, which Akatsuki no Yona did.\\n\\n\r\n3.)Comedy, sometimes its a hit or miss but it served its purpose,doesn't really stand up except for a fair few\\n\r\n.\\n\r\n4.)Fantasy, yeah  super powers from the members of the party,and the portrayal of some prophecy/legend,pretty much.\\n\\n\r\n5.)Romance,well since the story is just getting started, development isnt complete, though it is going somewhere,those who expect a Maid-sama like ending will be disappointed.\\n\\n\r\n6.)Shoujo,  its obvious that the romance is depicted between Son Hak and Yona.And I'm sure that the manga is continuing with both of them being the official couple, and how these two come together will be an essential part of the story,but with Yona being a dense girl and all the Shoujo aspect in the 24 episodes doesn't really shine.\\n\\n\r\nWith all these mediocrity why does it still get such a high score?Its because of the characters.\\n\\n\r\nOne thing I could say about Akatsuki no Yona is that its much more than the sum of its parts, the characters make this whole show so enjoyable,especially Yona. As I watched the anime I couldn't help but be a supporter of Yona to try to improve herself , and in the end I was very satisfied with a huge grin on my face,thinking that she has done well.And as a Hak X Yona shipper I kept rooting for them and though the story has just about finished its beginning chapters by gathering all members of the party, development between the two is there.\\n\\n\r\nAkatsuki no  Yona is an anime that doesn't look as good as it seems when you take it apart one by one like in the reviews, but when you watch it, you couldn't help but feel how wonderful this anime is, it is definitely slow, no doubt about that, and the cliches are there,but after around 5 episodes ,I was engrossed into the show and despite all its flaws, love it very much.\\n\\n\r\nThough viewed by some as a reverse harem, you already know Hak and Yona has its moments and their romance is one the elements in the series.\\n\\n\r\nSurprisingly when I watched Spirited Away, I couldn't grasp the message that it wanted to portray when I finished it, and read online about how Hayao Miyazaki wanted to portray the message about the growth of a young girl into adolescence, Akatsuki no Yona reminds me of that, the struggles on how to live when everything is taken away, and the path to become stronger could be devastatingly difficult. Watching Yona grow up from episode 1-24 not in terms of age,but personally is a thrilling ride that I don't think anyone should miss.\\n\\n\r\nThough its slow, stick with it, you wont be disappointed.A very refreshing anime.Time to read the manga. \\n\\n",

            "content": "Akatsuki no Yona is definitely a solid anime BUT it is definitely NOT for those who are interested in anime's similar to style, pace and structure of   >>> e.g  nanatsu no taizai or  seirei no morbito .\r\nThough similar in some aspects, this anime does well to differentiate itself from   them and it's probably not in the way you'd if you are the type of person  interested in the previous anime's stated. \r\nWHY??? Because akatsuki no yona is a shoujo romance based anime which inherently increases the pace within episodes and is uhh... ye retarded as fuk ifyou aren't interested.   \\n\\n\r\nStory: 7/10 It's 'OK' but definitely not original. It's somewhat similar to nanatsu no taizai's>> 7 deadly sins instead in this case it's the '4 dragons' ( without spoiling anything) each have their own unique powers and personality + backgrounds which help and constructing interesting char development.\\n\\n\r\n4 drag + the princesses body guard + another smart dude are of to save the country essentially from the bottom>>( this is an objective that develops over time which makes it interesting ) . HOWEVER THE CRINGE WORTHY SHOUJO>>> to reverse harem even at some points... ya it's preety fucked. \\n\\n\r\nArt: Definitely some of the best art I have ever seen from pierrot, in fact I'd say it was somewhat unexpected... 9/10\\n\\n\r\nSound: Again  , really GOOD 9/10 \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 7/10 Somewhat unoriginal however the execution of one in particular 'shin-ah' was insanely tear-jerking to the point it gets you hooked to not particularly want to know about the main plot  BUT THE PLOT BEHIND THIS FKING CHARACTER! \\n\\n\r\nHe also possesses in my opinion the 2nd most broken power in the existence of the adaptation. \\n\\n\r\nBut ye besides that, the rest of the characters are transparent. \\n\r\nWith again THE SHOJO MY FKING GOD! \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 7/10 A point to mention about this adaptation is that hak ( yona's body guard and  childhood male companion ) outputs decent humour throughout the series. But I should also mention that there is an obvious sexual tension that develops between these two characters that eventually becomes so thick you could slice it with a kitchen knife. \\n\\n\r\nOther than that, this anime is definitely enjoyable and not completely hopeless.   \\n\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL 7/10 \\n\\n\r\nI've read up to the latest CH (103 ) when this review is posted...... and if you do not like sexual tensions, romance and everything else that comes with cringe worthy shoujo THAN THIS ANIME IS DEFINITELY NOT FOR YOU!!! \\n\\n\r\nYou are better of finding something else like seirei moribito or Kingdom.\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Overall [9.9/10]\r\nHow should I begin to talk about this amazing piece of work? Akatsuki No Yona is not your typical reverse harem (not really actually) anime and the heroine certainly isn't one to whine and actually gets things done. That was practically one of the best factors for me. Coupled with light humor and an underlying motive in the story, it just made it drastically more appealing for me.\r\nStory [9/10]\r\nPersonally, I believe in bitter starts and hopefully sweet ends, and it brought forth that criteria expertly for me. As I had said, he character had a motive and were not merely just doing nothing andhaving fun. \\n\r\nIt shows moments of happiness but yet you would feel the poignancy of their own pasts as they try to overcome it and develop. Most of all this anime shows that there is hope and perhaps with every villain (again, substantial), there is one that did so for better reasons and there is greater evil in the world. It's incredibly realistic and something most of us at some point or another could relate to.\\n\\n\r\nArt [9/10]\\n\\n\r\nIn 1080p HD, I thought the art looked fabulous. Or perhaps I'm just a sucker for medieval/ancient architecture that has me squealing most of the time. The animation itself flows smoothly and there is one thing that I don't see much in other animes is that they add those little side prints you see in panels of manga. They do it expertly well too and convey the obviousness or hilarity of the situation and I commend them for that. Those little side prints are often neglected and I'm glad to see them put to use, especially when the mangaka herself has an incredible sense of humor. \\n\r\nEverything was pretty and kept to the original drawings, and they even added another effect which was the 'fire' in Yona's eyes. Believe it or not, such a thing does not exist in the manga and it was a nice touch to it. Good job animators :D\\n\\n\r\nSound [10/10]\\n\\n\r\nWhere the hell do I begin on this one? The Openings and Endings are amazing, especially the second opening.\\n\r\nThe voice actors are incredibly talented, as per usual and they sound like they were all having fun as they made this. The best voice acting I ever heard was Hak's Laugh and it does not help at the fact that I know that his voice actor is Decim which makes me want to fan girl even more. Not going to lie; I probably replayed that scene at least 20 times.\\n\r\nThe OST and background music are too, pretty amazing, if you bother to listen closely along with the dialogue. Applied at the right times and not over used, it gets a 10/10. The sound effects like punching and whatnot were pretty good too :)\\n\\n\r\nCharacter [10/10]\\n\\n\r\nI absolutely ADORE -- actually I LOVE the characters. Unique in their own ways, they compliment each other like pieces of a puzzle. \\n\r\nFirst of; Yona. I said this but she is not your typical heroine and one of the heroines I didn't want to slap. Her character development is excellent as you see her evolve from a sheltered and pampered princess into a being that is bigger than herself, willing to toss away the things she had known for her friends to prove her equal loyalty.\\n\r\nHak, her closest companion and having a love interest for the heroine. Dragons, might I say, he has the most patience and willpower ever. In every way for me, he is desirable. Masculine and yet not overly, simple and yet you know beneath it there are complications with himself. He's so frank and amazing and observant. I should stop singing him praises before I think that I'm making out with him.\\n\r\nThe Four Dragons; Ki-ja, Shin-Ah, Jae-Ha, Zeno. Again, Hilarious. They are so... bizarre and yet they pair up with one another. The interactions with one another is priceless as they lament and bond with one another. Most have a dark past and weird force of habits, but that's what makes them amazing and human.\\n\r\nAnd let's not forget Yoon, the pretty boy who is a genius. He is probably the one who we can relate to the most. The one that tries to be the best they can, but sometimes feel like it would never be enough. The one that would want to be praised to make themselves feel better and incredibly reliable. Need i say more?\\n\r\nNext and lastly -- side characters. They are special in their own ways too. They are properly developed and not half-assed and we could see their varied attachments with the main cast. Not drastically obsessive, but it makes you want them to be in the main role, and not just a side effect after one arc. It's the impression I don't often get and I'm grateful this anime had it.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment [10/10]\\n\\n\r\nFrom my long review... This is pretty obvious.\\n\r\nDid I enjoy it immensely? Yes.\\n\r\nWould I watch it again? I already did.\\n\r\nWould I read the manga over and over again? I already did that three times.\\n\r\nThis anime/manga was strangely addicting and I don't regret it one bit.",

            "content": "This is my first time writing a review, and it's because this anime is worth a review. **Little to no spoilers**\r\nStory: 10\r\nThis isn't your typical guy-meets-girl shoujo. It's about a weak girl who was betrayed by her loved one, and was kicked out of the palace. Now, she has to survive in the outside world--which is very different from the life she had in the castle. It's a mix of a lot of things: adventure, comedy, fantasy and a bit of romance. They also know how to balance the comedy and the serious scenes. The pacing was not too slow, and not too fast either.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 10\\n\r\nThe art was amazing. All of the characters and background were well-drawn. The art had an \"anime feel\" to it. The art wasn't so realistic, as to question whether you're watching an anime or a drama. The character designs were unique, and it suited the characters well. For example, the colour of their hair actually gives an idea of what they are (e.g. White Dragon=White Hair).\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9\\n\r\nYou don't see(or rather, hear) instrumental openings everyday. The first OP was peaceful, I can't complain about it. But the second OP made me feel like there was something wrong with my headphones, when I first listened to it. I think it grew on me, but I still prefer the first OP. The first ED was kind of too emotional(and slow) for me, therefore I prefer the second ED. Actually, \"prefer\" is the wrong word. I loved the second ED. It really screamed \"Akatsuki no Yona\". It was calm, and yet adventurous. It fits the anime very well.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10\\n\r\nThe characters were all well-developed that you'll find it hard to pick a favourite. All the characters were lovable (Yes, even the villain.). I find it really hard to hate the villain. He was such a cool and gentle character, but I guess people are all entitled to their opinions. The interactions between the characters are all so cute, it made me smile at my computer screen.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10\\n\r\nI wouldn't have written a review if it wasn't enjoyable. I haven't watched a good anime in a long time. A good anime in my opinion has to have a good story-line, and good art. This is one of those animes. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 10",

            "content": "(This has been adapted from my reddit thread)\r\nThe other day, for one reason or another, while talking with my wonderful mother, we stumbled upon the topic of the universe. Specifically about the scale of it all; how its literal astronomical size seems too daunting to comprehend. But how does this relate to Akatsuki no Yona, an anime that has about as much relation to outer space as does a piece of paper? Well, condense the thinking: despite the vastness of it all, we exist here, right now, at this very moment. Therefore, is it too silly or arrogant to think that we have some \"reason\"for living? That, perhaps, our life should have some purpose to it all? It is quite the interesting thought, one that this anime explores with some elegance.\\n\\n\r\nSTORY\\n\\n\r\nAkatsuki no Yona's main heroine is Yona, the daughter of the current King Il. But after a savage turn of events, Yona flees the castle with her trusted body guard, Hak Son, beginning her on the road of a life-changing journey.\\n\\n\r\nWhat's intriguing about the show is that the actual narrative and setting lends itself well to the adventurous nature that it embraces. Taking place in a China-like land, the era the cast find themselves in contains: kings, lords, clans, wars, and feuds. Therefore many of the conflicts revolve around these separate facets that predated modern society. Startling betrayal of close confidants, deceptive tactics to cause territorial harm, and unruly rulers holding an iron grip over a harbor town are just a smattering of what the show has to offer. But it's also more than just the problems that are faced. The background also serves well for the plot's direction, too. It's a classic tale that fits nicely in this classical setting; essentially, Yona is tasked with \"finding X amount of Y,\" where X is four and Y is the Dragon descendants. This sounds more mathematical than fantastical, but this formula works in tandem with the aforementioned adventuring. In essence, the anime becomes segmented into distinct arcs, making it a quest whose end is already known. The audience knows that Yona will acquire her destined companions, so it becomes not a question of if but a question of how. Thus, the show plays out, with significant focus on each soon-to-be acquired group member -- Ki-ja, Shin-ah, Jae-ha, etc. -- allowing ample time for everyone involved in the main cast to hold a spot in the overall equation.\\n\\n\r\nWhere Akatsuki no Yona dips slightly, and somewhat ironically, is in not having enough variables fleshed out. Speaking more concretely, while the focus on Yona, Hak, and the rest of the troupe is evident, exorbitant even, the focus on Soo-won, \"the bad guys,\" and the neutrals are not. This may not even be the anime's fault; it obviously needs to follow the escapades of the main cast. But much of Soo-won's motivations and the happenings of everyone else that is not Yona is left mostly up in the air. Part of the reason for this is to maintain a feeling of mystery; enshrouding Soo-won's actions in darkness leaves his character up for contention. In other words, it's not wholly apparent if he is good or evil. But with such little limelight given to him and the rest of the kingdom, there isn't much background or tension to make Yona's quest seem worthwhile.\\n\\n\r\nYet, the show manages to keep itself upright by making the trek itself have meaning. What is this saying? The idea of \"having a purpose\" has already been presented, and is what the anime follows wonderfully. Yona's journey is one where she finds not just the rest of the Dragons, but also herself. She comes to learn of the world that her father \"kept safe:\" its poverty, disease, seclusion, and human trafficking. What she learns is that the world isn't so well off. In fact, she almost cannot believe its state. And so what she concludes that she must do, what her purpose has become, is to protect those people she never knew needed protecting. And this theme is rampant within all parts of the show: the Dragons must follow their directive, the different villages harbored these fated men, Hak has his duty, Ik-su provides the prophecies, etc. Whether such purpose is predetermined or predicated doesn't matter. For the show's message is that, whether you be a servant of a castle or a local pirate mother, everyone has a purpose.\\n\\n\r\nANIMATION\\n\\n\r\nThe art for Akatsuki no Yona is difficult to describe. On the one hand, it's quite situational. And that's in every sense of the word: forests, towns, castles, cliff-sides, and caves are regularly visited, making the world itself seem vast, venerable, and vibrant. On top of this, everything fits nicely with the feudal, China setting discussed earlier. On the other hand, though, the environments are not particularly gorgeous nor are they horrid to look at. In short, they serve their purpose as set pieces without enough pizzazz to make them captivating. The anime also employs a cartoon-like style during the many comedic moments it boasts, which is used to good effect.\\n\\n\r\nThe character designs are well done for each of the cast members. Yona's fiery-red hair and peasant outfit; Hak's signature weapon and blue robe; and the Dragons' respective colors, attire, and uniqueness in details are all well-crafted. One gets a real sense of their power and importance by simply looking at them.\\n\\n\r\nActual animation is usually slightly above average. There are certain segments where it really picks up -- Hak's \"one versus many\" battle in the mountains is a great example of this -- but it consistently remains at a general evenness. There is a good amount of talking and sitting that is interjected with action sequences here and there, and while they have their nice moments of animation, the majority is not overly impressive.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS\\n\\n\r\nAkatsuki no Yona contains a nice cast of characters, from the mains to the sides.\\n\\n\r\nAt the top of the totem pole, but not so in royalty any longer, sits Yona. Kind of heart yet ignorant of the world outside the walls of her castle, she discovers that the former isn't always found in the latter. She falls from dainty princess to defenseless plebeian, with such a predicament resting uneasily within her. Not for the fact that she is no longer pampered or waited on, but for the fact that she feels helpless, that she is incapable of doing anything remotely worthy of her and Hak's situation. Her mindset changes with her hair; the cutting of one's flowing locks is symbolic of change for the better, which is exactly what Yona undergoes. After learning of the legend she is slated to take part in, she goes from feeling helpless to wanting to be helpful. And this is what happens over the course of the anime; her eyes face the reality of the kingdom she's never truly known, getting to experience its people, its cultures, and its hardships. Slowly but surely, she transitions from having to rely to standing on her own. By journey's end, while it is clear she has yet to fully relinquish everything from her past, her sights are firmly set on becoming the aid her people have always desired.\\n\\n\r\nAs for Hak, the other lead found from start to finish, he sits in a rather precarious position. Stoic, strong, and stupendous at fighting, he's one of a handful of people who initially sides with the young Yona. The beginning of the anime showcases his past; childhood friends with both Yona and Soo-won, but relegated as a bodyguard as opposed to ascending as the object of her affection. That is the source of his inner conflict: loving the girl who doesn't love him back, trusting her enough to do things on her own, suppressing his desires, wondering how she's doing, wanting to be by her side, and acting jealous of the man she cannot seem to forget. Those are way too many emotions for a single person to handle, let alone one of them. And while Hak fights his true feelings, he doesn't always win; there are times when he can't hold back his passion for her. Most of all, he's scared. Scared of her becoming powerful enough to no longer \"need\" him. Because he wants her to need him, more so than anything else in the world. And thus the mighty \"Thunder Beast's\" only weakness is revealed: it's not having his love go unreciprocated but losing it entirely.\\n\\n\r\nThe rest of the important members -- Yun, Ki-ja, Shin-ah, and Jae-ha -- all typically follow the same route. Find said character, discover what makes him unique, explore his past, and ultimately add him to the gang. This process sounds monotonous, but it's not; each character is given ample time to be developed within his respective arc. Even after his arc ends, the character still plays a role within the narrative and group, but isn't the sole focus anymore -- that is granted to the next person in line. What's most important about each of the characters, though, is their reason for joining. There has already been talk of purpose, but each is driven by another factor: Yona herself. This just isn't due to the Dragon's blood coursing through their veins. They all understand something through her that they themselves couldn't. Jae-ha realizes the worth in struggling as opposed to staying content. Shin-ah finally feels compassion from another. Ki-ja has someone who he can closely relate to in status. Yun learns to avoid being so judgmental. And Hak has something he loves more than words can describe. In other words, while Yona needs all of them in order to achieve the goals she has set for the future, they likewise need her to feel complete in the lives they live.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND\\n\\n\r\nPart of what makes the first OP so good is its lack of lyrics. Being able to engross one's self in the violins, flutes, and drums, without being distracted by a vocalist, is what the piece nails. It's orchestral, fleeting, and foreboding, all at the same time.\\n\\n\r\nThe second OP is weird. It doesn't fit, at all, with the show's mood or general atmosphere. But the slapping guitar, catchy up-and-down beat, and modern-pop tone makes it, at the minimum, quite interesting to listen to.\\n\\n\r\nThe first ED slows everything down. The male singer starts off quiet, working in harmony with the gentle guitar playing. The halfway point introduces the hard guitar, and the song continues with this combination until its end. The piece is okay, and easily the worst of the four.\\n\\n\r\nThe second ED, however, is a fantastic track. It begins with a resounding chorus, which leads into quiet, whispering singing backed by a light guitar. Then it hits its stride, with the vocalist and background singers working in unison. The instruments follow the beautiful vocal work, with the beat maintaining a nice rhythm. Overall, it perfectly captures the vibes of the anime itself.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack contains tense, violin-filled tracks during suspenseful moments; gracefully-chimed and flute-and-guitar tracks during the more peaceful ones; and piano arrangements that appear for the scenes that are significant or moving. The soundtrack is wonderfully composed, lining itself nicely with what the anime has to offer.\\n\\n\r\nAnd as for voice-acting, it's somewhere between average to above-average. A special shout-out goes to Chiwa Saito as Yona for her perky voice.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT\\n\\n\r\nThe anime was quite hilarious throughout its run. The various character interactions and their respective antics -- Shin-ah's way of sleeping, Yona's obliviousness to Hak's feelings, Hak's abrasiveness towards Jae-ha, and Ki-ja's embarrassment during certain situations -- were well polished. It made for an exciting and comedic time when the show wasn't showcasing drama or fighting.\\n\\n\r\nAnd that drama was usually quite thrilling, too. Seeing Soo-won's treacherous actions, watching Hak desperately try to break through a cave-in, or being taken aback by the fiery intimidation that emanated from Yona's eyes; such scenes usually had me wondering what was in store for the cast at the next turn of events.\\n\\n\r\nAkatsuki no Yona concludes in a rather open-ended fashion. But with its interesting storytelling, nice characters, and orchestral music, the show leaves me anticipating the rise of that next, new dawn.\\n\\n\r\nSUMMARY\\n\\n\r\nStory: Good, fantastical setting helps itself, not enough focus on \"not Yona and gang,\" literally thematically purposeful\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: Fine, okay art style, good character designs, average actual animation\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Good, Yona and Hak develop nicely, with the side characters seeing both growth and understanding\\n\\n\r\nSound: Good, good first OP, okay second OP, okay first ED, great second ED, great soundtrack, average VA work\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Good, strangely really funny, nice dramatic sequences, but not totally in love with the show\\n\\n\r\nFinal Score: 7/10",

            "content": "Describe the structure of this anime, and you\u2019ll get a shounen. Add the genders of the characters, and it\u2019ll read as if this anime tries to deconstruct both Shoujo and Shounen for some grand statement about anime, sexuality and the target audience. Watch it, and it\u2019s just a simple story about collecting plot coupons in the shapes of handsome guys which all happen to be engaging characters. It\u2019s odd how Yona opted for doing a simple adventure story when it could do so much more.\r\nIt\u2019s not bad, just bizarre. Most anime \u2013 or stories in general \u2013 that aim for a simple, exciting adventureshave low aspirations. They aim for a bit of fun, some wacky designs and battles, a few dramatic mission statements and a big explosion to signal the climax. Yona has all the ingredients to uplift this formula to something serious, yet it\u2019s content in basic storytelling. At least it has a good reason. As an example of adventure stories, Yona is fantastic.\\n\\n\r\nThe first thing a storyteller must decide is what\u2019s the meaning of his adventure. This meaning doesn\u2019t have to be explored with all its philosophical layers and references to dead white European males. Rather, this meaning will serve as an emotional core, to make us care about what\u2019s going on. We always care about things because they mean something, anything.\\n\\n\r\nYona starts with emotional hooks and never lets them go. A common mistake is turning your adventure into a set of obstacles to overcome using skills and badassery. Yona, instead, has a running theme connecting all these stages. What\u2019s dominating is a specific type of coming of age. It\u2019s not just about learning about the world outside, but realizing how different the bubble you were in is to the world.\\n\\n\r\nWhat makes characters interesting and meaningful is what they do with their circumstances. Yona\u2019s bubble doesn\u2019t just burst. Rather, she doesn\u2019t give up on her bubble but tries to reform it. In every place she goes to, she uses the lessons she grew up on \u2013 love, comfort, and softness \u2013 and bestows it upon the people. Her battle against the trafficking of women isn\u2019t plain morality. Yona aims for a specific type of world, some kind of replica of what she used to live. Notice her treatment of the dragons. She never demands that they\u2019ll join her moral crusade. She reacts in the same way her father did, she hopes they\u2019ll join them of her own will. Her gang is designed like her father\u2019s world, where everyone is nice to each other.\\n\\n\r\nAs a female character, Yona is fascinating. On the surface, she\u2019s a weak female character who needs her guys, weapons, and a shorter hair for validation. That\u2019s because we\u2019re so used to aggressive personalities. Even if our women aren\u2019t warriors, we expect strong characters to shout and care nothing at all about others.\\n\\n\r\nYona may be feminine, but it is hardly a weakness. She has a worldview that guides her, that is uniquely hers. The actions are never convenient and her moral system isn\u2019t a simple case of doing good. Beyond that, everyone actually relies on her. The source of meaning isn\u2019t just a way of moving the plot. The dragons don\u2019t join smoothly, and each views their situation differently. Nevertheless, Yona is the ultimate guide of the gang. The meaning of the journey, of remaking the world as a softer, more comfortable place to live comes from her.\\n\\n\r\nAlthough she rarely takes active, aggressive action she always remains dominant. That\u2019s because every conflict is an examination of her personality, and she changes. Everyone else just helps her with the technical details of getting food and scouting.\\n\\n\r\nThe anime also treats its antagonist well. Soo-won is a character of contrasts. His presentation is always a flip of what we before. It goes beyond the beginning, where he\u2019s a smiling angel who turns out to be murderous. In two episodes, he\u2019s the main character. We see how he runs the kingdom, what his views are of how it should be. It\u2019s a shame the series is so short and doesn\u2019t give him enough screen time. He\u2019s a cold, calculated person who\u2019s a fantastic actor. He also, when choosing a purpose, pursues it aggressively.\\n\\n\r\nAn aggressive personality doesn\u2019t necessarily translate to a cruel reign, but an efficient one. In a few instances, the anime is an excellent exploration of a benevolent monarchy. Although Soo-Won is cold, his aggressive pursuit brings him to a lot of victories. He manages to lift up a situation that King Il couldn\u2019t, and without aggression he couldn\u2019t do that. It\u2019s a shame he has little screen time. The creators use the screen time to display both sides, but they never clarify the connection between them.\\n\\n\r\nEach arc stands on its own, carry its own meanings, main characters and tones. The anime borders on experimental, with one arc flirting heavily with horror. The result is that despite having a structure of plot coupons, it never feels this way. Yona needs to collect all dragons to cash them in for End of Plot, but each tale of getting the coupon stands for itself. The stories are so different. One is about a comically religious village. Another is about an underground village living in constant fear. Another is about overthrowing the asshole ruler. Separate these stories from the big picture, and they stand on their own. A formulaic structure doesn\u2019t matter so long as the parts are good, and this anime is a clear proof of this.\\n\\n\r\nThat\u2019s why although its ending is one of the worst in the style of \u2018no ending\u2019, it\u2019s still great. Many complain about anime that don\u2019t really end, but often they do conclude their small arc. Yona is one of the few that builds up to a big conflict and never gets to it. It doesn\u2019t even use its final arc to conclude all the ideas that happened before. The anime doesn\u2019t set itself up as an episode in a gigantic story \u2013 like, say, Attack on Titan \u2013 but a straightforward adventure where we expect the hero and the villain to meet at the end for some milk, cookies, philosophical discussions and an exchange of blows. It ends by collecting all the coupons and never cashing them in. Since everything that happened before is good enough, it doesn\u2019t ruin the anime but it\u2019s still disappointing.\\n\\n\r\nThe art style is delightlyfully shoujo. The eyes are quite big. Yona is feminine, with a red hair that\u2019s not just red, but sore red. It\u2019s the kind of red that you don\u2019t wear to your workplace because it\u2019s too attention-grabbing. The guys are also all handsome. While the designs are appealing, few are distinct. Yona is beautiful, but that\u2019s expected from a shoujo anime that doesn\u2019t think feminine is an insult. As for the other characters, only Soo-Won has an interesting design. His soft side is expressed in his long, bright hair and warm expression that has a long, rather than wide smile. Everyone else fits their characters, but Hak\u2019s rugged look is typical dark short hair. Yun is another honorable mention. As an attempt to make a pretty boy, it\u2019s excellent. We never see much of this handsome male look. We see male characters who are handsome, but not those whose looks is a major selling point.\\n\\n\r\nYona is a straightforward adventure anime. What it aims to do isn\u2019t special, but what makes it special is how well it understands the adventure story. It manages to overcome a non-existent ending, and you can only do that by having separate arcs which still gel together, by having characters that breathe life to these arcs. Occasionally, it shuffles the pieces around but it\u2019s more for entertainment effect rather than subversion. Still, if you want to experience pure storytelling, this is it.\\n\\n\r\n3.5 dragons out of 5",

By the course of the anime, it proved me (and even those who watched it) wrong!\r\nYona, at first, is your typical spoiled princess who grew up with a doting father as King of Kouka Kingdom. She also had caring friends, Hak and Su-Won. She can get what she wants. She has a prefect life (as some may say), but it all goes upside down when a betrayal destroyed the Kingdom. The death of his fatherfrom the hands of his first love, Su-Won urged Yona to get everything back where it belong and put an end to all the conflict. With the help of his loyal bodyguard and friend, Hak, she improves herself, seeks the help of the 4 Dragons and embarks on an exciting adventure to bring peace back to Kouka Kingdom... and prove herself to be not your ordinary princess!\\n\\n\r\nI had a lot of fun watching this series. You just gotta love the development on Yona's character. The sorrow, the passion and the desire for peace is what I guess made Yona kept going on. Now that's not something you see always on reverse-harem themed series.\\n\\n\r\nHak, on the other hand, is a really, really amazing character. She supported Yona, protected her, although sometimes he teases her, you can still see how much he cares for Yona. Yes, I SHIP HAK x YONA :))\\n\\n\r\nOn the other hand, the other characters are equally essential for Yona's development as a character. Yun being the support of the group, Ki-ja, Shin-ah and Jae-ha being the direct support in battles, and Zeno... well, the clown? I dunno, I'm gonna read the manga to know Zeno more. haha!\\n\\n\r\nAnimation, for the most part is amazing! You just got to love the art in Yona's bloodlust. THAT'S IS FREAKING CREEPY AND AMAZING AT THE SAME TIME!\\n\\n\r\nMusic-wise, it was good too~! You just got to love every BGM used in every scene. The OST is equally good, as well.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I really do enjoyed the series. It broke the cliches of reverse-harem animes out there. Yona is a badass! I really do hope for a Season 2. For now, I'll be reading the manga while waiting. Highly recommended to all those who want something different. Trust me, you won't regret watching this. :)",

When it is something coming into comedy, it really makes me laugh since their jokes are pretty much hilarious when you first see it. After the cries, the show make you brighten up by containing the jokes.\r\nThe music, is truly amazing and fitting in scenes making us really imagining what Yona is going through. The art have probably took them a long time, especially theeyes and hair which makes it unbelievably hard for producers since they didn't leave out a single detail. Characters are mostly developed, except for the Yellow Dragon.\\n\r\nAkatsuki no Yona leaves several question marks in our head since there is no potential antagonist right now since Soo Won cannot considered to be bad right now. Soo Won has his own ways in doing things just like Yona.\\n\\n\r\nI'M WAITING FOR THE SECOND SEASON WHERE I HIGHLY BELIEVE WILL COME OUT.",

            "content": "Why do I always write my sucky reviews when I'm sick?? No clue! Here goes!\r\nOfc this review will be basted of what has happened up until ep 6. If there is a manga I haven't read it. This is only anime based! I will try my best not to spoil anything!\r\nStory:\r\nYona is the princess of a kingdom that is divided between 4 elemental tribes all Avatar style! Her father is a kind and wimpy king whom everyone seems to like. Her cousin and life love murders her father on her birthday which forces her to flee the palace with her bodyguard/childhood friend and seek away to make things right as well as to find herself.\\n\\n\r\nThe story in itself is pretty engaging, but what really works is the way Yona evolves! \\n\r\nThat said she only started doing that in episode 5. The first episodes are kinda slow paced which leaves you hanging for a while. For me some of the humor(which can be pretty out of place) makes up for that. It's thrown in a bit here and there and gives the show a pretty unique style when it's at it's lowest. The slow start has great payback tough as sh*t really starts hitting the fan in ep 5, so it's all good!\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nThis is funny as there are A LOT of characters who take up pretty much 50% of the opening who hasn't shown up yet. I am slightly worried that they won't get the development they need, but I'll let the writers take care of that. I'm looking forward to them anyhow!\\n\\n\r\nYona is our main. She starts out as a spoiled princess who only has eyes for her cousin Soo-won. She is energetic and a bit of a tsundere with no clue of the world, and this MAKES her! As we've seen in the opening already she will develop into a warrior princess, and I could not be happier with that! She started her development a couple of episodes ago, but in the latest episode we finally got a glimpse of the future which looks very bright!\\n\r\nHak is her childhood friend and closest servant. He is the leader of the wind tribe (No they don't have arrows on their heads) and the best warrior in the land!\\n\r\nSo far he hasn't gotten any development. They have the typical childhood friends relationship of bickering and teasing, and he has an indestructible loyalty towards Yona. I doubt his character will develop much more, but he's there to be the right hand handsome future love interest, so it's fine.\\n\r\nYona's cousin and father's murderer Soo-won. . . Is an asshole! That's what I know about him so far. His reason for killing the king is based on nothing as far as I'm concerned, and he gives off this \"You're supposed to feel sorry for me even tough I'm a bastard\" vibe.\\n\\n\r\nLook and sound:\\n\r\nThe animation is nothing spectacular in either the bad or good direction. Studio pierrot can be very good and very bad, so this is a nice go-between. The colors pop a bit too much if you ask me, but it can be overlooked.\\n\r\nThe music is the biggest downfall for this show so far. It's very ill-placed at times and very repetitive. I really liked the opening which is only an orchestra piece which gives a very epic feel. While I still like it they've also used it in the show a couple of times already which lessens the epic feel. I just hope that they'll work better with the music from here on out because the timing is really bugging me.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nSo far it's not fantastic and it's not bad. Today's episode got my hype back up as it showed a new side to multiple characters and I'm looking forward to seeing where the next step will lead!\\n\\n\r\nIf you're into historical, comedy, romance, or drama anime you should give it a few episodes and see what you think! I think it'll be worthy of your time!\\n\\n\r\nNow I will try to go to sleep as it's 2am, and hopefully I'll not sleep until 12 o'clock! (If I do I won't be able to wake up for school on Thursday. . .)\\n\r\nGood night to you!",

            "content": "Overall this anime started really good and caught my interest immediately. The time period seems to be around 1860 and it brings back this old medieval feeling which I myself love where there's no firearms or magic involved but however there is over-natural involved but it does quite fit the style of anime and I do not hope that there will be fireballs flying around in this anime as it just doesn't fit in. \r\nThe first op is just wonderful as it comes to music. The instrumental music is just so gorgeous and there is no lyrics to it and it speaks to me thatthis is the typical cultural music of japan and I love it! However the opening spoils way too much. When you play the first episode of Akatsuki no Yona, you see the main character (Yona) and her little fighting squad which is just a spoiler that shows you the characters who will appear later in the anime and doesn't do anything else than that. As an example what I would prefer better was a proper introduction of Yona and makes people see that wildfire in her eyes which would confuse the watchers after the op as you see her as a princess.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is quite default when it comes to the surroundings but the characters are pretty well made as they capture most of their emotions in their eyes and as they add the comical touch to it with small ball eyes, a colorful background and thick black contours. \\n\\n\r\nSomething that felt very charming was the story. After the first episode was completed, it was impossible to stop there. The story-line is clear and the objective of the anime is quite obvious but I love it. The anime is somehow resembling as a game where Yona, the hero of the story must seek out power to accomplish her goal. Very heroic which is also a huge clich\u00e9. Yona is indeed a character who starts out very weak but as the story goes on, she becomes strong and wants to help those that she keeps close. \\n\\n\r\nI like when there's a hero like that and she doesn't take to much spotlight neither which just makes it even better. But something that is bugging me is that the story goes too fast. I can see in front of me, sitting here in my chair watching the 200 episode of Akatsuki no Yona since you can create something so big out of these characters and this story but the writers just decides to rush things down. \\n\\n\r\nHak for example is the bodyguard of Yona and they have been friends since childhood and now he is the one protecting her from all the trouble happening in the world, one of the characters that has a kind of slow character development but there's a lot of potential and stuff to work with like for an example if Hak would turn mad and depressed for (just and example, it does not happen in the anime) Son Mundok getting executed which results in Hak leaving Yona and the others and taking the anime on a feel trip. \\n\\n\r\nBut one thing is happening after another which is way too fast and it just gets you closer and closer to the end of it which makes less room for more character development or making us viewers to bond with the characters making us more attached to them. You need to find a balance between going too fast and going too slow and right now, the anime is tipping over at going too fast which lowers my overall rating quite a bit. However the anime is really well done and it's so interesting, it made me think that this would turn out to be huge as there is SO much potential in it so I give it 7/10\\n\\n",

But I just coulnd't give a 10 because of the ending. It was left in the air, with no proper ending(?!) There's no explenantion about what happens between Hak and Yona, there's no explenantion about what happens with Su-Woon and the kingdom. I was deeply disappointed by the way everything ended.(8) \r\nArt: I just love this type of animation, and that's why the score is pretty subjective. It was very similar to Naruto's animation, and that's why it wasvery pleasurable for me to watch.(10) \\n\\n\r\nSound: Some of the soundtracks are pretty good, but it wasn't nothing WOW. It was ok, but nothing that would stick to my mind, unlike others' Op and music.(8)\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: The characters are amazing, I love them! They developed very smoothly. But, again... the story was left in the air so there are so many details about the characters that needed much more.(10)\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Well, I really enjoyed this anime, but at the end I was disappointed and mad... Everything ended like crashed in a wall. (10)\\n\\n\r\nOverall: I gave it an 8 just because of the ending and the music. Everything else was fine.(8)",

            "content": "Akatsuki no Yona is a lovely anime. Unlike most anime/manga there is always a man as main character (mc), but here we got a beautiful young lady.\r\nStory 8: I would say the story scores highest from me. First of all because it's a woman as a main character. We don't see that often. What I love about the story is that we follow a cheerful, very weak both physical and mental, happy girl, Yona, with very less self-confident. But after a incident happens, she turns into a more powerful women both in physical and mental physical and mental. After that incident she get aware what'shappening outside the castle she were living in before when she start traveling around the kingdoms. Once she realized that she is even more determined to take over the throne from a certain guy and get the people's trust. \\n\\n\r\nAs I said in a mysterious way we got to see that women aren't so weak as they always have said to be, but can be strong characters. And i am still waiting for that day when she kick a certain bastard's ass and take the throne herself. ^_^\\n\\n\r\nArt 7: The art is very good. I love how they drawn Yona furious and burning eyes. It's very nice done. \\n\\n\r\nSound 7: The OST are good. Not the best, but good. The only OST I love very much is the first OP. It shows us that shit gonna get real and give us a good fighting spirit. At the same time, the OST show us that this an adventure anime with a lot of comedy and enjoy. The second OST I love very much is the 2nd ending. It fits so well with the anime. Once you hear this OST it makes you think about Yona and her action and how determine she is to win the people trust. \\n\\n\r\nI would give the sound 8 if it weren't for the 2nd OP. Though the song is very lovely it doesn't fit with the anime. Techno doesn't fit with a adventure anime like this. They should a more calmer song for the opening like the first one. One that rise the fighting spirit, but at the same time is very lovely and full of enjoy. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters 6: Though I love that the mc is a woman and it show us how strong a woman can be, I still disappointed that Yona have no girls in her team. I mean if the main point is to show how strong women can be, they should at least add one girl in her team. That disappoint me very much. \\n\\n\r\nSomething else I think they should have done something with is that how far less Yona's strength is developing. I mean the male characters like Hak and white dragon have a overwhelming strength, but Yona's strength is developing so slow. I mean it would better to show how strong women can be if they increased her strength a bit. But the fault lies with the mangaka too since this anime is based on a manga. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 7: As I have said many times I love this anime and the main reason for that is that it show the strength of women. That makes me enjoy the anime even more. What is also good is that it has a lot of humour that makes you laugh throughout the episodes. \\n\\n\r\nOverall 7: Overall I think it's a great anime. It has a lot of potential and has a very good plot. It's just too sad that this anime have only 3 ep. left for this season. I were very curious about the yellow dragon as a character, but I guess we have to wait another time for that. :P \\n\\n\r\nI recommend this anime to anyone that loves to have a girl as a mc and loves to see how strong women can be. So if you want to see something good, funny and adventurous this is the anime for you. :)",

            "content": "Yona of the Dawn is one of those anime that can appeal to both male and female anime fans. While there are a lot of those, most shojo anime don't often appeal to the male demographic because, well, a lot of them are like chick-lit\u2014an abbreviation of literature who's demographic is, well, chicks.\r\nThe story starts off with Yona, a spoiled princess who's used to getting her way and doesn't like her fiery red hair. I have to be honest, I didn't really like her character at the start of the anime, but I can't deny that they did a really good job creating her. Yonaacts exactly as I would imagine a spoiled princess would. She's carefree and worries about the most trivial of matters. She's stubborn and likes to have her way. At the same time, Yona isn't a bad person.\\n\\n\r\nYona has two friends at the start of this series. Soo-Wan and Hak. Soo-Wan is Yona's cousin, and the person she's in love with, while Hak is her bodyguard and a general in the Kou Empire's army known as the Lightning Beast. During the first episode, Soo-Wan kills Yona's father, and he almost kills Yona. It's only thanks to Soo-Wan's help that she manages to escape with her life and flee the castle.\\n\\n\r\nWhat sets this anime apart from other shojo series is first and foremost, the story itself. Typical shojo anime generally involve three things: a high school setting, a lot of teenage drama, and a romantic pairing. While Yona of the Dawn does have it's fair share of drama, it's not the kind you'd find high schoolers dealing with. This is like a political drama with moments of intense action and humor to relieve the tension. Also, while there IS romance, it's not the kind of high school romance that's so typical of a series like this.\\n\\n\r\nOut of all the characters in the series, my favorite is definitely Hak. He's just one of those characters that you can't help but want to get behind. He's strong, has a sharp tongue, and a strong sense of duty. I was really impressed with his loyalty to Yona. Despite how often he pokes fun of her, you can see how much he cares about her as well.\\n\\n\r\nThe dialogue between Yona and Hak is also something I enjoyed a lot. Dialogue is always a tricky issue. In a lot of anime and TV shows, the dialogue tends to sound forced, as if they were reading lines from a script\u2014which they are, but when someone sounds like they're forcing out words, you can really tell. The dialogue in Yona of the Dawn is smooth and flows easily. It doesn't sound forced, especially when it comes to the conversations Hak and Yona have. Having a childhood friend myself, I can tell you that the good-natured teasing is something that we do. Saying that, my childhood friend isn't a girl, so all of the heavy romantic undertones that can be found during certain scenes feels a bit off to me, but I can accept it because of their close relationship.\\n\\n\r\nWhat really surprised me about this anime, outside of my much I enjoyed it, was the animation. While shojo anime aren't poorly animated, I feel like many of them are lacking when it comes to fluid animations. This is generally because the highest focus isn't on the animation but on the romance. Yona of the Dawn is one of the better animated series I've seen. I was especially impressed by the fight scenes, which I felt were incredibly well choreographed.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, where this anime really shines isn't the animation, the artwork, or even the story. It's the development of Yona as a person. At the beginning of this series, Yona is your stereotypical spoiled princess. Through the course of the series, she goes through a series of hardships, starting with the murder of her father and the betrayel of her beloved Soo-Wan. By the end of the series, Yona is almost unrecognizable from the spoiled girl that she had been at the beginning. Her metamorphosis from weak little girl to strong female protagonist is one of the most well-done examples of character development I've seen.\\n\\n\r\nSomething to take note of in this anime is that all of the characters are fairly likable. There was no one that I truly hated. Even the antagonist of the series, Soo-Wan, is someone who I can't find myself outright disliking despite what he did at the beginning.\\n\\n\r\nIf there was one issue I'd take with this series, it's that it's incomplete. There are more loose ends than Yona has split ends, and the main issue, the plot that this entire anime revolves around, was never resolved. Now, I understand that the manga is currently an ongoing series. Even so, I hate it when I watch something that doesn't have a conclusive ending because it always leaves me unsatisfied. Since this was one of the anime that I really enjoyed watching, seeing such a unresolved ending was particularly hard.\\n\\n\r\nThat's all for today's review.

            "content": "Hey you! YES you! Read this review. Watch this anime. This is an order, not a request, and it is for your own good. Akatsuki No Yona is nothing short of a masterpiece, and every single anime fan needs to watch it. \r\nI am a big fan of medieval AUs myself, so it was no surprise that I was interested when I read the summary. The whole idea sounded fascinating, so I decided to give it a try. Seeing as it was a shoujo, I was expecting an annoying, hot, forceful guy whose assaulting behavior was written off as romance, a ditsy heroine with aboutas much personality as a pancake, overpowered fight scenes, and a cliche conclusion. \\n\\n\r\nIt took me less than one episode to realize that I was wrong. \\n\\n\r\nThe story, to begin with, was phenomenal. I docked a point off for the unfinishedness of the ending and the rushing of the last episode, but other than that, there were no plotholes, nothing was overly repetitive, and everything was really realistic, compelling and interesting to watch. \\n\\n\r\nThe art was gorgeous. A great amount of the show takes place outdoors, and all the backgrounds are drawn beautifully. The characters were all distinct and unique without being outlandish, still retaining classiness. Yona, especially, was drawn really well. \\n\\n\r\nI watched the dubs (easier to watch while doing something else; tho I can't say I got much done while this amazing show was on) and the voice actors all put emotion into their roles, making it a pretty good dub. The opening and closing themes were amazing, fitting the show perfectly. Definitely would listen to them again. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters, oh gosh. Every single character is an amazingly written piece of art. Yona, to begin with, is amazing. That fact that I can remember a heroine's name is an amazing fact on its own-- they're usually so annoying and forgettable that I just tune them out entirely. However, she was so much fun and so REAL that I found myself liking a female character for the first time in years. The guys were all amazing as well, with each one having his own quirks and personality traits that set him apart from the rest. The relationships between the characters were interesting and created an awesome dynamic. As for our dear villain--- I couldn't hate him, he was just so well written! I won't spoil too much about him though, just go ahead and watch the first episode. :) \\n\\n\r\nOverall, I enjoyed this and binged it much faster than I've binged shows in a long time... I can say that my 'working life' suffered a lot on account of it. Take caution and start watching this when you know you have time to binge. \\n\\n\r\nI would recommend this if you: like medieval AUs, like strong heroines, like reverse harems, like group dynamics/relationships/friendships, like dragons, like magic, like long journeys, enjoy tales of betrayal and love and revenge and war\\n\\n\r\nI would NOT recommend this if you: don't like medieval AUs or princesses, want something especially dark, want a lot of romance/reverse harem going on opposed to plot\\n\\n\r\nHave a great day everyone!",

            "content": "Akatsuki no Yona is a show about a young, innocent, spoiled princess named Yona who is suddenly betrayed by the man Soo-won who she loved when he starts a coup de'etat and murders her father in front of her eyes. She is then thrust out of her castle as a fugitive and is forced into a world unknown to her with only her childhood friend Hak to protect her. She sets off on a journey to find the four dragons and take back her kingdom.\r\nWhat sets the story apart from others is the depth in which they go into the issues surrounding the kingdom. Eachstory arc is centered around an individual issue that is occurring in separate areas such as human trafficking, isolation and fear, and starvation. Issues that occur throughout the world into today that normally people aren't willing to discuss.\\n\\n\r\nEach arc is extremely fleshed out and detailed, causing a slow pacing to the anime which may be a turn off for some. The arcs are made to be long so that each dragon can be developed and understood as a person which is a rare gem in shows these days. They are all given a story, a reason to join with Yona, and a chance to shine as a new character.\\n\\n\r\nYona -the main character- is a particularly interesting and phenomenal character. She is known throughout the kingdom as a small frail looking girl with eyes and hair that flame with the strength and passion of the sun. During the day she seeks to help her people from the shadows, traveling through the kingdom and helping the sick and poor in the villages along the way. Restlessly she spends the nights practicing sword fighting and shooting her bow so that she can be of use to those who wish to protect her.\\n\\n\r\nShe is a young girl who is weak and helpless, and she admits that she is. Throughout the story she seeks to become stronger in her own way so that she can protect her kingdom and those who she loves. She stands guard in front of the weak to defend them from harm even if she knows she is no match for the aggressor. She even goes as far as to cut her treasured hair in order to free herself from burdening Hak which in my opinion was one of the most startling and beautiful moments in the show.\\n\\n\r\nProbably the most notable thing about her is that she allows herself to be disillusioned throughout her travels. She realizes that the kingdom is in a state of decay and that her kind and gentle father may not have been the best ruler after all. She does not try to defend her father or herself, but seeks to venture further and help fix the damage that has been done during her father's reign.\\n\\n\r\nThe state of the kingdom also brings an interesting twist to Soo-won's character. Even though you hate him at first you slowly begin to realize that there may have been something more behind his traitorous actions, and when he starts to repair the broken kingdom that suspicion grows. Even though you sympathize with Yona and Hak, you understand just as they do that something went wrong and Soo-won is trying to fix it.\\n\\n\r\nNot only are the characters and story beautifully fleshed out, the art and the music leaves nothing to be desired.\\n\\n\r\nThe art of the show is actually drawn closer to a manwha style rather than the typical Japanese manga art style which is not something we will commonly see. The characters are extremely detailed in design and emphasize the moments when a character truly grows and shows their power. You can feel and see the fire in Yona's eyes and hair and feel the strength through the animation alone.\\n\\n\r\nThe musical is also very orchestral and true to the feeling of the show. The instrumentation of the opening in particular has a very culturally Asian feel and tells a story as it goes along. There is no need for voices or explanations because the music explains everything it on its own. The song appears in the anime whenever something major happens to Yona's character and really helps to set the mood for the events unfolding.\\n\\n\r\nOverall I believe this is a show that most people can enjoy and appreciate. There is humor, action, fantasy, and serious issues all rolled into one wonderful show. If you overlooked the show once, I would highly recommend going back and looking into it again.\\n\\n\r\nThe review can also be found here https://eowinthcosplay.wordpress.com/2015/06/06/akatsuki-no-yona-the-hidden-gem-of-this-years-anime-season/",

But it's HOW it's told rather than the concept itself that makes this one. It has a good pace, it's well told and doesn't leave huge plot holes.\r\nArt: 9/10\r\nIt hasnice colors, it's well drawn and it's a nice ancient-China-thing. Battle scenes are well animated, there's no CGI to fill plot and every character has it's own disctintive traits. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nBoth openings were enjoyable, being the second one the best, and every BGM seems in its place. Music and sound doesn't define the anime, but they certainly help a lot and are well chosen.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nA strong point indeed. Yona seems obnoxiuous at first but she has a very well development through the anime, as well as the main companion. Each dragon has it's very own personality, and even the secondary and tertiary characters have an agenda.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nIt's easy to watch, it's enjoyable, and it has a nicely told story with some interesting characters. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nA very good show, way better than I expected when I first decided to watch it just by reading in the synopsis there were dragons involved. I consider it some fresh air from the ecchi-harem-fanservice overdose we are giver every season.",

            "content": "It's finally over. This exquisite anime is finally over. \r\nStory: 9/10 - The story seems very simplistic on the surface, which it is, at least you think is it. This anime has a define plot. It has a backbone that a majority of shoujo's don't have. This isn't an anime completely submersed in romanticized scenes with petty fanservice. While comedy is subjective, Akatsuki no Yona is magical experience with a well structured outline. It's slow paced at first, but it really builds up to moments and really, this anime should get a gold star in having one of the best female heroine's I've seen inawhile. This is definitely a hidden gem.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9/10 - Art style has a unique premise to it. With playful styling in not so serious moments, while having the really sharp beauty in fighting scenes. Gosh, the animation with Yona in certain episodes is just so breathtaking. The lighting effect in the anime is also something to notice. It really highlights the eyes, always. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 9/10 - The background music is very fitting for each scene depending on what's going on. Very pleasant. Though I wasn't too keen on the first Opening, the second one proves to be better. Same goes for the Ending song, the second one is probably one of the best.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10/10 - One aspect I really admire about this entire anime as a whole, are the characters. They aren't two dimensional. They are well developed for the most part. Though Zeno was briefly mentioned in the last episode, I'd like to point out his backstory isn't for a while in the manga (like in the 100s I think). Disregarding that, the development given to the characters makes them not only interesting, but really lovable. I can honestly say there's isn't a character I dislike, even our murderer Su-won. His character is development as well. \\n\\n\r\nOne character I'm going to point out is Yona, our princess in this anime. She starts off so weak and naive to the outside world. What's so great about her? She never suddenly gets stronger, she never acts out of her character; her character gradually changes with each episode. She slowly becomes this strong person she's striving to be. Her feeble yet bold personality really shines  through in this anime. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9/10 - I've enjoyed this anime to the max. I can't believe I almost skipped over this anime last season. I was extremely hesitant to watch this; thinking it would be some basic story. This became so much more than a story about a princess and her bodyguard Hak. It became something magical.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9/10 - *crosses fingers* I want a season two.",

It may be a bit harder to watch for some people that are expecting fast pace and action going forward all the time. \r\nIdea of this story can be a bit simple but later on you will learn that it might be more complex than you were thinking. Art and sound is pretty amazing in Akatsuki no Yona. I adore not only episode time but also openings and endings. With character development creators \"catch us\" with some well written secondary characters. And yeahthere are some scenes that will make you cry. But crying isn't a bad thing after all, it can be refreshing and make you think more about your current life. \\n\\n\r\nAnyways I rate anime as 10 and I hope that you will also enjoy it!",

Although don't expect a 11 year old kid to write anything decent but the base of the story is the same. Powerless Heroine with a special hair color related to some hidden power. A man who loves her undoubtedly and a traitor who once had her heart. Followed by companions who aid them on their quest and an adorable little pet that just makes you go \"Awww\" that does little helpful things.\r\nAlthough the saddest thing about this animeis there is no second session. Its only been 2 years so imma cross my fingers. This anime just only sets the base ground. Like the backstories before you begin your DnD Campaign and how you all met. Did I Mention I'm a HUGE fan of DnD? No? Well this anime is like one hell of a DnD Campaign. But watching these backstories is not boring at all. They really make you feel something. In the first few episodes I really felt her struggle. I knew just how she felt. The characters really come to life as you learn their struggles.\\n\\n\r\nI only have one complaint. This whole anime would have never happened If just 1 small thing went differently. You'll see it in the first few episodes. It makes me think the villain is one hell of an idiot. All he had to do was pop a question and live happily ever after. He could have even gotten away with what he does and not come to arms If he'd just made dubbly sure and went on to pop the question afterwards. It would have been the easiest way. But ah well.\\n\\n\r\nI love this show. Its got just want I want to see. Season 2 PLEASE!!!",

            "content": "Just based on the premise, I had really low expectations for Akatsuki no Yona when I started it. But those expectations were greatly exceeded within a fairly short amount of time, especially after about episode 6 or 7. It's not a particularly unique plot, but it definitely has its own identity and interesting characters, beautiful animation, and epic music.\r\nYona rocks. I love her, because really the majority of the series focuses on her development and growth... and she grows beautifully. She starts out as an innocent princess with no knowledge of the outside world and a little bit of a spoiled attitude, but this seriesreally changes her and develops her into a strong, dependable young woman. I cannot describe how much her character development pleased me. Other than her, my favorite character is actually Ik-Su, the priest. He may be a minor character, but he's just the sweetest, most hopeless case ever and I adore him.\\n\\n\r\nBut I wasn't a huge fan of the dragons or Hak. I liked Shin-ah well enough but, otherwise... I guess I just felt a bit irritated because it seemed to me that they all (especially Hak) were conspiring to hold Yona back from finding her strength. I know that's the time period they live in, but it just made me grit my teeth. In a way, I saw Hak as more of an antagonist than Soo-won, who I actually thought was an interesting and complex character by the way. Just because I so badly wanted to see Yona succeed, I found myself glaring intensely at the majority of the characters who kept Yona's company when they would try too hard to shelter her from danger.\\n\\n\r\nBut despite that, I really loved Akatsuki no Yona. An overall great story about resilience and empowerment and growth, with just a hint of romance sprinkled on the side. I'm also reading the manga, so I can't wait to find out what happens later in the story!",

            "content": "The idea of royalty getting ousted has been a hot topic for many historical fictions, so the idea is pretty cliche. So if you think this princess is going to be a useless piece of baggage that is annoying, you're right! To an extent.\r\nThe amount of character development Yona goes through is tremendous. At first, you think she's an annoying piece of baggage but as she sees the world outside the palace for the first time in her pretty comfortable fifteen years, she begins to realize that what she knew wasn't all she knew. Plus her father is pretty hated on (like most kings Imight add) so instead of returning to the palace, she works towards bettering her country from the shadows while learning the bow and sword on her travels. Yona soon begins to pull her own weight and even turns pretty badarse by the end of the show. She turns into your typical useless heroine into an actually really likable character.\\n\\n\r\nWith the addition of Yona and her quest, you have the side story of all these guys falling for her and her charisma/kindness. Of course the ones who get the most screentime in the romance aspect is her childhood friend, Hak, who also happens to be the strongest warrior in the kingdom and her bodyguard and her cousin, Soo Won, who was her first love. Of course, Yona is totally oblivious to Hak and constantly friend-zones him while is also accompanied by a merry bunch of more hot guys that also like Yona, but Yona is once again oblivious towards all the romantic action. It's totally obvious, but she doesn't know. It can get really annoying at some times, but at others it's pretty funny since the reactions the characters make are unusually accepting. The other characters cock-block each other all the time as well, making it very entertaining to watch the relationships that bloom from all their traveling.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, I would have to say it's the characters and their relationships that hold this whole show together. The story is pretty cliche for it's genre, so I found little redeeming qualities there. It's the characters.",

            "content": "Akatsuki no Yona\u2019s impeccable portrayal of a heart wrenching story of a lovable protagonist, Yona, the princess of the kingdom of Kouka, who overcomes her personal anguish for the greater good of her people is one to cherish. What made me deeply drawn to this anime was the thrilling adventure of Yona and her bodyguard Hak as they set foot on their journey to find the four dragons in order to protect the ones that Yona loves\u2014her citizens of Kouka and her friends from the seemingly evil and newly founded king Suu-Won (yes seemingly as we are unsure of his motivations for bestowing tragedy ontoYona). \\n\\n\r\nStory: 8.5\\n\r\nFrom the very beginning I was drawn to the story as the sudden change in tone from being cheerful to a heart wrenching one was beautifully portrayed in the first few episodes. However, this sense of depression was relieved through the hopeful storytelling of a feeble and ignorant princess becoming independent by finally gaining insight towards the corruption of her kingdom through her thrilling adventure. What makes an adventure story exciting is the thrill of discovering new characters that the protagonist meets along their journey and discovering who these people are, what their upbringing entails, what powers they possess, and most importantly what affect will they have on the story. Akatsuki no Yona used this element of the adventure genre almost perfectly by using the interesting characters of the four dragons, Yun, and the priest to add depth and excitement to this anime and to further develop Yona\u2019s character. In addition to the plot, the method of storytelling elevates the audiences\u2019 curiosity and interest from the very beginning, as the anime vaguely introduces the various characters and their powers and Yona\u2019s strength as a leader in the opening scene. This clever method of storytelling allows the audience to be put into state of confusion, yet allows them to develop a strong sense of curiosity, ultimately becoming completely consumed by the story.   \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 9\\n\r\nThe strong point of this anime is the characters as I explained before an adventure/action anime is centered around the development of the protagonist and his/her companions. Each of the characters in this story had a purpose, which was disparate motivations to follow Yona on her adventure, and this allowed each character to have depth. Hak and the four dragons are powerful and brave warriors which already appeals to the audience, but each of them have a different reason to follow Yona on her journey of self-discovery which strengthens the sense of camaraderie and complements the uplifting tone to the anime. However, the major character development and the aspect of the anime that appeals to me the most is the depth in Yona\u2019s character. Seeing a powerless, frail, and cheerful girl being struck by misfortune and being forced to overcome all of it riles my emotions and immediately brings a tear to my eye. But it is Yona\u2019s ability to escape her sheltered world as a princess and face adversity using her own strength that connects to the audience. It is the fiery passion that Yona gains while maintaining her emotional fragility that makes me pray for her triumph over her many difficult trials that gives dimension to this anime. \\n\\n\r\nAnimation: 8\\n\r\nThe animation is not particularly unique but it is fluid and matches the adventure genre by having very bright and memorable character designs and animation. What appealed to me specifically was the strength and force that the animation had during the more emotional and important scenes as various colours, images, and textures were used to really portray the strength of certain characters, especially Yona.  \\n\\n\r\nSound: 9\\n\r\nThe beautiful openings that perfectly reflect the vibe of the entire anime and the character of Yona, as she is the focus of the anime, captivated me entirely and are definitely worth listening to alone along with the various calming OSTs. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9.5\\n\r\nThis anime has made me hooked from the very beginning and constantly made me wanting more after each episode. From the very first cliff hanger to the very final seconds of the anime I felt like I was on a journey alongside Yona and this is what gives adventure anime its value. The ending of the anime was slightly rushed and some characters, such as the antagonist, Suu-Won, wasn\u2019t properly developed, but this only leaves the audience asking more questions and hopefully the second season (let\u2019s all pray for one) answers them!\\n",

Yona of the Dawn is such an enjoyable story, with memorable characters. I plan on reading the manga now, since I didn't want the show to end and I've heard the manga is ongoing.\r\nStory:\r\nThis is not your typical shojo, with the girl obsessed over a boy or her looks or finally getting a date. Yona is on a serious mission, and the story drew me in completely. I loved how Yona is more than \"justa girl,\" and even though she is weak and naive at first, she grows and becomes strong. \\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nBeautiful! I loved how the characters were drawn and the attention to detail with scenery. An absolutely lovely anime to watch.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nThis is one of the few anime in which I did not skip the intro song or the credits song. The music was beautiful! Even my husband, who was in another room at the time, came out and said, \"I love this music.\" I also loved the instrumentals throughout.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nEvery character had a story, and I found that even on the episodes that diverted from the main character, Yona, I was drawn in and intrigued. I even felt sympathy for the villain, Soo-Won! However, it really is Yona that draws the story together. She is perhaps my favorite anime heroine. As I said above, she grows from a rather weak, flawed character to one with strength and courage. \\n\\n\r\nI definitely recommend watching this anime if you haven't already. It has now become one of my absolute favorites!",

            "content": "Note: Some spoilers, this review is more designed to be read after finishing the series.\r\nYona of the Yawn (gottem) is a hot trash anime about a sheltered princess named Yona who enjoys her pampered life, living with her father (the King), best friend Hak (who is one of the strongest fighters in the kingdom), and her cousin Soo Won, whom she loves. One day Soo Won basically launches a coup with the Fire tribe (there are like 4 or 5 tribes in the show) against the king and kills him. Hak defends Yona from the attackers and the two escape. The rest of the animebasically consists of Yona trying to find 4 dragon warriors because of some prophecy.\\n\\n\r\nOver 24 episodes, the show can be divided into several mini arcs. The first 8 episodes deal with Yona leaving the castle and finding about her destiny. The rest of the episodes basically consist of each of the Dragon\u2019s arcs with the Yellow dragon having 1 episode at the end (and who was obviously rushed in), and the white dragon having only about 2-3 episodes. The anime uses flash backs semi-frequently to develop characters and give reasons for certain motivations.\\n\\n\r\nThe thing about Yona of the Dawn is that everyone in the anime wants to help her. Hak wants to help her, the wind tribe wants to help her, the priest wants to help her, Hoon wants to help her, the White and Blue dragons want to help her, even Soo Won, the main villain, wants to help her. Which is why the Green Dragon arc, at first, seems to be the most interesting. Jae Ha (the green dragon), is against following Yona and following the destiny of the dragons. Even after facing the genetic desire of the dragon to follow Yona, he initially rejects following her. But the anime is called Yona of the Dawn for a reason and he abandons his own desires to help her just because she shows some courage. So, the most interesting interpersonal conflict between the any of dragons and Yona is solved over basically an episode.\\n\\n\r\nThe only other interesting plot point in the anime is between the perception Yona has of her father, the realities of life outside the castle, and the influence of Soo Won\u2019s rule over the kingdom. Yet this is ridiculously undercooked over the 24 episodes. There is one episode dedicated to Soo Won to show his ability, cunning, and desire, and there are one or two moments showing Yona realizing her father\u2019s rule wasn\u2019t as great as she thought. But there is barely any introspective on her side. She continues without questioning why people are living in poverty, and what her father lacked in fixing the kingdom. The anime is simply preoccupied with developing Yona and the dragon sub plots, and that just makes it generic.\\n\\n\r\nI think one of the biggest issues with Yona of the Dawn is that is lacks all the charms of a decent battle/adventure manga. Firstly, the fights are atrocious. The animation falls off during any battles, the all consist of mobs fighting Hak with or without the other dragons. Furthermore, there is no suspense at all as Hak and the Dragon\u2019s have no weaknesses in the show. While most battle manga would deal with each character facing their weakness and overcoming them to become a stronger, better version of themselves, or at least facing an enemy that is a foil to their abilities, there is no such character development here for any character outside Yona. She is the only one who needs to learn how to fight, something she seldom does throughout the 24 episodes as most battles have her in the distance with Hoon while Hak + Dragons deal with everything. Whenever Yona must fight, she has no issues. She never fails on the battlefield, the first time she kills she does it without hesitation and under an unreal circumstance that her training and experience would not have accounted for, but the anime is called Yona of the Dawn after all. And, to add on top of all that, there is no well-defined enemy character for Yona\u2019s crew to fight. They simply beat on generic fire tribe and mercenaries throughout the whole series. Even the one enemy they hype up during the Green Dragon arc, they never have a real battle with. A lack of suspense, a lack of skill development, a lack of real challenge for the characters, and a lack of noticeable or skilled enemies make the battle/adventure aspects of the anime extremely weak.\\n\\n\r\nBut Yona of the Dawn is also supposed to be a romance\u2026 what a farce that is. The only legitimate romantic action in the anime occurs between Hak and Yona, and that is very rarely and most times when it occurs is played for laughs. There are one or two actual moments of Hak displaying his romantic interest in Yona upfront, and she just runs away, and the anime continues as if it did not happen. Yona never reflects on her relationship with Hak as anything more than platonic. She never considers if her feelings for Hak are similar to her feelings for Soo Won. So, the romance is unbearably slow, and the outcome is negligible.\\n\\n\r\nThe comedy in the anime is semi-persistent and unfunny. However, the biggest sin is that the anime uses comedy to undercut several serious/dramatic moments. When a character is seriously hurt, you can expect a joke. Or if Yona is having a serious conversation you can expect the squirrel character to be acting a fool in the background. Just another factor that reduces the minimal suspense and tension in the story.\\n\\n\r\nA few words about Yona, the character. I like her character design a lot, she\u2019s cute and her hair looks good both long and short. I also like that she is starts of very weak and must develop skills over the course of the show. However, the show surrounds her with such overpowered characters that her weakness in never a hindrance. There is always someone ready to save her, and the only times she is ever at risk is when she chooses to put herself in those positions. And even then, she is always accompanied by someone to protect her. Also, to make up for her weakness is that whenever she is in a bad position versus an enemy, the anime decides to giver her basically the equivalent of the mangekyou sharingan to scare of enemies or to stop them and give enough time for some deus ex machina to occur (she literally stares at people and they will say something generic like \u201cshe has fire in her eyes\u201d and they will leave alone). Finally, my biggest gripe against her character, and the show in general, is that she has no real purpose. The show has no real purpose. She spends the whole show finding the dragons for some vague reason. By the end of the show we still don\u2019t know what she wants. She doesn\u2019t want revenge against Soo Won, she doesn\u2019t want to return to the castle, she doesn\u2019t want to live a peaceful life, and the end she decides the just wants to travel and vanquish evil. What kind of generic result is that? It\u2019s to the point where the flash forward scene at the beginning of the show is changed at the end of the anime, because Yona\u2019s motivations don\u2019t match up with the scene! Yona of the Dawn started out decently enough, but progressively got worse other than the slight reprieve with the first couple of green dragon episodes. After that it fell off a cliff again. Yona of the Dawn is a \u201cjourney is more important than the destination\u201d anime that doesn\u2019t deliver on either part.",

            "content": "I think this is one of the best animes I've watched. It's actually the first anime I decided to watch on my own and I absolutely loved it. \r\nI think the plot is really good, because we have an unexpected twist right at the beginning of the story, although you can notice something feels off in Yona's Edenic life.\r\nThe whole story is set around Yona's travel throughout the country, which is the occasion for her to grow up and better understand the world. I think it's really amazing the way she goes from a sheltered princess to a strong leading female figure. \r\nWe can findthe classics of the shoujo in this anime, like the love triangle between the childhood friends, but there are also some unexpected elements. \\n\\n\r\nAnother very interesting aspect for me is the fact that you can't bring yourself to completely hate Soo-Won (according to me), because he obviously cares for Yona. That feeling actually grows when you read the manga. He really has the country's wellbeing in mind and isn't just the bad guy who destroyed Yona's life.\\n\r\nWe don't really see a prominent antagonist in the anime, but they actually show up later on in the manga. Although you can think Soo-won is \"the bad guy\", I think that title goes to the advisor Kye-sook (I'm also influenced by the manga, so...).\\n\\n\r\nI think that the characters' background could be a bit more developed, but with all the action taking place there wasn't really the time to do that. It was actually the lack of information on Zeno's past that made me read the manga and I'm very thankful because reading it is a pure delight.\\n\r\nIt's nice that each character has a particular personality and the story doesn't just focus on Yona/Soo-won/Hak, but also on the four dragons (Shin-Ah is my favourite). I also find the touch of cuteness with Ao/Pukyuu the squirrel adorable. \\n\\n\r\nI'm not really good at judging art, but I think that the characters show nice expressions, such as Yona's burning eyes, Hak's dark look and I find Shin-ah's golden dragon eyes mesmerizing.\\n\r\nI think that the sound and music were really nice, especially the first opening and the second ending. It gives a \"traditional\" feeling, like we're in an ancient time (which is the setting). The instrumentals are really good, even when it's a background music to heighten the tension in a fight or such. I think they fit the time and place.\\n\\n\r\nIf we're going to talk about something I'm not satisfied of in this anime, it's that there is no sequel! When you look at the manga, there is way enough to write a second season, with new characters that Yona's group befriends and dangerous enemies.\\n\r\nThis anime really follows the beginning of the manga and I actually think of it as a really nice way to incite us to read it. Of course, the anime is still great in itself, but I really, really hope they're going to make a new season.",

I am really hoping that the anime continues soon. \r\nIn general, the character development is amazing, the soundtracks are incredible and the voice acting is incredible, the art is excellent too. \r\nThe story has substance and shows how complicated life really is. I love the fact that nothing is black or withe, I mean, the world is complicated so nothing is pure evil or pure good ... I can relate to that. \r\nAlso, I love that the main character is a girl and that she is not the typical femalemain character. Yona is vulnerable but she is also strong, driven and intelligent. She may cry and hesitate a lot but at the end of the day she does what she has to be done and is constantly improving herself.   \\n\r\n Even though there is a love triangle in the story I really appreciate that it is not focused in that but in Yona's quest to survive, protect Hak and all her friends and also help her country be a better place. She is able to see the bigger picture, put some of her feelings aside and give priority to what is really important for her, her friends and her country.\\n\r\nFinally, the love triangle is also great! I personally am cheering for Hak. Love the character really, is strong, caring, intelligent, love when he try to seduce Yona. But I also like So Woon character, he is not the typical villain as he is not pure evil and is kind of easy to admire him... I would like to discover his real motives.\\n\r\nhope this review helps!",

            "content": "I've been putting off watching \"Akatsuki no Yona\" since I first saw a review for it. It looked like your typical plot-ridden Shonen ai with a helpless Princess in distress who can't think for herself and is surrounded by hot guys fighting over each other and her. I've never been happier to be wrong. The show takes not only that stereotype but also the wonderful peace-loving king stereotype and gives the viewer a insanely realistic rendition of the same adventure story that's been told for years. I don't usually go for realistic shows, but this one is grounded in a fantasy adventure story which makesit fun even if it is realistic. There are plenty of times when you can't help but laugh however it was the moments of seriously disheartening facts were revealed that I fell in love with this show. Not sad but disheartening, the scenes that reflect the world you live in almost shoving depression in your face. It doesn't stop there but those moments give the show it's brilliance especially from a literary perspective. \\n\\n\r\nThe story is very hard to tell without giving spoilers, but i'll try. It focuses on Princess Yona who is completely pampered and self-centered. Due to various events she ends up traveling the country for four warriors with dragon blood with her body guard, Hak, in hopes that they will follow her and offer protection for her and the bodyguard. There are love conflicts and hot boys that seem interested in each other as well as Yona, but there are realistic reasons as to why they happen. The anime ends when all the dragon blood warriors are found, and I'm desperately hoping they continue with another season.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is pretty good. The animations for the fighting and pretty much everything else are wonderfully smooth without any of the sloppy frames one expects from a shonen ai. Each of the characters ave a distinct style that sometimes extend to the way their faces are shaped. The colors are BRIGHT and there is a broad scheme used. The music is beautiful with an excellent opening and ending that changes halfway through the first season to fit the change in the characters. The show has more of a Chinese feel to it or maybe a really early Japanese feel. I must add that the visuals are just gorgeous with awesome clothe designs and surrounding landscapes. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters are what sells the show though. It gives the characters incredible depth and makes them grow in a realistic way too. There are several and each has their own complicated pasts and motivations. Like really, super, mind-bending complicated. It is easy to empathize with every single one of them which makes it hard to choose a side just like the way a real conflict has valid reasons on both sides. The dragon blood boys are not just pretty faces or poor kids with tragic backstories. They have just as much influence with how they grew up as the people who cared for them. An then there's Yona. She changes to an unbelievable extent that makes perfect sense. She doesn't go from self-centered idiot to rock hard killer, rather she changes the way a woman really does: with hard work, sacrifice, and huge amounts of guilt. She never loses her femininity or her royalty yet becomes almost an entirely different person.  \\n\\n\r\nI had to give the show a 10/10. It was refreshing to watch and analyze because of its complex nature. Even though it is complex, it conveys the points in a way that are understandable. For someone who basically lives off fantasy books and anime, this show is a refreshingly honest portrayal of the same themes and events one sees in the fantasy genre. The show is mature, but it is presented in a way that makes a child able to watch and enjoy the story. I preferred the sub over the dub. I highly suggest this show to all fantasy lovers of any ages, shonen ai lovers, and literary people. I am keeping my fingers crossed for a second season.",

I'm watching the English dub with a friend right now and while I do enjoy it and there are a couple of English voice actors that I admire in the cast, I HIGHLY recommend the subbed version for better immersion and honestly... Slightly more fanservicey shoujo goodness.\r\nMoving on.\r\nAkatsuki no Yona is a beautiful and colourful fantasy romance anime with a Feudal Korean setting. It's the story of a young princess who was raised sheltered in a castle, suddenly losing her home and her world just beingturned on its head. But where there's a will there's a way, and boy does Yona have a will. With the help of her childhood best friend and sworn bodyguard, Hak, she sets out on an adventure to become a stronger person. \\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately, there are quite a few questions left unanswered and the chemistry and conflicts between certain characters are sometimes barely touched upon if acknowledged at all. Luckily, this is one of those anime that, instead of screaming at its viewers to just read the manga, it playfully seduces them to turn to the original source material... So if you want answers, I hope you all like reading manga! :D\\n\\n\r\nThe art is colourful and quite pleasant to look at. The sound (subbed) is fantastic, the seiyuu are well cast and the background music is fitting for the story and the setting. I personally enjoyed the second op a little bit more but overall the music is all really nice.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter design is great, Yona is really well written and she's everything a female protagonist should be. They did a really good job creating a character that the audience can get behind and cheer for. \\n\\n\r\nAll the characters are all really cute. They all have their moments of weakness and their moments of strength. I was a little disappointed that we didn't get an in depth look at some of the characters and one of them was rushed/crammed into the last episode but I suppose it's to be expected with several main characters to follow in just 24 episodes.\\n\\n\r\nThe show's not perfect but it's still a really enjoyable anime if you're in the mood for something lighthearted, romantic and funny. Again, if you're interested, I recommend the subbed version.",

The character development.\r\nMany anime (also films and tv shows, maybe even books) has this strange flaw. The main character, especially when being a female has some kind of super power that makes him/her a really incredibly fast student of anything. This character learns how to fight immediately while the rest must have trained hard as hell to achieve their levels and not only fight. One example is Rey from Star Wars Episode VII.\r\nAnother thing is that this charactersometimes shows that he/she spent some time learning so OK they are powerful now. But aside from that they are still the same, unchanged. Example of that is Sakura from Naruto (hard to say that since I was a huge NaruSaku fan), Such characters are acting totally irrationally and like a 15 years old spoiled kids.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime breaks this curse finally. The character development of Yona hime is incredible. Not only does she learn how to fight but she also transforms from the spoiled little princess into a useful young lady on a good way to become a leader of the country. And it's not like a miraculous transformation, no she still has a way to go and that's what makes it even more closer to reality.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is pretty good overall, also the environment has an unique reality/legends feel. The comedy scenes are pretty funny and making the anime more enjoyable. Sometimes they appear even during a serious moments but it's cool. And the music is badass. Just listen to the first opening and you'll understand.",

The plot is amazingly detailed and gorgeous. I mean, there are epic dragons, a badass Princess, and badass bodyguard, badass people... etc~\r\nPlus, it takes place in some sort of medival-ish Japan, and it's gorgeous!!\r\nART: 10/10\r\nThe art is BEAUTIFUL. And so is the animation. Yona's animation and art style is the best; she's so gorgeous. And the fight scenes! They're so amazing!! The art itself is very detailed and amazing~\r\nSOUND: 9/10\r\nI absolutely adore the first OP and the second ED. They are both gorgeous. (I've said \"gorgeous\" somany times, but that's like, the best word to describe this anime: gorgeous.) \\n\r\nThe first OP (Akatsuki no Yona) is completely instrumental traditional Japanese music, and you can never skip it. It's beautiful. It gives you chills every time you hear it.\\n\r\nThe second ED (Akatsuki) isn't completely instrumental, but it is still traditional Japanese-sounding and it is BEAUTIFUL. I love it. I put it on repeat all the time and it is so soothing. \\n\\n\r\nThe second OP and first ED weren't my favorites, but they were interesting. The second OP caught me by surprise, and it will never give me the feelings the first OP gave me, but it was alright.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER: 9/10\\n\r\nI loved everyone in this anime (except the bad guys.) Everyone. (That does not include Soo-won.) Hak is someone I fangirl and crush over now, and I want to hug Yun, Shin-ha, Ki-ja, Jae-ha, and Zeno. Alllllll of themmmmm. <3\\n\r\nYona has extreme character development, and it's absolutely amazing to watch her go from a weak Princess to a badass Warrior-girl with flames in her eyes.\\n\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT: 10/10\\n\r\nI loved this anime. Genuinely loved it. It is one of my favorite shoujos ever.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall, this is definitely a 10/10. I would definitely re-watch this.\\n\\n\r\nIt sort of gives off a reverse-harem feel, but this is more action, adventure, and drama than romance. The drama is realistic, and the action is intense. \\n\\n\r\nAlthough it ends in a cliffhanger, I cannot WAIT for the second season, and will hopefully read the manga soon.\\n\\n\r\nSo, if you want to see an anime that's worth while to watch, then please, try this one. It's AMAZING. And GORGEOUS. <3",

I haven't watched an anime with a story quite like this one.   Each episode had me eager to find out what happens next.  Also, I loved the characters.  Each character had a unique personality and spot-on voice acting.  Character designs were lovely for all of the characters. The character development through out the season was great. Watching each character develop more and more with every episode was not only enjoyable but also had meemotionally invested in them.  As for the artwork, it was more than beautiful.\\n\\n\r\n I feel like I could go on and on about this show but my bottom line is this show was really worth watching and I'd recommend it to anyone!",

            "content": "This is a review to convince you that although there are many silly parts to this anime...\r\nYou should still watch it if you want a decent historical Anime that brings fantasy (ie. DRAGONS) into the world.\r\nSTORY:\r\nThe story is pretty good. The ep's are pretty linear and the plot is very interesting.\r\nThere are multiple times where the lines in this anime are so stupid and ridiculous because they're trying to hard to be metaphorical or deep...that it's funny BUT that's not to say ALL of the lines are stupid!\r\nThe way they set up the story sucks by the way.\r\nThey show you VERY early on a spoilerfrom many episodes into the future.\\n\r\nMany movies and shows do this to show you how it all comes back around but the way this show did it was random. Very...random.\\n\r\nSometimes it'll cut from this scenario to the next in the blink of an eye but other times it'll be very linear. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nART:\\n\r\nThe art is not the best in my opinion.\\n\r\nIt's not bad but it's not good for an Anime in this day & age.\\n\r\nThe style can be compared to a 2005-2007 Anime.\\n\\n\r\nWeird edits such as LITERAL fire flames showing in (NON-FANTASY) character eyes. I'm talking about it looking like a fire gif was overlapped on a characters eyes.\\n\r\nDramatic slo-mo's & a still image of a character with a galaxy or sky backdrop....\\n\r\nThings like that.\\n\r\nBasically, the animation of the art is not really cared for & just looks like they hired someone who was a new animator. (Like they know how to animate but they're still learning...)\\n\\n\r\nAlso most of the eyes are basic shoujo eyes. For the most part, the eyes are all the same.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nSOUND:\\n\r\nThe OST is very fitting. It's catchy. \\n\r\nI don't LOVE it but it's good for the Anime.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER:\\n\r\nAll of the characters are pretty basic personalities but they're not dislikable so I think you'd like/be okay with them.\\n\r\nThe willpower in all of the characters is something I really like in any character though.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT:\\n\r\nThis Anime is an Anime I would watch & finish but it's not an Anime I would keep up with weekly (as in be avidly awaiting for the next ep).\\n\r\nI don't love it but I don't hate it because the plot is interesting.\\n\r\nThat's my best explanation for my enjoyment.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL:\\n\r\nAkatsuki no Yona is very on & off (GOOD AT SOME PARTS, VERY BAD ON OTHER PARTS) with A LOT of things but if you piece it in your mind then you'll be fine.\\n\r\nIt has a plot that'll keep you watching but I personally don't think it would be in your Top 30 if you had to make a \"Best Anime\" list for every Anime you'd ever watched.",

Its creative story line is a nice break from the traditional action/romance anime themes that are most common in the Japanese animation industry. With interesting characters, great voices, and a suspense at the end of each episode that keeps the audience hungry for more, this anime is a must see for any anime enthusiast. That said, the anime did contain some lack of character development, and while the sound track for the first half of the season was magnificent, the fitting instrumental music was soon replaced with vocals that didn't quite embody thestory or main character. In addition, the show did maintain its smooth and entertaining plot development very consistently until the very last episode, which was a great disappointment as it both rushed to finish the initial story line and left so many questions unanswered. All in all, Yona of the Dawn was riveting and entertaining, and had it not scrambled to conclude its story in the briefest way possible, this anime just might have earned a perfect score.",

If your looking for super great action scenes then this probably isn't an anime for you to watch but if enjoy strong female leads and a story that keeps your attention then you should watch this anime. The Story follows Princess Yona as she goes on this adventure to find these special companions that are suppose to protect her. During her adventure she meets many characters, some of which have very unique personalities and you seeher grow throughout the episode. I have to say that the most enjoyable part of this anime was watching Yona's companions go through their development. Each and every one of them had a unique story and it really helped them grow closer to Yona.\\n\\n\r\nThe only issue of this anime that i really hated was the lack of romance between Yona and Hak. I was rooting for them from the beginning of the series but as the episodes progress i grew tired of waiting for their relationship to grow. They put these tiny scenes of their connection and it didn't really make a difference in their relationship. Maybe it grew a little but if they don't develop on it after the series comes on again, they will find themselves trying to force the bond.",

But as the series continue, I realized that there is much more into it. The story focused more on Yona's life after she was chased out of the palace and her character development - on how she slowly change into a spoiled princess who think of nothing but her hair into an amazing heroine whowill risk her life just to help and save her people.\\n\r\nSomething I didn't like about this anime is how they put those comedic relief in what was supposed to be..\"intense moments\"\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9/10\\n\r\nI really love the art and animation, especially during battle scenes.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9/10\\n\r\nThe opening and ending song of this anime is really good.

            "content": "Shoujo fans, rejoice. Here comes an anime that will most definitely salvage the genre among the clich\u00e9 fest that seems to reign it these days. \r\nAnime in general seems to be suffering a lot  about being fairly generic these days. All shounen comedy seems to be an ecchi harem, just like its action counterpart ahs the hot-blooded, determinator archetype as a main character. Shoujo has been infested with a horde of main female leads shallow enough for the viewer to easily self-insert without feeling remorse, which are usually friendless and pretty without realizing they're pretty. Which, by the way, falls in love with theequally shallow guy, which is more often than not a complete jerkass who very unrealistically 'changes' for the aforementioned Bella S-- *cough* female lead.\\n\\n\r\nThis, I'll emphasize, is the norm, not the rule. There are plenty of shoujo that soar over the sea of mediocrity and even  several of them who decompose the previously mentioned overused plots. Kudos to them, for being standouts on their own right.\\n\\n\r\nAnd kudos to Akatsuki no Yona, which didn't fall behind.\\n\\n\r\nThe story, I'll admit, is not entirely original, thus I had to give it a seven even though I certainly didn't want to). A girl goes on a journey to look for certain items that will help her achieve her goal, basically. However, I have to give my praise to the background. It's set in a fictional Korean-like kingdom called Kouka, whose problems are apparently scarce. The female lead, a princess, has lived indifferent and ignorant about all that lies outside. Then a certain major event forces her out and in look for the four dragons, legendary creatures who will her help retake the castle and overthrow a traitor who stripped her from all she knew.\\n\\n\r\nEven though the pace is slow, I honestly never felt the episodes pass, and more often than not I couldn't believe that was all. Each character has an arc, which is never a bad idea of well-executed. And this being the gem it is pulled it off effortlessly.\\n\\n\r\nCertainly a standout among the winter 2014 anime, Akatsuki no Yona offers a pleasure to the eyes with beautiful character designs, elaborated backgrounds and very solid animation. Very few frames seemed out of place and characters were seldom drawn out of proportion. \\n\r\nSame goes to the soundtrack, which greatly complimented the overall feel of the anime and in my opinion was only overshadowed by Tokyo Ghoul's (overhyped as hell, but great OSTs) and a couple others. Bonus points for the opening being instrumental as well.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters were a pleasure. An actually likeable female lead!? I had to be dreaming, except I wasn't. Yona manages to be spoiled, selfish and inmature the first episodes and still be endearing from the start. We see her grow and accept her hardships the way very few other leads could manage to do. She cries and whines, sure, but who can blame her? And she actually makes an effort to improve as an individual. Perhaps my favorite female character of the season.\\n\r\nSide characters weren't left behind, which was great. Hak was one hell of an eye candy with a personality to match, acting as the 'normal' one until the appearance of another character at the later half, and even then he was farily weird.\\n\\n\r\nA moment of silence for him being friendzoned in absolutely epic proportions as well. I swear I had never cringed as much as I did with this poor guy. \\n\\n\r\nEvery character was fairly developed and had a farily unique personality. The team waifu, a smallish boy called Yoon, gets a special mention because of the huge housewife potential he has. I swear no person would live unhappy with a guy like that.\\n\r\nThere's Jae-Ha, one of the dragons that despite his relatively little screentime quickly became the most interesting personality-wise, and Kija, a rather childish guy who can even pull of being annoying and endearing at the same time. And a character that appears exclusively at the last chapter, Zeno, a keet and a shota (what's not to love?) who acts silly but is obviously far more intuitive than his demeanor shows.\\n\r\nHell, even the antagonist is well-made to the point I find it hard to hate him. Scratch that, I still want his head to roll, but I do get his intentions, if you get me. And a good villain is a huge, huge plus to me. Possibly my favorite cast in the season as well.\\n\\n\r\nI have but one complaint, and that is Shina. I had such high hopes for him the moment he was introduced and even after the joined the group. Problem is, he was put far behind on the sidelines to the point he had one, two lines of dialogue at most in the latter episode. They could've at least tried making him relevant the way they did with Kija even if his arc had long passed.\\n\\n\r\nNeedless to say, this whole show was a delight to watch. Great characters, animation, a well-executed plot and an OST to match? I can't go as far as to call this a masterpiece... yet. It sure as hell has the potential.

            "content": "Did i give it my all before i last gave up on doing something? Were my thoughts of giving up being okay because i gave my best only to console myself? Such were the thoughts running through my head as i was watching this gem of the season, reflecting upon the times where i gave myself empty consolations on how it was okay to give up because I gave my all when thinking back i never actually did try my hardest. This anime struck a chord within me and possibly many of the other viewers, and if you havent watched it yet,for any who like watching the growth and developments of characters as they progress, or those who simply want to enjoy a nice adventure from the back of your seats, this anime is for you as you will be in for a thrilling rigde with moments that bring you joy and laughter, moments with thrill and excitement, moment filled with inspiriation and moments which would tug your heartstrings as you enjoy this wonderfully animated series of Akayona. \\n\\n\r\n   The story kicks off with our red haired princess, yona, losing her father, her sole parental figure who accompanied through her growing years to her childhood friend whom she always played with adored. Betrayed by her love and losing her father, yona's beliefs were shattered as the world around her, the days where she could spend in peace and tranquility crumbled. Just as she was staring deep into the abyss of despair and almost silenced, she was saved in the nick of time by her bodyguard and childhood friend.  \\n\\n\r\n   Henceforth begins the journey of the sheltered princess Yona as she transverses the continent, learing about the harsh realities surrounding the world while slowly progressing to be a figure worthy to lead, one who inspires people to follow her as her caliber as a person is tested multiple times throughout her journey.\\n\\n\r\n  This series is wonderfully animated starting from the crimson red hair of yona and the well represented characters to the various castles, buildings and landscape with colours and brightness which fits very well with the story and mood settings of the anime. What I feel was done particularly well was yona's fury mode with regards to the art as it fully depicted her fury while bringing along a sense of anticipation to the following actions she would take to resolve her fury.\\n\\n\r\n  The op and ed tracks were also well made to suit the mood of the story with appropriate insert songs at moment where there was a major event happening, particularly the tune in episode 22 which really fit the mood of the snipe.\\n\\n\r\n There was also great character development throughout the series with clear and steady plot progression, and was well-paced throughout the series after the first 3 episodes which might come off as a slightly slower start to some. \\n\\n\r\n   All in all, akayona was an interesting and enjoyable watch, packed with loads of action and development with ample laugh and a pinch of romance to complete the package but still the anime left much of the plot hanging and many praying after finishing the anime, praying towards the hopes of a season 2.... \\n\\n\r\nTo anyone reading this who hasnt watch it yet why not give it a try? I may not have much knowledge about your tastes in anime but I can assure that this is a great watch, a gem awaiting discovery.",

Yona starts as a dislikable character, her weakness, and brattiness showing making her annoying at first. When the man she loved -- Soo-Won-- killed her father right in front of her eyes, traumatizing her. But, after her father's death she is motivated to become stronger, and not let anyone die. She wants to fulfill the prophecy of the four dragons that came from theheavens to once fight beside King Hiryuu who founded the country, and fought against the humans, who wanted to kill him.\\n\\n\r\nYona is supposedly King Hiryuu's descendant, and she was told to find the four dragons, and get together, and fight along side each other like they did many centuries ago. (*COUGH, COUGH* REVERSE HAREM *COUGH*). \\n\\n\r\nI definitely recommend this to ANYONE. They also mix so many genres into the series, (romance, adventure, combat, etc). It's adorable, and will definitely make your heart melt. I'm hoping there will be a second season very soon! It has also turned into my new favorite anime EVER. I don't think anything could possibly beat it.",

            "content": "This anime had an interesting world to explore, a strong start, good characters, and a story that really made me want to go along for the ride. The problem is it never really goes anywhere. Sure they have to round up some allies before they storm the castle but it just doesn't feel like anything gets done because they never explain how rounding up the allies will help them accomplish any of their goals. Yes they are legendary warriors but if a regular human is better than them what makes them so necessary?\r\nThe story is basically just: \"We need to do the thing.\" And thenit never explains why they need to do the thing. Same thing with the Antagonist. Spoilers for episode one to follow: He betrays his childhood friend and the girl that loves him by killing the king but it never explains what any of his goals are or what led him to believe the king deserves to die. Sure it explains that someone told him something that made him want to kill the king, but why would he believe that information and act on it and where does he plan to go from there?\\n\\n\r\nIf you are telling a story by the time you are 24 episodes in you better give your audience a clear grasp of what the hell is going on and what your character's goals are. I want to like this story, I really do. It has cool characters and the way they build up their bonds is really nice and everything that happens in the show is done well, it is an enjoyable show. It just doesn't feel like it has any direction because one is never provided. In episode 24 both the protagonist and the antagonist are asked what their plans are and one says \"idk lol\" and the other says \"lol watch\"... for the love of god tell us what is going on! They don't even explain what the \"true powers\" of her allies are or why the thing that is supposed to happen when they all assemble didn't happen.\\n\\n\r\nAlso it feels kinda like they ran out of time so for recruiting the fourth dragon (spoilers) he just shows up and joins them and doesn't appear to have any powers.\\n\\n\r\nOther than not defining where the journey of the antagonist and protagonist were going and (I believe) running out of time and rushing the last episode or two the only things the show did that actually annoyed me were 3 traits of the princess:\\n\r\n1) Relationship obliviousness - typical main character bs. Your bodyguard wants to impregnate you, she really should have realized this numerous times.\\n\r\n2) She has red hair - everyone is looking for a \"red haired princess\"... dye your hair! You're on the run and have a single identifying trait! Do something about that!\\n\r\n3) Death stares are not real - just because you look at someone with a determined look in your eye and are a beautiful princess does not mean they are going to give a crap, especially when they clearly have the upper hand in the situation. Please stop doing this every time something bad happens to magically intimidate your way out of trouble.\\n\\n\r\nHonestly though those are minor gripes and the vast majority of the show is good. My main problem with it is that it could easily be great but just doesn't seem able to pass that barrier because it is afraid to break away from tropes. 7/10 show overall. Think of it as a not as good version of Arslan Senki.",

The story is unique and the world is very well developed, something which I usually find to be a little lackluster when it comes to anime unless it's widely known and extensive (i.e. Naruto, Bleach, One Piece, Fairy Tail, etc.). The characters are all very unique and, despite following certain tropes at their base that may be found throughout other series, they grow to become so much more complex over the course of the series, especially in the manga. Everyone that youmeet is memorable and has a purpose to either the story as a whole, or even just a specific arc. It's an anime which I honestly did not expect to get so attached to in the beginning, but something about it is so endearing that even in the beginning during the slow-paced introduction there is always something that grabs your attention and makes you want to know more about the world and it's characters. The only thing I wish they would have changed, or should do in the future, is add a few episodes or make a season two as it ended at a relatively odd spot in the story.",

I love the attraction building between Hak and Yona and wish there were more episodes.

            "content": "!! POSSIBLE SPOILER WARNING !!\r\nAlright. Here we go. Let\u2019s talk about this train wreck. Thank you Perriot for terribly adapting a rather well written manga that one can enjoy thoroughly.\r\nStory: 3\r\nHoly crap. What was this? This was pointless. If there were two seasons, the ending might pass but what is this? Pierrot clearly ruined a story that would have been an enticing adventure. There isn\u2019t even a real reason for Yona to be gathering all the dragons. We are never told an actual reason. I suppose it is to take back the kingdom from Su-won, but what the hell? What is she going to doif she ever fights him? Kill him? Now what? Is Yona going to rule now? Her whole journey seems pointless. The story isn\u2019t even consistent all the way through. Plus, the whole unfolding of events is stupid and we can especially see this when Pierrot rushes the meeting of Zeno (the yellow dragon) because they ran out of episodes. There is clearly meant to be a season 2. We can easily tell this because of the cliffhangers and such that we are left on. We can see that Zeno has more to him than he is letting on. There is so much that was introduced that would have been pointless without a season 2. Way to go Pierrot. You guys really did a great job ruining this adaptation.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 7\\n\r\nEh. Sound isn\u2019t terrible and they have a rather all-star voice actor lineup for the sub, in my opinion. I personally really liked the dub in general. But that can probably be acquitted to the fact that it is in my native language. But besides that, to me, the sub voice actors are really good and I personally like subbed Yona more than the dubbed one. Yona\u2019s dubbed VA annoyed the HELL out of me. The OP\u2019s and ED\u2019s are pretty good. I personally like them more than quite a bit of other shows. But, sometimes the insert songs seemed out of place. Other times they were done well and really added to scenes but sometimes I also felt myself distracted by the OST. I think that good insert songs shouldn\u2019t interrupt you watching a show but just add to the scene without you realizing it much.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8\\n\r\nThe art in this was pretty good. I really liked the characters for the most part and the way they looked. The character designs were great. Each characters attire drew me in and suited them. They did a good job here. They didn\u2019t have a ton of detail like a Kyoani, but it wasn\u2019t terrible. The OP and ED\u2019s looked good too, as they should. They were all done well and made me enjoy watching them to an extent.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 2\\n\r\nWell. It really sucks to give this a 2. I really don\u2019t know if I can give it anything above this. The character development is a joke. No one has any real story. Shin-ha, Hak, Yun, and Su-won, are the only 4 characters that ever get any development. Yona and Jae-ha go under a bit of development but not enough. Most characters turn out exactly how we suspected when introduced to them, and no one really goes anywhere. They all are the same way mostly when we are introduced to them as they are at the end of the show. Most of them suck too. Hak is the only character worth watching in this show. His self-sacrifice makes him admirable and Yona, even after brought up by Yun, never thanks him for all he does. Maybe she does thank him once or twice and I am just forgetting about it, but I guarantee she never does it more than that. She doesn\u2019t change besides the fact that she gets angry when other people get hurt. She is the stereotypical, \u201cI care about everyone but can\u2019t do anything about it,\u201d MC. Hak and Shin-ha are the only two characters I ever gave a flying frick about. Everyone else pretty much sucks.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 3\\n\r\nWell, I did enjoy it for a time but the more I watched it, the less I enjoyed it. I really feel like giving it a 3 in the enjoyment category is even a stretch.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 4.6\\n\r\nWell, this is it. It wasn\u2019t great overall and the art and sound are the only things that I don\u2019t hate, besides Hak and Shin-ha. I'm going to go ahead and round this down to a 4 because of the atrocity it is. Forget this show and Pierrot. I can\u2019t believe people gave this show above a 6.",

            "content": "Yona is the story of a fallen Princess. She was living the life man! Good food, clothes, jewels. Sixteen and on easy street. Of course that had to change. Out of the castle she now wanders the land with her boy toy Hak. He's certainly able to take care of himself. However, they both discover that they need help if they want to survive.\r\nThis leads us to the brunt of the story as Yona is given a message by a priest, \"Seek out the four dragon warriors.\" These four are the reincarnations of the dragons that served the king from a thousand years ago.Waiting for the return of their king.\\n\\n\r\nTaste: The show was delicious. I really liked our heroine Yona. She grows as a person throughout the show, and you can see her turning from the helpless girl in distress to a strong leader that inspires her companions to follow her. And that's what this show is about in the end. The growth of Yona. As she travels her nation she sees how the people have suffered under her Father's rule, and her desire to help them, along with the guilt she feels about having been so out of the loop.\\n\\n\r\nWe can also see how they do a good job of developing each of the other characters, why the dragons are how they are, and what drives them. There is a bit of the reverse harem action going as you can tell each character is really falling for Yona. She of course is totally oblivious.\\n\\n\r\nOn the negative, I think the show drags out a bit. And there's a lack of intensity to me. They might also be missing a true big bad, or it could just be a scene that really makes you feel as though there's a chance it can slide away from the beaten path. I'll give taste a 7.5 out of 10\\n\\n\r\nPresentation: This show had some good art, nothing that made me really go wow, but nothing that made me feel like they were low on budget or just lazy. When they did go into using more chibi art, it always seemed like it fit the situation. The music is kinda in that same area. I didn't have anything really stand out, but there wasn't anything that made me want to mute the show. Plus the voice work (Subs) was really well done. I'm going to give this a 3.5 out of 5 as well\\n\\n\r\nOriginality: When you get down to it, this is a pretty simple story, nothing to really say a curve ball has been thrown anywhere. Of course, I'll always say that it's not always a bad thing. Sometimes a story going how it should is well, how it should go. It just means you need to have solid characters and good story telling, which this show does. I'll give originality a 2.5 out of 5\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion, I liked the show. I marathoned it pretty hard! And then I hunted down the manga. So I'll be reading that. Looks like it's a 13.5 out of 20 I strongly suggest watching this show!\\n",

            "content": "Akatsuki no Yona is a must watch anime specially to those who love adventure, action, comedy , super power, tragedy, and politics. It has a very promising and interesting plot. The moment you start watching it, it will surely make you want to know more of what will happen in the next episodes. Moreover its art is  10/10 that's why I'm watching it 1080 p resolution to enjoy it more. This is by far the best Shojo anime I've watched, it's not just about romance, or the handsome guys, or just Yona's resolve and development. Akatsuki no Yona is telling a story with depth. It is very well done in every bit. The story was very well thought and the first episode will really hook you in. Who wouldn't be curious about your beloved, kind, gentle childhood sweetheart killing your father? haha \\n\\n\r\nConcerning the character, they all have depth and distinguishable traits. The main antagonist (Soo Won) is interesting, you'll wish to see him and know what's happening with him too. He's not just your usual villain who's pure evil. The main protagonist on the other side is promising, like any other girl shojo she's lovable, further her character development is amazing, from a spoiled brat to a reliable and brave person. \\n\\n\r\nIt has 24 episodes all in all. Honestly it's rare for me to be so excited about a shojo anime that I get to the extent to read the manga. So this is really a must watch especially for shojo lovers. There are currently 12 episodes and 13th is coming up. Manga chapters are currently 101 and still ongoing. The manga is great too especially the art and the expressions of the faces. Enjoy watching, it's very worth your time journeying with the girl standing in the blush of dawn. \\n\\n\r\n(p.s the opening is epic with the celtic like themed music)",

            "content": "I've always loved movies, shows and anime where strong and independent women kick the buts of some men. Akatsuki no Yona or Yona of the Dawn is one of that kind. Seriously, I love this anime and 24 episodes...Worth it! The fact that there is no release date of season 2 really makes me wanna cry.\r\nPlot and Storyline\r\nThe pretty, little story begins when pretty, little Princess Yona witnesses the murder on her father King II of Kouka. The killer is on one else but her great love Soo-Won (From the moment I saw him I knew that he was devil him-self). Yona couldn't of cursestay in the palace so she runs away with her best friend and bodyguard Hak. After meeting the oracle Ik-su they decide to find some \"Special Allies\" (They are really special, I just don't want to spoil the story) and fulfill Yona's destiny as the Princess of Kouka, take back and save the Kingdom. \\n\r\nIt's a for now unfinished story of a girl turning into a woman. Love, sadness and determination are mixed up with a great and interesting storyline along with some background stories about the main characters.\\n\r\nCharacters    \\n\r\nThe characters are typical like in every other anime story. We have the good guy, the bad villain and the pretty girl. But when we talk about each character in Akatsuki no Yona I have to admit that they are unique, specific and that they have that tiny spark inside that determines who they really are. \\n\r\nYona: Oh Yona, Yona... In the beggining she really is a naive and little princess but also determine. Exactly that determination helped her to overcome all her obstacles and persuade on her way to strength. And her aura, you just have to love her like everybody else in the show does. \\n\r\nSon-Hak: I love this guy! He was always a down-to-Earth guy despite his talent, strength and fame as the \"Thunder Beast\". Although he was also Yona's friend since childhood, he had to live in the shade of Yona's love towards Soo-Won. A great warrior and an interesting character. Son-Hak! \\n\r\nSoo-Won: What to tell about Soo-Won? Well first thing's first, he was a great actor and lair. \"Round of applause\"! He really didn't show any weakness in killing Yona's Father. Revenge really is something (Interested now?).\\n\r\nKing II: He reminds me of the cute, kind, little grandpa living next door. He hated weapons and war, and beacause of his all-the-time optimism his Kingdom soon started to lose strength. That's at least how we get to know him, but I am sure that he had a big secret under his tiny mustache. We'll hopefully find out in Season 2.\\n\r\nAnimation\\n\r\nMaho Yoshikama (Character design) and Michie Watanbe (Art lead) really did a great job. Ten out of Ten. The only thing I don't get is the fact that they praise Yona all the time for her beautiful Red hair although I think it's actually Redish-Violet. I don't know. And if I would be asked to give the award for \"Best Opening\" I would definitely give it to Akatsuki no Yona-Opening 2. Here is a link for the YouTube video if you'd like to see it: Akatsuki no Yona (Opening2)\\n\r\nConclusion\\n\r\nAkatsuki no Yona is an anime for evry...Girl, I think. I am not sure if boys would like it that much. It is not girly at all, it's just that boys might find the whole love story annoying. But hey, long live the feminism. Still, if I were a boy I would definitely give it a try.  \\n\r\nA great motivator and a love story to come. I hope the makers don't mess up the second season. \\n\\n\r\n Fingers crossed\\n\r\nYour AnimeGirl",

            "content": "This is one of those which I gave an 8/10 after a long time and also the only one which I stopped halfway because I was too greedy to finish it. \r\nStory: I was looking forward on seeing a story like this since ages! This anime has a totally captivating story and a plot that would keep you wanting more. It has all those powerful emotional elements that would definitely make you rate this one higher. From the start to the finish, Akatsuki No Yona delivers a powerful story of betrayal, love, loyalty and legend. To be honest, I even forgot that this was areverse harem because it was very serious and plot twisting at first. \\n\\n\r\nArt: The characters were drawn so beautifully that you can't take off your eyes from them. The scenic shots were done really well. Special mention for attractively characterizing \"Shin-Ah\" and making him a candidate for the best iconic male for year 2015. This is an anime which involves dragons, and dragons are very hard to draw.The clothing and accessories of the characters were done really well. The opening, however, is designed in a spoiler way which you will understand when you watch it. But that itself makes the audience know what would happen and yet you want to watch it because of the curiosity. \\n\\n\r\nSound: I think one of the most powerful things in this anime was the music which was done by Ryo Kunihiko. First time ever you get to see an instrumental becoming an opening, who said you need words to decorate an anime opening? Akatsuki No Yona clearly proved that there's no need. The other endings and openings were really pleasant as well- you can listen to them without disappointment. The voice dubbing was really good, I think some unrecognized seiyus had the opportunity to make a breakthrough here.  \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: I love the fact that the main group in this story had many characters of every variety. There was the positive one, the pervert, the mother, the loner, the loyal and the strongest \"even though he wasn't a monster\" one too. It's actually a small family to me and it's a great idea to make a reverse harem with. Each character has a unique background story which is equally interesting as the main plot. Also, the characters were introduced in a way that it would cause conflicts between them, which makes the audience more curious about it. Since this one is targeted for females, they've taken the trouble of adding a cute little squirrel which makes your heart warm and a huge urge to snuggle it. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: I never wanted to finish this anime, because I already loved everything about it. This one has that interesting way of breaking the humor into the serious scenes, they are more like amazing punchlines and it really made you laugh. There was absolutely everything in it that you want from a medieval anime, starting from action to slow romance. I saw enormous plot twists that would either make you laugh or keep you shocked for a moment. I think it also has that special feature that most reverse harems don't have, in usual harems they gave private space for each character without the other characters interference, but Akatsuki No Yona broke that rule which was more enjoyable to watch. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: This one has a totally unique story to it following a mythical legend. It also addresses amazing conflicting issues of being a locked up person who knows nothing about the outside even though you are royalty. I think being a woman, it taught me to be strong even though you are categorized as \"weak\" and no matter who you are you have an enormous potential to do almost anything.\\n\r\nDefinitely deserves a Visual Novel, it would sell well and since it's like a promotional production, I'd say that I would definitely read the manga without any second thoughts. \\n\\n",

I genuinely care for the love story, the relationships and all the characters. \r\nThe story is interesting, it remindes me not only of Inu yasha at this point, but also from Samurai Xbecause of the political aprouch.

She is no longer crying over the little things she would when she was at the beginning.

            "content": "Yona - From an ignorant princess slowly developing into one of the most badass female Anime characters... Well, she's still getting there though. This anime is really good.\r\nAkatsuki no Yona is about a girl named Yona. She was a carefree Princess in her Kingdom, Kouka. One day, someone kills her father, who was the king, and the one who killed her father was her beloved. With the help of Hak, he grants revenge on the \"killer\" (You will see it Su-won enough). However, she doesn't have enough power even though Hak is on her side. By that, a priest tells her to gather all the4 dragons.\\n\\n\r\nIn my opinion, this season is just a build up. Yes, until the 24th episode, it's just a build up. You will not see Princess Yona granting revenge on the Kingdom by the end of the season. This season mainly focuses on how she develops from being an ignorant princess. This season also focuses on the 4 dragons and how they differ from each other. Honestly, it's bittersweet. Bitter because of the ending and sweet because on how I enjoyed this anime a lot. That's the reason why I gave the story a 7/10 because the anime has a really good premise and I like how it slowly develops. What I don't like is how the ending is left hanging.\\n\\n\r\nHere are some positive things that you should expect from this show. I am just glad this show is slow-paced. They really took the time to develop Yona and the 4 dragons. Second is its fan service. Don't expect a lot of that and if there is a fan service, they handle it subtly which I am glad because most fan service today are not handled very well. Lastly is it's comic relief. This show can really share a lot of it's funny moments. I love how they handle moments when it's time to laugh and time to be serious. There aren't any weird transitions between the two. The timing of the comedy is great on this anime.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is really good. The coloring maybe decent, but the art style is really creative. The animation does have its moments, but then there are moments where they decided to place random still-frames especially when it comes to fight scenes. \\n\\n\r\nWhere the show truly shines is the Soundtrack. It really fits the setting of Akatsuki no Yona especially that first opening. This is the very first anime I watched where an opening are just instruments playing and it's amazing. That's the \"first\" opening. When the second opening came, well, it's crap. I mean, it sounds epic when you see the visuals of the opening which makes you pumped up. Without its visuals, the opening is meaningless.\\n\\n\r\nAnother thing where the show shines are it's characters. Again, you can really see on how Yona slowly develops, Hak on why he wants to protect the Princess, and Yun on why he wants to travel around the world. Don't forget to mention the 4 dragons. All 4 dragons have different powers (obviously) and different attributes. Each of them have a different attitude because of where and how they grew up, but they only have on idea - to protect Princess Yona (Apparently, Yona is somewhat a reincarnation of Hiryuu - the king that the dragon protects).\\n\\n\r\nOverall, this show very good. The character development, the soundtrack, and the humor is the reason why I like this anime. If you like Shonen anime (I know this is a Shojo anime), well give this show a shot and you might not regret it.\\n\\n\r\nScore: 8.2/10",

            "content": "One of my friends told me about how good was Akatsuki no Yona is . Everything he said was postive . I was curious how good this anime was and decided to try it out . After finished watching it , i can agree with him . Akatsuki no Yona is a great anime .\r\nPrincess Yona , who only have worries for her red hair is going to have her sixteenth birthday soon . Her beloved Su Won suddenly came to visit her which make her very happy . At that time , she asked her father about having a marriage between herself and SuWon but her father declined without hesitation . On her birthday , she feels like saying how she love Su Won very much to her father . She then goes to her father chamber only to find out a surprise of her life . What she witness is her nightmare . Her father is killed by her beloved Su Won . Because of that event , she became a fugitive on the run accompanied by her faithful and dear friend , Son Hak . I like how they did a good job at the story plot . Very nice indeed .\\n\\n\r\nThe arts were very good . I like how beautiful the art is at some moments . Same goes with the animation . Though i have a hard time not to gaze at Yona's giant eyes . It sometimes give me the chills .\\n\\n\r\nThe sound for Akatsuki no Yona were great . I like how the voice actor and actress did a good job at voice acting especially Yona who is voiced by Saito Chiwa . She has a cute and kawaii voice which make me fall for her . The OP and ED were good . I like the idea of having an instrumental song . It's kind of cool .\\n\\n\r\nAll of the characters does have a background . I like how Hak was always showing his love for Yona but she just think of it as one of his jokes . I know how you feel Hak . I really do . Other characters that pick my interest is Shin ah , The Blue Dragon that have the ability to see very far with it's dragon eyes and Kija , The White Dragon that have the hand of a dragon which have ten times more strength than normal humans .\\n\\n\r\nI really enjoy watching Akatsuki no Yona . From it's comedy that can make me laugh , to it's drama that almost made me cry and it's romance between Yona and Hak . I like what Hak did on episode 19 . He didn't have to kiss her to show his love but instead , lick Yona hand . Really Hak ? Really ? You sure know how to make a girl run away from you *facepalm*\\n\\n\r\nAkatsuki no Yona did a good job at capturing my interest . I really like this anime a lot and i hope this anime will have a second season because i really want to know what happen between Yona and Hak . I've been shipping those two so i hope they finally become a lover .",

            "content": "Akatsuki no Yona is probably one of the few shows I did npt expect to like that much. First, i'm not a fan of reverse harem shoujo series but this one surprised me. \r\nStory:  7\r\nYona Of The Dawn have a really intersting story but in my opinions,we didn't see much of the conplete story in this 24 episode anime. The manga is still ongoing and a lot of material for a possible second season. So, if you like historical setup with royalry and adventure, the story will take you in a wonderful ride of adventure around the kingdom to find these dragon guys.\r\nArt:8\\n\r\nThe art and animation for this show really surprised me because I never really like Studio Pierrot animation and art style. But to be honest the animation looked really solid in yhr few action scenes and the art looked well constantly. But they also did what I really hate to see, a LOT of budget saver frames. They were there for comedic moments but they were really badly animated chibi scenes.\\n\\n\r\nSound:   7\\n\r\nI love the first opening of this show, it's one of my favourite of all time to be honest. But then came the second opening. It didn't feel right, it was way too funky and annoying that i started skipping it after 4 episodes. For the OST, nothing too memorable except for the opening that came back a lot as being an OST in many scenes and also changed for diferent moments.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:    9\\n\r\nThis is where yona of the dawn shines. The characters really is the principal focus of the show since it was only about finding the 4 dragons. Yona has one of the best character developpement of 2014. She started from a normal innocent princess to a badass archer who would do anything to protect everyone. Hak also got good developpement but was more only there to help Yona and protect her. For the 4 dragons, they all got interesting backstories, reason to help her and also lovable and unique personnalities\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyement:    8\\n\r\nI did enjoy Akatsuki No Yona more than I thought I would because I started watching it without expecting much and then fell in the story could not stop watching. The fight scenes, even though there were not a lot, were well made and every episode felt unique. I honestly didn't like the blue dragon arc as much as the others because it felt long and boring when it could have been faster paced. The green dragon as the best arc of this anime and the one that was the most entertaining.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:    8\\n\r\nYona Of The Dawn is a show that a lot of people, like me, missed because it was a reverse harem adventure. This show really breaks the shoujo genre by proving us that shoujos are not only for girls. The action scenes looked a lot like any other action scenes that could be in a shonen. I recommend this series to anyone interested in a thrilling adventure show and don't mind slow pace focusing on characters instead of story developpement or action.\\n",

At first I came here because I thought the art was pretty, have a weakness for shoujo manga, the eyes were super sparkly, and it was full of bishonen. But what really managed to keep me reading were the characters themselves and how they've been changing and developing through the story. Most notably princess Yona. Yona is forced to go through sudden, dramatic changes in her lifestyle, and has to adapt to a completely different lifestyle, which she does realistically.Akatsuki no yona has great character development to make up for it's seemingly lack of plot and characters have their convictions and goals questioned. The animation is consistent and the fight scenes are acceptable. If you're into shoujo manga that deals with more than just fluffy romance, high school drama or love triangles I recommend checking this out.",

It was at a time when I didn't have anything on my list that was really grabbing my attention (I watch several anime's at once) and it was so fun and lovely that I watched it straight through without moving to another story. To me, that is usually a sign that this story has good entertainment value *nods.* \r\nIt has romance, yes, but it's not rushed at all, nor is it too much in your face, if you know what I mean. It feels more like an historical drama/ mythology,but done pretty well (I've had some bad experience with historical dramas, like Night Raid). A lot more going on here than romance. Political upheaval, survival, loss, war, friendship, and a coming of age story.\\n\\n\r\nI really liked how strong Yona is as a woman and as a character. She has a definite arc throughout the story, and I found myself really cheering for her by the end. And even better than that was Hak. He makes the story. His strength and loyalty are almost beyond belief, but instead of being turned off by the absurdity, I ended up really admiring him and rooting for him in his struggles and romantic endeavors. He makes a good straight man to some of the more comical characters, too. There seemed to be a pretty good balance between action, romance, drama, and comedy in this story, a thing that is pretty hard to pull off, I know. I think part of this strength lies in that it doesn't try to do too many genre's at once. It doesn't try to mix in sci-fi or slice of life. It just sticks to its points and fills them out pretty well.\\n\\n\r\nBut I didn't give it a 10, because it didn't have the WOW factor. It was great, I would definitely recommend it, but it needed just a little bit more to really knock your socks off. The ending does leave you hanging, though, so I see a second season in the works. I'll be there when that happens.\\n\\n\r\nP.S. I also happened to like the opening theme songs. Just sayin.",

            "content": "I was actually really reluctant to watch this anime because most reverse harems have really horrible female characters. I have to say I'm really impressed with the female lead in this anime though but i will get into that later.\r\nPlot - 6\r\nFor this plot i would have normally rated it a \"7\" for originality cause reverse harem's with a princess is very common but i deducted one point cause it's kind of like a \"go to the manga\" kind of anime. There is no closure in what they were trying to accomplish. It was still interesting to watch up until that point though.\r\nCharacters - 9\r\nOkay,personally i think this is where this anime shines the most. The female lead to this anime actually has some character development! This is what made me like this anime the most. The fact that the Yona (the female lead) tries to change herself so shes not powerless.\\n\\n\r\nArt - 8\\n\r\nI tend to rate more difficultly on art cause I'm picky like that. Originally i would have rated the art a 6 cause i don't really find it really beautiful. I bumped it up to an 8 cause of the backgrounds, the facial expressions and chibi (small) forms the characters take on randomly are adorbale.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 8\\n\r\nI enjoyed watching this anime quite a lot. The comedy was really to my liking and it really balanced the serious moments in the anime. The reason why this anime isn't a 10 is because as i stated before its a \"read the manga\" type of anime- where it kind of just cuts off.\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 8\\n\r\n- great character development\\n\r\n- comedy is really enjoyable\\n\r\n- a \"go to the manga\" type of anime",

This anime was able to use common anime tropes while avoiding some of the more common pitfalls of peers.\r\nStory:\r\nThis anime veils its true story until several episodes in, but after that point its fairly predictable and par for the course as far as I'm concerned. The major complaint I have with this anime is that it has moments of cringe-inducing melodrama that impaired my ability to enjoy the actually touching scenes. \r\nArt:\r\nSolidly animated at alltimes - a clear love project from the animation team. The eyes are expressive and reflect the intention of the characters nicely. The fighting was much more impressive than I expected, even the super-human characters movements are all animated and look natural. The backgrounds were fleshed out and I never felt that something was poorly done. I admire the amount of work that clearly was put into this.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nSo normally I don't put much into this category because usually they're an after thought; however the soundtrack for this anime fits it so perfectly that it deserves special mention. Why is \"Sound\" rated only a 7 then? Well, if you watch the anime, you'll notice that the intro was changed midway through (as always) but I feel like they completely botched the music choice for it. They went for the most generic \"anime intro song\" that I can't like no matter how many times I listened to it, which is a shame really because everything else auditory was fantastic.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nI am a firm believer of Chekhov's Gun (Google it) in storytelling - and some anime tend to ignore this principle entirely, making entire arcs that don't matter to the actual story in the slightest. Akatsuki no Yona is not one of those anime. All of the side characters matter well after their introductory episode(s) and more importantly events that happened previously are referenced without the heavyhanded use of flashbacks. I am extremely pleased to report that there was virtually no fan service for all of the 24 episodes (even though they even went into a brothel once). I'm so sick of pointless panty shots of characters and the sexualizing of girls well underage here in the U.S. Even though the main character is female and there are clearly several love interests, there wasn't even the slightest hint of nudity. Anything perverted with Yona would have been tasteless and completely out of character anyway; for not sinking that low the creator's of this anime have my respect.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nI enjoyed Akatsuki no Yona quite a bit and will definitely be on the lookout for a potential new season in the future. With well above average character development and non-filler side characters, Akatsuki no Yona earns a very solid thumbs-up from me!",

This might be a late review, but I got the urge to write one about this.]\r\nThe story started with a young red haired girl named Yona and her hatred for her hair 'cause of its odd color. I wasn't entirely surprised when I first watched this anime and I thought that I might be dropping this 'cause I thought that the heroine would be pathetic 'cause some common shoujo reverse harem anime always starts off with annoying pathetic MC, but I WAS WRONG. WRONG. Akatsuki no Yona is fardifferent from any other shoujo anime and I could say that Yona is by far the toughest heroine I've ever known in a reverse harem show. lol It's not your typical type of shoujo, mates.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is really impressive, in my opinion.  The characters are well detailed so as the background and the landscape. The animation has an authentic style and/or design. I salute Kusanagi-san, the author, for her best work.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound is one of the best things about this anime. Though, the first opening theme came off instrumental, it left a great impact to me which I found really amazing. The background music gave me goosebumps, too. Each of the characters voices are very unique and suitable for the character itself.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the characters, I don't think I have a character I dislike here or I want dead. All the characters are likable, appealing, hilarious and very unique. From the heroine and the other main characters, to the antagonist and also the side characters and/or extras. What really captivated my interest was Yona's character development. It went off properly and exactly as what I was anticipating. Everyone goes with different backstories that will surely leave a massive feels to its audience. I remembered crying when Shin-ah's past was revealed in the series.\\n\\n\r\nI really enjoyed watching this anime because there was never a dull moment in the series. You will laugh, you will cry, you will get excited, you will get depressed and you will also be attached. All emotions in one fascinating anime. Everything is well-made, though the series ended with a questionable cliffhanger.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I could rate it 11/10. I truly and highly recommend it to everyone 'cause I know that they will surely enjoy this anime.",

            "content": "Yona of the Dawn had popped up constantly in my recommendations list and I had finally decided to give it a shot, and I'm so glad I did. If you're a fan of shoujo anime then: stop what you're doing and go watch it NOW! But even if you aren't, you should still watch it!\r\nSTORY: 7\r\nI'm gonna be honest, Yona of the Dawn doesn't have the world's most original or unique plot, but it's easy enough to follow without getting you confused and keeps you hooked onto it. To me, that's not even a problem, even though it has a simple plot it's able tokeep you on edge and wondering 'what's next?'. My biggest problem with this anime was the ENDING. I won't spoil what happens, but it was so underwhelming! The entire journey the characters have lead to nothing, and it left me wondering where the hell the next episode was! (Of course, I've heard that there's probably going to be a second season of this anime, if there is this won't be too big of a problem when it comes out.)\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER: 9\\n\r\nIn the first couple of episodes, I really didn't like Yona. She seemed almost Mary Sue-like and depended everything on Hak. But the character development is amazing as she has to deal with more experiences and meets new people.  Hak, is probably my favorite character in the anime. He's witty, badass and tries his best to protect everyone, even if he's injured. The dragons are all different, they all have their own quirks and personalities. (You learn about their backstories through lots of flashbacks) As for Zeno... I've heard that he has a very in-depth backstory in the manga but I'm not reviewing the manga right now, I'm reviewing the anime! I really wish they could've just extended this anime a bit longer just so we could've learned at least something about him, the other dragons all got multiple episodes dedicated to them but Zeno gets bits and pieces of the last one. Hopefully they go in depth with him in season 2. Another issue is the lack of Su-Won, I wish they could've gotten more in depth with his character and HIS backstory, what did his father do to get killed? What about King II, why was he elected to become king in the first place? THESE ARE BURNING QUESTIONS I NEED ANSWERED, so there better be a season 2! (There are also other characters you meet that are pretty awesome, though! ;-)) \\n\\n\r\nART: 7\\n\r\nThe animation itself is pretty standard, it's clean and it's done well, I really loved the animation in the opening. The backgrounds and scenery in this anime were STUNNING. They were all beautiful, the colors they used were bright and colorful but dark when it needed to be. The anime goes into chibi-mode quite frequently, which I got pissed about sometimes because it would be a very touching moment at one second but it hits you with the chibi. It's not too big of a problem, as I understand that this show needed some comedic relief at certain points. \\n\\n\r\nSOUND: 10\\n\r\nI loved the music in this anime so much! The OP is so beautiful, and the background music in general was always spot-on. I watched the anime in the sub, I don't know anything about the dub. The sub voice actors all did an amazing job!\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT: 8\\n\r\nOther than getting completely annoyed at the ending, I don't have any other complaints. I thoroughly enjoyed it, and it kept me wanting more! it's definitely worth a watch. I'll totally be watching season two of Yona of the Dawn! \\n\r\n(Overall: 8.2)",

I love anime\u2019s who are not scared of being different. \r\nThe characters in this are well written and lovable. Of course, it is a shoujo anime so you can expect the huge amount of handsome guys, but let this not be a reason to let it slide without giving it a proper chance.\\n\\n\r\nThe main character, the princess, is in the beginning, of course, your typical spoiled princess. It makes sense, but most of the time when these characters get into difficult situations they remain their spoiled rotten self. In this case, however, Yona realizes how pathetic she is out there in the real world, incapable of defending herself and protecting others. \\n\r\nThis is why her character development is outstanding. She wants to grow stronger so she won't be the damsel in distress anymore. She still has some of those moments, but it\u2019s hard to get rid of a lifestyle you were born in. \\n\r\nI love her character because she is willing to train her weaknesses and grow stronger by her own hands. \\n\r\nThe rest of the characters are a lovable bunch of guys. They are good characters and are a great addition to the show. \\n\\n\r\nFor everyone who enjoys a well-written story with amusing characters and a good female lead, then this is your show. \\n",

            "content": "Brief synopsis\r\nIt is Princess Yona\u2019s 16th birthday and the question that everybody\u2019s asking is who is she going to marry now that she is of marrying age? Yona has her heart set on her cousin, Su-Won, who she adores. As Yona goes to plead her case with her father, who objects to this union, she finds herself embroiled in a catastrophic event that results in her fleeing from her kingdom into wild, new territory and seeking the help of a band of rogue warriors to reclaim what is rightfully hers.\r\nStory\r\nThe show\u2019s premise was not especially interesting. It reminded me of Nickelodeon\u2019s Avatar: The Legend ofAang, what with its motley cast of rebels travelling the world, trying to bring peace to warring tribes each named after a different element. However, this show lacked Avatar\u2019s charm, deeper messages of tolerance, and awesomely choreographed fight scenes. It also suffered issues with its pacing. By the show\u2019s completion its primary conflict had barely begun to be resolved. Nevertheless, I did find myself enjoying the show somewhat. It was easy to follow and made for a nice bit of mindless viewing.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters\\n\r\nWhilst no particular character leapt out at me as being especially interesting or lovable, there were a wide variety of them, each with their own unique set of characteristics. Particularly impressive was the fact that the show was able to dedicate time to developing the backstory of every main character and many of the supporting cast. And whilst I expected to be annoyed by the helplessness of the titular character, she really did try her best to become more independent and stronger as the show progressed \u2013 even if she did have to be rescued countless times! My only real problem was with that irritating squirrel, Ao. I couldn\u2019t stand that thing or the annoying, un-squirrel-like noises it was constantly making. I\u2019ve never understood the need to give a princess a cute, animal sidekick. It wasn\u2019t cute, it wasn\u2019t funny, it was irritating and actually detracted from my enjoyment of the show.\\n\\n\r\nArt\\n\r\nThe art was attractive. At points, it was even quite beautiful. Yona\u2019s world was colourful and every important character had interesting elements of visual design.\\n\\n\r\nMusic\\n\r\nThis was probably my favourite aspect of the show. Whilst there were a couple of gaffes, e.g., the forgettable techno-pop second opening, the music, which made full use of many traditional Eastern instruments, was generally outstanding and in keeping with the show\u2019s historical drama genre.\\n\\n\r\nOverall enjoyment\\n\r\nWhilst Akatsuki no Yona had its problems, e.g., with its unexceptional premise and pacing, it was better than I expected and was still somewhat enjoyable. What the show lacked in gripping story it started to make up for with its generosity in terms of character development and pleasing art and music. I\u2019m not sure whether I\u2019d recommend it to anybody, but I certainly wouldn\u2019t passionately persuade anybody against watching it either.",

            "content": "Story! 6\r\nI thought that the story, or the initial events leading to the core of the story, were a little random. Most of the foreshadowing is in Yona's red hair, and then suddenly she's the descendant of this random king who is the centre of this group of random dragons and there isn't a lot of explanation. You, as the audience, are expected to accept this turn of events and Yona's inevitable destiny. \r\nOn the surface level, however, the plot moves from dragon to dragon in a very natural succession that makes it flow smoothly. It verges on a grittiness near the end that separatesYona from a lot of reverse harems - it's very refreshing! \\n\\n\r\nArt! \\n\r\nThe art is appealing. The fighting sequences aren't anything to write home about, but they aren't clunky or awkward. The character designs are definitive and bright and modern. \\n\\n\r\nSound! \\n\r\nThe instrumentals are phenomenal!!  It's simply impossible to skip the second opening, which is so appropriately intense and lovely. The music is very fresh and caters to the time period of the series. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter! \\n\r\nThe characters are all tropes, to be honest, but they work into the series so efficiently and effortlessly that they form a family. They each have a unique, powerful backstory that carries the majority of the series, aside from the fate of the fantasy countries this series is set in. What's more important, is that the female-female relationships are made just as important as the female-male relationships. \\n\r\nI'm assuming that out of all the characters, Yona gets the most criticism. She makes the turn in her personalities - from spoiled princess to courageous warrior - rather quickly, it's true, but the motivations behind her development are very earnest. She isn't an insufferable heroine, just unrealistic, but in terms of the series she makes a great lead, and her kindness is well balanced with her determination to stick to her morals. \\n\\n\r\nOverall! \\n\r\nAkatsuki no Yona offers a very enjoyable series for people who are looking for something fluffy and of good quality (although it gets a little less fluffy when it comes to Zeno's backstory - I literally sobbed). The politics of different characters and countries are covered, if not in depth, and furthermore the characters all have relationships (good or bad) with one another that are dynamic and unique and sometimes challenging to the series, which offers something different than a lot reverse harems that don't want to work for it.",

            "content": "[DISCLAIMER: minor spoilers ahead]\r\nTrust. The faith that we humans put in others hoping that they will not break it in return. But when that faith is broken by the one we held most closest to our hearts, in the most brutal way possible, how can one not help but lose their trust in humanity? In Akatsuki no Yona we see our heroine - the Princess Yona - extend the arm of love and compassion despite suffering from a bitter betrayal.\r\nThe momentum of Akatsuki no Yona kicks in right from the first episode with the chirpy tone being undercut by something more sinister - instantly grabbingone\u2019s attention. The pacing is generally quite good, but are times when the plot is somewhat disrupted by frequent flashbacks, but those are mainly in the first third of the anime. Whilst Yona is a shoujo anime, it doesn\u2019t shy away from violence. There are plenty of fight scenes to keep you in your toes, but they aren\u2019t just there for simple entertainment purposes - fight scenes include the psychological analysis of various characters. Romance is not a driving factor in the anime, either. Yes, it is made clear from the beginning that Yona is very much in-love with her cousin, Soo-Won, but this isn\u2019t a story about how Yona is pining for him whilst wanting to murder him. There\u2019s no \u201cI love you so much, but you killed my Father therefore I\u2019m going to end your life, and mine, in a Shakespearean murder-suicide\u201d. Instead, the line between hate and love is blurred and whilst Yona\u2019s difficulty to completely throw Soo-Won away is important to the plot, romance is really not a priority. The anime instead focuses on putting Yona and her entourage in situations that will test them and our heroes go through a lot of hassle to get to where they are at the end of the anime. Friendship, betrayal, suffering and other important themes are well-explored within the 24 episodes.\\n\\n\r\nFurthermore, the anime is not afraid to tackle difficult subject matter in order to test the strength, resolve and resilience that Yona has been building throughout the length of the show. I won\u2019t talk too much about it, but anime can have the tendency to deal with such matters in an insensitive way sometimes. But in Akatsuki no Yona, the issue is dealt with tact and nobody\u2019s dignity is compromised in the process.\\n\\n\r\nAs the main character of the show, the anime is essentially Yona\u2019s story. The story of a once weak, naive, sheltered and - sometimes - spoiled young girl who fights to become a woman of strength, honesty and wisdom. Yona does more than just find four dragons on her journey through the Kingdom that her father once ruled: she grows up and forces herself to become resilient to her own suffering so she can help others alleviate their terror. We see Yona put others before herself. Her fellow companions attempt to shield Yona from stepping into something serious and encourage her to depend solely on them, but she refuses. She refuses to remain docile and ignorant.  Yona\u2019s resilience and passion makes her remarkable person. She is unlike any shoujo female protagonist that I have ever encountered, in that she goes through the most character development and it is her character trajectory that proves to be of most importance. There\u2019s no need to worry about a wet-wipe of a heroine who can\u2019t even think for herself. Yona is not just the heroine in name, but in what she does as well.\\n\\n\r\nHak, dubbed the Thunder Beast for his brute strength and skill in battle, is more than just a raging warrior that his nickname makes him out to be. As Yona\u2019s bodyguard and trusted childhood friend, he is conflicted between making her rely him for 100% protection and allowing her to become stronger on her own. Despite the emotional tirade that Hak seems to be fighting within, he still manages to be teasingly humorous and relaxed when the time calls for it. It\u2019s what sets him apart from other shoujo loyal-dog types. He\u2019s not brooding nor is he bitter: he is, at heart, a selfless man who doesn\u2019t mind being sidelined as long as it makes the people he loves happy. He might be righteous, but that doesn\u2019t make him dull. He\u2019s one of my favourite characters on the show - after Yona - but he wouldn\u2019t be if he was the irritating silent and \u2018cool\u2019 type who always protects his master from the shadows (and never has anything nice to say). Hak is up-front and honest in everything that he does (even if Yona doesn\u2019t always catch on to his true intentions) and that is what makes him so lovable.\\n\\n\r\nTo round it up, the third main character is Soo-won - our main antagonist. However, I\u2019d be lying if I said I hated him. Akatsuki no Yona doesn\u2019t give us a flat and psychotic villain with a laughable motivation. Instead we are presented with the counter to our heroine, he is not the epitome of evil as most villains are. Dishonest and cunning he may be, but Soo-won doesn\u2019t believe that he is actually doing anything wrong - and it\u2019s somewhat hard to disagree with his motivations. He seeks to repair weaknesses within the Kingdom of ... whilst uniting the five tribes in order to both strengthen the country against outside invasion and improve the lives of his subjects. His motivations are, essentially, honest but the way he goes about doing thinks is morally reprehensible. In my opinion, his character his full of nuance and I\u2019m interested to see how he progresses once I catch up with the manga (and if the anime gets a second season).\\n\\n\r\nThe cast of supporting characters are also very interesting and there wasn\u2019t one that I felt was unnecessary baggage. Although they are developed to varying degrees, in relation the amount of time they have on-screen, we get a clear indicator of their personalities and they all complement each other whilst adding depth to the show. \\n\\n\r\nDon\u2019t let the number of men put you off watching Akatsuki no Yona. This is a far-cry from a reverse-harem series. Yona\u2019s entourage (excluding Hak) might be devoted to her and care deeply for her, but there\u2019s none of this \u201cI must protect Yona because her heart calls to my heart\u201d garbage that we so often see in shoujo with a lot of dudes.\\n\\n\r\nAs well as a good plot and well-developed characters, Akatsuki no Yona also has some of the most beautiful animation I\u2019ve ever seen. The colours, character designs and sceneries are a real treat. The actual animation, itself, is also very well done. Characters are never seen in still shots and the fight scenes are animated with fluidity and precision. The soundtrack is also gorgeous - with the second ending theme being one of the most beautiful things I ever heard. I especially appreciated the inclusion of more traditional sounding East Asian music and instruments as well. There\u2019s also some pretty outstanding voice work as well (nothing ever sounded stilted and flat): with the Yona herself having a very emotional and nuanced performance. Chiwa Saito really captures the highs and lows of Yona. Special shout-out also goes Yuusuke Kobayashi who manages to make Soo-won sound both lovable and detestable. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, I think Akatsuki no Yona is a great anime that was able to capture me from start to finish. It\u2019s both moving and entertaining as well as wonderfully produced. I do hope it gets renewed for a second season because there were plot points and characters that needed development. It also ended in a way that suggests the studio wants to go ahead and adapt the rest of the material of the manga - that leaves me hungry for more.",

            "content": "Many anime struggles to achieve a very smooth and gradual development for their characters. Akatsuki no Yona is a dazzling dawn in that sense, since it is one of the few recent series that nails character development. Yona is officially on my list of favourite female protagonists. It is so amazing when you watch some of the later episodes of Akatsuki no Yona and go back to the very beginning. There is a massive shift to the atmosphere she possesses even though her appearance has gone through almost no change at all. It almost feels like a different anime. \r\nThe anime starts off with Yonaand group of guys behind her ready to interrupt what looks like an army heading to war. We see Yona as a leader, leading us to believe that this series will be action packed, war based anime. But after the quick (beautiful) opening, we are presented with a setting of a peaceful country and a princess that knows nothing about hardship. Yona is portrayed as a spoilt and naive girl in love, to whom everything is provided, from food, abundance of clothes, accessories, affection, guards,etc. But this life of her doesn't continue for long as it crumbles before her eyes during the second half of the episode. And now we are left with many question, few of which are \"Where is the Yona we saw at the very beginning? And how does she get to that point?\". And hence, we set off on a journey to see her grow as a person from experience, learn about her country and become stronger/independent.   \\n\\n\r\nAs you can guess from the title, the main focus is Yona. Therefore, other characters, compared to her, has less screen time, excluding Hak (Yona's childhood friend and her guard). However, that is not to say they are boring in any way. They all have their set of personalities, motives and back story that is unique to them. This makes every encounter during Yona's journey with new characters an interesting one. All the characters, however, are there to influence and take further Yona's character. \\n\\n\r\nArt style, while is decent throughout, has moments of brilliance sprinkled all over the series. The soundtrack is also something to take note of. While I do believe the amount of soundtracks in this series is less compare to other 24 episode series I have seen (thus, there is a lot of repeated background tracks), they are without a doubt beautiful. Therefore, I welcomed their repeated use. They provided the right vibe and atmosphere, and complimented the series very well. \\n\\n\r\nFollowing our main lead and her group may sound a bit too simple for a story. There is an overarching plot that has yet to start undergoing. Akatsuki no Yona simply served to provide a very rich cast of well developed characters. It allowed us to know them, inside out. It is merely a beautiful preparation towards a second season which is obviously on its way. This first half, as good as it is, will not make sense if there is no second season. The ending is, thankfully, a satisfying conclusion for season 1, going back full circle to how we started at the very beginning. The anime fulfilled its purpose of taking us on a well paced journey with many many uplifting, emotional and adorable moments to show us how Yona reached the Yona we saw in the first few second of the series.\\n\\n\r\nI leave a score of 8.7 as I eagerly wait for its continuation.",

The main character Yona is alot stronger then those in the the other reverse animes which i really liked. The guys in the anime are very diverse and quirky and anyone would love them. The plot is straight to the point and it doesnt really drag on, so it makes it alot easier to watch. There are some serious times but there are still many times where its funny and partswhere you just go \"AWWWWWE\" o its basically perfect.\\n\r\nI didnt have any problems with the anime what so ever so I really do recommend it to everyone.\\n\r\nOKAY SO\\n\r\nIm REALLY REALLY picky with the animes i watch that are reverse harem. I find it hard for me to find one that has the type of art i like and everything. This is one of those where its really hard to find bad things and parts in the show.\\n\r\nI would give this a 800/10 if i could.",

It's mainly about finding your purpose and who you really are and protecting who is important to you even ifit means sacrificing yourself. There are people who have crushes on Yona but she is too thickheaded to realize this. So as of romance don't expect too much. But as for story you will not be disappointed. \\n\\n\r\nI gave this straight 10s across the board. \\n\\n\r\nAlso if you enjoyed this anime then here is some animes I think you'd also like.

            "content": "\"Retaking the throne means taking responsibility for the entire kingdom\" - Hak.\r\n\"Yona of the Dawn\" is an adaptation of the manga by Mizuho Kusanagi.\r\nSTORY (8):\r\nThe story \"Yona of the Dawn\" takes place in the kingdom of Kouka. Yona is living in Hiryuu Castle with King II and her bodyguard, Son Hak. When Yona was about to show her true love for Soo-Won, things took a turn for the worst when Soo-Won killed King II and planned to take over the kingdom of Kouka. Due to this terrible incident, Yona and Son Hak were forced to leave the country. Along the journey they met Ik-Su &Yun. Ik-Su tells them that in order to save the kingdom of Kouka, Yona & Son-Hak has to find the 4 remaining dragons. So Ik-Su sends Yun to join with Yona & Son-Hak. \\n\\n\r\nThis anime is a journey in search for the 4 remaining dragons. Dragons are referred to the guys who have unique combat skills. \\n\\n\r\nThe story followed the traditional way of storytelling about setting up a character, sending them on their journey and learning more about them through their journey. This anime managed to do that well.\\n\\n\r\nAlthough this anime was clich\u00e9 at parts like people do nothing, this anime at least took the time to improve the 4 dragons including Son-Hak & Yun's relationship with Yona.\\n\\n\r\nART (9):\\n\\n\r\nThe animation style is good. The animation also uses comedic elements when there is any light-hearted moments.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND (9):\\n\\n\r\nThe opening and ending fits the tone of the music especially in the anime itself. This resembles like in ancient \\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER (8):\\n\\n\r\nI was very surprised to see a main female character who is strong and determined just like in the anime itself. Her name is Yona. She is beautiful but also determined to succeed no matter what happens. Chiwa Sato embodies the character of Yona well. I also did like her relationship with Son-Hak. Yona showed a lot of character growth when she travelled along with Son-Hak and finding the 4 remaining dragons. In the later episodes, Yona becomes a badass just like Son-Hak and the 4 dragons. Yona is one of the best main female character I have seen.\\n\\n\r\nSon-Hak is like a father-figure to Yona. When he teaches her how to use the bow, he showed compassion and he wanted her to learn how to develop combat skills. His backstory was handled well.\\n\\n\r\nSoo-Won is an interesting character, he could be an anti-hero. However, I wished that we would at least give more backstory to him on why he killed King II, Yona's father.\\n\\n\r\nI also did like Yun. He is distant to nobles. I also liked his backstory the most. He is distant to nobles just like being distant to popular culture. He reminded me so much of Hachiman Hikigaya who never want to be part of the majority and instead have his own private life. Yun is one of my favourite characters in this anime along side with Yona.\\n\\n\r\nI liked Shin-Ah's relationship with Yona although he is stoic and has no social skills. I did like the way how he opens up to Yona and her gang.\\n\\n\r\nI also like Ki-Ja's personality that is straightforward and polite.\\n\\n\r\nI did like Jae-Ha's charm and affection towards Yona.\\n\\n\r\nZeno only had one episode and it really sucks that we did not know much of him. I wish that they could explore more on the backstory of Zeno.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, I wish that Ki-Ja, Shin-Ah & Jae-ha could at least be given more material so that I can really appreciate them more. Nevertheless, their backstory was handled well. I did like most of the characters. At least they never show me any annoying traits. \\n\\n\r\nIt is very interesting that the names Jae-Ha, Shin-Ah & Ki-Ja were names that are inspired by Korean artists.\\n\\n\r\nCONCLUSION (8):\\n\\n\r\nDespite few problems I had with the show, I still enjoyed this show regardless. I just hope the OVA will try to wrap things up nicely. And we get to see Soo-Won. I am looking forward to that.\\n\\n\r\nThere is great character development.\\n\\n\r\nIf you are looking for an anime that focuses on journey and good character bonding moments, this anime is for you.\\n\\n\r\nI give this anime an 8 out of 10.",

            "content": "Dear Whoever is Reading This,\r\nMy absolute favorite genres are fantasy and romance and I just knew that \"Yona of the Dawn\" was a must watch.\r\nWhat really got me into the show, of course, beside the intruiging story with the Four Dragons, was the pace. No flaws there. Starts out by slowly pulling you towards the essence and gradually makes you hungry for more, and that never changes. Even until the end. It is just a very well structured and utmost delicious meal - appetizer (introduction), main dish (rising action+climax+denouement) and dessert (epilogue).\r\nAnother lovely aspect of the series was the characters. I honestly found not oneof them annoying or unecessary. I miss the gang already, especially Hak and him teasing practically everyone. I had the time of my life when he interacted with Yona, Mundok, Ki-ja or Jae-Ha... Their love/hate relationship is priceless. The comedy is fresh, light and of high quality.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack of \"Yona of the Dawn\" was splendid, I have to point that out. I am in love with the first opening and the second ending, because the themes just fit the show perfectly and who isn't a sucker for some beautiful traditional Japanese music? When there was some kind of an intense, edgy situation, the composers and  sound directors knew how to make you stand on your toes and gasp. \\n\\n\r\nThe art was wonderful in general, but one thing I absolutely adored was how the animators depicted Yona's eyes throughout the series. More fiery, more intimidating, more determined and... stronger.\\n\r\nThis girl turned from a weak, ignorant little girl to a passionate, powerful soldier woman. Her character transformation was an example of how an outstanding execution should be done.\\n\\n\r\n\"Yona of the Dawn\" was an adventurous, emotional, funny, exceptional and enthralling anime which I am so so glad I started watching because it was incredibly and undeniably worth it. \\n\\n\r\nIf you're looking for a fascinating plot with a nice and steady pace, interesting and radiating with ridiculousness characters, a captivating soundtrack, some epic action here and there... and if you'd like to witness the growth from Innocent Princess Yona to Badass Princess Yona, along her exploration of the world, then you should consider your priorities in life.\\n\\n\r\nThank you for reading.",

Girl travels to find allies in order to take back what is rightfully hers, she meets them and grew accustomed with each other. However, it takes great mastery to turn something not original into something that is refreshing and that is where Akatsuki no Yona proved to be the strongest. \r\nWhat would you do if you were betrayed bythe one you loved the most?\\n\\n\r\nThis question sparked the start of Yona's struggle and adventure. When she witness her father died by the sword of her beloved Su-Won her world fell apart. Being the princess that she is, she's been sheltered her whole life and knew only happiness. Having a loving father, a caring special someone, a loyal friend and a whole kingdom supporting her contributed on how trusting and simpleminded she is. But her perfect world crumbled before her very eyes and thus marked the beginning of her painful journey.\\n\\n\r\nWhile it seems that everything has been taken away from her, Hak, her ever loyal friend protected her, helped her, and supported her. You can see the feelings he held for Yona all this time. With flashbacks of their time together, Yona, Su-won and Hak made the strongest childhood friendship so much that it hurts watching things unfold for them.\\n\\n\r\nAkatsuki no Yona is full of interesting characters that will make you watch out for them. Even the supporting ones did a good job to make Yona stronger and fiercer where the situation calls for it. You can see the strong emotions play on Yona's face as she deal with her inner strife. It was fulfilling to watch her grow you can't help but be proud of her.\\n\\n\r\n\"No matter how foolish or incomprehensible, some love cannot be discarded. You may try to stop your heart, unable to forgive yourself, but there will be times when you lose hope and your heart is moved again.\" ~ Ik-soo\\n\\n\r\nRomance and love play an important role in shoujo anime, however, Akatsuki no Yona pulled it off in a subtle way. While the story didn't dwell on romantic relationships between the characters, you know that it's definitely there. You can feel how strong the feelings are. All the tension, hesitation, despair and love that is beyond comprehension. All these are present and were portrayed beautifully.\\n\\n\r\nAkatsuki no Yona managed to deliver shoujo with dignity. In a genre where often the princess is swept off her feet by her prince, Yona, on the other hand, will prove to you that a real princess will not stay behind his prince but rather stand side by side with her knight to fight - for herself and for what she think is right.",

            "content": "Believe it or not I actually dropped this half way through episode one because I expected it to be just another generic shoujo/romance anime. Boy was I terribly wrong. And boy am I glad I gave it a second chance.\r\nFrom the anime titles I have watched, it reminds me a combination of Fuushigi Yuugi and Fruits Basket. It reminds me of Fuushigi Yuugi because of the journey, while it reminds me of Fruits Basket because of the individuals pasts.\r\nSTORY. It starts out as a typical shoujo genre with the MC's (main characters) in a one-sided love triangle-esque web. (At least that is how it isportrayed in the anime thus far.) This web consists of a noble boy, a princess, and her loyal bodyguard/general. Everything changes once the first episode ends. The princess's love betray her and she is forced to leave her kingdom along with her loyal bodyguard. Thus the journey of the princess and her loyal bodyguard embarks. They come across a priest and his companion. The priest informs her the story long ago of a king and his four guardian dragons. He then tells her that she must gather the dragons. The princess, her bodyguard, and the priests companion then set on a journey to find the four guardian dragons: the white, blue, green, and yellow dragons.\\n\\n\r\n(Sorry if I made the story sound much more boring or lame than it actually is. My summary obviously does not do this story justice.)\\n\\n\r\nART. One word: BISHIES. (Just kidding, not kidding.) The art is beautifully breath taking. Exactly how a shoujo genre's art should be.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND. The songs used suit the anime well. As well as the ost bgm (background music). Good bgm makes, you, as an audience more engrossed in the anime.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER. The only thing I can say is that this author, is guuud. Every single character is lovable or likable. You will fall in love with every bishie in this anime, perhaps even the evil ones. The story does a great job of showcasing the characters past in a way that is not too exaggerated or forced. They all made me tear up or cry to some degree.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT. I enjoyed this series a little too much. Much more than I anticipated. This made me laugh, cry, smile, and it warmed my heart. I applause it for being able to merge the genres romance, comedy, and adventure so well.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, if I could, I rate this anime 9.6/10.\\n\\n\r\n10/10 rounding up.",

But by the second episode, I was so hooked into the show. It is very rarely that waiting each week for an episode felt like torture.\r\nAnd really, I just learnt that Akatsuki no Yona is categorized as a reverse harem.  I mean, if you squint you can see it. But watching it, all I saw was a girl who was learning to stand on her own two feet after her pampered world was ripped away. Yes, there are romantic undertones, but theydon't steer the story line. Unless you count the love Yona has for Su-Won. But that quickly gives way to other plot points.\\n\r\nWhen you reach the end the series, it's obvious that the story isn't done and it absolutely needs a second season. Like, really. This show absolutely needs another season.",

            "content": "This is my first review I have ever written. It is based purely on watching the anime and nothing else. No research into the producer etc.\r\nTo start this off, I have to say that this anime is what I was missing for the longest of time. It is one of the few anime that I eagerly wait for the moment it airs and watch it the first moment I get. Even so with all the greatness that is to be described below, there are some parts that makes me unable to give a clear full rating for this anime.\r\nI shall go into the good partfirst and the poorer part last.\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt - 9 :\\n\r\nI wont say that the animation is the greatest, but it is one of the finer ones I have seen. The art makes the character feel that they belong there. The world and the character blends in nicely. The one part that keeps me from giving a 10 on this is the comedy. Although I liked the comedy to soften the dull mood some of the scenes give, they transition badly and sometimes feels forced in some of the scenes thus ruining the consistency. Even so, it is part of the show and it sometimes give depth to the character in expressing parts of the character not easily shown to the viewers.\\n\\n\r\nI especially enjoy the second ending. I enjoy looking at still line art and the ending has tons of those. The effects added in makes it more than just a plain slide show.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound - 9:\\n\r\nIt is rare that any anime would opt for an instrumental only opening. Initially it gave me an impression that its going to be like \"gokukoku no brynhildr\", which is the only other anime I watched with an instrumental opening. But giving it another chance, after watching 2 episodes in, it did not feel out of place at all. Its one of the piece that I dont mind listening to for hours and hours. Another great piece was the second ending. Akiko Shikata's style of singing made this show that much more enjoyable. I eagerly await the album release of the second ending.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the sounds used in the show, most of them blend well making you feel part of the show. It complements the show in bringing out the excitement and the sadness when it is supposed to.\\n\\n\r\nOne bad thing about the sound that I have to comment. The second opening. With all the instrumental folk tracks used in the show, the second opening surprised me to be a electric, rock piece. It took me half way into the second cour before getting over the shock of having electric rock in such an anime.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 8:\\n\r\nCharacter development of the protagonist and the supporting characters are mostly well done. The protagonist especially gets her story and reason slowly unveiled through the show. The comedy scenes helped in showing beyond the serious tone that most of the show is in. However, there are several characters that I have to point out that did not get any show time. \\n\\n\r\nThe Yellow Dragon - Did not make its debut until the very final episode and didnt get much face time even so. Needless to say, there isnt any character development at all.\\n\\n\r\nSu-Won - We never really did understand his reasons for for doing what he did. It is said that he was avenging his father very early on but further down, it is hinted that he has other reasons as well.\\n\\n\\n\r\nStory - 7*:\\n\r\nBefore you judge. It isnt that bad. There are reasons for the score of 7 which ill explain.\\n\\n\r\nFirst off, the show starts out rather fast. Yona was betrayed by her childhood friend and lost everything she knew by episode 3. Even so, the rest of the show have good pacing and the arks were fleshed out nicely.\\n\\n\r\nThe over-arking storyline was simple. Gather the 4 dragons from wherever they are and save the country in the time of darkness. By episode 23, only 3 dragons were gathered which left me to see how the show would end with its last episode and 1 more dragon to gather. And lo and behold, it ended as I have expected. The dragon just joins the party. Nuff said. Well, even the character agrees that it is way too simple. This leaves me completely unsatisfied and craving to know the story of the last dragon. Who is he?\\n\\n\r\nAlso, the ending. The important question was finally asked. What are you going to do with the 4 dragons? Not explained either. The ending was nothing but rushed, completely rushed. \\n\\n\r\n*I gave the story a 7 and if there are any sequel after this at all, it would immediately change to 9. \\n\r\n(Yes I took this idea from Arkada from Glass Reflection)\\n\\n\\n\r\ntl;dr, If you like story set in the medival/feudal era. This would be a good show for you. Just dont expect a round and complete ending with the happy and fluffy feeling that it ended nicely.",

            "content": "Betrayal is the best word that describes this entire anime. \r\nWhen people first look at Akatsuki no Yona honestly the first thought their gonna think of is \"its a typical reverse harem, weak girl, bishounens all over\" And at first people are correct. However watch the first 4 eps and you'll be amazed of the plot twist that involved with this anime. \r\nAkatsuki no Yona deals with betrayal of someone you love, and politics. Their is a hidden romance story within the anime but its not the main focus. Basically the main focus is Yona (the lead heroine) finding herself, and learning to become morestrong so that one day she can take back the kingdom that was stolen from her father by her dear childhood friend Su-won. Shes banished from the kingdom along with her bodyguard Hak. When she is banished she finds out that since she has the Hiyruu blood in her that she could be the \"master\" of the 4 dragons. So she goes out in a search to find these dragons in hopes that they will help her on her journey. \\n\\n\r\nHonestly I love reverse harem their like my bitter sweetness. This has to be the first reverse harem anime in a while where i fully enjoyed the story and plot and everything about it. Akatsuki no Yona is very suspenseful, political, and dramatic. I loved the 4 dragons they all demonstrated their own personality and characteristics that made them different. I also loved the main character Yona she was a different heroine. She wasnt the typical whiny, shy, little girl. She was strong, determined, fearless, kind of giving a Catniss Evergreen \"Girl on Fire\" feel. Each episode builds her character up to being the bold, fearless woman. The only thing I didn't like was how their rushed it in the end. I really really really hope that they do a second season of this anime because it would get a lot of ratings too. They ended it in such a cliff hanger feel. which i hate!! lol \\n\\n\r\nBut overall this anime is a good shoujo reverse harem anime. I recommend it to any female or male too. Because the fight scenes were actually pretty bad ass and enjoyable. I would totally rewatch this anime again too!\\n",

Now, she will take up the sword and the bow on a quest to gain new allies and protect her beloved people.\r\nStory (10)\r\nI really liked the plot. You don't see many shojos with a unique plot thought. for me i dont care about plots that much to be quite honest. however, akatsuki noyona definitely had a unique story. also, the fight scene's were exciting. maybe even better than some fights in shonen animes.\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt (8) \\n\\n\r\nThe art was pretty nice. it didn't stand out to me that much. however, it was very clear and i never found errors in it. \\n\\n\\n\r\nSound (10) \\n\\n\r\nThe music was pretty darn nice. it isn't what i would listen to but it fits the anime so well.

At first i find this boring, after all i literally watched only the first two seconds and quit, but this anime turned out to be a romantic very folk tale ancient story styled anime, and im a sucker for those types of anime. a real time would be zankyou no terror, this would be around a 7.5.As this story goes on, i admire the art because its really nice, so it deserves a 10, i enjoyed the story because i found it so adorable and realistic and nonrealistic.  its astory about a brat who has escaped her kingdom with her handsome strong body guard to escape being killed by her love thats gentle and appealing that betrayed her yet, still obviously had feelings for her. Still shocked, in a way i found realistic from her unemotional what is life? i cant rely on hak, i dont want him to die. but what can i do, i have to try. Rather than the annoying what just happened? what should i do? oh protect me hot guy that obviously loves me yet i dont realize because im too weak. LIKE seriously, this is where most people are WRONG, theres a huge difference bettween being able to defend yourself from castle guards, and being able to kill a sword master, bruh, dont let him guard you cuz u r a big nuisance and he gonna get killed, at least be able to defend urself cuz thts one less problem without u. BUT at least THIS girl stands up and not sit there like an idiot, actually DOING something, like THANK JESUS! so then she goes on a journey to assembled these companions that will help her take back the thrown, i always have waited for a story like this, so IF U LIKE A SPOILED GIRL WHO GROWS STRONGER AND MORE DISCIPLINED WITH HOT GUYS GOING TO TAKE OVER A THRONE IN THE MOST BAD ASS FLASHY WAY, THIS IS THE STORY FOR YOU! i like the background music, it wasnt bad, but it wasnt awesome like zankyou no terror.\\n\r\nI really like the characters so far, a loyal strong, funny, tsundere guy, a stronger growing, dense girl, a guy doing whatever he has to, to reach his goal, even killing his lovers father which he admired so and his own lover, a coward in appearance, but not actually a coward inside, a gentle strong man that is funny, a narcissistic helper, a gentle gentle calm clumsy man, really great vharacters now that i think about it. and i really enjoyed it, so i hope u guys will like it too!",

            "content": "Yona of the Dawn: The Ani-TAY Review\r\nAmazing:\r\n-A Shoujo take on Shounen Adventures\r\nYona of the Dawn is the grand amalgamation of a shounen adventure that has been refined and revamped into a shoujo form. The selling point is action and adventure rather than romance, but it is calmed down with reason and sophistication. At the same time, it manages to pull you into its fandom through its remarkable ability to appeal to everyone. Whether you\u2019re male or female, a fan of shounen, shoujo, action or romance, there is something to be found in this show for all. \r\nEver notice that every fighter inexplicably has some kindof jumping capability in your standard shounen? This is not the case for Yona of the Dawn, for powers are subtle and proportionate. No-one is creating energy in their palms, no-one is harnessing the elements at will. Only a single person in the world has this jumping capability. Rather than trying to impress by making things bigger, faster, and stronger, the show promotes its action with efficiency and strategy. Rather than perpetually gaining new powers to surpass that of their opponents\u2019, characters use the few powers they have to their fullest. The only exception to this is Hak, but he is just one powerful badass with a guandao that gives him an eight foot advantage. In all, the resulting entertainment is the same, but Yona of the Dawn\u2019s means just come off as more realistic, calm, and collected, making it feel more like a shoujo. \\n\\n\r\n-Realization and Resolution\\n\r\nYona\u2019s reformation is highlighted not only by her broken ignorance, but also by her desire to do something about this world. There is nothing worse than a show that introduces a dumb, delusional, absent-minded, or plainly ignorant main character which then leaves them undeveloped for a long period of time. If an anime stays like this for too long it becomes an annoyance for viewers. A pampered princess will never know how terrible the world can be unless she herself is thrown into it. In Yona of the Dawn however, an escape from these fears comes impressively sooner than expected. Yona\u2019s mentality quickly sways from that of a helpless princess who always relies on others to that of a heroine who strives to take action into her own hands. \\n\\n\r\nAs viewers, we don\u2019t want to see a hero that\u2019s just dead weight. We want someone interesting enough to get behind. We want to see motivation, determination, a sense for what is right! Yona\u2019s character development is more than satisfactory in this regard. She\u2019s not just a pretty princess anymore!\\n\\n\r\nThis show holds a pretty deep insight into how kings are viewed by their people. King Il may have been introduced as a harmless soul, but this superficial quality means nothing to many people. What\u2019s really important to an average person is how they particularly benefit from their ruler. Sure, everyone living in the capital is fine, and that\u2019s where Yona would have conjectured that her father was a great king, but almost everyone who does not live in the capital (or a tribe\u2019s epicentre for that matter) seems to be living in poverty. The people Yona meets on her journey mention that a good king would\u2019ve surely saved them from demise. What is special here is that after Yona learns of these perspectives, she overwrites her own. This is a world that needs change, and Yona figures that out. You can see that she makes an internal resolve to save these people.\\n\\n\r\n-The Preservation of Innocence\\n\r\nLet me enlighten you; there is no fan service in Yona of the Dawn, full stop. *Drops mic* - round of applause - standing ovation. This show is truly in the minority and it receives my sincerest praise for this fact. Yona is untouched by obscurely angled cameras, conspicuous wind, violating entanglements, ripped clothes, and most of all, tripping into a cupped position with a fellow cast member. Enough grace cannot be said. \\n\\n\r\n-The Ambiguity of a Villain. *SPOILERS IN THIS PARAGRAPH*\\n\r\nThe new king\u2019s true motives are suspiciously unclear. There is more to him than what meets the eye. He clearly states why he executed his actions, but it just seems like he truly cares for Yona. He tries to scare her out of the throne room before others come in, almost hinting that it\u2019d be dangerous to stay. When others do show up, he asserts to merely capture her. Once she escapes, he sends no immediate dispatch. When he learns of her supposed death, he seems to falter. Upon the unexpected reunion, he makes sure to conceal her identity. This must all mean something. The speculation is really up for grabs, but everything feels to be pointing towards anti-heroism. Whatever his reasoning, his character is a good subject for delving into and holds promise for the future. \\n\\n\r\n-Is this a Disney Animation?\\n\r\nThis thought couldn't escape my mind throughout the entire production. I don\u2019t mean this in the sense that Yona of the Dawn feels western, but more refer to the fact that it fills the Disney checklist. We\u2019re given an amazing soundtrack, beautiful character design, lovable and well written characters, a story that can be adored by youth and has more to offer to adults, a main heroine with a cause that we can all root for, a supportive cast, the staple animal companion (\u201cBest rodent sidekick in anime since Pikachu.\" - Koda Kazar. See below), an initial plot twist that throws everything out of whack, the recuperation journey that follows, and an evolution for the better within the main character. This show has almost everything, the only thing missing are the musical numbers. Kind of reminds you of Mulan now, doesn\u2019t it? \\n\\n\r\n-Don\u2019t Mess with the Raijuu \\n\r\n\u201cSon Hak. The grandson of Son Mundok, former head of the Wind Tribe, he rose to lead the tribe at a young age. A single blow from his blade is like lightning, earning him the nickname of the \u2018Thunder Beast (Raijuu) of Kouka.\u2019\u201d Hak is without a doubt the strongest fighter in Kouka. He is brave, strong, and persevering, but none of these words do enough justice when trying to describe him. Without him, Yona would have easily died on multiple occasions, that is, if her journey would have even been able to start in his absence. We have seen him take on dozens of men at once and succeed, survive falls that would have left anyone else dead or paralyzed, heal from cuts that were more than just flesh wounds, and yet, maintain his bad-ass composure. In all fairness, Hak may seem a bit overpowered compared to everyone else, but his power is both still possible in the limits of this world and a key element of the story. With such a stature, reputation, and weapon, who wouldn\u2019t hesitate in the face of Hak?\\n\\n\\n\r\nOkay:\\n\\n\r\n-Taking it Step by Step, Predictably\\n\r\nThanks to the snippet at the end of episode two, we knew from the start that Yona would find all the dragons. A window into the future can easily be as a hinderance to a story, but in Yona of the Dawn\u2019s case, there was no way in hell that Yona wasn\u2019t going to find all the dragons. What makes the story better than its superficial find dragon one, find dragon two plot are the trials that the party goes through to recruit each dragon. This flash forward focuses the plot on how they will succeed, rather than if they will succeed. It focuses the viewer on the individual dragons and the telling of their own stories and complexities instead of wondering what is to come. \\n\\n\r\n-How is Yona Alive? *No particular spoilers, just lore*\\n\r\nThere are a few scenes in particular across Yona of the Dawn that leave you saying, \u201coh come on, no-one could live through that,\u201d or, \u201cthat guy could have easily killed her.\u201d The answer that most people would jump to is that Yona possesses plot armour. In short, that means she is invincible because she is the main character. While this may be true, I believe that there is a justifiable explanation to this as well. The following is opinionated, but please regard the speculation nevertheless. Yona has the power to subconsciously convey and control. Take, for example, the fact that Yona can stun the four dragons by just being in their presence. This is possible because she is the reincarnation of the dragons\u2019 tamer from 1000 years ago, Hiryuu. Hiryuu was a divine incarnation who was able to conquer the country along with the four dragons. If you ask me, this would be impossible to do with just five people, but persuasion changes everything. By sharing Hiryuu\u2019s soul, Yona is able to subconsciously restrain people and stop them from dealing harmful blows.\\n\\n\r\nKeep in mind that this is all just speculation, so believe what you will, but in the very least it makes sense. As for her method of conveying (and this one is easy), it\u2019s all in her eyes. I don\u2019t care who you are, you would stutter and take a second thought after Yona hits you with her powerful gaze. Those eyes are weapons in their own right and if you think I\u2019m just gabbing, take a look at this:\\n\\n\\n\r\nTerrible:\\n\\n\r\n-This Cut-Off Point is A Buzzkill\\n\r\nThe show has really just started ramping up; to stop now seems almost criminal. There was a great deal of time to get to know the first three dragons and have their characters develop and fleshed out. Then came the fourth. How do you expect to make an integral character rememberable with 10 minutes of airtime? It\u2019s really a shame. \\n\\n\r\nBelieve it or not, a shoehorned character is not the biggest problem here. Yona\u2019s found the four dragons, she\u2019s said her plan, and now it\u2019s time to start going at it, right? Wrong! First you need to split the story in the middle, wait for more content to be written, hope the BluRays sell, then you continue. Depending on how the BluRays do sell, this show will either be a prologue to one hell of an adventure, the amazingly adapted first season to a show that fell short for all the wrong reasons, or in the worst case a show with no sequel at all. \\n\\n\\n\r\nConclusion:\\n\\n\r\nLooking over what we have here, Yona of the Dawn is well done anime that just isn\u2019t done yet. This is a timeless adventure with characters we can all get behind, animated in a beautiful shoujo style. It is a mature take on genres that we already love and it takes itself seriously in that regard, never faltering. When considering watching this show, you only have to ask yourself one question: do I want to watch a story that is halfway done, or wait until it\u2019s finished? A good portion of the time this answer is no, but in the case of Yona of the Dawn, there is no harm. This prologue, if I may, stands on its own as a recuperation journey and a path to revealing the truth. Not only that, when the second season does come along, the only thing that you\u2019ll be required to remember is that Yona has assembled the four dragons. Without a doubt Yona of the Dawn is a Go For It! as it stands now, and once complete the show will just be that much better.\\n\\n\r\nAs written here: http://anitay.kinja.com/yona-of-the-dawn-the-ani-tay-review-1693229962\\n\\n\r\nBy: Stanlick (aka SeanStan)",

You will be anxious for discover new characters and know about their stories and powers, but maybe you also will be bored in some parts. It's a good anime to pass de time.\r\nThe story is really good, but I think they wrapped too much, being stopped in some parts and I think this made the anime enjoyment so low. I was anxious to see the Yellow Dragon, just for see him in the last episode, without showing his powers. The anime didn't had an end, this is what made me sad, It's likeDeadmand Wonderland. \\n\\n\r\nThe art is amazing, I love this old traces, big eyes... it remember me Magic Knight Rayaeth, or CLAMP traces. \\n\\n\r\nIn my opinion, characters was the most explored part in the anime. Every character had a good development, without leaving anything to desire.\\n\\n\r\nI really feel a little disappointed in the end, idk. I was waiting for see how Yona would take the throne back from Sowon, the powers of the Yellow Dragon and his story, and de development of Yona and Hak's love. \\n",

Her friendship with Hak even grew alot, Hak always remained his funny and sarcastic self which I was most pleased about (as soon as i saw Hak a bursted out laughing, hes just a funny character)  \\n\r\nI tried showing my friends this but they were put off, i dont know why. \\n\r\nAkatsuki no Yona, or Yona of The Dawn, will always remain one of my favourites, i feel like i watched Yona grow as a person and on the odd occasion i even cried (dont judge im like that)\\n\r\nI would also just like to say both of the Intros were amazing and i would never skip it just because they were both simply beautiful to listen to.\\n\r\nIf you havent watched this yet, just go watch it ok? such a beautiful anime, im hoping for a season 2.",

I like how Yona (the female lead) gradually changes from a simple-minded princess into a young woman capable of strong leadership (in a non-feminism-in-your-face kind of way). She learns how to tackle life challenges from her loyal body guard and all the other friends she makes during her adventures. \r\nBesides a good story and lovable characters, this anime also has beautiful animation and agood balance of humor and seriousness.\\n\\n\r\nThis is one anime that I wouldn't mind if they made 100+ episodes because the story has the potential to stay strong and the characters are well-developed and easy to like. It could easily become like another Inu Yasha. \\n\\n\r\nEveryone should make room on their anime list for this one!",

This is a background story to show the protagonist that she was a rich and unuseless princess, that the world is much more complex and cruel than she thinks, thus focusing mainly on her whole evolution as a person. She needs to learn to survive outside the palace, to become independent and strong!\r\nHowever I found all this development extremely forced, the unfolding of the story is even interesting but very boring. The action scenes did not work for me, it doesnot give excitement, emotion or anything. The development of the protagonist is (obviously) totally foreseeable, and this business of what is cool is to see how it reaches its apex of evolution is bullshit. Besides all the reasons that justify the actions of each of the characters are extremely shallow and forced that make you question while watching things like \"there are thousands of ways to solve this situation but insist on choosing the most difficult and totally illogical ... so why???\".\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is not bad but there is nothing much.",

The humour and art are great.\r\nThe only downside Iwould say is that it takes a while for the story to become exciting and entertaining. I'de say it starts to be really good around the fourth episode or so, so you have to be patient and continue on watching even though you might think its boring at the beginning.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, a fun, awesome and epic anime.

Specifically she loses her home and her trust in things she grew up with since childhood.\r\nIt defies the norm in the sense we have a female lead who is hurt by betrayal and is trying to overcome and make the right decision from it, unlike from the ordinary first time a female lead is shown to be a bad-ass and reliable personone can count on. She learns and grows both in character and in philosophy. This and the obvious 'It isn't a male lead.' It has promoted growth and development in character.\\n\\n\r\nThis is well told through the storytelling of the show;\\n\r\nShe learns how to defend herself and others,\\n\r\nshe learns independence,\\n\r\nshe learns how to distinguish others demeanor instead of naively trusting them immediately.\\n\\n\r\nAnd she adventurers along a mix of old and new friends in her party to realize her goal.\\n\\n\r\nIt very much reminds me a bit of a more Chinese storytelling rather than a Japanese storytelling but that may just be it visually for background, art, and setting. The action is standard with sometimes our main male lead standing out in his more bold moments.\\n\\n\r\nWhat I lost interest in was in two things;\\n\\n\r\nThe lesser con was the music sounds so great on its own, but I never felt the scenes complimented well with them. One never helped the other standout. I'm either really picky or something just seemed missing in terms of heavy or light moments. It was more character reaction that made things more memorable.\\n\\n\r\nThe biggest irritation for me was the lack of focus a high number of times. I get there is a time and a place for everything, but it seemed so segmented rather than fluid in delivery. This would be the back and forth of serious moments to comedic moments as well as the change of art style between shots but in the same scene.\\n\\n\r\nIt's jarring and a very agitating way of storytelling. An example comparison to get the idea across is sometimes a scene that includes CGI as a big part of a scene but it did not compliment the previous shots that had none or had that it didn't give introduction to help transition to the CGI segment.\\n\r\nThe show will change scene appearance into a very sudden flat shot either for all or just one of the characters and/or its background. A poorly contrasting use to the detailed backgrounds and mood set before it.\\n\\n\r\nA more small minor thing that bothered me was that the latest prophesied dragon/party member was haphazardly put in. Unlike the first three where we got to see backstory, interests, intentions and character. This is probably due to them reaching the last of the episode time/budget.\\n\\n\r\nThe standard anime check list is here at least whether you like them or not; Incest love interest (Cousin), the majority of friends have some romantic interest in the lead, the villain has some good in his evil doing, and comedy dialogue to show that our cast isn't always uptight (Although here gets a bit too much.)\\n\\n\r\nIt has good moments, but to me, it falls to make sure it does typical norms of the medium and therefore hurts itself into putting greatness into what it has.",

Hak is a very good character and a really good looking one at that, i love the devotion to him keeping Yona safe. The comedy in this anime is nice as well with the boys always bickering and Yonagetting on Hak about any little thing is priceless. This anime is really a diamond in the rough, don\u2019t really know why it\u2019s so underrated because its so good!",

Akatsuki no Yona was all about how a person is determined to change fates after losing what she believed was hers. It is not about how she succumb after the reality was displayed in front of her but rather on how shefought against that destructive fact. She believed in her own strength and tried to change the world she had learned to love. All she did was for the sake of the country she knew she was born to serve with. \\n\\n\r\nAt first, i thought that Akatsuki no Yona was just like any harem type of anime- a girl that is pampered by a bunch of attractive men and i did not mind about this anime because i thought it was just a typical anime. Yet when i started it, i just can't help but finish the whole story. The characters were lovable and the story itself was really something. Who would have thought that a weak and pampered princess of Kouka will turn into somebody who is capable of changing the country's fate? How will her slim arms and ample strength turn the country into a strong and able country? That is what we are going to expect from this story. With the help of her friends, how will they use their will as weaponry to protect the people in Kouka?\\n\\n\r\nThis anime is worth watching for. The story will give us the idea how how determination and will to help can change a country's fate.",

I enjoyed watching Yona blossom from a weak, ignorant, and sheltered girl into a determined and steadfastly strong-willed heroine, alongside the comrades that she meets along her journey.\r\nNever have I seen such intimate and thoughtful character development in a shojo storyline; each character is given proper background and each adds a special quality to Yona's troupe. The characters all complement one another and as a result, there is an intriguing dynamic among the protagonists. Do not be turned off by the reverse harem-- this story tosses outany tropes that would typically be found in reverse harem anime and romance is only a subplot throughout this story! The art style is also amazing and almost nostalgic. Be prepared for several climatic, well-drawn fight scenes. Not to mention, the soundtrack adds even more depth of emotion to Yona of the Dawn. It is one of the first anime shows in a while that successfully opens with a beautiful instrumental song (at least for the first twelve episodes). The music lends itself as a homage to the beauty of such instrumental songs.\\n\\n\r\nThe antagonist of the series is similarly complex and three-dimensional (as all interesting characters should be). His mannerisms and intentions definitely confuse us; however, this only makes Akatsuki no Yona even more of a gem. Storylines that develop the \"villain\" just as well as its heroes are few and far between. I look forward to seeing how the manga further dives into his character...\\n\\n\r\nAkatsuki no Yona truly deserves more attention (and a second season!). I know I will be re-watching this show one too many times in the future.",

The story is great, its not like a huge save the universe story, but its nice to have a small scale story. It's about a princess who is saving her homeland. It also isn't unrealistic, Yona isn't the strongest, but it makes sense. Now every female has to bea bad ass to be a strong female character. But its because Yona struggles that makes her more human. It makes her such a powerful character that more women can relate too",

            "content": "As a My Anime List user who rarely logs on, let alone writes a review, the fact that I am sitting here typing up a review for this anime already says something. \r\nI have been searching for the past few months to find a new anime to watch, yet could not find one that hooked me well enough to continue past the first few episodes.\r\nBut this anime was different. While I only started watching it to kill time and serve as background noise for my daily activities when I discovered it on Netflix and realised it featured the talents of some of my favourite voiceactors, I was immediately hooked from episode one, and found myself binge watching the rest, only stopping to write this review. \\n\\n\r\nWhile the opening animation was clumsy and seemed low budget, I could hardly say that for the rest of the series. \\n\\n\r\nLet's start with the main character. From episode one, all of the characters immediately pull you in with their quirky and unique (and very close to realistic) personalities and beautiful designs. While I was hesitant about watching an anime about a princess (as I expected her to be meek and constantly playing the damsel in distress), something seemed different about her from episode one and I quickly found out just how determined, caring, selfless and strong-willed she is, which shattered all previous misconceptions.\\n\\n\r\nYona immediately became not only a strong character I could look up to as a teenage girl, but a relatable heroine - I felt her pain, I understood her need to become stronger for those she loved, but most importantly, I felt inspired by her realism of her emotions. Despite all she had been through, she could not give up the pin Soo Won gave her. She could not ignore the grief she felt towards losing her father, the disappointment she felt towards herself for letting her childhood friend almost get killed and the pain of Soo Won's betrayal that haunted her memories. \\n\r\nAnd despite hearing and seeing for herself what her father's weakness did to the country, she never lost the love and admiration she had for him.\\n\\n\r\nShe is a true inspiration. She showed me that there is strength in everyone that can be turned into something amazing when put to use, and that it's possible to be hung up over past events, yet turn those emotions into a pillar of strength. That you don't need to be perfect or constantly rely on others to succeed. In this way, she is different from your typical princess and your typical anime heroine. She's neither tough as nails nor a complete girly ditz - she finds a balance. \\n\\n\r\nAnother thing that makes this anime special is how they portray the protagonists and antagonistic sides. It shows how different people perceive others. \\n\r\nIl killed his brother\\n\r\nSoo Won avenged his father and killed Il before unintentionally causing various other innocent deaths\\n\r\nWe later find out Il was a terrible king - his ideals only lead to more suffering.\\n\r\nWho is really in the wrong? Who is truly evil? \\n\r\nWhile I despised Soo Won for his underhanded tactics at first, episode 16 showed him in a new light - as a leader who truly wanted to improve the country, no matter what it takes, and as a leader who truly desires harmony and prosperity, even if temporary chaos is the only way to achieve certain things at first.\\n\r\nUnlike other animes(?) which try to positively show two warring sides fighting for their own definitions of justice and make you feel for both sides (i.e. Tokyo Ghoul), Yona succeeds in showing that antagonists need not be evil. In the end, Tokyo Ghoul still made me hate most of the CCG, showing their leaders as psychotic, misguided murderers, but Yona made me understand in a deeper way that justice isn't black or white and can't be treated as such, and it showed me that misunderstandings and opacity are perhaps the biggest problems with regards to human relations throughout the eras. I must give kudos for the writing style, too, as it not only managed to make me cry on several occasions, but also made me laugh and even provoked my maternal instincts towards a certain blue dragon despite him literally being the same age as me. \\n\\n\r\nIf there is anything to complain about... I'd say the opening definitely needs work.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, it is extremely rare for me to discover a series that pushes me to dedicatedly watch each episode with care and interest and avoid spoilers at all costs (I tend to go looking for spoilers because I'm weird) but Yona did it. \\n\r\nBravo writers. Bravo sound technicians and designers. Bravo animators. Bravo manga author. It was a terrifically executed work of art.",

            "content": "Okay , first of all let me start by saying that this anime had a lot of positive reviews and opinions, and given the rating, I expected a good one , But I'm sorry to say that It was a total letdown. I understand that most of you feel that this was an awesome anime , But I didnt feel that way , I am omitting the good points however few and concentrating on the demerits.\r\nMinor spoilers ahead\r\nThe way the anime progressed was the biggest letdown of the anime , It had a  pretty descent start with the introduction of the kind yet ,seeminglycowardly king and the childhood affairs of princess yona and soo won , but the story didnt pan out the way you would expect it to.\\n\r\nOkay so on Yona's 16th birthday there is a huge party and Soo won ( Yona's childhood one way sweetheart) comes to see her all handsome and shining , and he sees her as a little sister(wow! like we havent seen that before) but ofcourse Yona desperately tries to hang on him and drags Hak into some comic situations which forced out a smile.\\n\\n\r\nThen there is some guy who serves snacks there too , well he dies too soon for me to remember his name . Okay on the birthday there are some scenes for yona an Soo Won .\\n\r\nYona presents her love for Soo Won to her father who inexplicably denies it and says that is impossible, (yeah maybe he knows genetics and about inbreeding depression)\\n\r\nthats just awesome! , I'm skipping some scenes here , Then during the night she goes  to convince her father again of her feelings , but alas there are no guards and the kings' chamber is slightly opened and she opens to see what, Soo Won has stabbed her father to death (shocker) and then she mopes and they decide to kill her and then  miraculously Hak beats off a whorde of men and comes to rescue her , she Hak and the guy (irrevelant guy mentioned prior) makes an ingenious plan , the GUY puts a robe around his head and runs ever so conspicously into the open and while Yona and Hak make  a break for it , and all the guards chase after the robed guy , yeah that was  original and it might not have worked if the guards didnt have mush for brains, but they were guarding the palace so they couldnt have been some random potatoheads.\\n\\n\r\nNow moving on to the point were she escapes from the wind clans' territory, and meets the priest and he tells the legend of the dragons , Now I was starting to like it and thought they anime would take off from here . Whoops!! I forgot about the part where the prince from the fire clan chases yona and hak and in one scene he literally freezes as he sees Yona's eyes (because they are so fierce) yeah really , more of that to come and I would literally die if I dont mention Yona and Hak falling off a frickin cliff and surviving, I mean c'mon , fighting off an army was one thing but that , I'm pretty sure that Hak was  superman ( only asian) .\\n\\n\r\nThen they go in search of the four dragons of legend who will supposedly help Yona in her quest whatever that was. Meeting the dragons is kind of interesting and each dragon had a pretty decent backstory except for the yellow dragon , I especially like the blue dragon's backstory with Ao.\\n\\n\r\nYona trains really hard and she becomes a master archer within 10 episodes , ( believable since she shoots 300 arrows a day or so).\\n\r\nThe part about Yan Kumji was pretty decent , but I feel that the part about the dragons were very rushed and not well told , they could have dropped the useless parts about Yona and Soo Won and added some more about the dragons especially the yellow dragon. The anime had a good pace through the first 3 episodes then slows down and then picks up again during the 16 or 17 episodes.\\n\\n\r\nIf I really loved something , It was the awesome background score which always gave me goosebumps , but the story was lacking in overall and it didnt give insight into the lives of the characters much.There is  sure to be more in the second season and I hope they improve on the faults.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all it was a decent anime but totally undeserving of the hype it got.",

            "content": "(This is my first review)\r\nStory- 8\r\nThe story of Akatsuki no Yona was amazing. The way the first episode begins is engaging and hooks the audience in instantly. It has just enough gaps in the first episode that it leaves you wanting more. I loved the betrayal at the beginning, though it was expected, it still cuts deep because you can\u2019t help but feel sorry for Yona. The only reason I gave it an 8 instead of higher was because of the way the series ended on a complete cliff hanger. Sometimes, it\u2019s a good thing but in this series, everything was built up and thenthe series abruptly ended. Anyway, I\u2019m still holding out hope for a second season. \\n\\n\r\nArt and Sound- 9\\n\r\nNot only were the voice actors perfect for their roles, but the soundtrack gave Akatsuki no Yona a distinct feel of the story. I really liked the first opening in particular because it gave it a strong sense of the ancient mythology that Akatsuki no Yona bases itself on. \\n\r\nThe art in this series is one of my favourites. It definitely depicts the culture of Kouka. It also makes it seem very Shoujo at the beginning. The action scenes, never felt out of place, they were well timed and were pleasing to watch. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters- 9\\n\r\nAkatsuki no Yona is very character driven, since most of the series is about searching for the four dragons and meeting them. The villains were rightfully unlikeable, but I also felt pity for them. Soo-won makes me feel a lot of conflicting emotions and the four dragons and Hak were and incredibly funny. \\n\r\n I think the most important character development was Yona\u2019s. She is first presented as a weak, naive and shallow young girl. But from the very first flash-forward the audience is shown a strong warrior. The growth of Yona takes time, and doesn\u2019t happen in an episode, which just made me like her even more because she seemed so much more realistic than a heroine who changes her personality quickly. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment- 9\\n\r\nI really enjoyed this anime. It was funny and interesting. I still smile when I think about some scenes. Watching it made me really happy. \\n\\n\r\nOverall- 8\\n\r\nOverall, I loved the series and I only gave it the score that I did because of the way it ended. The series is beautiful and sweet even though it starts with a betrayal.  The story is heart-warming and heart-wrenching at the same time and it impacted me so much, that I won\u2019t be able to forget it for a long time yet. \\n",

            "content": "In a world where high school is the dominant setting for anime, Akatsuki no Yona appears to be something both refreshingly different and classic at the same time. A traditional, almost medieval eastern setting, a war of kings, princes, and princesses, a dash of legend, fantasy\u2014and indeed, if this truly was what Akatsuki no Yona was about, it would easily live up to expectation. Instead, in the same breath as it boldly proclaims itself different a fear of being just that seemingly holds it back from being all it could have been.\r\nStory\r\nAkatsuki no Yona is one of those unfortunate shows that begins with a reallyinteresting premise and yet is mysteriously afraid to actually commit to it.\\n\\n\r\nAll seems peaceful in the kingdom of Kouka. The land's various tribes are united under a kind emporer who hates violence and dotes on his daughter, Yona, the sole heir to his throne. For her part, Yona passes her days in comfort, primarily concerned only with the color of her unusually red hair and winning the heart of her distant cousin, Su-won. But all this comes crashing down in an instant when one night the emporer turns up dead, murdered by none other than Su-won himself, who immediately seizes the throne and brands Princess Yona an outcast. Under the protection of her bodyguard and childhood friend, Hak, Yona escapes\u2014but must live under the conditions of a commoner in the kingdom she has never personally set foot in before. Weak and all alone, she is left with but one choice for revenge: to find the legendary four warriors gifted with the powers of ancient dragons and reclaim the throne from Su-won\u2014a journey that will grow and change her into a warrior herself, as she comes to find firsthand that her kingdom is not as free from trouble as she believed.\\n\\n\r\nIt is uncharacteristic of me to dedicate so much time in a review to summarizing, but I do it here to make a point: this is what Akatsuki no Yona could have been. And while it technically still is, it so constantly skirts the boundary between being silly and serious that the overarching plot is all but lost in a dissatisfying delivery of both moods. However, that isn't to say the show is devoid of any bright moments. In fact, there were enough to keep me coming back for more, but I often found myself merely tolerating what came in between rather than thoroughly enjoying much of it. It isn't so much that the show suffers from too much filler, but from too little focus\u2014poor pacing and progression. Much of Akatsuki no Yona is divided up into chunks and delivered out of order as flashbacks or even flashforwards, breaking up the flow of the story and diverting far too much attention to side plots that would've been much better off told in one or two sentences of dialog. While this approach wouldn't be as faithful to the manga, it would make for better anime.\\n\\n\r\nWorse, the payoff at the end of the road is arguably not even worth the journey. Though a satisfyingly epic battle closes off the last few episodes, at the end of the season the flashforward of the prologue is not even reached in the timeline of the story, stretching the show into at least two seasons to cover content that could have been told\u2014and perhaps better\u2014in half of one. It's not that things don't ever pick up, but that even when they do, the show's bigger questions are never addressed, and the main villain is left practically untouched aside from a brief subplot adding nothing to the story except to remind us that yes, he does still exist and is somehow a threat\u2014though even that much is left unclear.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters\\n\\n\r\nBeing a journey to find and recruit a number of characters, Akatsuki no Yona is unsurprisingly heavily character-driven. The intention is for each new character to rub off on Yona in different ways even as she rubs back on them, but it's difficult to say the show succeeds. Pretty much everyone wears their personality on their sleeve, with the only remotely dynamic character being Yona herself, but being static doesn't necessarily prevent the rest of the cast from being very endearing\u2014just from being very memorable. Few characters are left undeveloped, and the author did a decent job devising different environments for each to grow up in and somehow define who they are at present. But bury any and all personality below a comfortably deep layer of corny humor and ultimately you're left with characters that always play it safe by remaining boringly simplistic. Each is more or less the same as the others, aside from one basic defining trait to give them some semblance of purpose. To be fair, those traits are used fairly well. It's just the depth behind it that's lacking, and that grows ever shallower the more characters are added into the mix.\\n\\n\r\nArt & Sound\\n\\n\r\nLike its historical-slash-medieval-fantasy setting, the art of Akatsuki no Yona is truly a breath of fresh air, likewise taking to the past in its slightly fantastic interpretation of traditional Korea. The setting bleeds through every aspect of the show's art, which stylistically also seems to harken to the past and reflect the styles of some '90s anime, but in more modern, high-definition form. It's a downright beautiful show when it tries to be: characters are well-animated, with eyes and expressions that seem truly alive, grand vistas frequently occupy the horizon, and though it does skip through a few battles (likely for budgetary concerns) others are carried out with great flare to the point of resembling Unlimited Blade Works' iconic style at times.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is equally easy on the ears, from the fantastic orchestral theme to the background music you'd only notice if it was bad. Even the completely out-of-place second intro somehow makes sense given the show's awkward sense of humor, and by contrast the second ending by Akiko Shitaka is mesmerizing in her characteristic ethnic sound. It's a rare anime today that sounds distinctly eastern in the traditional sense, but this is one of them\u2014and it's wonderful.\\n\\n\r\nConclusion\\n\\n\r\nDespite a fairly strong setup and some interesting plot points, Akatsuki no Yona ends up as a trudge through abysmally slow progression with insufficient payoff at the end, constantly abusing its allotted time and then demanding a second season to finish what it started. It's a distinctly character-focused show that could use its diverse cast as its greatest strength, but instead uses them all for the same corny humor that is only charming a fraction of the time. Though a refreshing setting, solid artwork, and great soundtrack do make the show worth checking out, they alone are not enough to warrant sticking through all 24 episodes. A tragic case of good ideas left unexplored, Akatsuki no Yona is merely passable when it could potentially have been a masterpiece. It's one of the most solid 7.5s I'll ever give; it's only too bad it couldn't reach a little higher.",

            "content": "I'll try to avoid spoilers as a manga reader so here goes.\r\nand i recommend you watch episode 1 or other reviews before this.\r\nAkatsuki no yona brings you to a shoujo china-esque world of fantasy and dragons. It begins with a princess, a kingdom, and an ever reliable gary stu body guard whose only flaw would be how stupidly in love he is.\r\nIt introduces yona, a powerful, charismatic leader of a band of \"thieves\" or vigilantes that somehow still fights for the country. Or not, wait was that how it was supposed to go? That in itself is the biggest flaw of the anime and mostespecially the first 2 minutes of it. The script writer was making the anime out to be too ambitious. It starts with a plot from the future or makes the current time seem like a 30 episode long flashback with the pace its going.\\n\\n\r\nThe plot isn't amazing, yet. It's typical princess shoujo + gary stu + dragons for the first half. But that's the beauty in it.\\n\\n\r\nYona a naive spoiled princess just saw her father killed by the love of her life. So without considering the not so subtle \"foreshadowing\" that keeps jumping around, Yona feels so human. She reacts the way normal people would. Hak and every other character reacts how they realistically would given what drives them, and that if nothing else appeals to the audience.\\n\\n\r\nThe plot is linear and absolutely well paced, minus the terrible foreshadowing. The story flows in a slow steady manner that leaves space for the thoughts and growth of each character.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is really good. Or at least how it was drawn. Every color is vibrant and well suited. The animation feels like it was done by a beginner though.\\n\\n\r\nThe sounds are outstanding and set the mood properly, if not hideously ironic given the plot twists. E.G. romantic music for soo won and yona.\\n\\n\r\nIt is without doubt enjoyable despite being irritatingly ambitious. Even if you've read the manga before it's still more than worth your while to watch.\\n\\n\r\nOverall it's a great shoujo manga that if not for the suckish animation and overly ambitious script, would be nothing short of a masterpiece.",

I just want to jot down my thoughts on somewhere where I physically can't lose it)\r\n\u2661\r\nI originally started Akatsuki no Yona because a friend of mine would not stop RAVING about how amazing it was and how wonderful all the characters (particularly Hak) was. I thought it revolved around a Korean era, since the clothing and names kind of matched with Korean ancestry, but I guess that's a different topic diluting the actual review.\r\nThe story is, in it of itself, a twist ofa stereotypical love triangle, but since I really like the whole historical era setting, it amplified the enjoyment I had for the anime quite a bit.\\n\r\nI have nothing really to say about this anime because it becomes extremely frustrating as the story progresses on. The story begins at a rather fast pace, but slows down significantly as the series goes on. Nonetheless, the artwork is unsurprisingly very beautiful and the characters, even the bad ones, are ones who you might just end up getting attached to. It does, however, end as a cliffhanger (IM STILL WAITING FOR SEASON 2 HERE)\\n\r\nIf you're looking for a short series that's interesting enough to hold your interest with fun little jibes but an overall serious atmosphere, then yeah. This is definitely a watch for you :)",

            "content": "Akatsuki No Yona is an epic tale of a kingdom far away (somewhat reminiscent of China). It involves a bigger picture but centers around a few core characters. Most episodes are spent introducing a character and their life and motivations. I enjoy the story, the setting, the art, the music. The villains are also well done, you love and hate them at the same time. The main villain is introduced in the first episode, so it doesn't feel disruptive when there are scenes centered on what the \"evil\" side is doing. \r\nThis anime like many others seems to follow the journey of a princess asshe grows into someone who can rule a country. It resembles many a shoujo and reverse-harem that have come before. The genius of this story is that it spends a lot of time and attention on the motivations and feelings of the princess's followers. What makes a person want to follow a leader? Why would someone leave their home to start a quest? What makes a good ruler? What makes it worthwhile to dedicate your life to a monarch, and why would someone make that choice? The princess grows a lot, but she would not have been able to succeed alone. A lot of emotional intelligence went into this story, and I am impressed. \\n\\n\r\nThe downfalls of this anime are its annoying stereotypes. There is one girl that all the boys love. She is going to conquer the kingdom and rule based on her ability to steal all the boys' hearts. There are no other females in the story so far. Furthermore the Princess Yona has the stereotypical shoujo \"cuteness\". She's clumsy, unusually honest, adorable and can come off as airheaded.",

Ofc there are these scenes with each and every man of her harem andher having their sweet moments.(don't wanna spoil what happens ofc).\\n\r\nPractically, in the end she forgets her initial motivation and start doing stuff based on her own judgement and forgetting why she did everything in the first place.\\n\\n\r\nArt~ animation and its style was really good.

            "content": "Definitely give this anime a chance and watch it through the entirety of the first and second episode at least. This anime is easily one of my favorites.  The first episode made me very skeptical, but by the end of the third episode I was completely hooked.  \r\nStory  8\r\nArt  8\r\nSound 8\r\nCharacter 10\r\nEnjoyment 10\r\nOverall 9\r\nOne of my favorite aspects of Akatsuki no yona is that it blends genres seamlessly. This anime can turn a comedic scene into a serious exchange without losing the emotion attached. One moment you're watching some kick-ass action scene, then there's a lump in your throat from acharacters heart-felt exchange,  and the next you're laughing.  I was a little shocked that I had not heard of Akatsuki no yona earlier once I finished it. \\n\\n\r\n (very slight spoilers ahead, but if you read the description you're fine)\\n\r\nAkatsuki no yona's selling point for me is easily the characters. I love all of them, there's not a single character on this show I dislike, and that includes the one you're supposed to hate.\\n\r\nFirst, Yona. At first she seems like a typical princess damsel-in-distress type, but she's so much more than that. My favorite thing about her is she doesn't settle into the trope given to her. This anime could've easily become another cliche, but instead Yona's character development grows until she becomes a leader and a fighter.   \\n\r\nHak is another great character. He's funny, charming and a bit of a bad boy, as many other leading male characters are, but his backstory with Yona creates a dynamic that is terribly sweet and their friendship is as equally fun as it is romantically frustrating. Hak adds to Yona's character a great deal, as you watch Yona grow stronger through his eyes. \\n\r\nNext, the dragons.  Their characters are a given, dragons are always friggen awesome. \\n\r\nAnd lastly Su-won, he will give you mixed emotions for sure. His character is very mysterious in his own way.  There will be times you'll want to hate him, but he's surprisingly hard to hate. \\n\\n\r\nOverall my biggest complaint about akatsuki no yona was that I want more episodes.  It's got action, romance, comedy, and a cool storyline to keep you interested. I highly recommend. \\n\\n\\n",

I also love Son Hak (which is more or less her love interest) because of his love for Yona. He is a very likeable character that viewers (especially girls) will definitely love. The four dragons (although Zeno has the least exposure) was also commendable.There struggles in life until being part of Yona's team is very engaging.\\n\\n\r\nGive it a try.",

I may not be the best reviewer but I need to somehow convey how I feel.\r\nAkatsuki no Yona was something that took time to grow on me personally, but when it did, it grew like Jack's beanstalk. \r\nMy favorite (and probably most people's) part is the characterization. It seems like most anime nowadays are just reusing thesame old character tropes that everyone has seen at least ten times already. Akatsuki no Yona does not do this. They all have reasons to how they act and the reasons are mostly made apparent so there is no bull-shitting us.\\n\\n\r\nEvery (main) character has their own life-changing experience that marks the beginning of their development and growth, especially the main character Yona. However it's not something that happens quickly. There are little changes here and there, but nothing happens overnight. It's all very...real. Which brings me to the main reason I love this show. The emotion in this anime is SO REAL and BELIEVABLE. I mean.. every time a character would cry, I would feel like crying too. In fact I did. Many times. I would say this show is not for people who don't like feeling intense emotions because it definitely makes you feel them. It also expresses them just..so well. The art combined with the amazing voice acting combined with fitting music and intense conversations really make this anime phenomenal.The characters really came to life on me and made me feel for them multiple times. \\n\\n\r\nLuckily it's not all heart-break though as there are laughs to fill in gaps between crying sessions. Amazingly, even the comedy is meaningful. It never feels misplaced and it always makes sense, never relying on petty jokes about a woman's breast size or anything like that.\\n\\n\r\nI'd also like to say that even though it has a lot of emotional scenes, the overall tone of it is not sad, because that is not the point of the anime. There are many wise quotes and many moments that make you feel warm inside. I think that for a shoujo genre, this anime is definitely one of the most mature.\\n\\n\r\nNow I'm not saying that it's a perfect anime, because those don't exist. However I feel that it has succeeded in ways most anime nowadays don't and for that, I think it deserves a watch.\\n\\n\r\nThe only thing that I think is lacking is the length. It doesn't cover every page of the manga, probably because it wasn't as popular as it should have been.",

            "content": "Yona of the Dawn sees our titular heroine fleeing from her sheltered life as princess of an entire kingdom with bodyguard Hak after witnessing her childhood friend, Su-won, assassinate her father to lay claim to her kingdom's throne. To gain the power to oppose Su-won's rule, Yona and Hak try to locate the whereabouts of descendants of the Dragon Warriors, four young men who gained the powers of the past Dragon Warriors they descended from.\r\nYona of the Dawn features a great deal of fleshing out for many of its major characters. Outside of focus on Yona and Hak's struggles to cope with Su-won's shocking betrayaland gathering the Dragon Warriors. Su-won is portrayed to have redeemable traits and justifiable reasons for his assassination plot with their kingdom struggling due to the incompetence of rule under Yona's father and is trying to correct the issues brought about from the old ruler when he becomes the ruler. On her end, Yona finds herself coming to realize the issues that her kingdom experienced from her father's questionable rule and that she had been ignorant to due to her sheltered lifestyle and being on the run from Su-won's supporters who want her dead, lead her to toughen up mentally and acquire combative skills to avoid burdening her allies. A number of the Dragon Warriors also get fleshed out to show how their special abilities affected how they lived until Yona's appearance in their lives. In regards to characterization, it is perhaps the strongest element that Yona of the Dawn offers due to the amount of depth and/or growth that many of the characters demonstrate throughout the span of the series.\\n\\n\r\nWhen it comes to plotting for the series, Yona of the Dawn is somewhat of a mixed bag. To a great extent, the series divides its focus on exploring Yona and Su-won's perspectives of the situations both face as Yona is focused on traveling with Hak to locate the Dragon Warriors and Su-won is assessing the issues faced in other parts of the kingdom coming from the previous emperor's rule. The plot buildup is solid in itself as Yona and her party do usually find themselves dealing with the corrupt elements of the kingdom during their journey, though the major conflict of the series involving Yona and Su-won's issues over rule to their kingdom is left unresolved due to the source material being ongoing and there isn't much time for the show to focus on the final Dragon Warrior introduced since he is introduced right within the show's final episode. Another element to the show I did take issue with were its attempts at comedy which felt badly timed to a great extent since they had the bad habit of taking place during the show's more serious moments at points and clashed poorly with some major dramatic moments, even if they were meant to ease the mood of the show.\\n\\n\r\nWhile having some slipups, Yona of the Dawn is still a mostly engaging and solid fantasy-adventure drama that delves into the differing dilemmas faced by our titular heroine and Su-won from the established rule of their kingdom and the means Su-won utilized to correct the issues faced within their kingdom. Still a worthwhile recommendation if you are a fan of shoujo titles.",

The sound was great too, overall it was an amazing anime..I recommended it to everyone really. The characters were funny and each one had a different personality. I really enjoyed seeing each character falling in \"love\" with Yona. It really didn't have any suspense though, which is why I put a 9 for Enjoyment. But besides that it was amazing. I ship so many characters with her though. All the characters really bring the anime together and without them I don't think it would be thesame. I really loved when she met Jae ha and Zeno, it was a funny anime x3. Jae ha was hilarious..him and Kija are absolutely great together. Hak and Jae ha...an odd pairing but its funny xD so its fine. \\n",

            "content": "I loved this anime though I do wish there will be another season. They left it a bit open. I would love to find out what happens next with the group now that they have the final piece. Besides that it's a beautiful done anime that kept me wanting to watch and thinking about it when I couldn't. The animation is beautiful other than the small things which every anime has. At one moment a hand looked way smaller than it should, that made me pause to giggle but it's hard to do things like that so I am still respectful since even if thehand was smaller than it should they fixed it in the next shot and it still took a lot of work. \\n\\n\r\nThe storyline was wonderful and I love how it progressed. I love how they introduced each character and how diverse they all were. I wanted to know more about some of them and I know I can in the OVAs or in the manga if I feel like it. Everything about this anime was beautiful and instead of going with the typical anime girl who couldn't do anything right they let her evolve into someone who could hold her own. I loved her progression and how much she had grown. She may have acted without thinking but in the end they won mostly because of her. \\n\\n\r\nEach character had their own personality and the dubbed did a great job at showcasing that. Not a single voice felt off to me and none of the characters annoyed me. Each had their role and they played it perfectly. Each character progressed wonderfully and I loved all of them. I found myself rooting for everyone. As for the reverse harem aspect it didn't bother me like it usually does. It was subtle and it was an interesting take on it. Though you have a solid idea who is going to win that battle. \\n\\n\r\nThe music took it home for me. It was beautiful and it only elevated the scenes. I found myself wanting to listen to each opening song and ending song every time but I'm impatient, lol. The action scenes fit perfectly and well everything did. The music was by far one of my favorites in this anime. Everything was just so well put together and beautiful done. I would suggest this to any person though at times the 'perverted' esk remarks a few of my friends might not enjoy, lol. But they are mostly for comedy. All in all this anime was a quick favorite of mine.",

            "content": "Alright, still a beginner at reviews but this is one I feel pretty confident in doing. Mild spoiler warning.\r\nA lot of shoujo anime annoys me, and the first episode of Akatsuki No Yona was rough for me at first. Yona is incredibly naive and airheaded, like so many female mc's. This anime took a somewhat unexpected turn, because Yona does not hone in on selfish desires or revenge. She begins to grow as a person and even educate herself. There is noteable growth in character development in all characters aside from Yona. Unlike a lot of shoujo or reverse harems, Akatsuki No Yona dives intothe back story and struggles of all the characters. \\n\\n\r\nI do not personally think that Akatsuki No Yona should be categorized as a reverse harem despite the many people who do. Yona clearly favors the male mc, Hak. The others that travel with her are all male as per usual in reverse harem, but the relationships are much more platonic. Some of the male characters exhibit either a humorous flirting relationship or maybe a small crush, but it seems that it is overall friendly. With that being said, each character gets a fair amount of screen time and story so if you have a favorite character you should be satisfied. \\n\\n\r\nMoving on from romance, this anime is unique in the way that despite being considered a shoujou, a good amount of battle and martial arts are featured. Most shoujou anime with battles are magical girls or something over the top, which is cool if that is what you like. One of the reasons I adore Akatsuki No Yona is because the romance and comedy is paired well with action. As a huge fan of shounen, this anime was a freaking god send. Of course there is not as much thrill as naruto or sao but for such a short anime focused on romance it is interesting, there is war and sword fighting. Fantasy action is no problem either. Akatsuki No Yona focuses on four warriors with the powers of dragons throughout the series. These four characters are balanced with their own physical skills that are enhanced by the powers of a dragon. The tensions of war and betrayal are a huge part of this anime and it really works well.\\n\\n\r\nOne of the last points I'd like to touch on is the humor in this anime. What makes this anime almost perfect for me is the triangle of humor, romance, and action. Most of the jokes are just stupid silly things that are funny, but there are some great little dry and dark jokes incorporated. The art style changes slightly in the midst of these humorous moments sometimes and that really brings out the humor. It's honestly your basic run of the mill anime humor, somewhat pervy and sarcastic or cynical, but some times you can't find that in shoujo so I was happy that it was included in Akatsuki No Yona.\\n\\n\r\nSo closing up this review, I really enjoyed this anime. So much so that I actually started reading the manga and have now read up to the latest chapter. I truly hope they will continue it, it was popular in both Japan and the West so there's no reason not to. There is a lot of development to be done and so much potential. \\n",

It was much MUCH more than that. \r\nWhat I loved most was the character development. Yona's character went from a young and spoiled rich girl to a confident and strong warrior. Female empowerment at its best. Hak also grew into a wonderful man. It had alot of great moments where I found myself gasping with excitement or crying from laughing too hard at a joke only Hak would say. \r\n I would recommend this to anyone who enjoys a strong anime withgreat characters, romance, comedy and a redemption driven plot. \\n\\n",

            "content": "Akatsuki no Yona is a series that I randomly started watching after seeing a very short teaser that got me already quite interested, which was in the end not all for nothing. Once I started watching it, I couldn't stop. The series is quite slow-paced and has subtle character developments, but that's maybe what drew me in and made it comfortable to watch. \r\nStory: 7\r\nAs I said earlier, this series is quite slow-paced, which did not bother me at all. However, because of that, the animation only covered a small section of the manga which consisted mostly of introducing the main characters, with little opportunitiesfor major developments, which I thought was quite a shame. But the series is just 24 episodes long and in my opinion the makers did the best they could to fill the episodes up without leaving out any of the content of the manga. It has a good balance of action, romance, and emotional moments and I especially liked the subtle moments of humor mixed in with those scenes.\\n\\n\r\nArt: The art in this series is very good. Not the best I've ever seen but it shows great details and great colors. It really showed great difference between serious parts and more humorous parts. Yet, the quality of the animation was consistent throughout the whole series and stayed great until the end. It focuses a lot on the quality of the eyes of the main characters what makes the character designs also much better. \\n\\n\r\nSound: I like the sound tracks in this series. It really represents the atmosphere very well. As the environment in which the story takes place was like ancient China/Korea, the sound tracks with the sounds of the flute and violin are really fitting and highlights the moments of action very well. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: One of the main factors that made me love this show were the main characters. Aside from the great character designs, I also like their personalities and their unique (humorous) ways of contributing to the traveling group. There were only a few background stories to give a little bit of depth to the characters, where in other cases the main plot was used to get to know the characters better. Still, within the small amount of episodes, the makers did a good of job of showing off the characters' personalities and making me feel attachment towards the characters. I usually don't like female protagonists, but in this series the main female character, Yona, gets a really good character development which made me even feel a little bit attached to her. \\n\\n\r\nSo overall, the story is maybe a bit clich\u00e9 and short (story-wise), but I still enjoyed watching it a lot. I started watching it without any expectations and I usually do not not watch these kind of series, so I never imagined I would get attached to this series so much! I find it a shame that not many people are familiar with this show, but it's not like I do not understand. I would not really recommend it to people who usually watch fast-paced series with very grand and flashy action scenes. This series is relaxing to watch even though there are also some action scenes in it. Furthermore, the romance is not too cheesy and the there isn't an overdose of humor, but there's still enough to make you secretly laugh or smile here and there :)\\n\r\nI also appreciate that they made a few extra OVAs to provide more backstories of some of the characters, which were also fantastic by the way. However I still hope that they will ever make a season 2 because after I finished watching this series, I went straight to the manga and couldn't stop reading it till the end. The story that's coming after the part that has been animated is also great so I would love to see it come out as a new season ever in the near future.",

            "content": "I first thought that history kind of anime will be kinda bad but I digress. I watch this anime out of just pure romance but this is what I found in this anime. Akatsuki no Yona happens to be one of my favorite anime after I watched this. Now these are my thoughts when it comes to this anime\r\nStory :\r\nThe story, it's pretty good. I would have rate this full 10 out of 10 if the story is actually finished but unfortunately it wasn't, it stays there so I was kinda like looking forward to the second season if there is one. I would say,if this anime didn't have comedy and funny moments in the storyline, I would have said that this anime is kinda boring but still, just maybe, the storyline itself is awesome but at the same time, it has some balance for both serious moments and funny moments, which makes me feel enjoyable watching this. I really thought that this anime is actually inspired by the Japanese history but I'm guessing this storyline is actually from Chinese history.\\n\\n\r\nArt :\\n\r\nThe art was great, it fits to the story that would like to prevail in this anime. I just love how cute Yona is when there are some funny moments and the serious Yona when she gets mad because of the unjustified reasons that happening to the country. It's just great.\\n\\n\r\nSound :\\n\r\nSound eh? I suspect that since this anime is from a Chinese history somehow so they would have put a Chinese-themed song and I was right. The first opening I'm sorry to say this but it's kinda lame. I know it was a history-related story but still an opening gave us a general idea what that anime is all about. But the first ending was freaking awesome. Yoru by vistlip, really conveys what Son Hak feels towards Yona himself, I felt his sadness in that soundtrack and somehow somewhat  he was the one who actually sings it.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter :\\n\r\nCharacters, I think it was fine. It fits to the changes to the story. I didn't really have much saying on this so I'm just gonna pass this one out.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment :\\n\r\nI really enjoy this anime. I always end up watching a lot of episodes in one day just to know what happens next. The episodes always end up where I really want to know what happens next thus makes me finish this series in just two days.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I think this is a great anime to watch. Possibly historic-romance related anime but at the same time, enjoying the comedy in the series, makes the anime balanced. But the only thing that sucks is the fact that the story was still redundant especially the ending. I just hope they make a second season for this anime.",

            "content": "So at first i want to admit that this the first review i've ever written and that my english isn't perfect so there could be some grammar/writing mistakes but i hope you can unterstand what i have to say.\r\nI've heard about this anime for like 2-3 years ago when i started to watch anime,because i'm sucker for shojo/romance i gave it a go but it doesn't excite me. I find it kind of boring and awfull besides i had high hopes as i watched the first episode so i dropped it and forget about it. I so that to a lot of animes unknowledged howi was but i was new to anime and at this point i can't understand what a masterpice it was. After some time when i understand the media better i gave some animes that i dropped a second cchance and the most of them make up my mind i was blown away and i asked myself how i could not like them at first? So i decided to give Akatsuki no yona a second change but i was a really long journey befor i really did. Yesterday i have started to watch and i was blown away i watched it till 5am and finished it like an hour ago. \\n\r\nBut what is so good at this anime? First of all i want to itroduce all the \"main\" charakters that were shown in the first episode \\n\r\nFirst of all we have an ordinary girl named Yona as protagonist who is the Princess of an kingdom and we have her father who is afraid of weapons and want anything to be peaceful in his kingdom without any war. \\n\r\nThen there is also Hak he is Yonas Guardian and yona and he are friends since there were little but he always tease her it is very funny. \\n\r\nAnd there is at last su-woon,he is yonas cousin and yona is in love with him since she were little. \\n\r\nI don't want to go into the plot because i would spoil anything but the main reason everyone should watch that anime is how great the Charakters are. Even the Villans in the Story are twisted and are not like what they seemed to be.Something that really catches me too was how great one person in this anime changed,this person grew from super weak to strong and protective something i always adore and admire the character development semed for me to be a big point in that anime. One thing i wanna mentioned too is the music in the anime. I really liked it,it fits the anime and the atmosphere perfectly and the second opening is now one of my favorite openings of all time. \\n\r\nI'm sorry if that is not helpfull at all for you \\n\r\nBut i'm so highly in love with it and i'm sad and depressed that it is ending and probably never gets a second season :(\\n\r\nI just wanna share my love to akatsuki no yona with you maybe i could bring you closer to watch that anime.\\n\r\nOne last thing that i wanna give you with if you read that review to the end is: if you drop an anime because you dont like it give it a go at another time even if its ten years later,maybe you'll change your mind \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "(This is my first review that hopefully won't delete lol pls bear with me)\r\nYona of the Dawn, a thrilling adventure anime that's not likely to leave my mind soon. Personally, I haven't been too attached to anime lately, and whenever I watched anime, I felt as if it was just as a form of entertainment. Anime like Trinity Seven and Gamers! entertained me, but I never felt any attachment to them. However, when I watched Yona of the Dawn, it brought me back to the days where I actually felt attachment towards what I was watching, which is what I absolutely LOVED about this show.\r\n(8)Story:The story itself is exciting, and the adventure of finding other powerful beings to bring to their side is what kept me binge watching this series in two school nights. Whenever I finished an episode, I couldn't wait to watch the next one. However, there are a few flaws with the story. Su-won's point of view and the reasons for his actions were never explained in the entire show, which were one of the things I was thinking about throughout the show. I also feel like they need to explain the geographic and political standpoints of all the kingdoms a bit more, to help the watchers understand why different kingdoms are allies or enemies and to create more tension between them, making the story more exciting. Other than that, the feeling of adventure and travel was excellently portrayed within the show, and I couldn't get enough of it!\\n\\n\r\n(9)Art: The art was absolutely amazing, and fit the characters and background for the feeling of the show very well. The spirit of Yona was AMAZINGLY represented in the art, with her hair glowing and he eyes sparking with a fiery glaze in them, with the growth in her character clearly seen. The backgrounds and sunsets for dramatic scenes were equally amazing, and completely matched the show. I gave it 9 instead of 10 because the animation can be a tiny bit fuzzy at times, and Yona's character could look a bit better, but that is NOT a reason to consider dropping the show. Overall, the art in this show is almost perfect, matching up with the feeling and music very well.\\n\\n\r\n(10)Sound: In my opinion, the sounds in this show is one of the best I have ever heard. It perfectly matches the feelings you make when watching this show, with the genres of fantasy, adventure, and action mixing together with the music, as well as the show itself. This is one of the only shows I watched completely, from the beginning to end, without skipping the intros or outros. The intros got you hyped for the upcoming episode, with the feeling of (historical?) fantasy well blended in it, especially the second intro. The second outro is one of my favorites (actually as I write this review I'm listening to it right now), it gives me the feeling of coming to the end of the action in the episode you just watched, and gives you a really fantasy-filled adventurous feeling, making you want to start the next episode. \\n\\n\r\n(10)Character: This is where the show really shines. You see the growth of each character, overcoming their dark past and forming a matured personality. The princess to traveler/bandit growth might be viewed as a bit cliche, but I loved seeing Yona's fiery expression at the end of the show. Each of the individual dragons (besides the yellow) grew from their dark past, to eventually bright as they joined Yona's group. Also, I loved each of the characters' different design. The different colors in their hair, representing what dragon they were, did not annoy me in the least. Their different personalities were clearly seen on each of the their character designs, which made it easy to distinguish who they were.\\n\\n\r\n(10)Enjoyment and (9) Overall: I haven't grown this attached to a show in a while, and I am very glad I watched it. One of the reasons I didn't give this a ten was because this anime had potential to develop Hak and Yona's relationship, but they never got past the point of Hak being \"specially\" frienzoned, which is why I would consider the romance part of this show as a subgenre(they might just be going along with the manga, so I can't complain). However, overall I really enjoyed this show and would recommend it to almost anyone. This mix of action, adventure, and fantasy was the best I have ever seen in any anime, and I wish more anime would follow this one's example.",

This is absolutely one of the must see anime out there.\r\nThe story telling is superb, from the fall of the MC to rise in power. This is much more like Akame ga Kill. They have similar plot from corrupt government to politicians. It is truly a masterpiece. The character development is pretty amazing. You can see their growth especially the MC. The enjoyment is fun from beginning to end. The romance is OK. It had also comedy and action element which is a big PLUS for me.\r\nPls watch this.Totally recommend it!!!!",

            "content": "Let's start, shall we ? This Anime was recommended from a close friend of mine and honestly I didn't expect much from it. I thought I should just expect an average Shoujo Anime with cheesy romance and the first episode supported that thought very well but goodness, I couldn't be more wrong....I can only laugh now on my foolish underestimation for such a beautiful story. \r\nNever have I seen such a realistic and relatable main character like the red-haired protagonist Yona before. It's kinda scary.\r\nArt: GORGEOUS. ABSOLUTELY GORGEOUS ARTSTYLE. It's a blessing for the eyes, strong colours, beautiful contrast and great clothing choices, I mustaddress that. When it comes down to the animation, it seems steady and the movements are very rough animated, especially in the fighting scenes but even so, camera ankles are pretty much on point most of the time, it doesn't go over the top and focuses on the expressions of the characters, making the setting prettty lively.\\n\\n\r\nSound: An instrumental opening...You don't see that often. When it comes to the soundtrack, it's fitting, medieval and flows perfectly at the background with the events in the story. One soundtrack was heavily used and seemed annoying after some time but nonetheless still great.\\n\\n\r\nStory: Unfortunately the main story is falling behind and the pacing is pretty slow, since it focuses more around meeting the four dragons of the story and bringing them together. But the main idea is nothing new, even so, watching the journey of the protagonist is enjoyable and doesn't abandon your interest.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: Personalities are predictable and ordinary. But what makes me want to continue to watch this Anime is definitely Yona. I'm in love with her development, watching her grow from a stereotypical, happy-go-lucky princess to a head-strong, brave and passionate young girl mesmerizes me.\\n\r\nAnother character worthy to mention is the main antagonist of the show. I'm sure, his \"ideal path and general way of thought\" is nothing new and has been used in other works but he seems to be interesting, mentioning him wouldn't mean any harm.\\n\\n\r\nConclusion: Absolutely enjoyable, heartwarming and exciting. I still wouldn't call Akatsuki no Yona a masterpiece but if we get to see the rest of the story then that may very well change.\\n\\n",

            "content": "FULL DISCLOSURE: I have not read the manga/light novel.\r\nART+ANIMATION: \r\nBackgrounds are good, city/ village design is good, strong level of detail and nice 3D layering of the artwork. Has a slightly dated to feel but it makes the humor scenes more entertaining for feeling out of place.\r\nThe animation is generally good, main character battles have amazing choreography and rarely have any static scenes. Some use of abnormal viewing angles. Mouth-flapping scenes are still present but are kept to a reasonable level.\r\nThe sound effects are good. In-show music is very good, but at times it seems too loud in the mix with voices. The first themesong does not follow the run-of-the-mill format of most recent action anime. It is similar to the music in the show and is orchestral and quite fluid in structure.\\n\\n\r\nSTORY: \\n\r\nThis may be considered a shoujo with the vast number of male characters, but it doesn\u2019t really hit that point until halfway through the series. The show feels quite gender neutral with scenes enjoyable by those on both sides, but nothing too ridiculous. It feels most similar in spirit to the Last Airbender series, with a good balance between battle scenes, character development, and light-hearted material \u2013 the music and setting also have a lot to do with that. Of course they don\u2019t have bending, but there is a parallel.\\n\\n\r\nThe story follows Princess Yona, a spoiled princess who has never stepped foot outside her castle. One night, she is caught up in the murder of her father, the king and is forced to go into hiding. Along the way she is told to gain the support of four specific people to aid her. What she didn\u2019t expect was that she would end up being caught up in an ancient legend from her kingdom. While out exploring the kingdom, see realizes much about the world around her and wishes to bring the happiness that she once had to her kingdom. \\n\\n\r\nThe first episode starts calm with some character background but ends with a great hook and cliffhanger that immediately draw in the viewer. From there we get a decent amount of backstory, and then continue into the first climax where our heroine has her awakening.\\n\\n\r\nGreat balance of easy-going humor with a few running gags, varied character building, and amazing battle scenes leaving me on the edge of my futon. Some serious character building scenes are broken up with silly moments, but all are either purposeful or reasonable. The pacing is well done. Nothing is rushed, and adequate time is taken to explore the important characters\u2019 backstories.\\n\\n\r\nDespite the main antagonist\u2019s plans being made well-known not too far into the series, I found myself wondering why he choose the plan of action that he did. Of course, he too is only human and it made for a good story.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS:\\n\r\nThe characters are well rounded and it is easy to feel invested in them. \\n\\n\r\nPrincess Yona goes from being a spoiled tomboyish girl having never ventured outside her castle, to choosing to fight on her own to protect others - seeing herself as the reason everyone else is in trouble. The in between stages are believable and well displayed. During the princess\u2019s steps of growth, she doesn\u2019t inexplicably gain new skills, even in crisis situations. Her burning awakening is realistic in that she isn\u2019t thinking about much else as if she were some all-knowing OP superhero. With some prompting, she wants to try on her own to learn more about her situation She spends much of her time practicing on her own whim, despite not being all that smart or skilled. Critically, she still retains her old personality mainly for comedic effect - na\u00efve, snarky but honest. \\n\\n\r\nEven seemingly flat and weak supporting characters have quite a bit of depth a reason behind them.\\n\\n\r\nThe \u2018reverse harem\u2019 dynamic is pretty standard and adds to the humor. It\u2019s hard to call it a reverse harem though considering the lack of romance going on \u2013 I\u2019m glad they chose that path here. That\u2019s not to say there isn\u2019t anything that could be portrayed that way though, but our lovely princess doesn\u2019t seem to think of those occasional situations in that way.\\n\\n\r\nThe \u2018bad guys\u2019 of all levels of the food chain show good reasoning abilities. There are one or two cowardly lord-level baddies with little depth more than preservation of their own standing. The story is mainly a struggle over how the path to the goal should be taken, with very little true bad guys, only disputes. The main antagonist is possibly the best example of this, where he had to do something unforgivable to accomplish what he saw needed to be done.\\n\\n\r\nOverall character design feels standard but fits. Many of the stronger characters stand out and that is taken into account while the group tries not to draw attention to itself during their travels.\\n\\n\r\nThe voice acting has above average casting, with good display of emotions. None of the stereotypical annoying crying in serious situations.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT:\\n\r\nI\u2019m surprised that I have never heard about this show before, as it is truly deserving of more attention. I found myself constantly thinking of it as the Japanese version of the Last Airbender / Legend of Korra series. Other than the obvious similarities between the two, the story-telling itself is what I felt stimulated that feeling the most. \\n\\n\r\nThe humor never skips a beat and is used to break up the less exciting moments of the less serious scenes. I love the way they give the humorous moments their own art-style. I smiled or laughed at most of them.\\n\\n\r\nPrincess Yona\u2019s growth as a heroine had me cheering her on the whole way, and she might just be my new favorite female lead character.\\n\\n\r\nThere are many quotes within the series that I like. My favorite - \u201cI\u2019m immortal. Actually, I can\u2019t afford to die.\u201d Others are more serious and applicable to real life.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL:\\n\r\nA very good semi-short series to watch if you are looking for a well-balanced and well thought out story with compelling characters. The humor is a welcome surprise in an otherwise serious looking concept. May be a shoujo, but it feels quite neutral.\\n",

A red-haired princess who thinks she has it all but takes everything for granted, later not being able to thank anyone. She changes herself. That's admirable, since not a lot of shows I have seen do that.\r\nI also really liked the first opening theme. Instrumentals are great.\r\nAlso, the characters are great. The four dragons? Allhad different traits. My favourite character is Yoon or Min-soo, mainly leaning towards Min-soo. \\n\\n\r\nSadly, this anime does not have a second season, but I have been told to read the manga. \\n\\n\r\nAnyway, that's my opinion about the anime Akatsuki no Yona, or Yona of the Dawn. thank you!",

            "content": "Akatsuki no Yona had me hooked on it all the way from the beginning of the first episode, I watched the whole season in a very short amount of time, I wish there was a second season that I could have continued onto, as I'm sadly not much of a manga person...\r\nAnyways...\r\nStory: I think the story was very good, the MC made huge progress compared to the very first episode to the very last, I know some people thought of not continuing it from seeing how the MC acted in the start, but continuing it is a good choice. The story never really seemed rushedso that's also good. I think the story had great development from a weak female MC who went through a traumatic experience that left her with only Hak to having strength and becoming more independent.\\n\\n\r\nArt: I really loved the art, I think the art was really beautiful and the eyes! I loved the way they did the eyes on all the characters, I especially like Sinha's or Yona's, especially when her eyes have flames in them. In general I just like art similar to Akatsuki no Yona's anyways.\\n\\n\r\nSound: I loved the intro, I never even skipped it once, it was really interesting to hear an intro with only instrumental, I've never seen an anime with only instrumental before. I just liked to listen to the orchestra as well. I also liked how the second outro started off with instrumental as well.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: I think the character development was great, they gave you quite a lot of information on the characters to where you could get attached to them as well. Some of the characters backgrounds stories were depressing, and some of them were just peaceful. Most of the characters have also gone through some sort of experience that made up their personality.\\n\\n\r\nOh, I just thought that they brought in one of the characters too fast, pretty randomly as well.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: I haven't watched an anime I enjoyed as much as this in such a long time, I was so happy to find an anime like this. I enjoyed the comedy scenes they put in every now and then too, most were pretty funny to me, but that's just my sense of humor. The action too... I got so overjoyed at one of the action scenes I didn't even know how to express how I was feeling. Haha I was mentally like \"YES!!!!\"\\n\\n\r\nOverall: I would recommend this to many people, and this is obviously a 10 for me! Uhh, this is also like a reverse harem so I don't know if anyone would mind that; other than that all is good! ^-^ I'll be sure to watch the second season if one does come out, some people are saying one won't be coming out, and I saw someone say one will be coming out in 2017, sooo idk.",

I think that overall though, the characters are all rather well portrayed, and Zeno's voice isperfect for his character!  \\n\\n\r\nI really liked the manga, which I read after watching the series, and I really hope that they make a second series for this anime, because it would be truly a shame if they didn't make any more content. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, a rather good watch, which occasionally urges me to rewatch it ^^",

            "content": "Story:\r\nThe basic premise is that Yona, the Princess of Kouka, must flee the castle after her father is assassinated. It turns out that she is the reincarnation of the original king of Kouka, and must gather the four dragon warriors from the creation legend to aid her in her quest. The story might not sound very original, but it is executed well with no plot holes that I could notice. The story is very well put together and thought out, and everything that happens seems logical. There's nothing out of place or random. I enjoyed that the dragon warriors didn't all immediately flock to Yona'sside, and that some of them needed to be won over. My only grievance is that the show didn't get to finish the story. The addition of the yellow dragon was very rushed and didn't really fit into the story the same way the other dragons did. \\n\\n\r\nArt: \\n\r\n Akatsuki no Yona has nice visuals with both the characters and the world around them. The animators didn't slack on the scenery. There are a lot of characters, but they all look very different which is a huge plus. There's nothing worse than having a big cast that all look the same! The animation is nearly flawless especially in the battle scenes.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nThe opening and ending songs work very well and are enjoyable to listen to. The first opening is entirely instrumental, and it pulls it off without being boring. About halfway through the series the opening song changes and, in my opinion, is just as good as the first opening. Going along with sound, the voice acting is also superb. Everyone's voices match their characters very well, and there are no characters with annoying voices. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nThe characters are really what make this show shine. I enjoyed nearly every character in the show, even the ones that the audience isn't meant to like. The only flaw here is that there are so many characters that it can be hard to give them all a proper amount of screen time. I would have loved to see more interactions between Hak and Yona. It would have been especially to the show's benefit to show more with Hak, Yona, and Su-Won. The flashbacks to their childhood was nice, but I wanted to see more with them as adults. The three dragons that are shown are all different which is a huge plus for the show. It would have not been enjoyable if the dragon's all had the same personality and attitude. Let us not forget about Yona, the star of the show. The series begins with Yona as a weak, self-centered Princess who I honestly wasn't rooting for. I really only started liking Yona when she realized that she couldn't keep relying on Hak. From then on out she really strives to grow as a person, and by the end of the series she is brave and willing to fight to protect those she loves.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nThis show caught my attention from the very beginning. For the most part every episode was a winner with little exception. The only episode I was blatantly bored watching was the fake battle/game/festival with Su-Won and the earth general guy. It felt unnecessary to the plot except to show that Su-Won wasn't a wimpy king. I would have rather the episode been spent developing the dragon characters instead of Su-Won. Other than that one episode I greatly enjoyed watching Akatsuki no Yona. I'm glad I watched it after the series was done airing so I could binge it! \\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nI would go back and change this rating to a ten if the show gets a second series. It didn't have time to wrap up the plot fully, but I'm glad the show wasn't rushed to finish. It would be great to see Yona get a second season. \\n",

            "content": "I absolutely loved Akatsuki no Yona (Yona of the Dawn). \r\nBefore I started this anime I defiantly did not expect to be too great. However the first episode changed my opinion completely.\r\nFirst I must give special mention to the main heroine Princess Yona, as the way she was handled though out the anime. Her character development is incredible. At first I thought she was going to just be a basic spoiled, cry-baby princess but I was so wrong. As the episodes go on Yona has become possibly my favorite female lead as she has become such an epic character. \r\nThe other characters in Akatsuki noYona are also amazing. While Yona stands out as my favorite, I still loved Hak, Yoon and the dragons. They are all unique in personality and it was very enjoyable getting to know them *especially Hak*. The villain is also wonderful but I will hold back on talking about him due to spoilers for the first episode. \\n\\n\r\nBoth openings are great while not too much difference between them. I loved the first one a bit more at first due to feeling that the second had out of place music but within about 3 episodes I loved it just as much. Both endings are also lovely and I didn't find myself skipping them like most other endings. \\n\\n\r\nI would recommend Akatsuki no Yona to most female anime watchers in a heartbeat. The anime is clearly more directed to females but I am sure if given the chance many males would love this anime just as much. This is certainly one of the best animes I have watched in some time and I hope that we are blessed with a second season.",

In this it's very clear who she likes most of all, or at least hopefully does. We'll see ^^\r\nThe art is really beautiful and I love the fact the artist shift from intense to chibi and cute really easily. My favourite part is the way when someone is showing a fierce expression theirs eyesseemed to glow. Especially Hak, his tend to do this most, increasing his attractiveness as a character for me.\\n\\n\r\nWhat I enjoyed most that despite some of it being a little fluffy and stereotypical, there were moments I wanted to cry and parts that had me in stitches. I love the humour the creators used to lighten the mood here and there. Once again Hak is a perfect example for this, his entire temperament is so enjoyable to watch.\\n\\n\r\nIf you enjoy a good adventure with love, loss and laughter, this is definately the anime to watch.

            "content": "Cartoons with strong female characters (and strong as in well-written, not emotionless fighters who do nothing but kill people and look cool) were a rarity back in the old days. But now, more and more of them are popping up, all of them being well received. When I was young and discovering the true nature of anime, I was amazed by anime's boldness in wanting to show things that most American cartoons wouldn't dare touch. Even the kids shows were mature and sophisticated, and that really appealed to me. As I expanded my anime repertoire, I began to learn more and more about Japan's standardson cartoons, and I eventually came to a realization why I love anime so much: the Japanese do so much more with animation rather than just limit it to kids shows or gross-out adult comedies, from horror and love stories to questioning humanity and the progress humanity has made over the years. I even took some classes on Japan and how circumstances such as World War II and the various earthquakes it had influenced many anime we know and love, from the old ones to the contemporary anime of today. However, the growing cynic in me is aware of the anime industry's gravitation toward bad harem moe wish fulfillment anime and catering to otaku rather than telling ambitious, passionate stories full of heart that everyone can love. But not all hope is lost, as there are still quality anime that pop out in modern times. One of those anime is Yona of the Dawn. Seriously, where has this been all my life?! It makes me feel like I'm 12 years old again, discovering the true nature of anime for the very first time, TEN years after the fact!\\n\\n\r\nYona is a lovely princess who lives a wonderful, pampered life in the Hiryuu Castle, nestled deep in the Empire of Kouka, with her father, King Il, her childhood friend whom she bickers with, Hak, and her cousin, Su-Won, whom she has a crush on. Her life is perfect and she doesn't have a care in the world, and wishes to marry Su-Won, but her father is against it. However, on a dark, stormy night, she is horrified as Su-Won, her beloved cousin, kills her father in cold blood and drives her and Hak out of the castle. With the help of some friends, she and Hak manage to escape death and Yona learns that in order to survive in this world, she have a lot to learn and a lot of growing up to do, and she can't afford to sit around and cry and cling to Hak all the time. A priest and his apprentice tell her and Hak about the Four Dragons who can help her take back her kingdom. With courage in her heart, Yona and friends set off to find the reincarnations of the four dragons with intent to save the Kouka Empire and reclaim her beloved home.\\n\\n\r\nWith a premise like this, it's no wonder a lot of people would be intrigued. Princesses have gained a bit of a bad reputation in the Western world, as they're usually portrayed as useless, shallow damsels in distress who love tea parties and dressing up, giggling over nothing, gush over marrying their prince charmings, and pretty much do nothing of importance to anyone or anything. When bad things happen, they're usually shown to just submit to it and wait for someone to rescue them, such examples being Sleeping Beauty and Snow White. But the death of Yona's father isn't the cue for someone to come and save her, even though it does. It's the start of her journey to become strong and more worldly. Simply put, in this story, Yona refuses to be the victim. She strives to become, and eventually does become, a hero. It shows us that the problems with most shows about princesses nowadays aren't princesses themselves, but rather what we, as a society, have done to them and reduced them to. Society sees princesses as damsels in distress who cannot be put on the same level as others. But Akatsuki no Yona takes that notion and smashes it into smithereens, though not without a few jabs at the concept every now and again, especially with how some of the characters treat her, especially Kija and Yun.\\n\\n\r\nNow for the technical stuff: first, the animation. It's bright, colorful, sharp, sleek, and looks quite good. The battle choreography is pretty good for the most part, the movements are reasonably fluid, the colors change depending on the atmosphere, befitting certain moments, and everything looks great. Usually, when the show wants to do comedy, they turn the characters into chibi-fied versions of themselves, probably for purposes of cuteness and hilarity, and it works pretty well here. I've heard some people say that they go a bit too far with this in that they insert these random moments in dead serious scenes as well, but I honestly had no problem with it. I think they're thrown in there so viewers can properly digest the dark and serious moments as well so it makes the scenes come off as less depressing or serious. I mean, obviously we have to show the characters in fun, happy situations before they're thrown into conflict and see what they're really like so we can have the chance to care about their struggles, right?\\n\\n\r\nThe music is another thing that really makes the show stand out. Since the show takes a lot of cues from ancient China and Korea, the music has a very distinct Eastern sound to it, from erhu sounds to other Eastern instruments I don't have names for. But every piece of music in the show works: whether it's a fun happy piece during a comedic moment or a roaring, bombastic violin during an epic battle scene, or soft erhus during the sad moments, every piece of music fits their intended scene, and it knows when to be subtle and when to pull out the stops. The music almost sounds a lot like Avatar: The Last Airbender, and they share a lot of commonalities, both in their music, premise, settings, and adventure-esque stories. You can tell the composer for this series is a very ambitious one, intent on bringing the show to life with his music, and if you ask me, he gets an A+. Both the opening and ending themes are very good as well, fitting the show's themes and atmosphere. I hear some say the second opening is a bit too J-poppy for such an Eastern-looking show, but while the music may not fit, the lyrics fit the show as it centers on Yona growing as a person and learning to survive in a harsh world.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are easily what make the show. They may seem like typical reverse harem stereotypes, but in this show, they are actually given depth and turn out to be so much more! But the show really excels in Yona's development. All throughout the show, she evolves from a spoiled, helpless, selfish, shallow princess to a strong, worldly, mature, and more open-minded young woman who is just trying to survive in the world, while still remaining vulnerable. Her friends and the Four Dragons get just as much personality and development within these 25 episodes. Shin-Ah is the silent, quiet type who is troubled by his tragic past, but is kind, sweet, and caring and helps his friends no matter what, and isn't a typical angsty lone wolf who hates everyone. Kija is a pompous rich kid who tries to do what he's been raised to do his whole life but doesn't always succeed, and often tries to push his ideas on others, but its called out, treated as a genuine character flaw, and it never comes off as mean-spirited, and he genuinely does care for his friends despite having lived a sheltered, pampered life. Yun is basically the glue that holds the group together, doing all the cooking, sewing, and anything that doesn't involve fighting, but even he isn't a damsel in distress. Every character, sans one who appears at the end, contributes something to the show and they're all very three-dimensional, showing lots of sides to them that most reverse harems don't even try to do these days. I love them all, even the villain and the skirt-chasing womanizer! Even side characters get some personality and focus!\\n\\n\r\nHowever, as much as I praise this show and love it and want more people to see it, it does have a very very big flaw. The anime is an adaptation of a long running manga that's still ongoing as we speak, and the show stops as soon as it introduces one character who NEVER APPEARS UNTIL THAT FINAL EPISODE. Basically, the anime really isn't much more than a commercial for the manga. But hot dang, is it a GREAT commercial for a manga! Seriously, if FUNimation ever dubs the rest of it, they should have Toonami air this, as this would probably become really popular here in the US if treated right, as shows like this need to be made!\\n\\n\r\nA wonderful, compelling show with great characters and a riveting story to tell, even in spite of its constraints. I highly recommend it!",

She is very brave and is willing to fight for the sake of those whom she cares about. She doesn't want to wait and let the boys fight. She also wants to get involved. A girl fighting like that is a very rare thing in reverse harem anime. All the characters are really good. Overall this series is great. It's my third favorite anime next to Death Note and Gosick. I hope this gets a second season very soon.",

            "content": "I started watching this show yesterday.  I got through the first 16 episodes, and I am VERY pleasantly surprised.\r\nFirst off, I am VERY selective about the anime I watch.  Every once in a while I feel 'brave' enough to try something new.  This was another of those moments.\r\nSecond, there are several things in an anime that will cause me to stop watching it IMMEDIATELY; the biggest being unnecessary fan-service.  (In my opinion, fan-service has no purpose in a story-based anime, and tends to distract from the show).  Then there's excessive 'cheesiness' or poor-application of humor, and finally poor story development.Out of about ten anime I start watching, usually 7-8 will drop from my list because of these factors.  \\n\\n\r\nYona of the Dawn, has exceeded ALL of my expectations!\\n\\n\r\nStory: This is not just another damsel-in-distress story, this is a story about someone who had it all, then lost it all, and is preparing to take it back!  Flashbacks are common in the show, but very well done!  Rarely in this show, if at all, did I think, \"Oh great; another flashback.\"  This show has a flow to it that I find is rare in many TV shows these days.  What is particularly interesting is that the show is fast paced, yet the pace is perfect for the show.  THAT is rare to me.  Many anime tend to rush to a point where the show feels unrealistic, but this handles the pace very well.  Not only that, but the transitions are done uniquely as well: as if the show is really two halfs of two episodes at a time.  It works very well for this series.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: Yona is the main character, and is NOT just a typical whiny Princess, at least not for long.  Over the course of the show she begins to transform into something more, a hero with a desire not necessarily to avenge, but to protect.  Her bodyguard, Hak, is another fun character.  He's a man of honor, but also someone who knows when it's time to joke and time to commence mass-mayhem.\\n\r\nThe villains in the story are unique, I feel.  You watch them, and find yourself wondering, \"Is he really the bad guy?\"  It makes me giddy thinking about the coming confrontation between the Hero and \"Anti-Hero\".\\n\\n\r\nArt/Sound: Very well done; the artwork, while perhaps typical, never really distracts from the story, and the music is INCREDIBLE!  I mean, and INSTRUMENTAL OPENING SEQUENCE!?!?!?  WHY DON'T THEY DO THAT MORE OFTEN!?!?!?!?  And even the second intro is impressive in it's own right!  The only complaint I have is that there are a few times when I found myself thinking, \"This is not a fitting background song for this scene\".  Even then, none of it is bad to say the least!\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: THIS SHOW IS FUNNY!!!\\n\r\nI mean, seriously, I have never seen an anime that blended such a level of seriousness with such a level of comic-relief so FLAWLESSLY!  The humor does not distract, it actually compliments each scene and even adds to the overall story.  Everything flows so naturally in this show that I must have been chuckling through half of it!  Fan-service is kept to a minimum, which is a big deal to me (I think there was one scene in episode three, and it was not just another \"lets rub boobs in the audiences face\" moment; it still flowed with the theme of the story at that moment).  And THE SQUIRREL IS AWESOME!!!  (You'll see why).\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9/10.  A wonderful anime that will keep you smiling, and even leave your heart throbbing.  But mostly keep you smiling.",

            "content": "I'm new here so this will be my first attempt to write a (decent) review about Akatsuki no Yona (AnY). \r\nFirst of all, AnY is an anime what actually led me here to write a review about it, so it's far special than the animes i've encountered recently. I highly recommend it because it's been a while since I had seen such a good ancient-like anime with sweet fitting soundtracks. Dancing is fun, but not as much without the music right?\r\nSTORY:   6 \r\nAfter you finish the anime you will need to read the manga. That's why I was a bit dissapointed and rateda 6, but don't let this 6 let you down. If the story was ended i'd probably go for a 8/9.\\n\r\nThe story itself is really well done. The first impression I had after the first episodes was like \"ow no it's that typical story again :/ \" well that wasn't the case at all. The story is very different than those common anime. This plot distinguishes itself in every way. It's more like a mythical quest you've always dreamed of. Kicked out princess, ancient time, survival, mythical powers, what do you need more?^^.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND:  8\\n\r\nEXCELLENT! just brilliant, I just love the soundtracks, it sounded a bit weird to me in the start but i was wrong. The soundtracks are just perfect! They are so calming and suited the atmosphere. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter:   7\\n\r\nThey did a superb job here! The characters in the anime are very well developed. Every time a 'main-side-ish' character joins the protagonist, a very well background of him/her is presented. I have to say, i hate seeing always background stories in animes. But in AnY, they were a MUST. and they were so touching and different that I just hoped for a background story every time a new friend joined the group!\\n\\n\r\nART:   8\\n\r\nBeautiful is the word. Ancient times means happiness, love and enjoyment. And you now what.. it was ALL THERE! It feels really good to see the anime. A lot of use of different joyful colours, plenty of romantic, mythical environments. Jupp, it was like the perfect mythical imagination of any fantasy lover.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT:   7\\n\r\nComedy and Romance. Tragedy and Love. Ofcourse I would enjoy it! Sometimes it did get boring like.. where is the story going to? but that was just like 1 or 2 episodes what didn't really bother, maybe these eps were needed to explain to story further?\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL:  7 \\n\\n\r\nYou just have to watch it. It's not an anime to get hyped of but it's a very reassuring anime. I'm busy the whole day, and whenever I got time in the evening this anime made me come to my senses. It took me away from this world and took me on a quest in search of the ( insert spoiler here ). I was a one darn happy kid while watching this. I'm still upset of no continuation.",

            "content": "Yona of the Dawn is the gem I have been waiting to come across. Out of all of the typical, same underlying theme in many current animes, this one really shines. Characters are unique, plot is well-thought out, interesting premise, amazing art and sound, with a fun element of humor = PERFECT!\r\nStory 10/10\r\nAmazing. In the beginning of watching this, I was quite skeptical. The protagonist seemed annoying and typical boy-crazy girl from the get-go. But as the plot progresses, we see how the trauma of witnessing her father's murder by her childhood crush/friend affects her and the way she looks at life. We see howshe becomes stronger in her quest, picking up a bow and arrow, swallowing her fear of heights, and doing her absolute best each day. The plot is easy enough to understand once it is introduced: legend of 5 dragons who get reincarnated. Yona is the crimson dragon who seeks out the other four in her journey.\\n\\n\r\nArt/Sound 10/10\\n\\n\r\nBEAUTIFUL, WONDERFUL, and WELL-FITTING.\\n\r\nThe art and sound really give you a nice sense on the time period.\\n\r\nAlthough, the Lady Gaga-type 2nd opening was a little strange, it worked, so whatever. Usually people don't watch openings unless there like Tokyo Ghoul or Mirai Nikki or Vampire Knight. But this anime didn't need a flashy opening to get my attention. The trailer was enough.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 10/10\\n\\n\r\nYES! Each character was very individual and unique. (These descriptions probably sound incredibly weird before watching)\\n\\n\r\nYona- once spoiled princess becomes a strong warrior. Cute, and rather unaware, a perfect link between her comrades.\\n\\n\r\nHak- hot childhood friend AKA the Lightning Beast (no really, that's what he's called). Yona's protector, has a little bit of a crush on her (but really, who doesn't?)\\n\\n\r\nYoon- \"Beautiful\", knowledgeable , slightly arrogant boy. Not my fav, but interesting\\n\\n\r\nKija- White dragon- Hilarious to watch his rivalry with Hak to protect Yona\\n\\n\r\nShin-Ah- FAVORITE. Sad childhood of the blue dragon. Quiet, withdrawn, but hilarious with his sidekick, Ao, the fluffy squirrel.\\n\\n\r\nJae-Ha- Narcisstic green dragon. Pretty funny pirate.\\n\\n\r\nZeno- the one we know least about-the yellow dragon. Childish and constantly hungry.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 10/10\\n\\n\r\nNot a dull moment. Laughed my face off. 'nuff said.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 10/10 \\n\\n\r\nDon't think I really need to say anything more.\\n\\n",

Of course I did, the petite arcs between the four dragons were comical and fun to watch along with the flirty dynamic between Hak and Yona made it so bearable to complete. The only issue I have of Akatsuki no Yona as of now is that throughout 90% of the anime Yona's looking for these dragons, but at the same time she has no clue what she's going to do with them after she collected them all. Which is why there's a season two to find out Yona's plans to do with the dragons! Or at least that's whatthe ending of the first season suggests. \\n\\n\r\nI couldn't find any other problems other than Yona's premise, since I'm assuming there will be a second season I'm excited to see Yona and Su-Won once they get together and have a face to face conversation. Other than that I enjoyed Akatsuki no Yona very much. If you haven't seen it yet please give it a watch, it's not your typical rom-come injected reverse harem.

            "content": "When I first found this show, I was confident that I'd like it- an assumption that turned out to be correct.  However, one thing worried me- the \"shoujo\" tag on MAL.  I'm a guy, and I'm not a particularly big fan of shoujos- not because they're made for girls, but because I found the plot to be too boring or clich\u00e9 and the characters cut and paste. However, male viewers, you have nothing to fear- the show's characters and fight scenes will make it totally unique to anything other shoujo.\r\nDo not be afraid.\r\nStory-8\r\nAlthough the plot itself it not exceptionally original, the \"twist\" inthe first 2 episodes opened up some new opportunities for this show- really, it kind of reminded me of a Disney movie sometimes. The pacing felt a little slow at first, picked up, died back down, and picked up again- all over the place but never boring.  The final few episodes really shine and have one of my favorite scenes ever.\\n\\n\r\nArt-8\\n\r\nPersonally, I really liked the character style- especially the eyes.  All characters were pleasing to look at.  The backgrounds I felt really seemed real- from a secluded shrine to a mountain village to a cave to a bustling city all seemed like actual places.  One thing that was especially awesome were the fight scenes- fast paced and fluidly animated. You could definitely feel the power when a certain blue-clad glaive wielder fought.  Another thing to be praised in the fight scenes is the camera work, which always allows you to see what is going on without making the fights seem boring.\\n\\n\r\nSound-10\\n\r\nWhere do I start with this? I would honestly rate this a 10/10 if they just played the 1st OP over and over.  It's that good. The song doesn't need words in order to feel epic.  The 2nd OP is by no means bad but not as good as the first. I don't have a lot to say about the 1st ED, but the 2nd was pure awesome due to the choir work in the background.  I wish more shows would pick out OPs and EDs that would fit the theme of the show so well as these do.  \\n\\n\r\nCharacter-9\\n\r\nAkatsuki no Yona did so much right in this category. Jeaha is always calm and nonchalant- an always flirting.  He also cares deeply about those around him and arrears to have a strong sentimental connection with his pirate crew.  Yun is the responsible one of the group- cooking the meals, managing finances, and scolding for misconduct. In the manga, he's even referred to as \"Mom\" a few times.  Kija never really struck me as unique but I enjoyed his squabbling with the aforementioned \"blue-clad glaive wielder\".  Zeno regrettably didn't get enough screen time but stole the show while he was there.  Shin-ah is the one character I just don't get- maybe I just don't like the silent type.\\n\\n\r\nAND NOW\\n\r\nOur leads\\n\\n\r\nYona- Wow, totally didn't see that coming.  Yona starts out as a character a show should never hope to have- whiny, complaining, clingy, and doesn't understand what she's doing.  However, this all changes.  Gradually, Yona becomes strong and independent, willing to make important decisions or put herself in danger to prove herself.  Her transformation is really something.\\n\r\nHak- What would this show be without Hak? Not nearly as good IMO.  Hak is my very favorite character in this show full of great characters. He's a total badass and is funny as hell. What's not to like? However, the decision he makes to ******* *** ****** (no spoilers) really shows how much he cares for Yona and how serious he is about her safety.  \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment-9\\n\r\nAt no point did I ever find this show boring or annoying, and I absolutely loved 2 of the arcs.  Bottom\\n\r\nline is, I enjoyed it every step of the way.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall-9\\n\r\nNo matter what your experience is or what shows you like, Akatsuki no Yona is a much watch.  Even if you don't like Yona at first, she'll grow on you- and the manga series is fantastic.  This show deserves so much more attention than it gets.\\n\\n\r\nThanks for reading my long review!\\n\\n",

            "content": "From the start, Akatsuki no Yona seemed destined to follow the standard \u201cRestore the Rightful Ruler to Power\u201d plot path, and the twists that do come tend to be emotional side tracks, or road blocks present so Princess Yona can expand her horizons from sheltered princess to enlightened warrior step by step. \r\nOne can't really argue with the quality of the art, or production value. No complaints at all in that area. As an incomplete work at this stage, it's hard to pass judgment on what likely needs another full season to bring the story to it's conclusion, but in terms of an action epic,it gets a passing grade, even if it's performance so far would put it behind something like Code Geass for plot. Yona covers all the basics and I was waiting for it to blow me away with greatness, and I just didn't find it, at least not in the first season, but I suppose there's still reason to hope. Right now, it feels like a SNES era RPG plot from a second tier publisher. Just wait you meanie, I'll come back with my four warriors of justice and I'll show you! \\n\\n\r\nI did like the reverse harem aspect of the show, and that while it's Shoujo it isn't shying away from action scenes like other examples of Shoujo I've seen. It is deserving of the action genre. Overall I will watch a second season if produced, and hope for a little bit more maturing of the plot, otherwise it will stay down a notch from the greats.",

            "content": "Akatsuki no Yona, spoiler free. \r\nAkatsuki no Yona is quite a breathe of fresh air from the \"edgy\" \"harem\" \"ecchi\" \"school life\" \"urban\" \"CGI\" plague that's been abundant in the industry as of late. It's definitely a retelling of a classic concept, but there's nothing wrong with that when it's done right. It's nice to see the familiar fantasy era where true warriors of sword and skill rule in the hierarchy of kings and vassals. The music feels culturally on par with it's era, accompanied by good art and animation, and an excellent cast of characters.\r\nWe are introduced to a very sheltered, spoiled naive, andarrogant princess by the name of Yona. Family and political figures are gathered to the castle in celebration of Yona's sixteenth birthday. We get brief introductions to other characters such as her childhood friends and love interests. However, her peaceful life is shattered that evening when she witnesses her father being murdered by the man she loves. Amid the chaos, her personal bodyguard Hak, manages to flee from the castle with Yona. Left heartbroken, confused, and lonely from this betrayal, Yona begins to gain a new perspective traveling outside the castle walls for the first time. She then embarks on a journey following an ancient legend to gain allies and take up arms to protect the beloved people of 'her' kingdom.\\n\\n\r\nThe story takes it's time showing the journey and growth of Yona and gathering her forces. It also gets split up at times to show a developing character of the antagonists. Giving a perspective from both sides really draw in the personal conflict that our heroine is experiencing for ourselves.   \\n\\n\r\nOur main heroine is the most attractive part of the show. It's great to see a strong inspiring female lead that feels real. Yona often struggles with her mixed feelings of love and animosity or her own helplessness, but also shows great determination in her resolve. There is also a great supporting cast of badass men, for instance her smug overconfident bodyguard Hak, who has extraordinary strength and on more than one occasion will fight off a number of men himself with ease. Each of the remaining cast all get good arcs delving into each of their stories, besides from one, that seems like it was rushed for completion of the first season. Assuming there will be another. \\n\\n\r\nThere's often spurts of comedy that sometimes feels out of place, but is rather entertaining and not really overdone. Again, the pacing is rather nice imo, it gets a little slow here and there, taking it's time giving attention to it's characters depth, such as backstory that explains their perspective and/or personality, or the subtle conflict of romance that foreshadows the future. It's a good balance, cause when the time for action comes, I found most of the conflicts suspenseful and the battles exciting, with good direction and animation.\\n\\n\r\nAkatsuki no Yona was a great experience. Would definitely recommend watching.",

But it has spoiled its potentiality focusing both on Shoujo and action. Last 8 epi really deserve even less than 4.\r\nArt is not any exceptional or outstanding one. Like other mediocre anime out there of recent years, its art is also mediocre.\r\nSound isgood I think. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter development is as weak as its story.  it was really annoying how the writer focused much on Yona. Yona is shown to be very strong at the second half. But the character transformation is not smooth rather its like jumping from 1 to 10.

            "content": "When I finished watching the first 5 episodes of this show I was honestly enthralled. I thought this was going to be the best shounen/shoujo story I'd ever watched. But then, with every episode it dug itself into a deeper and deeper hole. \r\nStory: This is clearly an unfinished show. However, unlike most shows that haven't been fully adapted, this one manages to spend 24 episodes and accomplishes basically nothing. 20+ episodes were used to build her harem. Suwan wasn't developed in the slightest either, so we have no idea why anything is happening, only that it is. Even Yona herself appears to have noidea why she is gathering her harem or what she even needs them for. I'm willing to give it a 6 because of the mini arcs, some of which were quite good. The green dragons mini arc was honestly fantastic. But with no overarching story to keep track of the show got dull quickly.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Yona is a fantastic shounen/shoujo protagonist. She is relatable and she doesnt rely on the power of friendship or whatever. She realizes that she is worthless and seeks to change that. As a romance protagonist she's horrendous, which is why this show ends up being a shitty reverse harem. Outside of Yona, we just have walking cliche harem tropes. Not a single other character is worth mentioning except Suwan, who wasn't developed despite being the single most interesting character in the show.\\n\\n\r\nArt: Art generally doesnt really matter to me, but I really liked this shows animation. The action scenes were really good, and the characters were generally well done as well. Admittedly, the people who drew this don't seem to know what subtlety means but I guess that's acceptable.\\n\\n\r\nSoundtrack: Other than the fact that they kept reusing the same song for like half the scenes in the show, it was really good. The 2nd op/ed were amazing and the first op was... interesting. It was an interesting choice, although one I personally dont agree with. The 2nd op did a much better job of hyping up the show than the melancholy instrumental that was the first one. Also, the English dub was top tier for those of you who prefer it.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: This should have been a prequel honestly. I haven't read the manga so I dont know what happens next or how accurate the adaptation is, but I do know that a potential second season CAN be an amazing show. All they would have to do is actually focus on Suwan and drop the stupid harem tropes. If they can do that, this will be one of the best shounen/shoujo shows. If they don't, it will just be a decent reverse harem.",

            "content": "(This is my first review of any anime)\r\nAs someone who was reluctant to watch the anime, someone who is not really into the whole fantasy aspect of stories, I found this 'Yona of the Dawn' very new and refreshing for me to watch. \r\nThe story itself is, to be fair, rather predictable and it follows a rather formulaic pattern of these typical journey stories. However, where the story may fall to cliche, the characters do not, each of them bringing them a different dynamic to the story. I myself am not usually an avid watcher or fan of harem/reverse harem anime due to its, uh,dare I say heavy \"fanservicey\" nature of them, many of which fall to the tropes of the genre. It is safe to say that YOTD does not include any fanservice (apart from that one moment with Hak, cough) which in fact ties in very nicely with the tone of the anime.\\n\\n\r\nInterestingly enough, I never feel myself drawn to any of the main characters. I usually find protagonists to be annoying or simply bland and flat. However, this was not the case with Yona. In the beginning, she was a truly a typical princess, air-headed and vain. As the story progresses, she begins to become more self-aware as well as less ignorant about the country around her. Her desire to become stronger is definitely shown through the series and by the end of the 24 episodes, her character development is astounding. In general, all the characters were a pleasure to watch and enjoy. I do have to say though, my favourite character in the series was definitely Captain Gigan.\\n\\n\r\nI do feel as if in some places, the music in the background was off-putting. For some serious scenes, the instrumental music was too up-beat and jolly. I'm not sure if that was going for an intended effect but it was jarring at times. However, both OPs were well-executed, in my opinion, capturing both the intense-but-not-too-intense attitude of the anime, combined with the light-heartedness of the anime.\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately, the story is definitely not complete. Despite the availability of the manga, I can't help but hope for a continuation of the storyline. Here's hoping to a second season!",

The score I give it will stay the same regardless of if Yona gets a season 2 or not. \r\nThat being said, I REALLY WANT A SEASON 2. \r\nThe story is far from over and I hope that there will be a continuation of the anime adaptation because overall its been good so far.\r\nThe best two characteristics of this show thus far have been the characters and theadventure story. You would think that looking at the official poster it would be just a reverse harem fantasy, but it has way more substance than that. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters, particularly the main character Yona, have been a lot of fun to watch. It was enjoyable to see a sheltered princess grow in strength to become a badass, and it's nice to see that the first season is (hopefully) just the start for her metamorphosis. \\n\\n\r\nThe animation is just okay on the other hand. There are moments when I see a pretty show and I cannot look away, particularly the beginning of episode 7, but the rest of the time it looks like any other tv anime. \\n\\n\r\nThat isn't to say that you should not watch it, in fact, I recommend it  :)",

            "content": "Intriguing beginning, and Yona isn't half bad as a female lead. We see her progression from a somewhat weak and sheltered girl, to a someone who strives to be stronger, which I appreciate. I also liked the interactions between her and Hak- there is tension and suspense and omg will they get together??! Though I have to admit sometimes when she says \"I'll protect you Hak\" I cringe inside and my cynical heart goes HOW? WITH WHAT? WHOSE PROTECTING WHO?\r\nHowever, what this show lacks is suspense and real conflict,  or what I really mean is conflict between the capture of the  'legendary fourdragons.' I've only hit episode 10 but so far the taming( I say taming lightly, because it's basically instant) of the white dragon was so uninteresting, and in a nutshell it was basically like this:\\n\\n\r\nWHITE DRAGON: my goal is to serve my chosen master\\n\r\n*Yona appears with her red hair*\\n\r\nWHITE DRAGON: OH MY YOU HAVE RED HAIR, YOU MUST BE THE CHOSEN ONE\\n\r\n*White dragon feels tinges in his arm*\\n\r\nWHITE DRAGON: MY BLOOD IS CALLING FOR YOU\\n\r\n*white dragon proceeds to follow Yona & Hak on their adventures*\\n\\n\r\nSee, Yona never has to prove herself and everyone just appears to follow her blindly for no reason.(Also what is with anime and red haired special snowflakes?!!!)  It would've been more interesting if the white dragon had his own motivations, or goals- or if there were more morally ambivalent/ or three dimensional characters. And apparently from what I've heard, the other dragons are also acquired in a much similar manner. I may change my mind.\\n\\n\r\nDespite what I've said, I do think Akatsuki no Yona is one of the better shojo animes out there, with a pair of likeable fairly strong leads. It's the side characters, and blind faith/chosen one storyline that bores me.\\n",

            "content": "I'm not gonna lie, the only reason why I watched this anime was because of a recommendation list that said it was about a princess gitting gud. Which I am a sucker for good female leads (Moribito being one of my favorite anime.) What I got was a decent little show about a princess in fact gitting gud. Spoilers below though Ill be very vague on them for those wanting to watch this series\r\n(Overall I give this an anime a 6/10 for the TL/DR)\r\nThe story is about the female lead Yona turning 16 and having a nice party that suddenly stops being nice when herentire life gets absolutely ruined by a coup. Her peace loving father, and king of the land and has a wopping 5 minutes of screen time, gets murdered and the murderer takes the throne, forcing the young princess to flee with her trusted friend, bodyguard and the male lead , Hak. From there it turns into an adventure story about her wanting to git gud but she's just a clooless pwincess who doesn't know any better. Honestly I am probably making the story seem bad when it actually has potential, shame it never expands on the potential. The coup is never fully expanded upon as the goals of it are never explained in the full 24 episodes this series goes through. The adventure aspect takes up most of it and its pretty good at that, the little arcs the bratty and clueless Yona and her badass hotboi, and albeit creepy, bodyguard Hak, journey together on are very nice as they work well as a duo, key word being duo. Eventually more people tag along as her new goal is to assemble the ancient descendants of dragon warriors to accomplish a goal that is not explained in the entire 24 episodes of this series, such as a very feminine boy genius. A very devout, very naive White dragon descendant. A very edgy Blue dragon descendant. A flirty and rather flamboyant Green dragon descendant. And the biggest offender of this motley crew \"I am hungry and Carefree\" The yellow dragon descendant. These extra characters don't really add anything aside from more people for Hak to tease but Ill go more into my problems with them when I talk about the characters. Overall with the current ending of this anime I cannot rate this story highly, too many loose ends and it is far too under explained for its own good.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is pretty good, some set pieces look really nice and I like the character designs. I especially like Yona's as it makes her look weak and pathetic when it needs too, yet still comes off as confident when needed.\\n\\n\r\nGod Bless this soundtrack. I am a massive sucker for eastern instrumentals. That being said no song really stood out, however every song enhanced the scene they were used in by quite a bit. The OP and ED are pretty forgettable though.\\n\\n\r\nOh boy the characters, I already expressed that I thoroughly enjoyed Yona and Hak as a duo, however though the rest of the cast drag them down, typically stealing the spotlight from one or both of them. As an example at one point Yona must go get these plants in a dangerous cliff side as part of a deal. The condition is that she must do it alone. Well Mr. Green and Flamboyant decides to follow her there to keep her company, alright that's fine. He even states that even he cant go past a certain point as he's too big. So Yona continues onward bravely, despite her being terrified and physically weak she still finds the inner strength to keep going and she actually fucking succeeds without any help. Awesome characterization there. Que an incoming storm from outta fucking no where, and a massive wave happens to hit the cliff side she was at. She falls over but manages to grab onto a tree root that's coming from the cave that has the flowers in them. Awesome, she gets to prove even more how strong she's become. But nah another character crushing wave comes by so Green and Flamboyant comes to her rescue. Stealing the spotlight from what could have been another good moment to show her strong will. Though this happens only a few times. Now the biggest and worst offender to the cast of characters is the Yellow Dragon, he shows up and says that he's carefree and that he's hungry. He appears in episode 23. Amazing and top tier characterization right there. Thankfully the antagonist of this show is a very interesting one, I won't go into much detail about him as I feel he needs to be experienced, as it appears most people have a different opinion on him.\\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed the comedy and what little action the show offers. Most of the comedy comes from the motley crew bickering or bantering, typically the fault of Hak. \\n\\n\r\nOverall Akatsuki no Yona wanted to tell the story of a princess gitting gud, and it does. Kinda, it feels incomplete. As the ending it has really isn't an ending. It more feels like the end of a long arc. If it had a proper ending I would have given this anime a 7/10 but as it is now It earns its 6/10. Its held back by the extra cast of characters and poor story.",

It is really lovely series which takes place in old era where princess Yona is on a journey with her companions.\r\nThere is nothing really much to the actual story but characters are really diverse and lovable, even the negative once.\r\nPrincess Yona grows up being pampered by her father (who hated violence and use of weapons) and on her 16th birthday her cousin Su-won (whom she loves) murders her father. She escapes with help of her bodyguard and childhood friend Hak and embarks on journey to find four dragons (now in humanform).\\n\\n\r\nAll the characters are funny and overall mood of the anime is somewhat light. Hak is funniest (and sexiest) character of all, he loves Yona and protects her throughout journey but he is also considerate of her feelings for Su-won. Su-won, I think, is also one of the interesting characters. He murders emperor because he hates his -no wars- ideology. He wants to make is kingdom stronger and unite different tribes in his kingdom.\\n\r\nAside from these two there are four dragons all of them have different personalities, powers and own stories but in the end they just team up with Yona to help her through her mission.\\n\\n\r\nBackground score is also impressive, I liked opening theme and 2nd ending theme. Animation is really nice. Thing I liked most is chemistry between Yona and Hak and I want to see how their relationship grows over the time of series. Waiting for season 2 !!\\n\\n\r\nYou should watch it if you like road trip, romantic stories\\n\r\nYou should avoid it if you don\u2019t like somewhat reverse harem plots",

Yona is very admirable. The art wasn't the best, but the colors were very vivid. The sound was amazing! It was medieval like, and fit the story perfectly.\r\nI loved this anime, and am now impatiently awaiting season 2!!!",

            "content": "If I'm completely honest I've always despised harems. They've always seemed unrealistic and heavily reliant on fanservice to do the job right, and when I saw that this show was a male harem I decided to never touch it even with a 10 foot pole. But after some badgering from the internet I decided it couldn't hurt to watch, and that was when I found out how to do a harem right. Akatsuki no Yona excels at everything it attempts to do and I'm honestly shocked that there's no season 2 yet. Shocked and disappointed. This show is a masterpiece of character development and mythology,and I don't use the word \"masterpiece\" often.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 10\\n\r\nThe story of Akatsuki no Yona takes place after the spoiled 16 year-old princess Yona is the victim of a coup d'etat, led by her cousin Soo Won. She and her bodyguard Hak flee the kingdom to avoid being killed, and learn of a destiny they have to achieve in order to reclaim Yona's home. Despite it being a somewhat simplistic plot, I've never really seen it around before, and it has never been executed quite like AnY. Every arc seems to unfold into dangerous territory and most of the time, the characters don't come out completely unscathed. Unfortunate events have our heroes tumbling from place to place, desperately trying to recover from each attack. You never get the sense that these characters are safe, they're constantly on the run from something. It's realistic, even for a fantasy genre, and the way the characters react to each new event feels real and wholesome. But the story isn't the biggest charm point this show has, it's the characters and how they work with the story. Like I said, the plot is simple, but the driving characters are what makes it interesting (and I will talk in-depth about this later).\\n\\n\r\nArt: 10\\n\r\nOkay if I'm honest I wasn't a huge fan of the art at the beginning of the series. Everything was so sparkly and the eyes were so huge and while I absolutely didn't HATE the art, it wasn't anything special. There were a few moments when the animation seemed absolutely brilliant, especially in the chase scenes, but like I said, nothing special. But then, after a few episodes, you get to see how Yona is shaped by the tragedies that surround her, and it's very easy to see her character development through her eyes alone. Her eyes are a huge focal point in the art here, showing her going through the transition from naive girl to fierce warrior. The colors of each scene really help reflect what you should be feeling, from fiery reds to pump you up to cooler, darker blues to make you feel at ease. Basically I'm a huge fan of character development through subtle changes in the characters' appearances and colors, and this is a tactic that AnY executes extremely well. More examples of this can be shown in Hunter x Hunter (2011) and the more tragic arcs of One Piece.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9\\n\r\nThe first opening of this show is brilliant, as it takes a special type of show to be able to pull off a completely instrumental opening. Its music goes completely in-sync with the visuals and they flow really beautifully into each other. The first ending looks and sounds lovely, though it doesn't hold quite the same impact as the OP. I wish they'd kept the instrumental opening in the second half of the season, as I'm not a huge fan of the 2nd OP. The 2nd ED, however, is so fitting to the show and sounds and looks lovely, to boot. The OST also has some very emotional tracks that I'm very fond of, and overall, the sound of the series is great, although it's nothing TOO fantastic.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10\\n\r\nI'd give this an 11 if I could. If you watch this show for anything, it should be for the characters. Yona is definitely one of the strongest, most well-developed female characters I've ever seen. It's so refreshing to see a character who is initially a spoiled crybaby progress so well into a fierce, determined fighter, without sacrificing parts of her original charm. She still goofs off and is ignorant to many things, but she WANTS to learn. Yona is pretty much my hero. If you're looking for a strong female character in a series, you don't need to look any further. Despite being the center of a harem, Yona is easily the least romance-focused character in the show. She portrays a realistic female character in danger surrounded by males who love her and want to protect her. That meaning, she doesn't let them protect her. Every time she's saved by someone, she wants to return the favor, and get stronger. She has no time for worrying about her romantic life, and she makes this very clear. \\n\r\nThe other characters aren't without their charm points, either, specifically Hak, Soo Won, Yoon, and the dragons. Hak is incredibly funny and sassy, and badass too. He has his gentle side and obviously cares deeply for Yona (and cared deeply for her father), and he, like Yona, has deep emotional conflict about Soo Won. His interactions with the dragons are hilarious, and he's a likable, relatable character. Yoon is a support character but his development and friendship with Yona is so nice, considering the got off on the wrong foot at the start. The dragons and their interactions are all very wholesome and nice, despite having only known each other for a short time. The backstories are seriously tragic, so if you wanna cry and feel bad for these characters, this is the place to go. As conflicted as Yona and Hak are about Soo Won, I feel this conflict as well. I still don't know how to feel about Soo Won, he's easily one of the best villains I've seen come out of the fantasy genre. Altogether, the characters are what make this show truly enjoyable. If you want strong characters and amazing interactions, this is the show for you. I just wish there could be a season 2 so you didn't have to go read the manga to find out more about the yellow dragon. If you ask me, they chose an awkward time to cut the series off, and a season 2 is basically necessary to enjoy it (or you could read the manga, but who does that now a days? :P)\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment and overall: 10\\n\r\nThis show is an excellent portrayal of what a harem can be, and what a fantasy adventure can be. Yona is an incredible character who still has a loooong way to go, and the other characters support and compliment her in all the best ways. The art and animation are nothing to judge, and the story weaves in with the strong characters very well. If this show doesn't get a season 2, I will be severely disappointed, since the future arcs of the manga have some of the best moments and greatest things to offer. If you want basically anything good out of an anime, I suggest you watch this.",

I'm not almost caught up with the manga.\r\nThis is now a 9 overall.\r\nAs the story progresses it really does get better and better. Literally my only disappointment is despite it's great reviews, it hasn't been renewed for a season 2. I find that very odd. It has all the makings of becoming a long, well known shounen like Full Metal, One Piece, Naruto, Bleach, Fairy Tail etc. It's up there, it really is.\r\nIt begins witha betrayal which is what leads to the MC becoming a strong and determined person. However, even in the betrayal story there is a twist. It seems there are rarely any fully evil people, which is the idea I think.\\n\\n\r\nThe romance element is subtle enough to not ruin the fighting and action part of the story, but strong enough to give you that cute little feeling in your stomach. All the guys are hot too, which is major bonus (Y) :')\\n\\n\r\nThey do a great job of building up on their backstorys as the show goes on. I find longer shounen like this time do that very well. They don't give you all the info in one go but enough to make you understand what's going on with them.\\n\\n\r\nThe comedy is brilliant! IT kind of reminded me a it of FMA and One Piece comedy. It helps break up the tension very nicely and makes you love the group even more. I enjoy that Yona doesn't want to remain a damsel for long and forces the guys to let her practice her combat skills, even becoming a formidable fighter.\\n\\n\r\nThis is 100% worth a try. With only 24 episodes in the anime until renewal, it's not a massive commitment that will take forever to get caught up to date either.",

            "content": "Yona of the Dawn: Proof that \"Harem\" and \"Quality Anime\" are not mutually exclusive terms.\r\nComing into the series, I had a fair bit of skepticism. Harem (reverse or not), is just not a genre I usually enjoy. Taking one glance at the character section on MAL did not help. This show is not only a reverse harem, but it is what I would consider a \"bishounen\" reverse harem. To top if off, there really is no other female characters outside the MC to speak of. SO it's a bunch of hot anime boys whose only romantic option is the protagonist. Now, is that pandering tothe target audience a bit? Sure. But let's not throw the baby out with the bath water. That fact does not preclude this from being a top-notch anime. \\n\\n\r\nIt's very simple, while some might roll their eyes as bishie after bishie is introduced into Yona's growing harem and consider that a negative, the show basically nails every other aspect. I'll explain.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 8\\n\r\nI'm not going to get into specifics of the story and you can read the synopsis to at least get the gist of the set up. But I will say the story, while not mind-blowing, has not enough twist and turns to make it pretty consistently compelling. Each episode will usually leave you wondering what is going to happen next, and usually plays a role in the overall story arc in the series.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9\\n\r\nArt-wise, it's excellent as well. The animation quality is high across the board and there is some really beautiful shots and cinematography throughout. Also, needless to say, I think female fans will be happy with the design of male characters. Thumbs up.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 6\\n\r\nSound-wise, it's ok. The voice acting was good, not great. A lot of the same background music was replayed a lot, and oftentimes way too loudl. I can't say either of the OPs or EDs really stood out either. Sound is the show's weak link, but it's not egregiously bad.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 8 (heads up, this is going to be the longest section)\\n\r\nNow again, it's worth pointing out these characters were very clearly designed to appeal to its target audience, which is not me. But that doesn't mean they're bad. There is a decent mix of goofy and serious characters, and I would say most are likable. I appreciated the fact that not only were the characters different, but the way in which Yona interacted with them were unique for each one.\\n\\n\r\nNow, there's a lot of characters in the show, but I am going to spotlight 3 of them. First, Yona, the main character. She is a sheltered, naive, and overall pretty useless princess that is forced to abandon the castle just to survive. It's very much a sink or swim scenario, and to her credit, she swims. Her character development from the princess everyone has to protect to someone that can protect herself, and sometimes others, is a big part of the series. I'd also like to applaud the realistic progression she shows. No one turns into a BAMF overnight, and neither did she. Overall, she was a solid main character, even if she comes up a bit short in comparison to some of my other favorite shoujo MCs.\\n\\n\r\nSecond, we have Hak. He's the bodyguard, and childhood friend, of Yona. Let's it call like it is. Hak is awesome. Yeah you might take a look at him and think he's just eye-candy, but it goes well beyond that. He is an incredibly talented warrior, selfless, devoted, and overall just good dude. Honestly, and I know she's the MC and a princess, but IMO he's out of Yona's league. It's definitely one of those cases where if she wasn't the main character, I doubt he'd be so love-struck. Also, the whole \"childhood friend secretly harboring feelings for the oblivious main character\" thing has freakin' been done to death. Just stop it already writers. In fact, my biggest complaint was how his entire world seemed to revolve around Yona. It seemed like most conversations and thoughts of his had something to with her. He's a cool enough character that his association with Yona shouldn't completely define him as a person. But I digress, Hak is still awesome. Definitely a top-tier husbando.\\n\\n\r\nThird, Su Won. He is Yona's cousin, and yes, first and only love. Unfortunately, he also murders her father and takes his place as Kouko's next king. This leaves Yona in utter shock, as not only does she love this man, but this action conflicted so heavily with the Su-Won with the gentle smile she knew. We don't see as much from him after this, but it's clear he was very much not alone in this coup d'etat. It leaves both Yona and the viewer in a conflicted state. Is he a monster or a simply monster's puppet? Who is the real Su Won; the man who murdered the king, or the loving cousin that would fall asleep holding Yona's hand? It's not entirely clear, and that's what makes him such an intriguing \"villain\".\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8\\n\r\nGood action, good drama, decent comedy. The only thing that hindered my enjoyment was the whole bishounen reverse harem aspect of the show. Although I'm sure its target audience loved that part.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8\\n\r\nA really good show, that also has me shaking my head a bit. Because it could've been GREAT if not for the pandering it exhibited with the harem aspect, all the eye candy, and insanely lopsided gender ratio. Having said that, it is definitely the best harem anime I have seen and I think one that even guys can appreciate. I know I did.",

I kept watching this show and it just feels like a otome version of Arslan where theres just more guys being added to her party who are cool and strong and all fall in love with her.\r\nStory- its really straightforward without much depth, there very possibly could be somekind of twist or whatnot at the end but so far its been a bare travel here oh phew we made it hear talk for a bit travel there, occasionally picking up new companions.\\n\\n\r\nArt- Its pretty good\\n\\n\r\nSound- Not much to be said here most modern anime have good sound, the 1st op was meh since the visuals and song didnt match up too well but many people liked it.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters- arent anything special, not unique at all pretty much.\\n\\n\r\nSo it was ok, but nowhere near as good as The Heroic Legend as Arslan and pretty much just made me want to rewatch that.",

Akatsuki no Yona has been on my plan to watch list for so long and I finally watch it. I have no regrets finishing it in one day.\r\nThe story is very beautiful, touching, dramatic, full of mystery and plot twists, romantic and teach us something as well. It's not all about romance between Yona and the guys, but also value of each character's background and actions. Plus, the story is very funny but also give you tears and screamsmany times.\\n\\n\r\nYona, probably is one of the amazing female character ever created. She teaches us how something could change in a blink of an eye and you must survive by struggling from your previous lives. It teaches us girls to be strong even when people say we're weak.\\n\\n\r\nWhat kind of let me down is that the ending is not as impact full as I would imagined. Though it may be continued in the manga but I think that the anime should've choose the right manga chapter as the ending.",

            "content": "Akatsuki no Yona, a.k.a Yona of the Dawn, a.k.a The Girl Standing in the Blush of Dawn.\r\nLike 90% of the anime I've watched, Akatsuki no Yona was a rare gem that I randomly found.\r\nLike needle and the haystack.\r\nExcept the needle was miniscule, and I stepped on it.\r\nBut bleeding for it felt good.\r\nOK, that sounded weird but you have the gist of it.\r\nAmazingly, I've rated all sections 9/10 because of how much I'm in love with it.\r\n*May contain spoilers... oops*\r\n~Story~  (9/10):\r\nThe story begins on beautiful, sunny weather.... Hah, you wish. Long story short, the lovely cousin Su-won, who Princess Yona is in love with (Eww),betrays her and Hak, the lovely general, and kicks them out of the castle with soldiers chasing them. Since the princess lost her silver spoon and after watching her father getting killed right before her eyes, she becomes a marionette. Then some priest shows them the way of life and they go on an adventure finding her dragons.\\n\\n\r\nAnd it is the most awesomest (If that's even a word...) adventure. I don't like weak girls who rely on their super hot bodygaurds just because they said so. No, OK, that's not cool.\\n\r\nThat's not the case with Yona.\\n\r\nTo protect Hak, her newly acquired friends, and herself, she finds the first dragon. \\n\r\nTo free the dragon she cries over, she takes him away as the second dragon.\\n\r\nThe third one is a pervert.\\n\r\nAnd the fourth is.... yeah.\\n\\n\r\nPoint is, during this journey, not only Yona takes up a weapon her father banned and warned her to never touch, she changes from only thinking about herself to thinking about saving her country. I don't know about you, but that's amazing. This season is a world-builder, so that means it's only the beginning. The story is not rushed, it's paced out just fine, and it leaves you with a cliffhanger. \\n\r\nA good one, OK?\\n\\n\r\nReason why I didn't give it full marks, was becuase it was a snail's pace at the beginnning, which is both a bad and good thing.\\n\\n\r\n~Art~ (9/10):\\n\r\nI loved the art. I'm no art critic, so, to be honest, I don't know what to write. \\n\\n\r\n~Sound~ (9/10):\\n\r\nCan an instrumental opening sound soooooo~ good? \\n\r\nI can hardly believe it. \\n\r\nUsually, when I listen to the opening once, I skip it during the rest of it.\\n\r\nNot with this one, nope.\\n\r\nThe second opening, I found was fantastic, not as great as the first, but still great.\\n\r\nI believe there is sub and dub, but I've only fully watched the sub and a tiny bit of dub.\\n\r\nDub was OK.\\n\r\nSub was great.\\n\r\nDon't judge me.\\n\r\nThe instrument stood out for me the most, was the flute. It carried a nice tune, and it made the background music a delight to hear.\\n\\n\r\n~Character~ (9/10):\\n\r\nAs I said before, Yona became a sissy princess, to a badass red-hair. \\n\r\nFor this season, the flashbacks were mainly about Yona, Hak and Su-won's childhood, when they were still best friends. So, I believe, if we are ever gonna get a second season, the dragon's backgrounds will be revealed. Yona goes under a great change; like metamorphosis- a caterpillar to a beautiful butterfly. But it's not enough, I want to see more~.\\n\\n\r\nOh, and I love the four dragons, they are so cute and adorable in their own way.\\n\\n\r\n~Overall~ (9/10):\\n\r\nThis anime has done a great job in mixing seriousness and comedy; you'll laugh when they laugh, and you'll cry when they cry. \\n\r\nThis anime is suited for those who like reverse-harems, little tiny bits of romance, action, fantasy and historical themes.\\n\\n\r\nIt would be no joke to call this one of my favourite animes of all times~\\n\\n\\n",
