            "content": "**This review has a section (highlighted by tags) that contains spoilers.\r\nSakurasou no Pet na Kanojo is a rom-com slice of life anime, so it\u2019s a good watch by default, right? Well, not quite. This genre has a shtick for being oversaturated, particularly with many poor productions. Why should you watch Sakurasou in particular, over the many other rom-com slice of life's? Well, read on to find out.\r\nSakurasou does one thing especially well that makes it stand out among its competitors, and that is its character dynamics. That is an aspect of it that is simply fantastic. As such, this review contains a fairly lengthy discussionof the plot, which I will highlight with spoiler tags.\\n\\n\r\nThe main characters of Sakurasou no Pet na Kanojo are Kanda Sorata, Kamiigusa Misaki, Shiina Mashiro, Aoyama Nanami and Mitaka Jin. Already, Sakurasou can be seen as a highly unique anime. With 5 characters that are all equally important to the story, the audience gets five times the character development than most rom-coms. However, the story technically follows the adventures of Kanda Sorata, who has been banished to Sakurasou (\u201cSakura Hall\u201d) due to the regular school dorms not allowing the keeping of cats. As he cares deeply for his cats, Kanda ends up biting the bullet and chooses to live at Sakurasou. There at Sakurasou, he lives with other would-be delinquents. And so, the relationships between the five characters at Sakurasou would serve as the backbone of this anime\u2019s story. \\n\\n\r\nPresumably, this should already be heaven for any rom-com slice of life lover; after all, there are five main characters and 24 episodes. The real thing that does it for Sakurasou, however, is the romance aspect of the anime. And by \u201cdoing it\u201d, I mean doing a disservice. The romance in this anime is quite horrid, honestly. This is especially hard for me to say as I thoroughly enjoyed literally every single aspect of Sakurasou, except for its romance. \\n\\n\r\nI\u2019m going to be discussing the story in mild detail, so if you don\u2019t want to be spoiled at all, skip to the [endspoiler] tag.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\n**[startspoiler]\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nMy first problem is Misaki\u2019s relationship with Jin. Due to the nature of the anime and the nature of Misaki\u2019s personality itself, her quest for love was simply a joke; I never really took it seriously. Whenever she cried after her numerous failures, I did not feel sympathy for her, nor did I feel emotional as a viewer. Misaki\u2019s love struggles never really had any weight to them, and they even got resolved fairly quickly (as if to further undermine them).\\n\\n\r\nThe other problem: Aoyama and Kanda\u2019s relationship. Oh boy. This relationship single-handedly \u201cruined\u201d Sakurasou for me (not really ruined, but it basically kicked my pairing hopes in the nutsack). I personally rooted for Aoyama and Kanda to get together throughout the series, but man was THAT wishful thinking. Before watching this series, I read many posts touting Sakurasou as being \u201cthe bad kind of predictable\u201d. And I certainly see why now. Right from the first episode, you could already see Shiina x Kanda being established. Them getting all touchy-feely so early on, the sexual innuendos, the peeping moments\u2026 it was all meant to be from the very beginning. So why then, did the writers decide to create a second relationship branch in Aoyama x Kanda? It makes zero sense to me, and Sakurasou\u2019s execution of the pairing itself made just about the same amount of sense. The entire time, Kanda is as blunt as a block while Aoyama is as pitiful as a bug. It was just painful for me to watch Aoyama each time she tried to confess to Kanda. Her constant failures were just really disgusting, and especially so since I\u2019m one of the viewers who prefer Aoyama over Shiina. Not by much, because I do love Shiina as a character, but some preference nonetheless. Aoyama\u2019s unrealized love was truly cringe-worthy; two especially disgusting moments were when she confesses her love, only to play it off as \u201cgood acting\u201d, and when she gave a half-ass confession to Kanda after her audition. Seriously, it\u2019s like the producers were purposely getting my hopes up simply to laugh at me afterwards. Two times, we were supposed to get Aoyama to finally confess to Kanda, and for Kanda to (more than likely) go out with her or reject her. But, we get the worse-case scenario; Aoyama\u2019s love is never realized! As I have said before, the chemistry between Aoyama and Kanda really pissed me off not only due to how poorly it was coordinated but also by how unnecessary it was. The producers did NOT need to include a second girl for Kanda; this isn\u2019t a harem anime. Shiina would have been good enough, and the story could have simply focused on Kanda x Shiina being realized. However, just as this anime put the final nail in the coffin when it came to pissing me off with Aoyama x Kanda, episode 23 came about: the graduation episode. And boy, let me tell you. This was one of the greatest episodes in anime history; I\u2019m just going to say it now. The emotion displayed in this episode by all the characters (students, school staff members, Sakurasou residents included) was simply unreal. This scene does not necessarily make you want to cry. However, you can sense the genuineness within each characters\u2019 sadness, their speeches, and their feelings for each other. Instead of being a giant cheesefest, the producers of Sakurasou actually managed to make the graduation episode an honest-to-goodness emotional episode. And I felt it. However, I found myself asking: \"Why wasn't this the final episode?\"\\n\\n\r\nThe last episode (24) made it seem as if there was still plenty more for Sakurasou to cover. It introduced two new characters, and it was the start of a new year; everything was fresh. We were going to see Kanda and Shiina being isolated from the other main characters for the first time, and maybe even having their relationship furthered. We even got a glimpse of the two new members of Sakurasou, and they are not bad characters in the slightest. All in all, the producers had quite a lot of quality material to work with if they wanted to create another season. So why didn\u2019t they? After I finished watching all 24 episodes of Sakurasou, I was left wanting more. The series didn\u2019t really \u201cend\u201d at all; why start a new chapter if you're just going to cut it off right away? The ending makes no sense to me. You could say that this is a sign that the producers are thinking of a second season, but there hasn\u2019t really been any news yet. It\u2019s just wishful thinking as of now.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\n**[endspoiler]\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nIn every other department, however, Sakurasou excels. \\n\\n\r\nStory [9/10]: Probably the most important aspect of an anime, Sakurasou has an exceptional story. While its romance is admittedly weak, as previously discussed, it doesn\u2019t take much away from the story. There were quite a lot of aspects of Sakurasou that I had a critique for, and yet I found myself excitedly watching every episode regardless. I constantly wanted to find out what would happen next, and I was definitely held in suspense during many moments throughout the anime. The moments of drama, in particular, gave Sakurasou such great depth. \\n\\n\r\nArt [10/10]: One of the absolute KILLER aspects of Sakurasou! The art implements a fairly unique style, using mainly warm and bright colors. Most animes have art that uses colors and shades from a generic palette, which causes them to look to look very similar to each other; Sakurasou strays away from this. All of the characters are drawn nicely, along with all of the minute details in the animations being perfectly executed. However, if there was one thing to really set Sakurasou apart, it\u2019s the art used to portray Shiina Mashiro\u2019s artistic virtuosity. As the viewer, I was able to completely comprehend the extent of Shiina\u2019s skill due to Sakurasou\u2019s magnificent art. Not to mention, whoever drew Shiina\u2019s drawings was quite talented themselves. \\n\\n\r\nSound [10/10]: The only proof I need to verify the greatness of Sakurasou\u2019s soundtrack is the fact that its OPs/EDs are among my top-played songs on my iPod. Initially, I wasn\u2019t really feeling the first opening; it sounded somewhat generic. However, after listening to it multiple times by virtue of watching the anime, I fell in love with it. The openings completely portray the mood of the entire anime (and the openings very cleverly display the fantastic art style, too). The second ending in particular went very nicely with the characters dynamics at that point in the story.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter [10/10]: Sakurasou\u2019s characters truly give it that extra dimension. For a rom-com, all five main characters are surprisingly deep. Throughout the story, we get to learn of all of their backgrounds. What makes them so amazing is the fact that despite vastly contrasting upbringings, all of the Sakurasou residents are accepting of each other. There is never any sense of dislike or resentment among them, and they are all genuine friends. That chemistry between them is what makes them so special to watch. \\n\\n\\n\r\nI thought long and hard about my final rating. Admittedly, there are quite a few problems with Sakurasou, such as its romance. However, for an anime that has left such a huge impact on me, Sakurasou deserves nothing less than a perfect score. Along with other viewers, I have been left wanting more. Few other animes have managed to make me feel this way. And while I was watching it, Sakurasou provided countless laughs and a fair share of quality drama. Never was I bored at any moment while watching the series. The greatest thing about Sakurasou, however, is the fact that it manages to meet and then exceed the standard expectations of a romantic comedy slice-of-life anime; it truly is a fantastic production.  Rarely can anyone recommend an anime of this genre as a must-watch for anime enthusiasts of all kinds, but that is exactly what I\u2019m doing with Sakurasou no Pet na Kanojo.",

            "content": "\"Everyday was the same. Deep down, I felt bored. I wanted to blame someone for my being bored.\" - Kanda Sorata\r\nThe very first line in the anime coming from the protagonist himself. Frankly, I felt exactly the same after watching the first dozen episodes of Sakurasou no Pet na Kanojo. J.C. Staff, a studio which animated numerous titles such as Toradora, Zero no Tsukaima, Toaru Majutsu no Index, now it's Sakurasou no Pet na Kanojo or in English, 'The Pet Girl of Sakurasou'.\r\nStory? Kanda Sorata was told to move to a place called Sakurasou, a dorm where the problem students dwell in. One day, ShiinaMashiro, a genius, moves to the Dorm. And so, Sorata's dorm mates given him the task to take care of Mashiro. So there ya go. You can probably predict the outcome of the show before you even watched it.\\n\\n\r\nSakurasou is a somewhat-more-than-generic romance/comedy anime. So, what are the common features of rom coms? Generic protagonist lives alone, story set in high school, extraordinary female protagonists, transfer students, probability of the transfer student living next door, childhood friends, imoutos having brother complex, beach episodes, protagonist is a chick magnet and lots of other distinctive features. It's those shows where you watch simply because you're too bored. Sakurasou is no exception.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, Sakurasou no Pet na Kanojo is slightly more different than the usual. While it does have most of the features mentioned, but this time the protagonist lives in a dorm, filled with problem students and Sakurasou have a slightly better plot...and I guess that's pretty much it.\\n\\n\r\nSince it's a romance/comedy anime then you're expecting some humor. Regrettably, the \"comedy\" part is appalling. Sakurasou provides the viewer with lots of humor throughout the series, but none of them were hilarious. All in all, Sakurasou fails to be entertaining in terms of humor. \\n\\n\r\nIn most cases, ecchi scenes and fanservice in these kind of anime are tolerable, as long as there are few but if too many, it affects the quality of the show. Indeed, I knew there were going to be ecchi in the series, but Sakurasou has more than expected.\\n\\n\r\nFinally, it's the story. Sakurasou starts off as boring, tiresome, especially the beginning and it may also be the biggest flaw of the anime. Brace yourselves, because boredom strikes very early. The starting episodes may give a bad first impression to the viewer and some may even stop watching the series solely because of that. Sakurasou is one of the few anime I've watched that left a terrible first impression.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, once you've covered the dull early episodes, at one point Sakurasou eventually starts becoming more intriguing later on(if it ever does for you). Personal point of view: I might have enjoyed Sakurasou more if it only had 12 or 13 episodes, not with 24 episodes. Why? for me, it starts becoming more interesting roughly at episode twelve. Some of the characters' past were interesting to watch such as Shiina Mashiro's however the enjoyment only lasted for couple of minutes. Sakurasou did have some memorable moments; both happy and sorrowful, but most of them were in the middle or near the end of the series. Luckily, the ending was pretty decent. Not the best ending I've seen, but still it's ok.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter? I'll show you in a list.\\n\r\nThese are the characters who dwell in Sakurasou Dorm. \\n\r\nScores are out of 5. Lowest(1) being Hated. Highest(5) being Loved.\\n\\n\r\nKanda Sorata:(1/5) Boring male protagonist; essential in most rom coms. Now, only more irritating.\\n\r\nShiina Mashiro*:(3/5) Female protagonist. Neutral.\\n\r\nAoyama Nanami:(3/5) The common tsundere type. I feel sorry for her at the end of the series.\\n\r\nMitaki Jin:(3/5) Looks like he lost his virginity years ago.\\n\r\nKamiigusa Misaki:(2/5) Energetic, noisy type. \\n\r\nAkasaka Ryuunosuke:(3/5) A Hikikomori. \\n\r\nChihiro Sengoku:(3/5) Dorm teacher of Sakurasou.\\n\\n\r\nA couple of supporting characters.\\n\\n\r\nKanda Yuuko:(1/5) She has brother complex. I'm not surprised. Most of the imoutos nowadays have brother complex anyway.\\n\r\nRita Ainsworth:(3/5) Kawashima Ami...is that you?\\n\\n\r\nFrom the list above, any scores below 3 means they're disliked. None of the characters were interesting. Of course, all of the scores above are just my opinion. Though, it's nice to see character development going on.\\n\\n\r\n*In some of the scenes, Shiina Mashiro really reminded me of Akemi Homura, a character which I really love in Madoka Magica. Perhaps the last two episodes of Madoka Magica are simply too memorable...\\n\\n\r\nArt/Visuals? Overall, it's great. Colors are bright and artstyle is gorgeous. Backgrounds are nice and Shiina Mashiro's artwork are incredible.\\n\\n\r\nSound? Voice acting is pretty good(Sorata yelling almost every time is rather aggravating). OP and ED are all J-Pop themed songs and I've only bothered to listen to them once. I do like J-pop songs, but only selected ones. There's some very beautiful background music being played during the sad scenes.\\n\\n\r\nConclusion? Sakurasou no Pet na Kanojo isn't the worst rom com I've watched and its far from being the best. To sum up, it's pretty average, despite the number of flaws it has. Unfortunately, Sakurasou just didn't live up to my expectations. Not even close.",

            "content": "Once in a while, it's nice to be pleasantly surprised. Going into something with a synopsis like Sakurasou, I honestly wasn't expecting much, but the end result was nice way to finish such a great series like this.\r\nKeep in mind this is my first review. I'm not going to dive into why I picked numbers for each category because I find it pretty repetitive, but more strictly my enjoyment and impressions I have towards this anime. So by all means, I'm no expert in anime, I just watch what seems enjoyable for me.\r\nOne of Sakuraou\u2019s most redeeming factors is the atmosphere from the characters/ setting.Sakurasou is not a typical setting like your group of friends or a school club. Our setting is that of Sakurasou, a rather different dorm that is home to individuals that are quite \u201cunique\u201d yet extremely talented. However, it\u2019s in this sense that Sakurasou offers a large and diverse, and while rather clich\u00e9, cast that provides a lot of depth and humor. \\n\\n\r\nMost noteworthy is our oblivious and rather emotionless female lead Mashiro, who brings the concept of a girl who has for all her life painted pictures and has no clue how to take care of herself. Her character overall works well with the over exaggerated actions of the male lead in charge of her, Sorata, and provides a humorous dynamic that many slice of lifes lack. The many other residents also play a vital role in this series, ranging from the tsundere friend who also likes Sorata, Nanami, to the random, jubilant, and talented animator Misaki. All of these characters complement the duo rather well, and are accompanied with their own meaningful back stories.\\n\\n\r\nSo by reading this far, it seems all this anime would have a rather shallow plot with the normal clich\u00e9 characters. That\u2019s where I was largely surprised by this anime. I was fearful of this anime just in the sense that it had 24 episodes, which always suffers from pointless fillers that deters viewers from watching it. However, this anime is unique in the sense that it juggles many different ideas and maintains it well.\\n\\n\r\nAlthough the first three episodes were quite slow and lacked much plot movement, episode four was one of these first indicators that showed that even a show like this can have depth, and displayed drama and development that some series take 12 episodes/finales to reach. The introduction of Sorata\u2019s ambitions at the start to be a game maker contrasts beautifully with Mashiro\u2019s brilliance. While Sorata faces the hardships and realities of being a newbie game maker, Mashiro eases her way to the top as new manga artist. And Sorata experiences those feelings of when somebody is better than you.\\n\\n\r\nJealously. Hatred. Frustration.\\n\\n\r\nI found it to be quite relatable and understandable. Does one give up if they can\u2019t be successful at something? Or is there something beyond failure? Many of the characters of this series meet this question and ask themselves the same thing.\\n\\n\r\nSakurasou\u2019s pacing is pretty solid, allowing it to nail its melodrama while also maintaining its comedic feeling. While I\u2019m not a huge fan for melodrama because it\u2019s always overdone and cheesy, I felt a lot of drama in Sakurasou was on-level and believable. The balance of comedy and drama, switching from serious moments to ones full of sexual innuendos and jokes, really helped the pacing out. The comedy is revolved around the character\u2019s personalities, so if you have a liking towards all the characters, you\u2019ll enjoy the sexual and awkward moments of Sorata and Mashiro or the embarrassing outburst of Nanami.\\n\\n\r\nAs you would expect, you\u2019re going to have your moments of fan service and perhaps overdramatic moments to the point where it\u2019s silly, but I don\u2019t think it really deters the series as a whole. Yes, sometimes the fan service is a bit silly and unneeded, but as long as we\u2019re not getting panty shots every 5 minutes, it doesn't affect the series as a whole. As the series progresses into a more serious mood, the quite attractive scenes of Mashiro fade out (sorry if you enjoy them). And yes, Mashiro is a love and hate character. If you hate her, you probably won\u2019t like this series.\\n\\n\r\nEnd result? Something that catches you off guard. A romance comedy with a unique feel that truly hits home. Great atmosphere of characters and cast, and solid pacing that intertwines comedy and drama. If you\u2019re a romance comedy fan, by all means watch this if you want something with a change of pace.\\n\\n\r\nSakurasou no pet na Kanojo was quite the ride and I\u2019ll sincerely miss this series. Even though it won\u2019t happen, I\u2019d love a season 2.\\n\\n\r\nThanks for reading my block of text, and if you survived this far, please leave any comments or criticism on my profile so I can improve my future reviews.",

            "content": "\"Over the last three years here at Sui High, I've made many dear friends. And what allowed me to meet them... was a student dorm called Sakurasou.\" - Misaki\r\nThe Pet Girl of Sakurasou. When I first read the little summary of it on MAL I got the horrible feeling in my stomach it would be very sexually forward with a lot of fan service and very little plot/char. development. I thank God today that I'm terrible at guessing plots to anime, and I will take this second to simply say \"I apologize\" to the writer for having low expectations. Because I could not have possiblybeen more wrong.\\n\\n\r\nThis story is about a group of what I can only describe as misfit geniuses. These are the rejects of the school, and at the same time some of the most artistically gifted students at Sui High. For various reasons, be it financial or social, they each have ended up in the cheapest and fairly rundown Co-Ed dorm at the school, Sakurasou. Kouhai (The main male protagonist) was forced to move into the dorm after he tried to take care of a stray cat he found, however dorm regulations forbid him to keep it unless he moved. So of course, he decided to move until he could \"find another owner for it\". However, by the time the show opens up on the present at the start of out story, rather than him making any progress, he has actually taken in like... 10 more cats. As I said, so at the open of the show Chihiro sensei (runs the dorm) asks Kouhai to go pick up a transfer student who will be moving into Sakurasou. That transfer student is none other than the beautiful, quiet, legendary artist Mashiro. He comes to find out she is essentially incapable of taking care of herself on her own, so in the same nature as his cats, he takes on the responsibility of being on \"Mashiro duty\". \\n\r\nThe misfits have many little adventures and antics and overcome many trials during their time at Sakurasou.  As time passes friendships form and grow, bonds grow stronger, fights, love, tears, all come into play among the six friends of Sakurasou. \\n\\n\r\nNow Ill do that thing where you separate it into sections\\n\\n\r\nArt\\n\r\nActually, even though I'm not big on being able to tell huge differences and intricate details between different anime, this show's art really stood out. It felt smooth, clean, and beautiful. I daresay it was made to look so as to reflect the fact that they are all artistic students in their various fields, to match the level of beauty they themselves can create. The only other anime I know of with animation better than this would be Nagi no Asakura. So that's pretty darn good. I appreciated the high quality.\\n\\n\r\nMusic, Sound\\n\r\nNot a pro on music, I can basically tell you whether I \\n\r\n1. Liked the OP and ED. (I really did)\\n\r\nand\\n\r\n2. thought the music distracted me from the show or helped to amplify it. (It blended well and I liked it just fine. Nothing to report back negative on.\\n\\n\r\nStory Quality/ Why I Enjoyed It\\n\\n\r\nThis has to be one of the best stories of friendship and love I've ever seen. Now when I say love I mean it in a universal way. Not JUST romantic love, although there is plenty of that. I mean also the love between friends. Best friends. Think of a friend of yours who is the absolute most important friend you don't want to have to be without. Now take six of y'all and go live in a dorm together. That's in essence what you have here. The plot was paced very well, nothing happened too quick or too slow. The pain and struggles each character went through had me feeling like I was right there struggling with them. Is that not a powerful thing? When a story can draw you in so much that when something big happens, whatever it may be, it has the power to make you FEEL emotion. And no I'm not talking about \"man I'm so pissed the plot went in this direction\". No... I'm talking about when you see a character get their heart broken, you feel for them, you cry with them. It's really not easy for an anime to do that. But for me, this did. \\n\r\nI'm telling you, Misaki's graduation speech TORE ME UP (that means it made me cry).\\n\\n\r\nClosing Thoughts\\n\r\nI highly recommend this show to anyone who loves a good story about the bond between friends. And young love. This show is as funny as it is sad, as it is heartwarming as it is beautiful. \\n\\n\r\nHats off to Sakurasou no Pet na Kanojo.\\n",

            "content": "So, just to get this out of the way, Sakurasou no Pet na Kanojo is a high school, romantic comedy drama based off the light novels of the same name whose main draw comes from the characters and how they interact with each other. To be completely honest, when I first heard about Sakurasou no Pet na Kanojo before it even aired, I fully expected it to be a \u201cweird-girl harem comedy\u201d, and the first couple episodes really did nothing to change that opinion. However, as the show progressed, I found that I never could have been more wrong.\r\nThe story revolves around Kanda Sorata, asecond-year in high school who gets sent to Sakurasou because he took in and cared for a cat in the normal dorms (which is not allowed, obviously). Sakurasou is an old boarding house where the \u201cloonies\u201d of the school reside and there is a myth among the student body that once you get sent to Sakurasou, you can never return to the normal dorms. Sorata just sees this as a temporary phase and vows to get out of Sakurasou as soon as possible by getting someone to adopt the cat he found but, he soon finds that the eccentric residents of Sakurasou begin to grow on him. The comedy within the series focuses mostly on the Japanese style of comedy called \u201cmanzai\u201d (look it up if you're curious) and at times the comedy can be pretty funny but it can get stale after a while. The story is, in my eyes, really just a stage to set up the interactions between the characters but, that is not to say it is bad- it has some interesting twists to it. Indeed, I particularly enjoyed the story and the way things played out but, I will say something outright and that is: Sakurasou no Pet na Kanojo is not all smiley-faces and rainbows. The anime has a theme of cruel, harsh realism and not everything goes peachily for the cast but, when things did go right, I felt the very same happiness, relief, and triumph the characters felt. To put it simply, the story is an enjoyable emotional roller coaster ride where I somehow felt connected to the characters as though I was with them for the ride.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters in Sakurasou are the main draw of the anime, and there are an equal number of \u201cnormal\u201d characters to \u201cweird\u201d or \u201cgenius\u201d characters. From the uncontrollable and wild Misaki to the recluse Ryuunosuke, each character is unique and feels as though they \u201cbelong\u201d amongst the cast. That is to say, none of the main cast of characters are one-dimensional and each have their own back-story and motivations; they're not just characters thrown in randomly for effect and best of all, they feel like real (strange) people. By the end, I really got a feel for how the characters act and feel, and why they do so in the first place. As I mentioned above, I felt connected to the characters and cared for them; whatever happened to the characters in the anime- all of them- affected me, whether it was the bitterness of defeat or the joy of sweet victory.\\n\\n\r\nThe art and animation in Sakurasou is good but is generally nothing spectacular or over-the-top. The one exception, however, is Mashiro's art which is often pretty amazing, befitting her status as a world-renowned artist. While I didn't particularly like the back-ground music, openings, or endings too much, I didn't think that they were bad; they fit the anime well and the transitions into the ending themes were often smooth. The voice acting is pretty good overall and accurately displays how the characters are feeling moment to moment, which is pretty amazing in Mashiro's case since she is usually dull and monotone. I particularly enjoyed Nanami's quirk of lapsing into Osaka dialect at times and, with my limited knowledge of what the Japanese language sounds like, it never sounded fake or too forced. One last thing to mention is the anime often makes references other things, in particular to Toradora! with the Palm-top Tiger design showing up consistently. Like Sakurasou, Toradora! was also produced by J.C. Staff.\\n\\n\r\nSo, to sum it up, Sakurasou no Pet na Kanojo is an enjoyable emotional roller coaster with interesting characters and is an anime that I would recommend to just about anyone who enjoys romantic comedies or dramas. To be completely honest, I often waited on watching episodes rather than watch them right when they came out because, at times, I was afraid the drama would be overbearing but, in the end, I didn't really find anything I really disliked about this anime and I felt the package as a whole was delivered excellently.\\n\\n\r\n9 out of 10",

            "content": "Sakurasou no Pet na Kanojo is an artistic anime that blends together a colorful array of different anime themes. There's plenty of comedy, school romance, a loveable cast, emotional dramatic scenes, and... cute girls. These themes unfold into the grand events within and without the walls of Sakurasou.\r\nSakurasou tells the story of a basic, bland-haired male who has to take care of a genius, empty-headed bishoujo. Around him are fellow Sakurasou members, friends, family, and enemies. OK, maybe not that last one. The story isn't groundbreaking, but what it unfolds into is what makes Sakurasou a bit better than average.\r\nSince the story is set ina school setting, there isn't much Sakurasou brings to the table. I'll admit Sakurasou does a neat job at forming arcs that are unparalleled, though only a handful of them are remotely interesting.\\n\\n\r\nSakurasou's strongest trait lies within the cast. The main and supporting cast blended well; sometimes I would forget that some characters were not main characters. There were a plethora of quote-worthy scenes, such as Mashiro Shiina's \"I belive in pantsu\" quote.  It was a pleasure to observe the many different interests and character flaws collide together like one big painting. Many of the characters' decisions were heavily influenced by their relationships with others, which sets the ground for its drama. The cast consists of a seiyuu-to-be with a dialect, a shut-in computer wiz, a crazy, perverted senpai, and... a basic, bland-haired male with a boring personality.\\n\\n\r\nThe artwork for Sakurasou is simply pretty. The character models are all very appealing, and the backgrounds complement the vivid artsy themes of Sakurasou. In terms of music, the first OP is bouncy, while the ED is catchy. The latter OP and ED are also beautiful songs, and match the drama fairly well.\\n\\n\r\nThe voice cast did a fantastic job. Kiyano Ai as expressionless Mashiro Shiina, Nakatsu Mariko as dialect-heavy Aoyama Nanami, and Takamori Natsumi as the playful Kamiigusa Misaki were splendid. Their voice work, along with the other voice actors/actresses just added to the already delightful cast.\\n\\n\r\nSakurasou had a handful of flaws, however. It should be noted that the latter, dramatic half of the season was mediocre at best. The drama felt forced often times, and was boring to watch after the ground was laid out. The notion of having a pet girl at Sakurasou seemed to have been dropped in the latter half as well; stories of taking care of Shiina are all overwritten with the dramatic romance. Some of the characters developed way too late, or didn't really develop at all. Others seemed to pop out of the sky (Akasaka Ryuunosuke). Unfortunately, these character development flaws fell onto a majority of the main cast, especially Mashiro Shiina.\\n\\n\r\nAnother glaring problem is the bland story to Sakurasou. It certainly grasped the nichijou (daily life) of students with career goals, but it didn't do so in a way that made the viewer feel compelled to care. It's great to see students try hard for their dreams, but it isn't entertaining, especially in Sakurasou's case. The backstory presented for a number of the main cast did a poor job of drawing sympathy for their cause (at least for me, anyways).\\n\\n\r\nDespite Sakurasou's many problems, it still stands as a satisfactory anime. It's a fairly fun watch, but unfortunately, it does not stand out very well. The story is adequate, the cast is up to par, and the overall execution ranges from suitable (first half) to mediocre (latter half). Sakurasou isn't exceptional, but I would say it is a tad above average. Sakurasou no Pet na Kanojo does not pass with many flying colors; it only passes with a few.",

            "content": "From all the Slice of Life, Romantic Comedy last year I've seen, Sakurasou no Pet na Kanojo was by far the best.\r\nBut that in of it self doesn't say much about the Quality of the show, does it?\r\nLet me first sum up my overall impression/emotions with the show.\r\nI laughed.\r\nI cringed.\r\nI was touched.\r\nI felt connected.\r\nAnd I recommended it despite it being just another JC Staff School Anime.\r\nWhy?\r\nThat's what I'm going to explain to you now.\r\nStory:\r\nThe plot revolves around a young male named Sorata Kanda who is attending an art school. He has the habit of picking up cats and caring for them. His dorm though doesn'tallow pets, that's why he moves to Sakurasou the dorm for trouble students.\\n\r\nEarly on he is tasked to keep an eye out for a talented girl (Mashiro) who has trouble of dealing with everyday tasks and socializing with people, but otherwise is a genius artist.\\n\\n\r\nThe premise sound generic at first. A ordinary highschool boy meets mysterious girl. But it goes far beyond that. The story revolves around the problematic of overcoming your own jealousy.\\n\r\nHow to continue doing what you do, even though you find yourself in a world where there is always someone better than you.\\n\\n\r\nI personally felt really attached to this concept since it is something that drags me down often as well. I gave up on many things because more talented people stepped into my life. It's hard to struggle with the hatred that occurs inside you when you deal with these people.\\n\\n\r\nAbout the event that happen otherwise isn't much to say. We have a lot of fanservice, comedic situations, a lot of drama and also some romance.\\n\r\nThe pacing is rather slow since it turns more serious later in the show, which is sad since a lot of people might have given up by then with the overall generic-ness of the show.\\n\r\nBut we get a lot more later on.\\n\r\nRomance, Drama and a rather satisfying and mature ending.\\n\\n\r\nOverall the Story isn't particular deep or anything but well founded and relateable.\\n\\n\r\n6/10\\n\\n\r\nAnimation:\\n\\n\r\nWhat can I say about Sakurasou... well it does look average. There is no crazy choreography or battle scenes. No amazing fluidity. But it has an overall nice artstyle.\\n\r\nLight colors, very warm, many oranges and reds were used. The backgrounds looked good but not outstanding.\\n\r\nThe character designs, though generic \"moe\" were well made and distinct.\\n\r\nI personally liked them.\\n\r\nThe quality was overall good and kept its standards.\\n\r\nAnd that's it.\\n\r\nSakurasou is not an animation-heavy show. It doesn't rely too much on fancy visuals but also looks pretty and modern.\\n\\n\r\n7/10\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\\n\r\nAs voiceactors we get... *drumroll*\\n\\n\r\nYoshitsugu Matsuoka; aka Kirito from Sword Art Online.\\n\r\nThis is a hit or miss, if he bothers you because you didn't like him in SAO well.. but bad.\\n\r\nI personally like Matsuoka, he is a fresh new voice talented and gives the Beta Male MC of this area a different voice than Kaji Yuki...\\n\\n\r\nBesides that I didn't find anyone particular outstanding but mention able would be Mariko Nakatsu, for voicing a voice actress. Must be weird hah!\\n\r\nThe rest did a good job. The voiceacting is modern and natural overall.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is fitting but not rememberable. It just works with this type of show, has a good variety but isn't the kind of music I'd listen to outside the show.\\n\\n\r\nThe same is true for the Opening and Ending. Though the second ending had a nice beginning which was sometimes used effectively.\\n\\n\r\nSound isn't really the strongest Point of Sakurasou but also not bad in any way.\\n\\n\r\n5,5/10 ~ 5/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\\n\r\nOh boy, I could say a lot about the characters, but I try to keep it short.\\n\\n\r\nLets start with the good.\\n\r\nSorata Kanda starts off as a submissive beta male as we all know them from various school anime. But later becomes more depths. He by far was the most interesting character of the show because he dealt with the crushing feeling of failing and dealing with someone who doesn't fail. His overall nice personality is questioned many times by a dark and cruel side of him he internally fights.\\n\r\nHe often snaps and shows real human emotions, and behavior.\\n\r\nWhile the rest also starts of as your typical school rom-com cast:\\n\r\n - The childhood friend who is in love with the MC and also is a tsundere\\n\r\n - the emotionless girl that also has some weird crush on the MC\\n\r\n - the genki oppai girl always up (but here sometimes down)\\n\r\n - the gigolo/perverted friend. though more on the mature end\\n\r\n - and all the other side characters you can think of\\n\r\nBut everyone of them shows in the progression of the show real problems, and crisis.\\n\r\nOf course you have to deal with stereotypes for the most part, but they are overall a good relatable cast, which have their flaws and never feel too one sided.\\n\\n\r\nIt's also funny how characters become more likable the further the show progresses. It is evidence of character progression.\\n\r\nSomeone who has seen many Rom-Coms in his life might probably not open up to them, but for people who are fairly new to the genre they are a great cast!\\n\\n\r\n 8/10\\n\\n\r\nValue:\\n\\n\r\nThough there might be a second season I doubt it will. A rewatch is also unlikely, but not impossible.\\n\r\nI do recommend this show though, and I already did!\\n\\n\r\nI will keep this anime for a while in the back of my mind but it wasn't anything life changing. Though for 2012 it was one of the better shows.\\n\r\nIt's also nice to see that JC Staff does something that isn't just meh and Light Novels are not all shit (SAO).\\n\r\nBut personally I like LN and their adaptations for the most part.\\n\r\nBut to be honest. With all these School anime they have one flaw.\\n\r\nThe likelihood this will have any effect on the industry or might be something regarded a gem in anime later is very low.\\n\r\nThat's why it can only get a ...\\n\\n\r\n2/10 (but this does not include my enjoyment!)\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\\n\r\nI fairly enjoyed the show. It looked nice, but not outstanding, the soundtrack was fitting and the Voiceactors did a good job.\\n\r\nThe premise and plot was interesting, and the character drama meaningful enough to be taken seriously.\\n\r\nWell but with all of these shows it never exceeds to be really serious, which is okay!\\n\r\nI had fun, was looking forward to next episodes even if I sometimes was raging over some things like once...\\n\\n\r\n\"I modified your post [sakurasou forum link to my post], because it was offensive and contained too much profanity.\"\\n\\n\r\nThat was me raging hard. Something that meant I took the show serious enough.\\n\\n\r\n7/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall I give this show a 6/10 because it manages to be above average and was entertaining as well as gave me some insight on my own personal feelings. Nothing deep or life changing but a nice take on something we probably all once felt.\\n",

Nearly every previous review for this shit has been a 10. Is there something I missed while watching this? Seriously, what's so amazing about it?\r\nSo characters: you got your generic numbnuts male protagonist who's usually too fuckin' scared to say what he really means, a schizophrenic or something, a generic tsundere, the generic sex-crazed pervert character, and some other annoying chick. Sounds great already!\r\nThe setting: 1700's France? No, fuck you, it's a school. What did you expect?\r\nOk, to befair, it's more of like a special arts school or something, but it's still, nonetheless, a school.\\n\\n\r\nSo what is this show about? I dunno, friendship? The wonders of growing up? Fuck, if I know. All I know is that this did NOT need to be made into 24 episodes. What was the point of it all? The main plot can be easily summarized quickly:\\n\\n\r\n>guy lives with crazy people\\n\r\n>girl comes to live with crazy people and becomes the guy's friend\\n\r\n>fanservice\\n\r\n>another girl notices and gets upset\\n\r\n>she comes and lives with them\\n\r\n>occasional bullshit argument\\n\r\n>cousin or whoever comes to take first girl away\\n\r\n>doesn't\\n\r\n>happy ending?\\n\\n\r\nDid that really need to go on for 24 episodes? Does everyone who enjoy this actually think this is a good plot? Am I really missing something? (No, fuck your useless bullshit subplots)\\n\\n\r\nMaybe I wouldn't be so pissed about this if it wasn't so long and everyone would shut up about it. So many times, people have this on their top 10 romance anime lists and I just don't believe it. What's to like about this?\\n\\n\r\nTwo more notable things that pissed me off:\\n\r\n1. At times, this shit really felt like a harem and I personally despise harems.\\n\r\n2. The main protagonists announce their love at the very end. It's misery. You watched the show for an accumulated 12 hours, and all you get in return is some sappy bullshit. It's not worth it. It's never worth it.\\n\\n\r\nThey say the journey is better than the destination, but not if the journey is equally bullshit. This was a waste of time, a forgettable experience, and I have absolutely nothing to show for it. I'm upset to have seen this..",

            "content": "Sakurasou.... where to start. I am a huge sucker for romantic school kind of animes but MANY times I was unable to find the right kind of anime. There were many many animes which just got dull and boring straight from the start. But Sakurasou had me captivated and eager which made me wait every week for the new episode to come out. I even wanted to learn Japanese just so I could watch this anime raw!!!! (Which means i get too watch it faster :D) This anime, like many kinds of anime had its up and downs. And it was these ups and downsmaking me eager to see how they would solve such relationship problems.\\n\\n\r\nGreat Romantic school genres like I have mentioned before was something that was very hard for me to find. When I read this animes summary I can't deny that I wasn't very tempted to begin watching this anime. But i persevered and I am very glad I did. I felt like god had shined the internet light of faith on me when i stumbled upon this anime. I practically screamed HALLEJUAH!\\n\\n\r\nStory: For me this was the biggest thing that dragged me into this anime. The title ''Sakurasou no Pet na Kanojo'' translated to english just means the pet girl of Sakurasou. The ''pet girl'' is none other than Mashiro Shinna the genius painter who is BEAUTIFFFULLLL. But she totally can't look after herself. That's where the main character comes on. Sorata Kanda just your average high schooler who has the job of looking after Shiina. You can tell that these two characters themselves just scream DRAMA at your face. And what good drama it was. It had me crying with the characters and sometimes had me screaming at them like WHY U SO DUMB. The relationship between Mashiro and Sorata was also quite a sight. Still all in all this had me hooked like a fish and I am very glad I saw this anime to the end. I GIVE THE STORY A 10!!!!\\n\\n\r\nArt: This anime had very beautiful visuals. It could portray the characters emotion perfectly and this helped the story so much. The characters were well drawn and the art was light. But dark as well when it needed to be. The art all around was good- wait GREAT. I felt that at some points the art did lack a bit but all in all I couldn't have wished for anything better. I HEREBY GIVE THE ART A 9!!!!\\n\\n\r\nSound: This was also an excellent part of the anime. The intro song was very catchy and although I skip many animes intro songs I wouldn't even think of doing that for this one. The music throughout the anime was also great. It helped with all the moods, light and dark. I felt that the music helped give the viewers a more emotion in the story. The voice acting of all the characters were SPECTACULAR. Mashiro's bored and emotionless voice could not have been better portrayed. All the characters had great voices and I applaud all the voice actors for that. The end song of this anime was also very catchy. Not much I can say about that hahaha. AND THUS I GIVE THE SOUND/MUSIC/VOICE A 10!!!!\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: The characters were also one of the parts that made Sakuraso stand out to me. In some people's eyes the character's may seem to be one of those well used cliche type of characters. A talented but social-lacking girl, an absolute normal high schooler, a loud, funny sempai, wise old playboy, shut in technical genius and the seemingly uninteresting but is actually interesting teacher. All these kinds of characters may have been used in many kinds of animes but I felt that Sakurasou was one of the only ones who actually used them to their fullest potential. I don't see any other animes out there with this much potential. If you can find some them I'd be glad to have a watch. CHARACTER. SCORE. A. 10!!!!\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: I will just go out and say it but I give this animes enjoyment level a 10. Why? Because this is one of those animes that I find hard to put off. It had me hanging off my chair waiting for each new episode too come out. And having finished this anime I fear that another romantic anime of this potential may not come for another 5000 years...\\n\\n\r\nSo anyways overall I enjoyed this anime immensely and I hope you readers of this boring review can find a few seconds... Or a minute... Or a hour... Or a day... Actually a couple of days if u watch it little by little, in your important schedule to watch this delightful anime. OVERALL I GIVE THIS ANIMES OVERALL SCORE A.......... 10!!!!",

            "content": "Well, I don't normally go out of my way to write reviews.\r\nBut wow...\r\nThis show deserves it.\r\nWithin the first four minutes or so I thought this anime was going to be typical Harem or some annoying romance that attempts to sway you by overly cliche one-liners and pompous ass shots, but oh how was I wrong.\r\n**NO SPOILERS**\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nStory: \r\nThe story is unique in this anime because it does something that I really don't see very often in literature these days.\r\nIts actually a generally sad story, but the reason its sad isn't because of stream that which guides the plot; i.e., war, death, dystopia, anarchy, evil tyrant, etc.,but more so the realism that reflects in how the characters develop around one another.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime really sheds light on the unspoken feelings that revolve consistently in any given relationship; Jealousy, Envy, Heartbreak, etc, but the best of it is that its not delivered to us the way a typical Shoujo would; using extras, realization characters, stereotypical events (The beach, Vacationing) to push the relationship forth. In fact, the relationship is merely a catalyst for the primary conflict WITHIN the main character that is that he must breach the revelation that is his true aspirations and goals in his life.\\n\\n\r\nAnother great thing about this anime is that the story isn't ENTIRELY about the relationship. Its about friendship, and the coalition of people gathering together and forming bonds that help bring unite them. For lack of a better phrase, you essentially watch a family be created right before your very eyes.\\n\\n\r\nAnd let me tell you, its truly heartwarming scene indeed.\\n\\n\r\nRating: 10.\\n\r\ntl;dr:\\n\r\nFriendship oriented. Romance is not the 100% primary story element. Realistic scenarios. Realistic characters. Self-Realization. Failure.\\n\\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\\n\r\nIt guess it goes without saying that the art in this show is phenomenal. Then again, it seems almost ridiculous to even have to mention this statistic nowadays. Being that this is a modern anime, the technology used to develop this piece of work couldn't be anything less than perfect.\\n\\n\r\nFrom a cinematographic standpoint, it was perhaps twenty-five frames a second. \\n\\n\r\nThe scenes are well choreographed to invoke particular emotions or thoughts at a particular scene. The lighting was realistic and pleasant to watch, details fell down to a simple swaying tree to present that the wind was breezing by. Sakura petals streamed in the luminosity of their stellar backdrops. Clouds, buildings, shadows, toning, glitter, facial expressions - everything seemed to present itself beautifully.\\n\\n\r\nChibi moments are gloriously prepared and orchestrated in comic situations and were not overused. \\n\\n\r\nRating: 10.\\n\r\ntl;dr:\\n\r\nIts a modern anime. If you don't like the art, you need to see an optometrist.\\n\\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\\n\r\nWhen rating sound I always find it necessary to comment on the voice actors work. Of the array of characters, I was definitely satisfied with all of the voices portrayed. Even accents and slang was correctly articulated by the actors. No one seemed too annoying or too bitter. The characters were well delivered to the audience.\\n\\n\r\nSecondly, the OST is an excellent mix of both tragically sad and joyously happy music, the orchestration reflecting the scenes and attitudes of the given characters. It was honestly well made, and I have little argument against them. \\n\\n\r\nThe various ending themes and opening themes were easily rememberable and had a gleaming feeling to it.\\n\\n\r\nRating: 10.\\n\r\ntl;dr:\\n\r\nAcoustic. Piano. Depressing yet Joyful. Excellent voice acting.\\n\\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\\n\r\nThis anime has a bit of everything. The diversity of the characters gives a bit of something to love in everyone. You have your stereotypical nerd, the glossy white haired innocent, the childhood friend clinging to romance with the male lead, the overly eccentric genius girl and her loyal companion side kick. Sakurasou no Pet na Kanojo certainly has a little bit of everything.\\n\\n\r\nBut what stunned me enough to give this a such a high rating was that the characters were surprisingly dynamic and realistic in how they acted, given their roles. \\n\\n\r\nPerseverance through strength and friendship became the overwhelming theme of the story, and the characters somehow all coordinated around one another and aided each other in their quest to realize themselves and their futures.\\n\\n\r\nThe romance aspect is somewhat of a skewed triangle. While it is blatantly obvious that Shiina and Sorata are destined for one another, Aoyama still attempts at the boy, so as to give off the perspective of insecurity that she holds within herself. This helps her when she transitions to maturity, and once again reflects the overwhelming principle that friendship prevails.\\n\\n\r\nRating: 10\\n\r\ntl;dr:\\n\r\nNot too dramatized. Simple yet complex. Realistic. Love affairs. Friendship.\\n\\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\\n\r\nComments regarding enjoyment lie in the principle that this anime is not directed towards those that are eagerly looking for some Shoujo Romance, or some outstanding moral conclusion about life.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime is carefree, yet it breathes through the seemingly minor conflicts that arising during adolescence that truly impact the entity of our lives. It brushes upon realistic issues about growing up and realizing that the world is larger than yourself. \\n\\n\r\nI honestly couldn't stop tuning in every Monday to watch this show. It had a pleasant mixture of comedy and seriousness that left me satisfied to the core.\\n\r\nRating: 10\\n\r\ntl;dr:\\n\r\nIt was a fun experience, and a proper message.\\n\\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\\n\r\nI would find it insulting to the author if I rating this anything less than a masterpiece. While there were things that seemed overly done and a bit exaggerated, a grand majority of this anime was flawless.\\n\\n\r\nIts a shame that there are so little of these \"oh so perfect\" diamonds out there.\\n\\n\r\nIf you don't like this anime, I would honestly like you to PM me with your reasoning because you need to be enlightened.\\n\\n\r\nRating 10.\\n\r\ntl;dr:\\n\r\nStellar anime\\n\r\nGreat message. Great Art. Great soundtrack. Excellent Characters. Lasting appeal.\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Every journey begins with the first step.\r\nSakurasou no Pet na Kanojo (also known as The Pet Girl of Sakurasou) is an anime series based off the light novel with a manga adaptation also written in the works by Hajime Kamoshida. The story tells of a group of young people and details the lives of them, especially Sorata Kanda the main protagonist who recently got kicked out of his school dorm after picking up a stray cat. Thus, he moves to the Sakurasou dormitory where he meets Mashiro Shiina, a strange girl with a very talented skill.\r\nThus, let his new life begin!\r\nThe story of the seriesis quite lighthearted to say the least, even judging by the title. We have two main protagonists - Mashiro Shiina and Sorata Kanda who shares a very strange relationship. Although beautiful, Mashiro is known to be a very peculiar girl with a talented skill in her skills of crafting artwork. However, she also has absolutely no knowledge about common sense or the factors of daily life. Now, raise your hand! Do you want to live with a beautiful girl like that? Perhaps some might be but in Kanda's case, it's literally hell for him. Waking up every day and seeing a beautiful girl like Mashiro may sound like a dream come true for any guy but it's a lot harder for Mashiro than he'll ever imagine. It usually spells out for misunderstandings, drama, and situations that puts Sorata at frustration.\\n\\n\r\nThe way they meet is quite expected based on the common gags and tropes we see in the anime industry today. They meet in a park of joy and prosperity. The duo lives in the same dorm, eats the same food, but are totally opposites in terms of their personalities and ways of life. For one thing, it's up to Sorata to wake up every day and take care of her. It's like a master and pet relationship in the sense that Sorata Kanda plays the role of the caretaker. On the other hand, Mashiro is the \u201cpet girl\u201d of Sakurasou, as the title says. It's pretty generic but at the same time pleasant to watch because the two's relationship and the depth of how the duo interacts on several episodes. It is also surprisingly entertaining in the way of Mashiro's speech pattern in which her brutal honesty often is (and humorously most of the time) is misinterpreted by other characters.\\n\\n\r\nOh but that's just the tip of the iceberg. As some may expect, the Sakurasou dorm has more than just these two residents. Among some of the other members includes Sorata's classmate, Nanami Aoyama who portrays the typical tsundere and insecure girl. Often times, she treats Sorata harshly but deep down cares for him and the others. At the same time, it's quite easy to tell that she is insecure regarding her own future in the voice acting industry. Furthermore, it seems that the interactions between Sorata and Mashiro has put her mind under a bit of frustration of seeing them together. It's no surprise that she is the character who plays the rival in a potential love triangle of the story.\\n\\n\r\nThe other characters also portrays the typical gags in this anime. We have the all enthusiastic and sometimes crazy girl, Misaki who is hyperactive in the things she do. We have the smooth talking Jin Mitaka who is known for being a womanizer with his smooth talking skills but at the same time deeply cares for his friends. Then, there's the other characters such as the trap Ryunosuke who specializes in his techno gadgets. Also, let's not forget about Rita who used to be Mashiro's caretaker but at the same time feels a sort of resentment and jealousy towards her. All of these characters plays a sort of role in the development in the story especially in regarding Sorata and Mashiro. In fact, it's easy to see how much they come just half way into the series. At the same time though, it's clear that these two still need a bit of development to forge a more solid relationship especially with some rages issues from Sorata.\\n\\n\r\nAs mentioned before, Mashiro is a girl who lacks common sense. Yet upon closer examination, she can quite an appealing character. The series often portrays her as a typical dumb blonde in terms of common sense. However, she is very caring for her friends and tries her best to earn the respect and love of everyone. Mashiro is also quite hardworking with her works by slaving all day and night on her manga and strives to not give up especially when she knows that there are others who inspires her to become what she wants to be. In a generic show such as this, it is surprising that we can see how far some characters can become with hard work, determination, and friends.\\n\\n\r\nThe show isn't totally perfect though as some of the gags used between each episode becomes repetitive and sometimes, overused. The fan service is present that sometimes appears out of random and is nothing more than nonsense. Most of the time, this falls under Mashiro's case and in the morning time when Sorata gets a surprise wake up call. In other cases, the dialogues that Mashiro speaks becomes exaggerated and forced. It's almost if the directors are trying to mix in too many things at once and sometimes, it just doesn't work out right. For example, the seemingly filler episode involving Sorata's little sister Yuuko seems to play little to no role in the overall progression of the story. She just seems to be another common gag added to the entire series. So now, they wanted to add the little sister type with all the other casts. Seriously, what?...\\n\\n\r\nLuckily though, there is hope for the series as some fans who originally thought this might be a harem is downplayed. In fact, the romance so far is quite lighthearted and non-explicit.The romance is almost humorous with the characters playing the roles in their shoes. With enthusiasm , shallowness, misunderstanding, or just being there, the romance of the series is surprisingly fun to look at.\\n\\n\r\nIn my mind, I found the artwork of the series to cute. The designs of the characters is lighthearted that has a soft touch to them with the way they are dressed. It's almost humorous sometimes especially with the way Mashiro dressing up the way she does in some of the earlier episodes. Sorata's over exaggeration in the series is also humorous to look at when he get caught up in a misunderstood situation. Overall, the movement of the artwork is done right to fit within this romantic comedy series. Now, if only Mashiro's manga will be more cuter as well...\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack and music of the series seems mediocre. Jin Aketagawa handles the choreography who strives to makes the series lighthearted during many of the scenes. In fact, it's no surprise that a lot of the series' comedic, dramatic, enthusiastic, or entertaining scenes are crafted to be lighthearted. Even the OP song, Kimi ga Yume wo Tsuretekita by Pet na Kanojo-tachi is known to be lighthearted and smooth which depicts a montage of the main characters and a tiny glimpse of their lives at the dorms. J.C. Staff is already known for some of their other works in the romantic comedy media such as Toradora, Hatsuoki Limited, and the recent Little Busters! What J.C. Staff presents here is what is their latest line of their evolution of works.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I found the series to be a charming gem. Despite the weak story and seemingly cliched humor, it is surprisingly entertaining. It's hard to present series like this as some fans may see it the wrong way originally. Yet, I found it to be quite charming. It's not exactly a masterpiece or something of a highlight of the year, but is crafted well with its cast of characters. It's funny how imagination sometimes can go so far to create a series like this but otherwise, I found Sakurasou Pet Kanojo to be quite an entertaining watch.",

            "content": "So. Finished The Pet Girl of Sakurasou, one of the most anticipated animes for the first quarter of 2013. My thoughts on the first episodes told me nothing but, \"Just another echii/rom-com, you've seen this all before\". Usually my brain is correct when it comes to watching animes for the first time.\r\nUsually.\r\nMy brain was dead wrong when it came to this one. The thing I love about being me is that despite how clich\u00e9 some romantic comedies are, I always finish them, no matter what. But this time I didn't need to power through it, and the season finale just made me want more. Theshow had hilarious comedy, an intriguing story, and the characters were all perfect.\\n\\n\r\nTo start off, let me explain something to rom-com lovers out there: It doesn't matter if a romantic comedy has multiple clich\u00e9s, such as meeting a girl in a certain area that'll have a huge purpose later in the show. What matters is how the people who made the romantic comedy will play it out. You could have one show with a story and have it end up being awful. On the other hand, you could have another story with the same story and have it end up being incredible. Luckily, The Pet Girl of Sakurasou ended up being on the incredible side. The story was unique, each episode was full of comedy, romance, and the occasional feels. There are moments of awkwardness and bitterness, but they all level out into moments of happiness and laughter. I really liked how they played the show out, and I'm really hoping for a season 2 with a storyline just as good as season 1.\\n\\n\r\n2013 has been looking up to be a great year in the art industry. The artwork gets more and more colorful and impressive every year anime continues to be made. Looking back in the 1990s, there was Evangelion, Cowboy Bebop, and many others with exceptional artwork for it's time. Now you look at the animes of today and you have Kotoura-san, Fairy Tail, Sword Art Online, etc, and you'll notice the difference that 20 years of experience can have on an animator. As for the Pet Girl of Sakurasou, this is a perfect example of the 20 year experience I was talking about. Colorful, detailed, beautiful... there are moments where I honestly wish that my life was more like an anime... alright, there isn't really 1 moment in my life where I wish it was more like an anime, who hasn't? Grade A artwork.\\n\\n\r\nThere isn't much to say about the audio in The Pet Girl of Sakurasou, except that the voice actors/actresses worked on their roles with real professionalism and realism. They fit the characters' personalities and I learned to like and respect them a lot.\\n\\n\r\nThis is the part I was looking forward to: character reviews. We have Sorata, the kind hearted/incredibly dense male protagonist of the show, who most animal-lovers will end up looking up towards due to the fact that he can't say no to helping out a homeless animal and giving it a home. Aww...  Then we have Mashiro, the quiet, and sometimes questionable female protagonist, and I say questionable because I've started to wonder how she has been living like 15 years and still doesn't know how to put on clothing without instructions. These are the 2 main characters of the show, who end up playing big roles in each other's lives, and I say that because Sorata is the one giving the instructions to Mashiro. We also have Aoyama who is Sorata's classmate, Misaki, the hyperactive senior living in the same dormitory as Sorata who is constantly causing trouble in a hilarious way, and finally Jin, the playboy/braniac of the group. All of them are considered to be main characters due to the fact they have a whole lot of screen time in the show and play vital roles in the story. Put them all together, and it's one big happy family, and I mean that, if you took one of them out, it wouldn't be the same, and that's how I like it.\\n\\n\r\nI started watching this by the time episode 18 was already released, and I watched all of the episodes already released in under 10 hours, and when I finally tried to hit the \"next\" button, \"Please wait until next week for episode 19 to be released\". That irritated the CRAP out of me. I just got into an amazing show and now I gotta wait a week to watch another episode, and then repeat that cycle until the season finale. Once it finally finished, it left me in tears and wanting more. I can safely say that this is probably one of my favorite animes released this year, no joke. I do agree that not everyone may enjoy it, especially those who hate waiting for characters to confess to each other, but trust me, it's worth the wait. Give it a few episodes. If you don't start enjoying it by episode 3... keep going. If you don't start enjoying it by episode 23... just watch the last episode, you're almost done with it, it's 24 minutes of your life. But I doubt it'll be a waste of time.",

            "content": "\"Every day was the same. Deep down, I felt bored. I wanted to blame someone for my being bored.\" - Kanda Sorata\r\nSakurasou no Pet na Kanojo follows the life of a high school student, Sorata, being forced to live in a dorm called Sakurasou for the 'special' students of the school after he breaks a rule of the regular dorms. The people living there are all very unique in their own way but seem to be the misfits of society. At first, our main character, Sorata, firmly sets his goal as leaving Sakurasou as soon as possible and does not intend to stay for long.However, after a period of time, especially after an English transfer student named Shiina Mashiro moves into Sakurasou, Sorata begins to rethink his plans.\\n\\n\r\nStory [9/10]\\n\\n\r\nThe story of Sakurasou no Pet na Kanojo is extremely realistic and is very well thought out. Combining romance, comedy and drama, the anime balances between these genres perfectly. A key theme of Sakurasou no Pet na Kanojo would be obstacles and hardships in life and how to overcome them. Even though most of the series is rather light-hearted, when one of the characters do fail after working so hard for their goal, you will feel an unexpected surge of emotions and sympathy for them. Apart from failure, the show also focuses on friendships. Unlike many other anime, Sakurasou no Pet na Kanojo does not have a very one-sided love triangle and develops the relationships in a unique manner. Viewers will not be biased specifically towards one outcome but be more willing to accept any of the relationships. Overall, the story of Sakurasou no Pet na Kanojo is heart-warming, realistic and beautiful.\\n\\n\r\nArt [10/10]\\n\\n\r\nThe art of Sakurasou no Pet na Kanojo was flawless. It was clean, polished and unique. When Sorata and Shiina first met under the cherry blossom trees, the way the petals were dancing as they fell from the trees was the most beautiful scene I have ever seen. Honestly, I can't complain about the art of this anime at all.\\n\\n\r\nSound [8/10]\\n\\n\r\nThe openings and endings of Sakurasou no Pet na Kanojo were cheerful and happy which really added to the light-heartedness of this anime. I've played these songs on Osu! many, many, many times and still do. I even listen to 'Days of Dash' when I go to school to remind me of the greatness of this anime. The soundtracks inside the show were also very fitting and suitable. The only reason it didn't score a 9 or 10 was that I just simply prefer some of the other soundtracks out there such as the Anohana ending.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter [10/10]\\n\\n\r\nFor me, the best part about any anime would be its characters. I can only enjoy a series thoroughly if it's got loveable, realistic and relatable characters. In this case, Sakurasou no Pet na Kanojo definitely ticks the box. After finishing this anime, I immediately went to put Shiina Mashiro and Kanda Sorata up on my favourite characters list. The characters in Sakurasou no Pet na Kanojo are all unique in their own way and the show provides great character development for all of them. By the end of Sakurasou no Pet na Kanojo, we get to learn about all six main characters' backgrounds and become very attached to each and every one of them. I honestly really miss all the times when everyone was gathered around the dining table having a hot pot in Sakurasou tradition.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment [10/10]\\n\r\nOverall [10/10]\\n\\n\r\nI love this anime and its characters with a passion, I really do. This anime has really allowed me to rethink my life and what I want to be and do when I'm older. It's a thought provoker, for sure and has impacted my life heavily. I've both laughed and cried and seriously, what a ride it has been. Sayonara, Sakurasou no pet na Kanojo!",

            "content": "The Pet Girl of Sakurasou is my favorite romance-comedy anime from the past couple years, for a couple of reasons. At first glance, the show seems like the usual perverted fan-service-shit everyone\u2019s grown accustom to these days as the first two episodes are filled with a beautiful clueless girl walking about blindly and nakedly around a teenage guys house with lots of ecchi moments (original huh)... However, I decided to not drop the series and I'm glad I didn't, because upon watching more of the show, I found that the story goes on it's own path, away from the generic rom-coms story (pretty well-written fora rom-com). Whereas many romance shows will focus solely on a friendship/love bond within like a love triangle or square, that takes place in school-some workplace and has tons of ecchi to keep perverted audience members interested, Sakurasou does beyond that. Something about this show halfway that caught my attention was that it's bright and cheerful when it should be (even more-so than other romance stories), but at the same time it contrasts itself perfectly with dark sides of life-romance that most generic rom-coms don't do. Sakurasou's story is actually a story, not an episodic romance drama that's controlled by the characters, which is a nice change of pace from romance anime nowadays. \\n\\n\r\nThe story revolves around the main character Sorata Kanda, who is forced to shift from a normal dorm to an eccentric dorm called Sakurasou, filled with delinquents, in order to keep his pet cat. The very (insert weird/annoying words here) personalities of his dorm roommates make Sorata tempting to leave, but then suddenly a super hot girl named Mashiro Shiina moves into Sakurasou. And... Mashiro seems to lack any common sense or knowledge of anything really - except painting/drawing which is she a master \"artist\" at. Anyways, Sorata is sort of forced to take care of Mashiro and help her out with the everyday tasks of life. Gradually, the dorm begins to become more livable for Sorato when more friendly and not-too-weird residents move in. And so... our romance triangle/comedy/touching-story begins. \\n\\n\r\nPersonally more than anything, I found Sakurasou No Pet Na Kanojo to be one of the most genuinely fun and touching shows to watch. This was a beautiful romance show that ranks somewhere near the top of my top anime list and you don't see someone like me whose into deep, psychological, horror, historic say something like that. More than anything, Sakurasou No Pet Na Kanojo is a story about the bond made between friends and all the wild times and the real and unexpected emotions that come with them. A big theme or concept in this story is one of \"dreams\" during youth. Mashiro asks Sorata (and others), \"What do you want to be?\" Everybody has their (probably outrageous) dreams and they may very well vary from age to age. As a child we probably wanted to be a Pokemon master, or a superhero. As a teen maybe we wanted to be a world famous actor, or artist or basketball player. In college people change courses/majors quite often in order to find something that suites themselves. What a person's dreams are will come to define that person's identity as who he/she is. But many people end up giving up on their dreams because they believe that \"it's too hard\", or \"I can't possibly do it\". Hope is something that's hard to come by unless there's some kind of motivation or reason. The main protagonist Sorata is like that. But he finds his motor, and sense of hope in Shiina Mashiro and this \"story\" of this rom-com truly reached out and grasped my attention/heart. You know how people always say practice makes perfect and hard-work always pays off? Well is that honestly true? The show serves as a simple but great watch and has its own morals to share at the end. Reminds me of my high-school, college days. A great, tender feeling indeed~ If you want a purely enjoyable rom-com then Sakurasou is the one to watch. The ending leaves the show \"unanswered\". I hope there's a season two, but as of now it doesn't seem like there will be which is very depressing considering they left it a cliffhanger with no concrete pair-ups and an introduction of a new character at the very very end.\\n\\n\r\nOut of all the slice of life anime series I've seen, Sakurasou definitely has one of the most memorable and adorable set of characters. Shiina Mashiro is probably my favorite female character from a romance series. At the beginning Mashiro seems like shes just there for fan service but as the story progresses she helps others find and reach out for their dreams. She maintains the happiness, purity and innocence that children should have during their youth. She seems all dumb (she's pretty clueless) but she honestly does have a deeper understanding of life/the world. She learns common sense and the meaning of friendship and love. She is the driving force of the other characters as well as the show itself. Sorata gets a lot of hate - blah blah blah for being dumb sometimes, but that's so oversold. Sorata is who he is, and he stays true to his character throughout. The other characters all played specific funny roles and added lots of enjoyment/comedy to the show. Although.. Yuuko Kanda was a pretty stupid and useless character... Anyways, a lot of shipping pairings will be shattered, but oh well that's what romance stories do. The developing friendship chemistry (and romance) between the characters was just beautiful to watch. As I'm writing this review I'm starting to realize just how much I really liked Sakurasou's set of characters. I wish real life could be this simple, innocent and fun.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound in the show were pretty good. I don't really like all \"cute\"- openings very much, but both of Sakurasou's openings were enjoyable to listen to - I liked them both. The endings were decent as well. The voicing crew did a marvelous job with each character's tone; fit their personality and looks perfectly. The dynamic voicing of each character certainly brought more \"life\" to the characters. It might sound cheesy, but I could feel the emotions that the characters wanted the audience to feel~ Heh... Anyways the animations were out of the roof, very colorful. J.C staff truly animates romance stories well. Bravo. Production quality was consistent throughout the entirety of the series - backgrounds were well portrayed. The weather as well - lightning which was beautiful - nature was beautiful - fireworks were beautiful - Animals were beautiful - Mashiro's art was beautiful, And... Shiina Mashiro was beautiful~\\n\\n\r\nWhat more is there to say, someone like me who doesn't even like romance stories that much absolutely loved this. I'm sure those of you who love romance stories will love it even more than I did. I'd probably give the series a 10/10 if it wasn't for that unsatisfying ending, but don't let that stop you from giving this show a try, it's in my opinion the best slice of life story I've seen in a long time.",

            "content": "Sakurasou is an anime that is more than the sum of its parts. If I were to break down Sakurasou into its most basic ingredients, I wouldn't be able to claim that any of those ingredients are particularly brilliant. However, the wonderful hot pot created when all of those ingredients are boiled together is one that is unique and unforgettable.\r\nStory - 9/10\r\nThe premise of Sakurasou is generic enough, but the story grows beautifully from its humble beginnings. Containing multiple story arcs, each with enough plot and character to facilitate being an anime alone, Sakurasou almost resembles a battle shonen in structure. Various arcs centered aroundfocused goals allow the plot to progress and the characters to grow. The pacing, for a melodramatic slice-of-life, is fast, but not in a bad way. The speed of the series serves to keep the viewer engaged, very rarely moving so fast that you feel like you've missed something. In regards to a few plot points, the story sometimes either seems to move too quickly or too slowly, but the overall story is beautifully told at an interesting and unique pace. \\n\\n\r\nArt - 7/10\\n\\n\r\nSakurasou has lovely character designs that burst with personality. I can't think of any points in the anime where the drawings were weak enough to distract from my immersion in the story. The animation itself was fine, although during more kinetic scenes, it lacked. Kinetic scenes were rarely required in the story, so that isn't a major complaint. The reason the art only scores a 7 is mainly due to the color used. The colors in Sakurasou were dull and pasty, which isn't my cup of tea. It did allow the more colorful scenes to stand out, but this opportunity was squandered.\\n\\n\r\nSound - 6/10\\n\\n\r\nThe sound effects, as per usual in anime, were fine. Never did they distract from the show. The reason sound scores only 6 out of 10 is because of the soundtrack. Although Sakurasou is chocked full of emotional scenes, the background music was almost never powerful enough to support the amazing performances by the voice actors and actresses. Furthermore, the soundtrack in general was rather forgettable, although I enjoyed the OPs and EDs. That isn't to say the soundtrack is bad, it just was weaker than the rest of the show.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 10/10\\n\\n\r\nThis is where Sakurasou truly shines. All of the main characters in Sakurasou are unique and flawed. Some of them may seem to be tropes at first glance, but as you watch more episodes, you'll quickly realize that they're anything but. Over the course of the story arcs and their interactions with one another, all of the characters grow as human beings. In addition, the character flaws are some of the best I've seen written in anime. The flaws of the characters can often be annoying, but usually because you've been in their situation before and understand how they feel. You know that they're feeling something silly, but it's such a realistic portrayal of how a person would react. I would love to see the characters grow even more.\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 9/10\\n\\n\r\nAs I said, Sakurasou is more than the sum of its parts. Although the art and sound sometimes drag down the engaging story and beautiful characters, it manages to come together in what I believe is an unforgettable anime. Sakurasou is an important watch for any anime fan.",

            "content": "Sakurasou no Pet na kanojo is one hell of a ride. And it's definitely a hidden gem among all the generic slice-of-life animes out there and is lies among the best of them in my opinion. Its beginning may turn away many viewers due to its more than revealing shots of the characters, but please try to stick with this anime because you'll be rewarded with an alien-like yet relateable cast, amazing accompaniment of music, and a splash of colors swirling around the screen that's bound to give your eyes orgasms. \r\nSeriously, please stay with us at Sakurasou.\r\n* WARNING *\r\nThere are spoilers below and Iwould highly recommend you watch the anime before reading this article.\\n\\n\r\nThe main thing that stuck with me throughout this anime was the characters, the story was simply meh. It kept the drama up and was useful to keep things interesting but otherwise it didn't do much except tell about a struggle. \\n\\n\r\nWhat I really liked about this anime was that it really explored the themes of fighting and losing. I don't think I've ever watched any other animes where the main characters fail at their dreams and how they cope with it. Some people may say that Sorata complains a lot and is a dick at times, but I feel that it's something people are unfamiliar with viewing, which is that they are human. So many times are we presented characters where they rise beyond the normal setting because they were smart, strong, and lead others to victory or somehow manage to leap out of their comfort zone because of a strong mentor. We are used to seeing that because that's what we all aspire to be. \\n\\n\r\nWe all want to be strong, to be able to fight for our morals and goals, to overcome our weaknesses and be somebody people can rely on. But Sakurasou, no matter how crazy some of their scenes or maybe the entire season, these characters are still human. We are told that we have to hide our feelings and never talk about problems openly or else we would be ridiculed for being weak. And this is something that Kanda, Aoyami, Misaki, Jin, and Ryunnosuke all struggle with. \\n\\n\r\nRyunnosuke has trouble dealing with people because he's afraid of being hurt. He was abandoned for being himself and got to the point where he was used to being rejected and thought it was normal to shut himself in his room to escape his own fears.\\n\\n\r\nMisaki is a genius compared to almost everybody else yet she is also the most emotionally delicate, perhaps even more so than Ayonami. Ayonami grew out of her shell and finally became more honest with herself. But who was the one that encouraged Ayonami to grow more confident, yet at the same time regressed back into her anime to hide what she felt for Jin? \\n\\n\r\nWe all deal with fear here, and this anime portrays this better than most. They fear losing, winning, moving forward. Yet they keep on moving on. That's the main lesson I learn from this anime. It's to fight for what you want with all of your strength. Even if you fall to your knees, cry out and curse the world because you didn't make the interview or lost your job, WE CANNOT GIVE UP. It is what Misaki says:\\n\\n\r\n\"Leap out into outer space!\"\\n\\n\r\n*END SPOILERS*\\n\\n\r\nI usually write my reviews like this, with what I personally feel whenever I finish up an anime. It's a little odd but it's what I usually roll with, so please bear with me. Here's the \"normal\" part of the review down below!\\n\\n\r\nI really thought the art was something exceptional and it truly stood out from most other animes that I had seen. Its attention to detail reminded me of the focus ufotable often has towards its animes as well. J.C. Studios really went all out and one scene is particularly memorable to me, which was the pool scene where all the water droplets were flung about and flow of the waves ebbed to the movement of the characters while they splashed around. It was just so smooth and unreal that kind of attention was paid towards the pictures J.C. Studios paints Sakurasou as. Whether it's the smile of Shina or the fallen sakura petal, they all are animated well. \\n\\n\r\nThe sound played a large part in ramping up the emotional impact of scenes. When I heard the soft tones of the piano tiptoeing beside the harsh tones of the characters, it blended together perfectly. The soundtrack does meld with the script of the anime. The only problem I had was that the 2nd ED was slightly inappropriate after certain scenes because of its loud and more joyful nature. \\n\\n\r\nSeriously, if you are somebody that enjoys an anime that provides an experience that teaches you how to fight, how to lose, and how to move on, this is a perfect one for you. I did not particularly care for the first 5 episodes of this anime, but as it drove on, I found myself relating to these characters despite their extreme differences.  I am proud to say that I enjoyed it, enjoyed it so much that this is actually my 3rd viewing of Sakurasou. Please, watch this anime. It is certainly worth your time, and the fanservice does die down after the first few episodes. \\n\\n\r\nThank you so much for reading my review, and I hope I didn't bore you. If you have any feedback, I'd greatly appreciate it! Feel free to message me if you want to discuss it!",

            "content": "I started watching this anime fully expecting it to be just another silly light-headed boyish comedy full of gratuitous skin flicks and fanservice. I admit, my hormones made me do it. If you just want a short summary, though, hear me out on only two more statements: This is a story about a kindhearted teenager who cares for, and slowly falls in love with, a savant. And I'm still surprised to say it's the only anime that has managed to pull any tears out of my eyes.\r\nYes, the show does start out with the immature titillation that we all came for. Yes, the comedic timingis superb. And this content, while it gets toned down somewhat, never entirely goes away. As the season progressed, though, I began to feel a little ashamed with myself for assuming from the start that this show's creators were nothing more than money-grubbing opportunists who only wanted to sell bawdy humor smattered with breasts and derriere to finance their next financial venture. Because, as it turns out, Sakurasou turned out to be a lot more.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are deep and rounded. The hero very slowly falls in love with the heroine, but to get there he makes legitimate sacrifices. Even more intriguing is how everyone attempts to reconcile their own opinions of the savant heroine: is she mentally handicapped or an unbelievably gifted genius? How would less gifted individuals deal with her, and how would average people deal with her? \\n\\n\r\nIn almost every episode, there's an unobtrusive scene of a white cat lying silently with her black companion (they'd been adopted by the hero). By explicitly linking the white cat to the heroine, the show subtly tells us that the success she represents can only exist with its implied black partner, failure. One can't exist without the other, no yin without her yang. As it turns out, this symbolism becomes very important.\\n\\n\r\nAt its heart, the show is a love story. But it's also a story about life, a story about coming to terms with imperfections and a story about the transition into young adulthood. Some find immense success in their dreams while the rest aren't quite that lucky. The overarching question that the show asks the viewer is this: Regardless of your successes or failures, how are you going to step forward?\\n\\n\r\nMaybe that's a question we all should consider.",

            "content": "Bueno, how should I put it.......well, I'd probably say that this anime is good at the start of 2013. It is safe to say that this anime ended in episode 23 and it is safe to assume that episode 24 would just a filler since there were spoilers already indicated either from the forums, light novel, manga or from MAL's character info. So, this anime more like intensified of what was about the situation about the people of  Sakura Dormitory or more popularly called \"Sakurasou.\" So, without anymore BS, here are my ratings for each of this anime's category.\r\nGood 7:\r\nStory- Thought the anime itdoes have the usual bunch of maverick group of student who don't fit in a normal society and were piled up in one place kinda thingy, but this anime's overall story was about the slice of life of each characters of this anime and quite frankly the romance and comedy genre are more pronounce, though the comedy part was more on Sorata, it's very obvious that he carries most of this anime's direction and that very good of what the writer, Hajime Kamoshida did.\\n\\n\r\nSound- For the first few episode, I'd really like both opening and closing themes, I also like the VA's of Aoyama, Shiina and Jin. But for Sorata and Ry\u016bnosuke, not much. Sorata's VA, Yoshitsugu Matsuoka though he's only 26 years old already he sounded like an old man, as for Ryunosuke's VA,   Yui Horie no longer has that youthful intonation to play a young guy, she should have just been limited to voice the latter's AI as Maid.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter-  I would probably have a mixed reaction about every character's in this anime, in a sense that one cannot view them in a double dimension but in a triple dimension, you may hate them in one way and like them in another, but the presences of  the 3rd dimension is somewhat you'll find odd. so let tackle each one of them:\\n\\n\r\nSorata Kanda, he is basically a dude who has a big chip on his shoulder because everything that goes around Sakurasou was placed on him, his chip become bigger where Shiina came into picture. I like the fact that he thinks more for other than for himself, doesn't hesitate to help around, do all the chores and babysit Shiina, but what makes me wanna kick his ass sometimes, was the fact that what he thinks that's good for others that he doesn't even consider if that is what they wanted nor does he pause for a while to see the bigger picture. What was odd about him is that the amine's direction was too depended on him especially the comedy genre of this anime, you might that the comedy part is him.\\n\\n\r\nShiina Mashiro, she is the added chip on Sorata's shoulder, because her only Chihiro wasn't of much any help. When she was introduce to be Sorata's ward I have nothing but disgust for her character, she's somewhere in between the threshold of either being a genius, retard and a lack of common sense. Though her character was in such threshold, it is nice that she does have emotions especially when it come to her feelings with Sorata. I admit, I kinda hate the Sorata X Shiina arc, then again she does provide this anime's heart warming plot,\\n\\n\r\nAoyama Nanami, when she came to Sakurasou she sort of lifted one of Sorata's chip, I would have wish for the Aoyama X Sorata arc, but it was unfortunate that she also thinks for of others than herself and it was her concern for others that makes things too unfair for herself. She loves Sorata, but always end up restraining herself which I'm guess that it involves her  concerns for Shiina's welfare.\\n\\n\r\n  Misaki Kamiigusa, ok she has a bad case of ADHD, but what I like about her was her never ending goal to be Jin's girl which give this anime a dramatic edge. I don't like her impulsiveness that she doesn't even bother to be still and think things around.\\n\\n\\n\r\nJin Mitaka, this character is a 'Dichotomy,' he's a player and yet he refuses to bang Misaki ( which is good), in one episode there seems to be a yaoi element that exist between him and S\u014dichir\u014d, but that's just me.\\n\\n\\n\r\nRy\u016bnosuke Akasaka, a computer geek who prefer to be a loner, I like his pragmatic side when he confronted Sorata about the dorm's situation, but I hate the way he shoves Rita away and being arrogant towards the teacher, I guess if I where in the teacher's shoes I'd be wreaking his laptop in front of him.\\n\\n\r\nChihiro Sengoku, the useless dorm teacher that I don't like at all, period.\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnoyment- Well, what's make is anime enjoyable was the slice of life that each character has as this anime goes on, but more credit goes to Sorata and Aoyama since it was the predicament that these two character go through that put's this anime into its direction.\\n\\n\r\nOverall- I'd say that even thought its the two said character's who guide this anime to its direction, it won't be fair to not include the other character's for the romance does give this anime such warm with is make up. But, since for the most part this anime depends on Sorata and Aoyama I find it unfair to give this anime a score higher than seven since it wasn't fair that one character, Aoyama, has to be this self sacrificing individual for the sake of Sorata and Shiina.\\n\\n\\n\r\nMediocre 5:\\n\\n\r\nArt- I gave this category such score since I don't have much to say about its art, period.\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe End.",

            "content": "\"Don't judge a book by its cover.\" Something we are all guilty of doing on a regular basis. Who can blame us? We're human. We are quick to judge, are influenced greatly by first impressions, and will easily discard great potential investments without a second thought. Despite this deficit of reasonable evaluation, humans are also great beings; we are able to look back and realize first impressions can be capable of grievous deception. \r\nSakurasou no Pet na Kanojo (The Pet Girl of Sakurasou) is not really a romantic series. It is also not really a comedy. Though it has bits of both of these elements,I would not consider either of these two the main focus. If I were to pick any one genre that describes this show best it would be a drama, and a fine one at that. It's very rare that you come across an anime that has such a strong dramatic effect without choking on dialogue, yet it's exceptionally done here. Behind the facade of childish yelling, panty shots, cleavage, and sexual innuendos lies a story. It's a story of following your aspirations and getting shot down, working harder than others but not getting the part, being so talented that others don't understand you, and being wanted by the one you love but denying them because you don't feel enough self-worth. A story of passion, frustration, and maturity.\\n\\n\r\nThe pacing of story flows with a certain finesse. It never feels too fast, and never too slow. It feels just right and occupies its 24 episode run in quite a snug manner. I would like to say the same about the animation because it stays easy on the eyes and retains its consistency. I enjoyed both OP's and ED's; they felt uplifting and were generally all around fun. Going into the sound criteria, I would like to mention how much I enjoyed the timing of the sound effects during dramatic moments. The voice actors did a great job showcasing emotion and talent through their respective characters.  \\n\\n\r\nThe residents of Sakura Hall are an intriguing group of social outcasts that became more and more endearing as the series progressed. Each of them has their own quirks, talents, and dreams that set them all apart, yet also brought them all together. The reason I really liked this group of characters was oddly because of their negative traits. They act stupid, get depressed, get frustrated, and envious. They seem like realistic people and act accordingly in order to help each other through tough times. There were a number of memorable scenes such as the 'bro talks' between Sorata and Jin, Misaki's struggle with love, the making of Nyapollen, and the graduation speech that leave a lasting impression. These characters took me on a roller coaster of mixed feelings and at the end of it I was a little sad to see them depart for their next ride. \\n\\n\r\nWhile I thought the series was great, it also had its own hindrances that obstruct a better score. First I would like to address the issue of fan service. Fan service is one of the biggest problems in the anime industry for me; often the panty shots, cleavage, and suggestive dialogue is fine in small doses. I understand why it's there, but when it's unnecessary and much too potent it tarnishes an anime leaving you wondering what could have been. For Sakurasou in particular, the fan service is more concentrated towards the early half of the series; this in itself is why the start of the series felt so generic and why I assume many people typically dropped the show to begin with. Secondly, romantic development. Every once in while it would be nice to come across a protagonist that isn't as dense as a plank of wood. Yes, I'm looking at you Sorata. While I don't consider Sakurasou to be a romantic series, romance elements do pop up numerous times throughout the series. Romantic interests felt unsatisfactory and left me feeling something to be desired with the exception of Jin and Misaki. Fortunately for us, at least Sakurasou isn't a cheap harem. \\n\\n\r\nSakurasou no Pet na Kanojo began an empty canvas. It peered into the hearts of man and admirably grasped what it feels like to be full of envy and full of excitement, heartbroken and loved, alone and surrounded by people you can without a doubt call friends. All of this is gathered on a palette with a wide variety of colors; a palette to paint upon the canvas the joys and disappointments that life has to offer. Looking at the portrait, there is only one question left. \u2018What color do you want to be?\u2019",

            "content": "To be brief, this anime was a lot better than I though it would be. The beginning sets it up as a cliche harem series having the main character surrounded by different over-used archetypes. I soon found out that my assumption was wrong and the show greatly develops. Although it deviates away from a crappy harem show, the story behind it is still mediocre at best, and I have seen many like it. It is a story about bonds and friendship and all that jazz. However, there are still a few elements to it that grabbed my emotions. Later in the show the theme ofhard work not always paying off really got to me. I believe that theme is easy for anyone to relate to and can provide a very emotional experience at some points. \\n\r\nThe art and animation of this show is its greatest  attribute. Although most of this show is talking and crying, when something actually happens it is animated in a beautiful manner. The character design itself is nothing too special, but it also isn't bad. \\n\r\nThe music of this series was just typical j-pop and is easily forgettable. It is good enough not to make your ears bleed. \\n\r\nThe characters of this show are indeed loveable but can also be annoying. The characters all fit some kind of anime archetype I have seen millions of times. At the beginning this drove me crazy because everyone was so predictable and annoying. However as the story starts to build up the characters start to build as well. The main character initially seems like the typical \"AHH GIRLS\" harem lead. This is quickly destroyed because he proves to actually have some backbone and i gained respect for him as the series went on.\\n\r\nOverall i enjoyed this series and found it easy to watch episode after episode. I could relate to it personally in so many ways. The idea of working hard not always providing the results you want really got to me and at one point I had to hold back the tears. However I feel this story can be easily replaced in my heart and there are just too many cliches to be able to call it special.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\n.",

            "content": "**This review has a section (highlighted by tags) that contains spoilers.\r\nSakurasou no Pet na Kanojo is a rom-com slice of life anime, so it\u2019s a good watch by default, right? Well, not quite. This genre has a shtick for being oversaturated, particularly with many poor productions. Why should you watch Sakurasou in particular, over the many other rom-com slice of life's? Well, read on to find out.\r\nSakurasou does one thing especially well that makes it stand out among its competitors, and that is its character dynamics. That is an aspect of it that is simply fantastic. As such, this review contains a fairly lengthy discussionof the plot, which I will highlight with spoiler tags.\\n\\n\r\nThe main characters of Sakurasou no Pet na Kanojo are Kanda Sorata, Kamiigusa Misaki, Shiina Mashiro, Aoyama Nanami and Mitaka Jin. Already, Sakurasou can be seen as a highly unique anime. With 5 characters that are all equally important to the story, the audience gets five times the character development than most rom-coms. However, the story technically follows the adventures of Kanda Sorata, who has been banished to Sakurasou (\u201cSakura Hall\u201d) due to the regular school dorms not allowing the keeping of cats. As he cares deeply for his cats, Kanda ends up biting the bullet and chooses to live at Sakurasou. There at Sakurasou, he lives with other would-be delinquents. And so, the relationships between the five characters at Sakurasou would serve as the backbone of this anime\u2019s story. \\n\\n\r\nPresumably, this should already be heaven for any rom-com slice of life lover; after all, there are five main characters and 24 episodes. The real thing that does it for Sakurasou, however, is the romance aspect of the anime. And by \u201cdoing it\u201d, I mean doing a disservice. The romance in this anime is quite horrid, honestly. This is especially hard for me to say as I thoroughly enjoyed literally every single aspect of Sakurasou, except for its romance. \\n\\n\r\nI\u2019m going to be discussing the story in mild detail, so if you don\u2019t want to be spoiled at all, skip to the [endspoiler] tag.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\n**[startspoiler]\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nMy first problem is Misaki\u2019s relationship with Jin. Due to the nature of the anime and the nature of Misaki\u2019s personality itself, her quest for love was simply a joke; I never really took it seriously. Whenever she cried after her numerous failures, I did not feel sympathy for her, nor did I feel emotional as a viewer. Misaki\u2019s love struggles never really had any weight to them, and they even got resolved fairly quickly (as if to further undermine them).\\n\\n\r\nThe other problem: Aoyama and Kanda\u2019s relationship. Oh boy. This relationship single-handedly \u201cruined\u201d Sakurasou for me (not really ruined, but it basically kicked my pairing hopes in the nutsack). I personally rooted for Aoyama and Kanda to get together throughout the series, but man was THAT wishful thinking. Before watching this series, I read many posts touting Sakurasou as being \u201cthe bad kind of predictable\u201d. And I certainly see why now. Right from the first episode, you could already see Shiina x Kanda being established. Them getting all touchy-feely so early on, the sexual innuendos, the peeping moments\u2026 it was all meant to be from the very beginning. So why then, did the writers decide to create a second relationship branch in Aoyama x Kanda? It makes zero sense to me, and Sakurasou\u2019s execution of the pairing itself made just about the same amount of sense. The entire time, Kanda is as blunt as a block while Aoyama is as pitiful as a bug. It was just painful for me to watch Aoyama each time she tried to confess to Kanda. Her constant failures were just really disgusting, and especially so since I\u2019m one of the viewers who prefer Aoyama over Shiina. Not by much, because I do love Shiina as a character, but some preference nonetheless. Aoyama\u2019s unrealized love was truly cringe-worthy; two especially disgusting moments were when she confesses her love, only to play it off as \u201cgood acting\u201d, and when she gave a half-ass confession to Kanda after her audition. Seriously, it\u2019s like the producers were purposely getting my hopes up simply to laugh at me afterwards. Two times, we were supposed to get Aoyama to finally confess to Kanda, and for Kanda to (more than likely) go out with her or reject her. But, we get the worse-case scenario; Aoyama\u2019s love is never realized! As I have said before, the chemistry between Aoyama and Kanda really pissed me off not only due to how poorly it was coordinated but also by how unnecessary it was. The producers did NOT need to include a second girl for Kanda; this isn\u2019t a harem anime. Shiina would have been good enough, and the story could have simply focused on Kanda x Shiina being realized. However, just as this anime put the final nail in the coffin when it came to pissing me off with Aoyama x Kanda, episode 23 came about: the graduation episode. And boy, let me tell you. This was one of the greatest episodes in anime history; I\u2019m just going to say it now. The emotion displayed in this episode by all the characters (students, school staff members, Sakurasou residents included) was simply unreal. This scene does not necessarily make you want to cry. However, you can sense the genuineness within each characters\u2019 sadness, their speeches, and their feelings for each other. Instead of being a giant cheesefest, the producers of Sakurasou actually managed to make the graduation episode an honest-to-goodness emotional episode. And I felt it. However, I found myself asking: \"Why wasn't this the final episode?\"\\n\\n\r\nThe last episode (24) made it seem as if there was still plenty more for Sakurasou to cover. It introduced two new characters, and it was the start of a new year; everything was fresh. We were going to see Kanda and Shiina being isolated from the other main characters for the first time, and maybe even having their relationship furthered. We even got a glimpse of the two new members of Sakurasou, and they are not bad characters in the slightest. All in all, the producers had quite a lot of quality material to work with if they wanted to create another season. So why didn\u2019t they? After I finished watching all 24 episodes of Sakurasou, I was left wanting more. The series didn\u2019t really \u201cend\u201d at all; why start a new chapter if you're just going to cut it off right away? The ending makes no sense to me. You could say that this is a sign that the producers are thinking of a second season, but there hasn\u2019t really been any news yet. It\u2019s just wishful thinking as of now.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\n**[endspoiler]\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nIn every other department, however, Sakurasou excels. \\n\\n\r\nStory [9/10]: Probably the most important aspect of an anime, Sakurasou has an exceptional story. While its romance is admittedly weak, as previously discussed, it doesn\u2019t take much away from the story. There were quite a lot of aspects of Sakurasou that I had a critique for, and yet I found myself excitedly watching every episode regardless. I constantly wanted to find out what would happen next, and I was definitely held in suspense during many moments throughout the anime. The moments of drama, in particular, gave Sakurasou such great depth. \\n\\n\r\nArt [10/10]: One of the absolute KILLER aspects of Sakurasou! The art implements a fairly unique style, using mainly warm and bright colors. Most animes have art that uses colors and shades from a generic palette, which causes them to look to look very similar to each other; Sakurasou strays away from this. All of the characters are drawn nicely, along with all of the minute details in the animations being perfectly executed. However, if there was one thing to really set Sakurasou apart, it\u2019s the art used to portray Shiina Mashiro\u2019s artistic virtuosity. As the viewer, I was able to completely comprehend the extent of Shiina\u2019s skill due to Sakurasou\u2019s magnificent art. Not to mention, whoever drew Shiina\u2019s drawings was quite talented themselves. \\n\\n\r\nSound [10/10]: The only proof I need to verify the greatness of Sakurasou\u2019s soundtrack is the fact that its OPs/EDs are among my top-played songs on my iPod. Initially, I wasn\u2019t really feeling the first opening; it sounded somewhat generic. However, after listening to it multiple times by virtue of watching the anime, I fell in love with it. The openings completely portray the mood of the entire anime (and the openings very cleverly display the fantastic art style, too). The second ending in particular went very nicely with the characters dynamics at that point in the story.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter [10/10]: Sakurasou\u2019s characters truly give it that extra dimension. For a rom-com, all five main characters are surprisingly deep. Throughout the story, we get to learn of all of their backgrounds. What makes them so amazing is the fact that despite vastly contrasting upbringings, all of the Sakurasou residents are accepting of each other. There is never any sense of dislike or resentment among them, and they are all genuine friends. That chemistry between them is what makes them so special to watch. \\n\\n\\n\r\nI thought long and hard about my final rating. Admittedly, there are quite a few problems with Sakurasou, such as its romance. However, for an anime that has left such a huge impact on me, Sakurasou deserves nothing less than a perfect score. Along with other viewers, I have been left wanting more. Few other animes have managed to make me feel this way. And while I was watching it, Sakurasou provided countless laughs and a fair share of quality drama. Never was I bored at any moment while watching the series. The greatest thing about Sakurasou, however, is the fact that it manages to meet and then exceed the standard expectations of a romantic comedy slice-of-life anime; it truly is a fantastic production.  Rarely can anyone recommend an anime of this genre as a must-watch for anime enthusiasts of all kinds, but that is exactly what I\u2019m doing with Sakurasou no Pet na Kanojo.",

            "content": "\"Everyday was the same. Deep down, I felt bored. I wanted to blame someone for my being bored.\" - Kanda Sorata\r\nThe very first line in the anime coming from the protagonist himself. Frankly, I felt exactly the same after watching the first dozen episodes of Sakurasou no Pet na Kanojo. J.C. Staff, a studio which animated numerous titles such as Toradora, Zero no Tsukaima, Toaru Majutsu no Index, now it's Sakurasou no Pet na Kanojo or in English, 'The Pet Girl of Sakurasou'.\r\nStory? Kanda Sorata was told to move to a place called Sakurasou, a dorm where the problem students dwell in. One day, ShiinaMashiro, a genius, moves to the Dorm. And so, Sorata's dorm mates given him the task to take care of Mashiro. So there ya go. You can probably predict the outcome of the show before you even watched it.\\n\\n\r\nSakurasou is a somewhat-more-than-generic romance/comedy anime. So, what are the common features of rom coms? Generic protagonist lives alone, story set in high school, extraordinary female protagonists, transfer students, probability of the transfer student living next door, childhood friends, imoutos having brother complex, beach episodes, protagonist is a chick magnet and lots of other distinctive features. It's those shows where you watch simply because you're too bored. Sakurasou is no exception.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, Sakurasou no Pet na Kanojo is slightly more different than the usual. While it does have most of the features mentioned, but this time the protagonist lives in a dorm, filled with problem students and Sakurasou have a slightly better plot...and I guess that's pretty much it.\\n\\n\r\nSince it's a romance/comedy anime then you're expecting some humor. Regrettably, the \"comedy\" part is appalling. Sakurasou provides the viewer with lots of humor throughout the series, but none of them were hilarious. All in all, Sakurasou fails to be entertaining in terms of humor. \\n\\n\r\nIn most cases, ecchi scenes and fanservice in these kind of anime are tolerable, as long as there are few but if too many, it affects the quality of the show. Indeed, I knew there were going to be ecchi in the series, but Sakurasou has more than expected.\\n\\n\r\nFinally, it's the story. Sakurasou starts off as boring, tiresome, especially the beginning and it may also be the biggest flaw of the anime. Brace yourselves, because boredom strikes very early. The starting episodes may give a bad first impression to the viewer and some may even stop watching the series solely because of that. Sakurasou is one of the few anime I've watched that left a terrible first impression.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, once you've covered the dull early episodes, at one point Sakurasou eventually starts becoming more intriguing later on(if it ever does for you). Personal point of view: I might have enjoyed Sakurasou more if it only had 12 or 13 episodes, not with 24 episodes. Why? for me, it starts becoming more interesting roughly at episode twelve. Some of the characters' past were interesting to watch such as Shiina Mashiro's however the enjoyment only lasted for couple of minutes. Sakurasou did have some memorable moments; both happy and sorrowful, but most of them were in the middle or near the end of the series. Luckily, the ending was pretty decent. Not the best ending I've seen, but still it's ok.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter? I'll show you in a list.\\n\r\nThese are the characters who dwell in Sakurasou Dorm. \\n\r\nScores are out of 5. Lowest(1) being Hated. Highest(5) being Loved.\\n\\n\r\nKanda Sorata:(1/5) Boring male protagonist; essential in most rom coms. Now, only more irritating.\\n\r\nShiina Mashiro*:(3/5) Female protagonist. Neutral.\\n\r\nAoyama Nanami:(3/5) The common tsundere type. I feel sorry for her at the end of the series.\\n\r\nMitaki Jin:(3/5) Looks like he lost his virginity years ago.\\n\r\nKamiigusa Misaki:(2/5) Energetic, noisy type. \\n\r\nAkasaka Ryuunosuke:(3/5) A Hikikomori. \\n\r\nChihiro Sengoku:(3/5) Dorm teacher of Sakurasou.\\n\\n\r\nA couple of supporting characters.\\n\\n\r\nKanda Yuuko:(1/5) She has brother complex. I'm not surprised. Most of the imoutos nowadays have brother complex anyway.\\n\r\nRita Ainsworth:(3/5) Kawashima Ami...is that you?\\n\\n\r\nFrom the list above, any scores below 3 means they're disliked. None of the characters were interesting. Of course, all of the scores above are just my opinion. Though, it's nice to see character development going on.\\n\\n\r\n*In some of the scenes, Shiina Mashiro really reminded me of Akemi Homura, a character which I really love in Madoka Magica. Perhaps the last two episodes of Madoka Magica are simply too memorable...\\n\\n\r\nArt/Visuals? Overall, it's great. Colors are bright and artstyle is gorgeous. Backgrounds are nice and Shiina Mashiro's artwork are incredible.\\n\\n\r\nSound? Voice acting is pretty good(Sorata yelling almost every time is rather aggravating). OP and ED are all J-Pop themed songs and I've only bothered to listen to them once. I do like J-pop songs, but only selected ones. There's some very beautiful background music being played during the sad scenes.\\n\\n\r\nConclusion? Sakurasou no Pet na Kanojo isn't the worst rom com I've watched and its far from being the best. To sum up, it's pretty average, despite the number of flaws it has. Unfortunately, Sakurasou just didn't live up to my expectations. Not even close.",

            "content": "Once in a while, it's nice to be pleasantly surprised. Going into something with a synopsis like Sakurasou, I honestly wasn't expecting much, but the end result was nice way to finish such a great series like this.\r\nKeep in mind this is my first review. I'm not going to dive into why I picked numbers for each category because I find it pretty repetitive, but more strictly my enjoyment and impressions I have towards this anime. So by all means, I'm no expert in anime, I just watch what seems enjoyable for me.\r\nOne of Sakuraou\u2019s most redeeming factors is the atmosphere from the characters/ setting.Sakurasou is not a typical setting like your group of friends or a school club. Our setting is that of Sakurasou, a rather different dorm that is home to individuals that are quite \u201cunique\u201d yet extremely talented. However, it\u2019s in this sense that Sakurasou offers a large and diverse, and while rather clich\u00e9, cast that provides a lot of depth and humor. \\n\\n\r\nMost noteworthy is our oblivious and rather emotionless female lead Mashiro, who brings the concept of a girl who has for all her life painted pictures and has no clue how to take care of herself. Her character overall works well with the over exaggerated actions of the male lead in charge of her, Sorata, and provides a humorous dynamic that many slice of lifes lack. The many other residents also play a vital role in this series, ranging from the tsundere friend who also likes Sorata, Nanami, to the random, jubilant, and talented animator Misaki. All of these characters complement the duo rather well, and are accompanied with their own meaningful back stories.\\n\\n\r\nSo by reading this far, it seems all this anime would have a rather shallow plot with the normal clich\u00e9 characters. That\u2019s where I was largely surprised by this anime. I was fearful of this anime just in the sense that it had 24 episodes, which always suffers from pointless fillers that deters viewers from watching it. However, this anime is unique in the sense that it juggles many different ideas and maintains it well.\\n\\n\r\nAlthough the first three episodes were quite slow and lacked much plot movement, episode four was one of these first indicators that showed that even a show like this can have depth, and displayed drama and development that some series take 12 episodes/finales to reach. The introduction of Sorata\u2019s ambitions at the start to be a game maker contrasts beautifully with Mashiro\u2019s brilliance. While Sorata faces the hardships and realities of being a newbie game maker, Mashiro eases her way to the top as new manga artist. And Sorata experiences those feelings of when somebody is better than you.\\n\\n\r\nJealously. Hatred. Frustration.\\n\\n\r\nI found it to be quite relatable and understandable. Does one give up if they can\u2019t be successful at something? Or is there something beyond failure? Many of the characters of this series meet this question and ask themselves the same thing.\\n\\n\r\nSakurasou\u2019s pacing is pretty solid, allowing it to nail its melodrama while also maintaining its comedic feeling. While I\u2019m not a huge fan for melodrama because it\u2019s always overdone and cheesy, I felt a lot of drama in Sakurasou was on-level and believable. The balance of comedy and drama, switching from serious moments to ones full of sexual innuendos and jokes, really helped the pacing out. The comedy is revolved around the character\u2019s personalities, so if you have a liking towards all the characters, you\u2019ll enjoy the sexual and awkward moments of Sorata and Mashiro or the embarrassing outburst of Nanami.\\n\\n\r\nAs you would expect, you\u2019re going to have your moments of fan service and perhaps overdramatic moments to the point where it\u2019s silly, but I don\u2019t think it really deters the series as a whole. Yes, sometimes the fan service is a bit silly and unneeded, but as long as we\u2019re not getting panty shots every 5 minutes, it doesn't affect the series as a whole. As the series progresses into a more serious mood, the quite attractive scenes of Mashiro fade out (sorry if you enjoy them). And yes, Mashiro is a love and hate character. If you hate her, you probably won\u2019t like this series.\\n\\n\r\nEnd result? Something that catches you off guard. A romance comedy with a unique feel that truly hits home. Great atmosphere of characters and cast, and solid pacing that intertwines comedy and drama. If you\u2019re a romance comedy fan, by all means watch this if you want something with a change of pace.\\n\\n\r\nSakurasou no pet na Kanojo was quite the ride and I\u2019ll sincerely miss this series. Even though it won\u2019t happen, I\u2019d love a season 2.\\n\\n\r\nThanks for reading my block of text, and if you survived this far, please leave any comments or criticism on my profile so I can improve my future reviews.",

            "content": "\"Over the last three years here at Sui High, I've made many dear friends. And what allowed me to meet them... was a student dorm called Sakurasou.\" - Misaki\r\nThe Pet Girl of Sakurasou. When I first read the little summary of it on MAL I got the horrible feeling in my stomach it would be very sexually forward with a lot of fan service and very little plot/char. development. I thank God today that I'm terrible at guessing plots to anime, and I will take this second to simply say \"I apologize\" to the writer for having low expectations. Because I could not have possiblybeen more wrong.\\n\\n\r\nThis story is about a group of what I can only describe as misfit geniuses. These are the rejects of the school, and at the same time some of the most artistically gifted students at Sui High. For various reasons, be it financial or social, they each have ended up in the cheapest and fairly rundown Co-Ed dorm at the school, Sakurasou. Kouhai (The main male protagonist) was forced to move into the dorm after he tried to take care of a stray cat he found, however dorm regulations forbid him to keep it unless he moved. So of course, he decided to move until he could \"find another owner for it\". However, by the time the show opens up on the present at the start of out story, rather than him making any progress, he has actually taken in like... 10 more cats. As I said, so at the open of the show Chihiro sensei (runs the dorm) asks Kouhai to go pick up a transfer student who will be moving into Sakurasou. That transfer student is none other than the beautiful, quiet, legendary artist Mashiro. He comes to find out she is essentially incapable of taking care of herself on her own, so in the same nature as his cats, he takes on the responsibility of being on \"Mashiro duty\". \\n\r\nThe misfits have many little adventures and antics and overcome many trials during their time at Sakurasou.  As time passes friendships form and grow, bonds grow stronger, fights, love, tears, all come into play among the six friends of Sakurasou. \\n\\n\r\nNow Ill do that thing where you separate it into sections\\n\\n\r\nArt\\n\r\nActually, even though I'm not big on being able to tell huge differences and intricate details between different anime, this show's art really stood out. It felt smooth, clean, and beautiful. I daresay it was made to look so as to reflect the fact that they are all artistic students in their various fields, to match the level of beauty they themselves can create. The only other anime I know of with animation better than this would be Nagi no Asakura. So that's pretty darn good. I appreciated the high quality.\\n\\n\r\nMusic, Sound\\n\r\nNot a pro on music, I can basically tell you whether I \\n\r\n1. Liked the OP and ED. (I really did)\\n\r\nand\\n\r\n2. thought the music distracted me from the show or helped to amplify it. (It blended well and I liked it just fine. Nothing to report back negative on.\\n\\n\r\nStory Quality/ Why I Enjoyed It\\n\\n\r\nThis has to be one of the best stories of friendship and love I've ever seen. Now when I say love I mean it in a universal way. Not JUST romantic love, although there is plenty of that. I mean also the love between friends. Best friends. Think of a friend of yours who is the absolute most important friend you don't want to have to be without. Now take six of y'all and go live in a dorm together. That's in essence what you have here. The plot was paced very well, nothing happened too quick or too slow. The pain and struggles each character went through had me feeling like I was right there struggling with them. Is that not a powerful thing? When a story can draw you in so much that when something big happens, whatever it may be, it has the power to make you FEEL emotion. And no I'm not talking about \"man I'm so pissed the plot went in this direction\". No... I'm talking about when you see a character get their heart broken, you feel for them, you cry with them. It's really not easy for an anime to do that. But for me, this did. \\n\r\nI'm telling you, Misaki's graduation speech TORE ME UP (that means it made me cry).\\n\\n\r\nClosing Thoughts\\n\r\nI highly recommend this show to anyone who loves a good story about the bond between friends. And young love. This show is as funny as it is sad, as it is heartwarming as it is beautiful. \\n\\n\r\nHats off to Sakurasou no Pet na Kanojo.\\n",

            "content": "So, just to get this out of the way, Sakurasou no Pet na Kanojo is a high school, romantic comedy drama based off the light novels of the same name whose main draw comes from the characters and how they interact with each other. To be completely honest, when I first heard about Sakurasou no Pet na Kanojo before it even aired, I fully expected it to be a \u201cweird-girl harem comedy\u201d, and the first couple episodes really did nothing to change that opinion. However, as the show progressed, I found that I never could have been more wrong.\r\nThe story revolves around Kanda Sorata, asecond-year in high school who gets sent to Sakurasou because he took in and cared for a cat in the normal dorms (which is not allowed, obviously). Sakurasou is an old boarding house where the \u201cloonies\u201d of the school reside and there is a myth among the student body that once you get sent to Sakurasou, you can never return to the normal dorms. Sorata just sees this as a temporary phase and vows to get out of Sakurasou as soon as possible by getting someone to adopt the cat he found but, he soon finds that the eccentric residents of Sakurasou begin to grow on him. The comedy within the series focuses mostly on the Japanese style of comedy called \u201cmanzai\u201d (look it up if you're curious) and at times the comedy can be pretty funny but it can get stale after a while. The story is, in my eyes, really just a stage to set up the interactions between the characters but, that is not to say it is bad- it has some interesting twists to it. Indeed, I particularly enjoyed the story and the way things played out but, I will say something outright and that is: Sakurasou no Pet na Kanojo is not all smiley-faces and rainbows. The anime has a theme of cruel, harsh realism and not everything goes peachily for the cast but, when things did go right, I felt the very same happiness, relief, and triumph the characters felt. To put it simply, the story is an enjoyable emotional roller coaster ride where I somehow felt connected to the characters as though I was with them for the ride.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters in Sakurasou are the main draw of the anime, and there are an equal number of \u201cnormal\u201d characters to \u201cweird\u201d or \u201cgenius\u201d characters. From the uncontrollable and wild Misaki to the recluse Ryuunosuke, each character is unique and feels as though they \u201cbelong\u201d amongst the cast. That is to say, none of the main cast of characters are one-dimensional and each have their own back-story and motivations; they're not just characters thrown in randomly for effect and best of all, they feel like real (strange) people. By the end, I really got a feel for how the characters act and feel, and why they do so in the first place. As I mentioned above, I felt connected to the characters and cared for them; whatever happened to the characters in the anime- all of them- affected me, whether it was the bitterness of defeat or the joy of sweet victory.\\n\\n\r\nThe art and animation in Sakurasou is good but is generally nothing spectacular or over-the-top. The one exception, however, is Mashiro's art which is often pretty amazing, befitting her status as a world-renowned artist. While I didn't particularly like the back-ground music, openings, or endings too much, I didn't think that they were bad; they fit the anime well and the transitions into the ending themes were often smooth. The voice acting is pretty good overall and accurately displays how the characters are feeling moment to moment, which is pretty amazing in Mashiro's case since she is usually dull and monotone. I particularly enjoyed Nanami's quirk of lapsing into Osaka dialect at times and, with my limited knowledge of what the Japanese language sounds like, it never sounded fake or too forced. One last thing to mention is the anime often makes references other things, in particular to Toradora! with the Palm-top Tiger design showing up consistently. Like Sakurasou, Toradora! was also produced by J.C. Staff.\\n\\n\r\nSo, to sum it up, Sakurasou no Pet na Kanojo is an enjoyable emotional roller coaster with interesting characters and is an anime that I would recommend to just about anyone who enjoys romantic comedies or dramas. To be completely honest, I often waited on watching episodes rather than watch them right when they came out because, at times, I was afraid the drama would be overbearing but, in the end, I didn't really find anything I really disliked about this anime and I felt the package as a whole was delivered excellently.\\n\\n\r\n9 out of 10",

            "content": "Sakurasou no Pet na Kanojo is an artistic anime that blends together a colorful array of different anime themes. There's plenty of comedy, school romance, a loveable cast, emotional dramatic scenes, and... cute girls. These themes unfold into the grand events within and without the walls of Sakurasou.\r\nSakurasou tells the story of a basic, bland-haired male who has to take care of a genius, empty-headed bishoujo. Around him are fellow Sakurasou members, friends, family, and enemies. OK, maybe not that last one. The story isn't groundbreaking, but what it unfolds into is what makes Sakurasou a bit better than average.\r\nSince the story is set ina school setting, there isn't much Sakurasou brings to the table. I'll admit Sakurasou does a neat job at forming arcs that are unparalleled, though only a handful of them are remotely interesting.\\n\\n\r\nSakurasou's strongest trait lies within the cast. The main and supporting cast blended well; sometimes I would forget that some characters were not main characters. There were a plethora of quote-worthy scenes, such as Mashiro Shiina's \"I belive in pantsu\" quote.  It was a pleasure to observe the many different interests and character flaws collide together like one big painting. Many of the characters' decisions were heavily influenced by their relationships with others, which sets the ground for its drama. The cast consists of a seiyuu-to-be with a dialect, a shut-in computer wiz, a crazy, perverted senpai, and... a basic, bland-haired male with a boring personality.\\n\\n\r\nThe artwork for Sakurasou is simply pretty. The character models are all very appealing, and the backgrounds complement the vivid artsy themes of Sakurasou. In terms of music, the first OP is bouncy, while the ED is catchy. The latter OP and ED are also beautiful songs, and match the drama fairly well.\\n\\n\r\nThe voice cast did a fantastic job. Kiyano Ai as expressionless Mashiro Shiina, Nakatsu Mariko as dialect-heavy Aoyama Nanami, and Takamori Natsumi as the playful Kamiigusa Misaki were splendid. Their voice work, along with the other voice actors/actresses just added to the already delightful cast.\\n\\n\r\nSakurasou had a handful of flaws, however. It should be noted that the latter, dramatic half of the season was mediocre at best. The drama felt forced often times, and was boring to watch after the ground was laid out. The notion of having a pet girl at Sakurasou seemed to have been dropped in the latter half as well; stories of taking care of Shiina are all overwritten with the dramatic romance. Some of the characters developed way too late, or didn't really develop at all. Others seemed to pop out of the sky (Akasaka Ryuunosuke). Unfortunately, these character development flaws fell onto a majority of the main cast, especially Mashiro Shiina.\\n\\n\r\nAnother glaring problem is the bland story to Sakurasou. It certainly grasped the nichijou (daily life) of students with career goals, but it didn't do so in a way that made the viewer feel compelled to care. It's great to see students try hard for their dreams, but it isn't entertaining, especially in Sakurasou's case. The backstory presented for a number of the main cast did a poor job of drawing sympathy for their cause (at least for me, anyways).\\n\\n\r\nDespite Sakurasou's many problems, it still stands as a satisfactory anime. It's a fairly fun watch, but unfortunately, it does not stand out very well. The story is adequate, the cast is up to par, and the overall execution ranges from suitable (first half) to mediocre (latter half). Sakurasou isn't exceptional, but I would say it is a tad above average. Sakurasou no Pet na Kanojo does not pass with many flying colors; it only passes with a few.",

He has the habit of picking up cats and caring for them. His dorm though doesn'tallow pets, that's why he moves to Sakurasou the dorm for trouble students.\\n\r\nEarly on he is tasked to keep an eye out for a talented girl (Mashiro) who has trouble of dealing with everyday tasks and socializing with people, but otherwise is a genius artist.\\n\\n\r\nThe premise sound generic at first. A ordinary highschool boy meets mysterious girl. But it goes far beyond that. The story revolves around the problematic of overcoming your own jealousy.\\n\r\nHow to continue doing what you do, even though you find yourself in a world where there is always someone better than you.\\n\\n\r\nI personally felt really attached to this concept since it is something that drags me down often as well. I gave up on many things because more talented people stepped into my life. It's hard to struggle with the hatred that occurs inside you when you deal with these people.\\n\\n\r\nAbout the event that happen otherwise isn't much to say. We have a lot of fanservice, comedic situations, a lot of drama and also some romance.\\n\r\nThe pacing is rather slow since it turns more serious later in the show, which is sad since a lot of people might have given up by then with the overall generic-ness of the show.\\n\r\nBut we get a lot more later on.\\n\r\nRomance, Drama and a rather satisfying and mature ending.\\n\\n\r\nOverall the Story isn't particular deep or anything but well founded and relateable.\\n\\n\r\n6/10\\n\\n\r\nAnimation:\\n\\n\r\nWhat can I say about Sakurasou... well it does look average. There is no crazy choreography or battle scenes. No amazing fluidity. But it has an overall nice artstyle.\\n\r\nLight colors, very warm, many oranges and reds were used. The backgrounds looked good but not outstanding.\\n\r\nThe character designs, though generic \"moe\" were well made and distinct.\\n\r\nI personally liked them.\\n\r\nThe quality was overall good and kept its standards.\\n\r\nAnd that's it.\\n\r\nSakurasou is not an animation-heavy show. It doesn't rely too much on fancy visuals but also looks pretty and modern.\\n\\n\r\n7/10\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\\n\r\nAs voiceactors we get... *drumroll*\\n\\n\r\nYoshitsugu Matsuoka; aka Kirito from Sword Art Online.\\n\r\nThis is a hit or miss, if he bothers you because you didn't like him in SAO well.. but bad.\\n\r\nI personally like Matsuoka, he is a fresh new voice talented and gives the Beta Male MC of this area a different voice than Kaji Yuki...\\n\\n\r\nBesides that I didn't find anyone particular outstanding but mention able would be Mariko Nakatsu, for voicing a voice actress. Must be weird hah!\\n\r\nThe rest did a good job. The voiceacting is modern and natural overall.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is fitting but not rememberable. It just works with this type of show, has a good variety but isn't the kind of music I'd listen to outside the show.\\n\\n\r\nThe same is true for the Opening and Ending. Though the second ending had a nice beginning which was sometimes used effectively.\\n\\n\r\nSound isn't really the strongest Point of Sakurasou but also not bad in any way.\\n\\n\r\n5,5/10 ~ 5/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\\n\r\nOh boy, I could say a lot about the characters, but I try to keep it short.\\n\\n\r\nLets start with the good.\\n\r\nSorata Kanda starts off as a submissive beta male as we all know them from various school anime. But later becomes more depths. He by far was the most interesting character of the show because he dealt with the crushing feeling of failing and dealing with someone who doesn't fail. His overall nice personality is questioned many times by a dark and cruel side of him he internally fights.\\n\r\nHe often snaps and shows real human emotions, and behavior.\\n\r\nWhile the rest also starts of as your typical school rom-com cast:\\n\r\n - The childhood friend who is in love with the MC and also is a tsundere\\n\r\n - the emotionless girl that also has some weird crush on the MC\\n\r\n - the genki oppai girl always up (but here sometimes down)\\n\r\n - the gigolo/perverted friend. though more on the mature end\\n\r\n - and all the other side characters you can think of\\n\r\nBut everyone of them shows in the progression of the show real problems, and crisis.\\n\r\nOf course you have to deal with stereotypes for the most part, but they are overall a good relatable cast, which have their flaws and never feel too one sided.\\n\\n\r\nIt's also funny how characters become more likable the further the show progresses. It is evidence of character progression.\\n\r\nSomeone who has seen many Rom-Coms in his life might probably not open up to them, but for people who are fairly new to the genre they are a great cast!\\n\\n\r\n 8/10\\n\\n\r\nValue:\\n\\n\r\nThough there might be a second season I doubt it will. A rewatch is also unlikely, but not impossible.\\n\r\nI do recommend this show though, and I already did!\\n\\n\r\nI will keep this anime for a while in the back of my mind but it wasn't anything life changing. Though for 2012 it was one of the better shows.\\n\r\nIt's also nice to see that JC Staff does something that isn't just meh and Light Novels are not all shit (SAO).\\n\r\nBut personally I like LN and their adaptations for the most part.\\n\r\nBut to be honest. With all these School anime they have one flaw.\\n\r\nThe likelihood this will have any effect on the industry or might be something regarded a gem in anime later is very low.\\n\r\nThat's why it can only get a ...\\n\\n\r\n2/10 (but this does not include my enjoyment!)\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\\n\r\nI fairly enjoyed the show. It looked nice, but not outstanding, the soundtrack was fitting and the Voiceactors did a good job.\\n\r\nThe premise and plot was interesting, and the character drama meaningful enough to be taken seriously.\\n\r\nWell but with all of these shows it never exceeds to be really serious, which is okay!\\n\r\nI had fun, was looking forward to next episodes even if I sometimes was raging over some things like once...\\n\\n\r\n\"I modified your post [sakurasou forum link to my post], because it was offensive and contained too much profanity.\"\\n\\n\r\nThat was me raging hard. Something that meant I took the show serious enough.\\n\\n\r\n7/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall I give this show a 6/10 because it manages to be above average and was entertaining as well as gave me some insight on my own personal feelings. Nothing deep or life changing but a nice take on something we probably all once felt.\\n",

            "content": "\"This area feels weird, it's been throbbing hard since that time.\"\r\n-Mashiro Shiina, Episode 12\r\nMy god, everyone seems to have a total hard-on for this show. Why? Nearly every previous review for this shit has been a 10. Is there something I missed while watching this? Seriously, what's so amazing about it?\r\nSo characters: you got your generic numbnuts male protagonist who's usually too fuckin' scared to say what he really means, a schizophrenic or something, a generic tsundere, the generic sex-crazed pervert character, and some other annoying chick. Sounds great already!\r\nThe setting: 1700's France? No, fuck you, it's a school. What did you expect?\r\nOk, to befair, it's more of like a special arts school or something, but it's still, nonetheless, a school.\\n\\n\r\nSo what is this show about? I dunno, friendship? The wonders of growing up? Fuck, if I know. All I know is that this did NOT need to be made into 24 episodes. What was the point of it all? The main plot can be easily summarized quickly:\\n\\n\r\n>guy lives with crazy people\\n\r\n>girl comes to live with crazy people and becomes the guy's friend\\n\r\n>fanservice\\n\r\n>another girl notices and gets upset\\n\r\n>she comes and lives with them\\n\r\n>occasional bullshit argument\\n\r\n>cousin or whoever comes to take first girl away\\n\r\n>doesn't\\n\r\n>happy ending?\\n\\n\r\nDid that really need to go on for 24 episodes? Does everyone who enjoy this actually think this is a good plot? Am I really missing something? (No, fuck your useless bullshit subplots)\\n\\n\r\nMaybe I wouldn't be so pissed about this if it wasn't so long and everyone would shut up about it. So many times, people have this on their top 10 romance anime lists and I just don't believe it. What's to like about this?\\n\\n\r\nTwo more notable things that pissed me off:\\n\r\n1. At times, this shit really felt like a harem and I personally despise harems.\\n\r\n2. The main protagonists announce their love at the very end. It's misery. You watched the show for an accumulated 12 hours, and all you get in return is some sappy bullshit. It's not worth it. It's never worth it.\\n\\n\r\nThey say the journey is better than the destination, but not if the journey is equally bullshit. This was a waste of time, a forgettable experience, and I have absolutely nothing to show for it. I'm upset to have seen this..",

            "content": "Sakurasou.... where to start. I am a huge sucker for romantic school kind of animes but MANY times I was unable to find the right kind of anime. There were many many animes which just got dull and boring straight from the start. But Sakurasou had me captivated and eager which made me wait every week for the new episode to come out. I even wanted to learn Japanese just so I could watch this anime raw!!!! (Which means i get too watch it faster :D) This anime, like many kinds of anime had its up and downs. And it was these ups and downsmaking me eager to see how they would solve such relationship problems.\\n\\n\r\nGreat Romantic school genres like I have mentioned before was something that was very hard for me to find. When I read this animes summary I can't deny that I wasn't very tempted to begin watching this anime. But i persevered and I am very glad I did. I felt like god had shined the internet light of faith on me when i stumbled upon this anime. I practically screamed HALLEJUAH!\\n\\n\r\nStory: For me this was the biggest thing that dragged me into this anime. The title ''Sakurasou no Pet na Kanojo'' translated to english just means the pet girl of Sakurasou. The ''pet girl'' is none other than Mashiro Shinna the genius painter who is BEAUTIFFFULLLL. But she totally can't look after herself. That's where the main character comes on. Sorata Kanda just your average high schooler who has the job of looking after Shiina. You can tell that these two characters themselves just scream DRAMA at your face. And what good drama it was. It had me crying with the characters and sometimes had me screaming at them like WHY U SO DUMB. The relationship between Mashiro and Sorata was also quite a sight. Still all in all this had me hooked like a fish and I am very glad I saw this anime to the end. I GIVE THE STORY A 10!!!!\\n\\n\r\nArt: This anime had very beautiful visuals. It could portray the characters emotion perfectly and this helped the story so much. The characters were well drawn and the art was light. But dark as well when it needed to be. The art all around was good- wait GREAT. I felt that at some points the art did lack a bit but all in all I couldn't have wished for anything better. I HEREBY GIVE THE ART A 9!!!!\\n\\n\r\nSound: This was also an excellent part of the anime. The intro song was very catchy and although I skip many animes intro songs I wouldn't even think of doing that for this one. The music throughout the anime was also great. It helped with all the moods, light and dark. I felt that the music helped give the viewers a more emotion in the story. The voice acting of all the characters were SPECTACULAR. Mashiro's bored and emotionless voice could not have been better portrayed. All the characters had great voices and I applaud all the voice actors for that. The end song of this anime was also very catchy. Not much I can say about that hahaha. AND THUS I GIVE THE SOUND/MUSIC/VOICE A 10!!!!\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: The characters were also one of the parts that made Sakuraso stand out to me. In some people's eyes the character's may seem to be one of those well used cliche type of characters. A talented but social-lacking girl, an absolute normal high schooler, a loud, funny sempai, wise old playboy, shut in technical genius and the seemingly uninteresting but is actually interesting teacher. All these kinds of characters may have been used in many kinds of animes but I felt that Sakurasou was one of the only ones who actually used them to their fullest potential. I don't see any other animes out there with this much potential. If you can find some them I'd be glad to have a watch. CHARACTER. SCORE. A. 10!!!!\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: I will just go out and say it but I give this animes enjoyment level a 10. Why? Because this is one of those animes that I find hard to put off. It had me hanging off my chair waiting for each new episode too come out. And having finished this anime I fear that another romantic anime of this potential may not come for another 5000 years...\\n\\n\r\nSo anyways overall I enjoyed this anime immensely and I hope you readers of this boring review can find a few seconds... Or a minute... Or a hour... Or a day... Actually a couple of days if u watch it little by little, in your important schedule to watch this delightful anime. OVERALL I GIVE THIS ANIMES OVERALL SCORE A.......... 10!!!!",

            "content": "Well, I don't normally go out of my way to write reviews.\r\nBut wow...\r\nThis show deserves it.\r\nWithin the first four minutes or so I thought this anime was going to be typical Harem or some annoying romance that attempts to sway you by overly cliche one-liners and pompous ass shots, but oh how was I wrong.\r\n**NO SPOILERS**\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nStory: \r\nThe story is unique in this anime because it does something that I really don't see very often in literature these days.\r\nIts actually a generally sad story, but the reason its sad isn't because of stream that which guides the plot; i.e., war, death, dystopia, anarchy, evil tyrant, etc.,but more so the realism that reflects in how the characters develop around one another.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime really sheds light on the unspoken feelings that revolve consistently in any given relationship; Jealousy, Envy, Heartbreak, etc, but the best of it is that its not delivered to us the way a typical Shoujo would; using extras, realization characters, stereotypical events (The beach, Vacationing) to push the relationship forth. In fact, the relationship is merely a catalyst for the primary conflict WITHIN the main character that is that he must breach the revelation that is his true aspirations and goals in his life.\\n\\n\r\nAnother great thing about this anime is that the story isn't ENTIRELY about the relationship. Its about friendship, and the coalition of people gathering together and forming bonds that help bring unite them. For lack of a better phrase, you essentially watch a family be created right before your very eyes.\\n\\n\r\nAnd let me tell you, its truly heartwarming scene indeed.\\n\\n\r\nRating: 10.\\n\r\ntl;dr:\\n\r\nFriendship oriented. Romance is not the 100% primary story element. Realistic scenarios. Realistic characters. Self-Realization. Failure.\\n\\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\\n\r\nIt guess it goes without saying that the art in this show is phenomenal. Then again, it seems almost ridiculous to even have to mention this statistic nowadays. Being that this is a modern anime, the technology used to develop this piece of work couldn't be anything less than perfect.\\n\\n\r\nFrom a cinematographic standpoint, it was perhaps twenty-five frames a second. \\n\\n\r\nThe scenes are well choreographed to invoke particular emotions or thoughts at a particular scene. The lighting was realistic and pleasant to watch, details fell down to a simple swaying tree to present that the wind was breezing by. Sakura petals streamed in the luminosity of their stellar backdrops. Clouds, buildings, shadows, toning, glitter, facial expressions - everything seemed to present itself beautifully.\\n\\n\r\nChibi moments are gloriously prepared and orchestrated in comic situations and were not overused. \\n\\n\r\nRating: 10.\\n\r\ntl;dr:\\n\r\nIts a modern anime. If you don't like the art, you need to see an optometrist.\\n\\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\\n\r\nWhen rating sound I always find it necessary to comment on the voice actors work. Of the array of characters, I was definitely satisfied with all of the voices portrayed. Even accents and slang was correctly articulated by the actors. No one seemed too annoying or too bitter. The characters were well delivered to the audience.\\n\\n\r\nSecondly, the OST is an excellent mix of both tragically sad and joyously happy music, the orchestration reflecting the scenes and attitudes of the given characters. It was honestly well made, and I have little argument against them. \\n\\n\r\nThe various ending themes and opening themes were easily rememberable and had a gleaming feeling to it.\\n\\n\r\nRating: 10.\\n\r\ntl;dr:\\n\r\nAcoustic. Piano. Depressing yet Joyful. Excellent voice acting.\\n\\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\\n\r\nThis anime has a bit of everything. The diversity of the characters gives a bit of something to love in everyone. You have your stereotypical nerd, the glossy white haired innocent, the childhood friend clinging to romance with the male lead, the overly eccentric genius girl and her loyal companion side kick. Sakurasou no Pet na Kanojo certainly has a little bit of everything.\\n\\n\r\nBut what stunned me enough to give this a such a high rating was that the characters were surprisingly dynamic and realistic in how they acted, given their roles. \\n\\n\r\nPerseverance through strength and friendship became the overwhelming theme of the story, and the characters somehow all coordinated around one another and aided each other in their quest to realize themselves and their futures.\\n\\n\r\nThe romance aspect is somewhat of a skewed triangle. While it is blatantly obvious that Shiina and Sorata are destined for one another, Aoyama still attempts at the boy, so as to give off the perspective of insecurity that she holds within herself. This helps her when she transitions to maturity, and once again reflects the overwhelming principle that friendship prevails.\\n\\n\r\nRating: 10\\n\r\ntl;dr:\\n\r\nNot too dramatized. Simple yet complex. Realistic. Love affairs. Friendship.\\n\\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\\n\r\nComments regarding enjoyment lie in the principle that this anime is not directed towards those that are eagerly looking for some Shoujo Romance, or some outstanding moral conclusion about life.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime is carefree, yet it breathes through the seemingly minor conflicts that arising during adolescence that truly impact the entity of our lives. It brushes upon realistic issues about growing up and realizing that the world is larger than yourself. \\n\\n\r\nI honestly couldn't stop tuning in every Monday to watch this show. It had a pleasant mixture of comedy and seriousness that left me satisfied to the core.\\n\r\nRating: 10\\n\r\ntl;dr:\\n\r\nIt was a fun experience, and a proper message.\\n\\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\\n\r\nI would find it insulting to the author if I rating this anything less than a masterpiece. While there were things that seemed overly done and a bit exaggerated, a grand majority of this anime was flawless.\\n\\n\r\nIts a shame that there are so little of these \"oh so perfect\" diamonds out there.\\n\\n\r\nIf you don't like this anime, I would honestly like you to PM me with your reasoning because you need to be enlightened.\\n\\n\r\nRating 10.\\n\r\ntl;dr:\\n\r\nStellar anime\\n\r\nGreat message. Great Art. Great soundtrack. Excellent Characters. Lasting appeal.\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Every journey begins with the first step.\r\nSakurasou no Pet na Kanojo (also known as The Pet Girl of Sakurasou) is an anime series based off the light novel with a manga adaptation also written in the works by Hajime Kamoshida. The story tells of a group of young people and details the lives of them, especially Sorata Kanda the main protagonist who recently got kicked out of his school dorm after picking up a stray cat. Thus, he moves to the Sakurasou dormitory where he meets Mashiro Shiina, a strange girl with a very talented skill.\r\nThus, let his new life begin!\r\nThe story of the seriesis quite lighthearted to say the least, even judging by the title. We have two main protagonists - Mashiro Shiina and Sorata Kanda who shares a very strange relationship. Although beautiful, Mashiro is known to be a very peculiar girl with a talented skill in her skills of crafting artwork. However, she also has absolutely no knowledge about common sense or the factors of daily life. Now, raise your hand! Do you want to live with a beautiful girl like that? Perhaps some might be but in Kanda's case, it's literally hell for him. Waking up every day and seeing a beautiful girl like Mashiro may sound like a dream come true for any guy but it's a lot harder for Mashiro than he'll ever imagine. It usually spells out for misunderstandings, drama, and situations that puts Sorata at frustration.\\n\\n\r\nThe way they meet is quite expected based on the common gags and tropes we see in the anime industry today. They meet in a park of joy and prosperity. The duo lives in the same dorm, eats the same food, but are totally opposites in terms of their personalities and ways of life. For one thing, it's up to Sorata to wake up every day and take care of her. It's like a master and pet relationship in the sense that Sorata Kanda plays the role of the caretaker. On the other hand, Mashiro is the \u201cpet girl\u201d of Sakurasou, as the title says. It's pretty generic but at the same time pleasant to watch because the two's relationship and the depth of how the duo interacts on several episodes. It is also surprisingly entertaining in the way of Mashiro's speech pattern in which her brutal honesty often is (and humorously most of the time) is misinterpreted by other characters.\\n\\n\r\nOh but that's just the tip of the iceberg. As some may expect, the Sakurasou dorm has more than just these two residents. Among some of the other members includes Sorata's classmate, Nanami Aoyama who portrays the typical tsundere and insecure girl. Often times, she treats Sorata harshly but deep down cares for him and the others. At the same time, it's quite easy to tell that she is insecure regarding her own future in the voice acting industry. Furthermore, it seems that the interactions between Sorata and Mashiro has put her mind under a bit of frustration of seeing them together. It's no surprise that she is the character who plays the rival in a potential love triangle of the story.\\n\\n\r\nThe other characters also portrays the typical gags in this anime. We have the all enthusiastic and sometimes crazy girl, Misaki who is hyperactive in the things she do. We have the smooth talking Jin Mitaka who is known for being a womanizer with his smooth talking skills but at the same time deeply cares for his friends. Then, there's the other characters such as the trap Ryunosuke who specializes in his techno gadgets. Also, let's not forget about Rita who used to be Mashiro's caretaker but at the same time feels a sort of resentment and jealousy towards her. All of these characters plays a sort of role in the development in the story especially in regarding Sorata and Mashiro. In fact, it's easy to see how much they come just half way into the series. At the same time though, it's clear that these two still need a bit of development to forge a more solid relationship especially with some rages issues from Sorata.\\n\\n\r\nAs mentioned before, Mashiro is a girl who lacks common sense. Yet upon closer examination, she can quite an appealing character. The series often portrays her as a typical dumb blonde in terms of common sense. However, she is very caring for her friends and tries her best to earn the respect and love of everyone. Mashiro is also quite hardworking with her works by slaving all day and night on her manga and strives to not give up especially when she knows that there are others who inspires her to become what she wants to be. In a generic show such as this, it is surprising that we can see how far some characters can become with hard work, determination, and friends.\\n\\n\r\nThe show isn't totally perfect though as some of the gags used between each episode becomes repetitive and sometimes, overused. The fan service is present that sometimes appears out of random and is nothing more than nonsense. Most of the time, this falls under Mashiro's case and in the morning time when Sorata gets a surprise wake up call. In other cases, the dialogues that Mashiro speaks becomes exaggerated and forced. It's almost if the directors are trying to mix in too many things at once and sometimes, it just doesn't work out right. For example, the seemingly filler episode involving Sorata's little sister Yuuko seems to play little to no role in the overall progression of the story. She just seems to be another common gag added to the entire series. So now, they wanted to add the little sister type with all the other casts. Seriously, what?...\\n\\n\r\nLuckily though, there is hope for the series as some fans who originally thought this might be a harem is downplayed. In fact, the romance so far is quite lighthearted and non-explicit.The romance is almost humorous with the characters playing the roles in their shoes. With enthusiasm , shallowness, misunderstanding, or just being there, the romance of the series is surprisingly fun to look at.\\n\\n\r\nIn my mind, I found the artwork of the series to cute. The designs of the characters is lighthearted that has a soft touch to them with the way they are dressed. It's almost humorous sometimes especially with the way Mashiro dressing up the way she does in some of the earlier episodes. Sorata's over exaggeration in the series is also humorous to look at when he get caught up in a misunderstood situation. Overall, the movement of the artwork is done right to fit within this romantic comedy series. Now, if only Mashiro's manga will be more cuter as well...\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack and music of the series seems mediocre. Jin Aketagawa handles the choreography who strives to makes the series lighthearted during many of the scenes. In fact, it's no surprise that a lot of the series' comedic, dramatic, enthusiastic, or entertaining scenes are crafted to be lighthearted. Even the OP song, Kimi ga Yume wo Tsuretekita by Pet na Kanojo-tachi is known to be lighthearted and smooth which depicts a montage of the main characters and a tiny glimpse of their lives at the dorms. J.C. Staff is already known for some of their other works in the romantic comedy media such as Toradora, Hatsuoki Limited, and the recent Little Busters! What J.C. Staff presents here is what is their latest line of their evolution of works.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I found the series to be a charming gem. Despite the weak story and seemingly cliched humor, it is surprisingly entertaining. It's hard to present series like this as some fans may see it the wrong way originally. Yet, I found it to be quite charming. It's not exactly a masterpiece or something of a highlight of the year, but is crafted well with its cast of characters. It's funny how imagination sometimes can go so far to create a series like this but otherwise, I found Sakurasou Pet Kanojo to be quite an entertaining watch.",

            "content": "So. Finished The Pet Girl of Sakurasou, one of the most anticipated animes for the first quarter of 2013. My thoughts on the first episodes told me nothing but, \"Just another echii/rom-com, you've seen this all before\". Usually my brain is correct when it comes to watching animes for the first time.\r\nUsually.\r\nMy brain was dead wrong when it came to this one. The thing I love about being me is that despite how clich\u00e9 some romantic comedies are, I always finish them, no matter what. But this time I didn't need to power through it, and the season finale just made me want more. Theshow had hilarious comedy, an intriguing story, and the characters were all perfect.\\n\\n\r\nTo start off, let me explain something to rom-com lovers out there: It doesn't matter if a romantic comedy has multiple clich\u00e9s, such as meeting a girl in a certain area that'll have a huge purpose later in the show. What matters is how the people who made the romantic comedy will play it out. You could have one show with a story and have it end up being awful. On the other hand, you could have another story with the same story and have it end up being incredible. Luckily, The Pet Girl of Sakurasou ended up being on the incredible side. The story was unique, each episode was full of comedy, romance, and the occasional feels. There are moments of awkwardness and bitterness, but they all level out into moments of happiness and laughter. I really liked how they played the show out, and I'm really hoping for a season 2 with a storyline just as good as season 1.\\n\\n\r\n2013 has been looking up to be a great year in the art industry. The artwork gets more and more colorful and impressive every year anime continues to be made. Looking back in the 1990s, there was Evangelion, Cowboy Bebop, and many others with exceptional artwork for it's time. Now you look at the animes of today and you have Kotoura-san, Fairy Tail, Sword Art Online, etc, and you'll notice the difference that 20 years of experience can have on an animator. As for the Pet Girl of Sakurasou, this is a perfect example of the 20 year experience I was talking about. Colorful, detailed, beautiful... there are moments where I honestly wish that my life was more like an anime... alright, there isn't really 1 moment in my life where I wish it was more like an anime, who hasn't? Grade A artwork.\\n\\n\r\nThere isn't much to say about the audio in The Pet Girl of Sakurasou, except that the voice actors/actresses worked on their roles with real professionalism and realism. They fit the characters' personalities and I learned to like and respect them a lot.\\n\\n\r\nThis is the part I was looking forward to: character reviews. We have Sorata, the kind hearted/incredibly dense male protagonist of the show, who most animal-lovers will end up looking up towards due to the fact that he can't say no to helping out a homeless animal and giving it a home. Aww...  Then we have Mashiro, the quiet, and sometimes questionable female protagonist, and I say questionable because I've started to wonder how she has been living like 15 years and still doesn't know how to put on clothing without instructions. These are the 2 main characters of the show, who end up playing big roles in each other's lives, and I say that because Sorata is the one giving the instructions to Mashiro. We also have Aoyama who is Sorata's classmate, Misaki, the hyperactive senior living in the same dormitory as Sorata who is constantly causing trouble in a hilarious way, and finally Jin, the playboy/braniac of the group. All of them are considered to be main characters due to the fact they have a whole lot of screen time in the show and play vital roles in the story. Put them all together, and it's one big happy family, and I mean that, if you took one of them out, it wouldn't be the same, and that's how I like it.\\n\\n\r\nI started watching this by the time episode 18 was already released, and I watched all of the episodes already released in under 10 hours, and when I finally tried to hit the \"next\" button, \"Please wait until next week for episode 19 to be released\". That irritated the CRAP out of me. I just got into an amazing show and now I gotta wait a week to watch another episode, and then repeat that cycle until the season finale. Once it finally finished, it left me in tears and wanting more. I can safely say that this is probably one of my favorite animes released this year, no joke. I do agree that not everyone may enjoy it, especially those who hate waiting for characters to confess to each other, but trust me, it's worth the wait. Give it a few episodes. If you don't start enjoying it by episode 3... keep going. If you don't start enjoying it by episode 23... just watch the last episode, you're almost done with it, it's 24 minutes of your life. But I doubt it'll be a waste of time.",

            "content": "\"Every day was the same. Deep down, I felt bored. I wanted to blame someone for my being bored.\" - Kanda Sorata\r\nSakurasou no Pet na Kanojo follows the life of a high school student, Sorata, being forced to live in a dorm called Sakurasou for the 'special' students of the school after he breaks a rule of the regular dorms. The people living there are all very unique in their own way but seem to be the misfits of society. At first, our main character, Sorata, firmly sets his goal as leaving Sakurasou as soon as possible and does not intend to stay for long.However, after a period of time, especially after an English transfer student named Shiina Mashiro moves into Sakurasou, Sorata begins to rethink his plans.\\n\\n\r\nStory [9/10]\\n\\n\r\nThe story of Sakurasou no Pet na Kanojo is extremely realistic and is very well thought out. Combining romance, comedy and drama, the anime balances between these genres perfectly. A key theme of Sakurasou no Pet na Kanojo would be obstacles and hardships in life and how to overcome them. Even though most of the series is rather light-hearted, when one of the characters do fail after working so hard for their goal, you will feel an unexpected surge of emotions and sympathy for them. Apart from failure, the show also focuses on friendships. Unlike many other anime, Sakurasou no Pet na Kanojo does not have a very one-sided love triangle and develops the relationships in a unique manner. Viewers will not be biased specifically towards one outcome but be more willing to accept any of the relationships. Overall, the story of Sakurasou no Pet na Kanojo is heart-warming, realistic and beautiful.\\n\\n\r\nArt [10/10]\\n\\n\r\nThe art of Sakurasou no Pet na Kanojo was flawless. It was clean, polished and unique. When Sorata and Shiina first met under the cherry blossom trees, the way the petals were dancing as they fell from the trees was the most beautiful scene I have ever seen. Honestly, I can't complain about the art of this anime at all.\\n\\n\r\nSound [8/10]\\n\\n\r\nThe openings and endings of Sakurasou no Pet na Kanojo were cheerful and happy which really added to the light-heartedness of this anime. I've played these songs on Osu! many, many, many times and still do. I even listen to 'Days of Dash' when I go to school to remind me of the greatness of this anime. The soundtracks inside the show were also very fitting and suitable. The only reason it didn't score a 9 or 10 was that I just simply prefer some of the other soundtracks out there such as the Anohana ending.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter [10/10]\\n\\n\r\nFor me, the best part about any anime would be its characters. I can only enjoy a series thoroughly if it's got loveable, realistic and relatable characters. In this case, Sakurasou no Pet na Kanojo definitely ticks the box. After finishing this anime, I immediately went to put Shiina Mashiro and Kanda Sorata up on my favourite characters list. The characters in Sakurasou no Pet na Kanojo are all unique in their own way and the show provides great character development for all of them. By the end of Sakurasou no Pet na Kanojo, we get to learn about all six main characters' backgrounds and become very attached to each and every one of them. I honestly really miss all the times when everyone was gathered around the dining table having a hot pot in Sakurasou tradition.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment [10/10]\\n\r\nOverall [10/10]\\n\\n\r\nI love this anime and its characters with a passion, I really do. This anime has really allowed me to rethink my life and what I want to be and do when I'm older. It's a thought provoker, for sure and has impacted my life heavily. I've both laughed and cried and seriously, what a ride it has been. Sayonara, Sakurasou no pet na Kanojo!",

            "content": "The Pet Girl of Sakurasou is my favorite romance-comedy anime from the past couple years, for a couple of reasons. At first glance, the show seems like the usual perverted fan-service-shit everyone\u2019s grown accustom to these days as the first two episodes are filled with a beautiful clueless girl walking about blindly and nakedly around a teenage guys house with lots of ecchi moments (original huh)... However, I decided to not drop the series and I'm glad I didn't, because upon watching more of the show, I found that the story goes on it's own path, away from the generic rom-coms story (pretty well-written fora rom-com). Whereas many romance shows will focus solely on a friendship/love bond within like a love triangle or square, that takes place in school-some workplace and has tons of ecchi to keep perverted audience members interested, Sakurasou does beyond that. Something about this show halfway that caught my attention was that it's bright and cheerful when it should be (even more-so than other romance stories), but at the same time it contrasts itself perfectly with dark sides of life-romance that most generic rom-coms don't do. Sakurasou's story is actually a story, not an episodic romance drama that's controlled by the characters, which is a nice change of pace from romance anime nowadays. \\n\\n\r\nThe story revolves around the main character Sorata Kanda, who is forced to shift from a normal dorm to an eccentric dorm called Sakurasou, filled with delinquents, in order to keep his pet cat. The very (insert weird/annoying words here) personalities of his dorm roommates make Sorata tempting to leave, but then suddenly a super hot girl named Mashiro Shiina moves into Sakurasou. And... Mashiro seems to lack any common sense or knowledge of anything really - except painting/drawing which is she a master \"artist\" at. Anyways, Sorata is sort of forced to take care of Mashiro and help her out with the everyday tasks of life. Gradually, the dorm begins to become more livable for Sorato when more friendly and not-too-weird residents move in. And so... our romance triangle/comedy/touching-story begins. \\n\\n\r\nPersonally more than anything, I found Sakurasou No Pet Na Kanojo to be one of the most genuinely fun and touching shows to watch. This was a beautiful romance show that ranks somewhere near the top of my top anime list and you don't see someone like me whose into deep, psychological, horror, historic say something like that. More than anything, Sakurasou No Pet Na Kanojo is a story about the bond made between friends and all the wild times and the real and unexpected emotions that come with them. A big theme or concept in this story is one of \"dreams\" during youth. Mashiro asks Sorata (and others), \"What do you want to be?\" Everybody has their (probably outrageous) dreams and they may very well vary from age to age. As a child we probably wanted to be a Pokemon master, or a superhero. As a teen maybe we wanted to be a world famous actor, or artist or basketball player. In college people change courses/majors quite often in order to find something that suites themselves. What a person's dreams are will come to define that person's identity as who he/she is. But many people end up giving up on their dreams because they believe that \"it's too hard\", or \"I can't possibly do it\". Hope is something that's hard to come by unless there's some kind of motivation or reason. The main protagonist Sorata is like that. But he finds his motor, and sense of hope in Shiina Mashiro and this \"story\" of this rom-com truly reached out and grasped my attention/heart. You know how people always say practice makes perfect and hard-work always pays off? Well is that honestly true? The show serves as a simple but great watch and has its own morals to share at the end. Reminds me of my high-school, college days. A great, tender feeling indeed~ If you want a purely enjoyable rom-com then Sakurasou is the one to watch. The ending leaves the show \"unanswered\". I hope there's a season two, but as of now it doesn't seem like there will be which is very depressing considering they left it a cliffhanger with no concrete pair-ups and an introduction of a new character at the very very end.\\n\\n\r\nOut of all the slice of life anime series I've seen, Sakurasou definitely has one of the most memorable and adorable set of characters. Shiina Mashiro is probably my favorite female character from a romance series. At the beginning Mashiro seems like shes just there for fan service but as the story progresses she helps others find and reach out for their dreams. She maintains the happiness, purity and innocence that children should have during their youth. She seems all dumb (she's pretty clueless) but she honestly does have a deeper understanding of life/the world. She learns common sense and the meaning of friendship and love. She is the driving force of the other characters as well as the show itself. Sorata gets a lot of hate - blah blah blah for being dumb sometimes, but that's so oversold. Sorata is who he is, and he stays true to his character throughout. The other characters all played specific funny roles and added lots of enjoyment/comedy to the show. Although.. Yuuko Kanda was a pretty stupid and useless character... Anyways, a lot of shipping pairings will be shattered, but oh well that's what romance stories do. The developing friendship chemistry (and romance) between the characters was just beautiful to watch. As I'm writing this review I'm starting to realize just how much I really liked Sakurasou's set of characters. I wish real life could be this simple, innocent and fun.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound in the show were pretty good. I don't really like all \"cute\"- openings very much, but both of Sakurasou's openings were enjoyable to listen to - I liked them both. The endings were decent as well. The voicing crew did a marvelous job with each character's tone; fit their personality and looks perfectly. The dynamic voicing of each character certainly brought more \"life\" to the characters. It might sound cheesy, but I could feel the emotions that the characters wanted the audience to feel~ Heh... Anyways the animations were out of the roof, very colorful. J.C staff truly animates romance stories well. Bravo. Production quality was consistent throughout the entirety of the series - backgrounds were well portrayed. The weather as well - lightning which was beautiful - nature was beautiful - fireworks were beautiful - Animals were beautiful - Mashiro's art was beautiful, And... Shiina Mashiro was beautiful~\\n\\n\r\nWhat more is there to say, someone like me who doesn't even like romance stories that much absolutely loved this. I'm sure those of you who love romance stories will love it even more than I did. I'd probably give the series a 10/10 if it wasn't for that unsatisfying ending, but don't let that stop you from giving this show a try, it's in my opinion the best slice of life story I've seen in a long time.",

            "content": "Sakurasou is an anime that is more than the sum of its parts. If I were to break down Sakurasou into its most basic ingredients, I wouldn't be able to claim that any of those ingredients are particularly brilliant. However, the wonderful hot pot created when all of those ingredients are boiled together is one that is unique and unforgettable.\r\nStory - 9/10\r\nThe premise of Sakurasou is generic enough, but the story grows beautifully from its humble beginnings. Containing multiple story arcs, each with enough plot and character to facilitate being an anime alone, Sakurasou almost resembles a battle shonen in structure. Various arcs centered aroundfocused goals allow the plot to progress and the characters to grow. The pacing, for a melodramatic slice-of-life, is fast, but not in a bad way. The speed of the series serves to keep the viewer engaged, very rarely moving so fast that you feel like you've missed something. In regards to a few plot points, the story sometimes either seems to move too quickly or too slowly, but the overall story is beautifully told at an interesting and unique pace. \\n\\n\r\nArt - 7/10\\n\\n\r\nSakurasou has lovely character designs that burst with personality. I can't think of any points in the anime where the drawings were weak enough to distract from my immersion in the story. The animation itself was fine, although during more kinetic scenes, it lacked. Kinetic scenes were rarely required in the story, so that isn't a major complaint. The reason the art only scores a 7 is mainly due to the color used. The colors in Sakurasou were dull and pasty, which isn't my cup of tea. It did allow the more colorful scenes to stand out, but this opportunity was squandered.\\n\\n\r\nSound - 6/10\\n\\n\r\nThe sound effects, as per usual in anime, were fine. Never did they distract from the show. The reason sound scores only 6 out of 10 is because of the soundtrack. Although Sakurasou is chocked full of emotional scenes, the background music was almost never powerful enough to support the amazing performances by the voice actors and actresses. Furthermore, the soundtrack in general was rather forgettable, although I enjoyed the OPs and EDs. That isn't to say the soundtrack is bad, it just was weaker than the rest of the show.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 10/10\\n\\n\r\nThis is where Sakurasou truly shines. All of the main characters in Sakurasou are unique and flawed. Some of them may seem to be tropes at first glance, but as you watch more episodes, you'll quickly realize that they're anything but. Over the course of the story arcs and their interactions with one another, all of the characters grow as human beings. In addition, the character flaws are some of the best I've seen written in anime. The flaws of the characters can often be annoying, but usually because you've been in their situation before and understand how they feel. You know that they're feeling something silly, but it's such a realistic portrayal of how a person would react. I would love to see the characters grow even more.\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 9/10\\n\\n\r\nAs I said, Sakurasou is more than the sum of its parts. Although the art and sound sometimes drag down the engaging story and beautiful characters, it manages to come together in what I believe is an unforgettable anime. Sakurasou is an important watch for any anime fan.",

And it's definitely a hidden gem among all the generic slice-of-life animes out there and is lies among the best of them in my opinion. Its beginning may turn away many viewers due to its more than revealing shots of the characters, but please try to stick with this anime because you'll be rewarded with an alien-like yet relateable cast, amazing accompaniment of music, and a splash of colors swirling around the screen that's bound to give your eyes orgasms. \r\nSeriously, please stay with us at Sakurasou.\r\n* WARNING *\r\nThere are spoilers below and Iwould highly recommend you watch the anime before reading this article.\\n\\n\r\nThe main thing that stuck with me throughout this anime was the characters, the story was simply meh. It kept the drama up and was useful to keep things interesting but otherwise it didn't do much except tell about a struggle. \\n\\n\r\nWhat I really liked about this anime was that it really explored the themes of fighting and losing. I don't think I've ever watched any other animes where the main characters fail at their dreams and how they cope with it. Some people may say that Sorata complains a lot and is a dick at times, but I feel that it's something people are unfamiliar with viewing, which is that they are human. So many times are we presented characters where they rise beyond the normal setting because they were smart, strong, and lead others to victory or somehow manage to leap out of their comfort zone because of a strong mentor. We are used to seeing that because that's what we all aspire to be. \\n\\n\r\nWe all want to be strong, to be able to fight for our morals and goals, to overcome our weaknesses and be somebody people can rely on. But Sakurasou, no matter how crazy some of their scenes or maybe the entire season, these characters are still human. We are told that we have to hide our feelings and never talk about problems openly or else we would be ridiculed for being weak. And this is something that Kanda, Aoyami, Misaki, Jin, and Ryunnosuke all struggle with. \\n\\n\r\nRyunnosuke has trouble dealing with people because he's afraid of being hurt. He was abandoned for being himself and got to the point where he was used to being rejected and thought it was normal to shut himself in his room to escape his own fears.\\n\\n\r\nMisaki is a genius compared to almost everybody else yet she is also the most emotionally delicate, perhaps even more so than Ayonami. Ayonami grew out of her shell and finally became more honest with herself. But who was the one that encouraged Ayonami to grow more confident, yet at the same time regressed back into her anime to hide what she felt for Jin? \\n\\n\r\nWe all deal with fear here, and this anime portrays this better than most. They fear losing, winning, moving forward. Yet they keep on moving on. That's the main lesson I learn from this anime. It's to fight for what you want with all of your strength. Even if you fall to your knees, cry out and curse the world because you didn't make the interview or lost your job, WE CANNOT GIVE UP. It is what Misaki says:\\n\\n\r\n\"Leap out into outer space!\"\\n\\n\r\n*END SPOILERS*\\n\\n\r\nI usually write my reviews like this, with what I personally feel whenever I finish up an anime. It's a little odd but it's what I usually roll with, so please bear with me. Here's the \"normal\" part of the review down below!\\n\\n\r\nI really thought the art was something exceptional and it truly stood out from most other animes that I had seen. Its attention to detail reminded me of the focus ufotable often has towards its animes as well. J.C. Studios really went all out and one scene is particularly memorable to me, which was the pool scene where all the water droplets were flung about and flow of the waves ebbed to the movement of the characters while they splashed around. It was just so smooth and unreal that kind of attention was paid towards the pictures J.C. Studios paints Sakurasou as. Whether it's the smile of Shina or the fallen sakura petal, they all are animated well. \\n\\n\r\nThe sound played a large part in ramping up the emotional impact of scenes. When I heard the soft tones of the piano tiptoeing beside the harsh tones of the characters, it blended together perfectly. The soundtrack does meld with the script of the anime. The only problem I had was that the 2nd ED was slightly inappropriate after certain scenes because of its loud and more joyful nature. \\n\\n\r\nSeriously, if you are somebody that enjoys an anime that provides an experience that teaches you how to fight, how to lose, and how to move on, this is a perfect one for you. I did not particularly care for the first 5 episodes of this anime, but as it drove on, I found myself relating to these characters despite their extreme differences.  I am proud to say that I enjoyed it, enjoyed it so much that this is actually my 3rd viewing of Sakurasou. Please, watch this anime. It is certainly worth your time, and the fanservice does die down after the first few episodes. \\n\\n\r\nThank you so much for reading my review, and I hope I didn't bore you. If you have any feedback, I'd greatly appreciate it! Feel free to message me if you want to discuss it!",

            "content": "I started watching this anime fully expecting it to be just another silly light-headed boyish comedy full of gratuitous skin flicks and fanservice. I admit, my hormones made me do it. If you just want a short summary, though, hear me out on only two more statements: This is a story about a kindhearted teenager who cares for, and slowly falls in love with, a savant. And I'm still surprised to say it's the only anime that has managed to pull any tears out of my eyes.\r\nYes, the show does start out with the immature titillation that we all came for. Yes, the comedic timingis superb. And this content, while it gets toned down somewhat, never entirely goes away. As the season progressed, though, I began to feel a little ashamed with myself for assuming from the start that this show's creators were nothing more than money-grubbing opportunists who only wanted to sell bawdy humor smattered with breasts and derriere to finance their next financial venture. Because, as it turns out, Sakurasou turned out to be a lot more.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are deep and rounded. The hero very slowly falls in love with the heroine, but to get there he makes legitimate sacrifices. Even more intriguing is how everyone attempts to reconcile their own opinions of the savant heroine: is she mentally handicapped or an unbelievably gifted genius? How would less gifted individuals deal with her, and how would average people deal with her? \\n\\n\r\nIn almost every episode, there's an unobtrusive scene of a white cat lying silently with her black companion (they'd been adopted by the hero). By explicitly linking the white cat to the heroine, the show subtly tells us that the success she represents can only exist with its implied black partner, failure. One can't exist without the other, no yin without her yang. As it turns out, this symbolism becomes very important.\\n\\n\r\nAt its heart, the show is a love story. But it's also a story about life, a story about coming to terms with imperfections and a story about the transition into young adulthood. Some find immense success in their dreams while the rest aren't quite that lucky. The overarching question that the show asks the viewer is this: Regardless of your successes or failures, how are you going to step forward?\\n\\n\r\nMaybe that's a question we all should consider.",

            "content": "Bueno, how should I put it.......well, I'd probably say that this anime is good at the start of 2013. It is safe to say that this anime ended in episode 23 and it is safe to assume that episode 24 would just a filler since there were spoilers already indicated either from the forums, light novel, manga or from MAL's character info. So, this anime more like intensified of what was about the situation about the people of  Sakura Dormitory or more popularly called \"Sakurasou.\" So, without anymore BS, here are my ratings for each of this anime's category.\r\nGood 7:\r\nStory- Thought the anime itdoes have the usual bunch of maverick group of student who don't fit in a normal society and were piled up in one place kinda thingy, but this anime's overall story was about the slice of life of each characters of this anime and quite frankly the romance and comedy genre are more pronounce, though the comedy part was more on Sorata, it's very obvious that he carries most of this anime's direction and that very good of what the writer, Hajime Kamoshida did.\\n\\n\r\nSound- For the first few episode, I'd really like both opening and closing themes, I also like the VA's of Aoyama, Shiina and Jin. But for Sorata and Ry\u016bnosuke, not much. Sorata's VA, Yoshitsugu Matsuoka though he's only 26 years old already he sounded like an old man, as for Ryunosuke's VA,   Yui Horie no longer has that youthful intonation to play a young guy, she should have just been limited to voice the latter's AI as Maid.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter-  I would probably have a mixed reaction about every character's in this anime, in a sense that one cannot view them in a double dimension but in a triple dimension, you may hate them in one way and like them in another, but the presences of  the 3rd dimension is somewhat you'll find odd. so let tackle each one of them:\\n\\n\r\nSorata Kanda, he is basically a dude who has a big chip on his shoulder because everything that goes around Sakurasou was placed on him, his chip become bigger where Shiina came into picture. I like the fact that he thinks more for other than for himself, doesn't hesitate to help around, do all the chores and babysit Shiina, but what makes me wanna kick his ass sometimes, was the fact that what he thinks that's good for others that he doesn't even consider if that is what they wanted nor does he pause for a while to see the bigger picture. What was odd about him is that the amine's direction was too depended on him especially the comedy genre of this anime, you might that the comedy part is him.\\n\\n\r\nShiina Mashiro, she is the added chip on Sorata's shoulder, because her only Chihiro wasn't of much any help. When she was introduce to be Sorata's ward I have nothing but disgust for her character, she's somewhere in between the threshold of either being a genius, retard and a lack of common sense. Though her character was in such threshold, it is nice that she does have emotions especially when it come to her feelings with Sorata. I admit, I kinda hate the Sorata X Shiina arc, then again she does provide this anime's heart warming plot,\\n\\n\r\nAoyama Nanami, when she came to Sakurasou she sort of lifted one of Sorata's chip, I would have wish for the Aoyama X Sorata arc, but it was unfortunate that she also thinks for of others than herself and it was her concern for others that makes things too unfair for herself. She loves Sorata, but always end up restraining herself which I'm guess that it involves her  concerns for Shiina's welfare.\\n\\n\r\n  Misaki Kamiigusa, ok she has a bad case of ADHD, but what I like about her was her never ending goal to be Jin's girl which give this anime a dramatic edge. I don't like her impulsiveness that she doesn't even bother to be still and think things around.\\n\\n\\n\r\nJin Mitaka, this character is a 'Dichotomy,' he's a player and yet he refuses to bang Misaki ( which is good), in one episode there seems to be a yaoi element that exist between him and S\u014dichir\u014d, but that's just me.\\n\\n\\n\r\nRy\u016bnosuke Akasaka, a computer geek who prefer to be a loner, I like his pragmatic side when he confronted Sorata about the dorm's situation, but I hate the way he shoves Rita away and being arrogant towards the teacher, I guess if I where in the teacher's shoes I'd be wreaking his laptop in front of him.\\n\\n\r\nChihiro Sengoku, the useless dorm teacher that I don't like at all, period.\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnoyment- Well, what's make is anime enjoyable was the slice of life that each character has as this anime goes on, but more credit goes to Sorata and Aoyama since it was the predicament that these two character go through that put's this anime into its direction.\\n\\n\r\nOverall- I'd say that even thought its the two said character's who guide this anime to its direction, it won't be fair to not include the other character's for the romance does give this anime such warm with is make up. But, since for the most part this anime depends on Sorata and Aoyama I find it unfair to give this anime a score higher than seven since it wasn't fair that one character, Aoyama, has to be this self sacrificing individual for the sake of Sorata and Shiina.\\n\\n\\n\r\nMediocre 5:\\n\\n\r\nArt- I gave this category such score since I don't have much to say about its art, period.\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe End.",

            "content": "\"Don't judge a book by its cover.\" Something we are all guilty of doing on a regular basis. Who can blame us? We're human. We are quick to judge, are influenced greatly by first impressions, and will easily discard great potential investments without a second thought. Despite this deficit of reasonable evaluation, humans are also great beings; we are able to look back and realize first impressions can be capable of grievous deception. \r\nSakurasou no Pet na Kanojo (The Pet Girl of Sakurasou) is not really a romantic series. It is also not really a comedy. Though it has bits of both of these elements,I would not consider either of these two the main focus. If I were to pick any one genre that describes this show best it would be a drama, and a fine one at that. It's very rare that you come across an anime that has such a strong dramatic effect without choking on dialogue, yet it's exceptionally done here. Behind the facade of childish yelling, panty shots, cleavage, and sexual innuendos lies a story. It's a story of following your aspirations and getting shot down, working harder than others but not getting the part, being so talented that others don't understand you, and being wanted by the one you love but denying them because you don't feel enough self-worth. A story of passion, frustration, and maturity.\\n\\n\r\nThe pacing of story flows with a certain finesse. It never feels too fast, and never too slow. It feels just right and occupies its 24 episode run in quite a snug manner. I would like to say the same about the animation because it stays easy on the eyes and retains its consistency. I enjoyed both OP's and ED's; they felt uplifting and were generally all around fun. Going into the sound criteria, I would like to mention how much I enjoyed the timing of the sound effects during dramatic moments. The voice actors did a great job showcasing emotion and talent through their respective characters.  \\n\\n\r\nThe residents of Sakura Hall are an intriguing group of social outcasts that became more and more endearing as the series progressed. Each of them has their own quirks, talents, and dreams that set them all apart, yet also brought them all together. The reason I really liked this group of characters was oddly because of their negative traits. They act stupid, get depressed, get frustrated, and envious. They seem like realistic people and act accordingly in order to help each other through tough times. There were a number of memorable scenes such as the 'bro talks' between Sorata and Jin, Misaki's struggle with love, the making of Nyapollen, and the graduation speech that leave a lasting impression. These characters took me on a roller coaster of mixed feelings and at the end of it I was a little sad to see them depart for their next ride. \\n\\n\r\nWhile I thought the series was great, it also had its own hindrances that obstruct a better score. First I would like to address the issue of fan service. Fan service is one of the biggest problems in the anime industry for me; often the panty shots, cleavage, and suggestive dialogue is fine in small doses. I understand why it's there, but when it's unnecessary and much too potent it tarnishes an anime leaving you wondering what could have been. For Sakurasou in particular, the fan service is more concentrated towards the early half of the series; this in itself is why the start of the series felt so generic and why I assume many people typically dropped the show to begin with. Secondly, romantic development. Every once in while it would be nice to come across a protagonist that isn't as dense as a plank of wood. Yes, I'm looking at you Sorata. While I don't consider Sakurasou to be a romantic series, romance elements do pop up numerous times throughout the series. Romantic interests felt unsatisfactory and left me feeling something to be desired with the exception of Jin and Misaki. Fortunately for us, at least Sakurasou isn't a cheap harem. \\n\\n\r\nSakurasou no Pet na Kanojo began an empty canvas. It peered into the hearts of man and admirably grasped what it feels like to be full of envy and full of excitement, heartbroken and loved, alone and surrounded by people you can without a doubt call friends. All of this is gathered on a palette with a wide variety of colors; a palette to paint upon the canvas the joys and disappointments that life has to offer. Looking at the portrait, there is only one question left. \u2018What color do you want to be?\u2019",

            "content": "To be brief, this anime was a lot better than I though it would be. The beginning sets it up as a cliche harem series having the main character surrounded by different over-used archetypes. I soon found out that my assumption was wrong and the show greatly develops. Although it deviates away from a crappy harem show, the story behind it is still mediocre at best, and I have seen many like it. It is a story about bonds and friendship and all that jazz. However, there are still a few elements to it that grabbed my emotions. Later in the show the theme ofhard work not always paying off really got to me. I believe that theme is easy for anyone to relate to and can provide a very emotional experience at some points. \\n\r\nThe art and animation of this show is its greatest  attribute. Although most of this show is talking and crying, when something actually happens it is animated in a beautiful manner. The character design itself is nothing too special, but it also isn't bad. \\n\r\nThe music of this series was just typical j-pop and is easily forgettable. It is good enough not to make your ears bleed. \\n\r\nThe characters of this show are indeed loveable but can also be annoying. The characters all fit some kind of anime archetype I have seen millions of times. At the beginning this drove me crazy because everyone was so predictable and annoying. However as the story starts to build up the characters start to build as well. The main character initially seems like the typical \"AHH GIRLS\" harem lead. This is quickly destroyed because he proves to actually have some backbone and i gained respect for him as the series went on.\\n\r\nOverall i enjoyed this series and found it easy to watch episode after episode. I could relate to it personally in so many ways. The idea of working hard not always providing the results you want really got to me and at one point I had to hold back the tears. However I feel this story can be easily replaced in my heart and there are just too many cliches to be able to call it special.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\n.",

            "content": "Ah, Sakurasou. This was a show that I watched a long while back and even now, I still love it. It brings back so much memories, happy and sad. And when I think about now, Sakurasou was probably the first anime I ever gave a perfect 10. You might think that since it's a rom-com that it's good by default, right? Well, no. Sakurasou is a romance comedy with touch of slice of life, but it's not like any other. That's not what makes it special. It's characters  and compelling, influential storyline is what makes this show amazing. If this is not considered amasterpiece, then I don't know what is. And I'm still trying to figure out why this isn't more popular. Of course, everyone has their own opinions and likes and dislikes, so I don't expect every person to give this a 10, a 9 or even like this show at all. But, I will tell you, it is worth the watch. So, if you are thinking about watching this, watch it. I promise you will not waste your time. Forget the genres and don't judge it by first impressions. Let the characters and story speak for themslves. Maybe I'm exaggerating and giving this show a bit more credit than it actually deserves, but hell, I don't care. Doesn't change the fact that I love this show and always will. The thing is, Sakurasou had on impact on me as a person, and it was one hell of train ride to remember. I still cry everytime when I realize that there is no second season and there probably never will be. Anyways, let's get on with the actual review, shall we?\\n\\n\r\nStory: The story revolves around a high school student named Kanda Sorata, who lives in Sakurasou, a dormitory for 'Problem children' and, just as you'd expect, there are a few other interesting members living there as well. But, the funny thing is, Sorata wasn't even supposed to there. He was forced to move due to keeping a cat in the normal dormitories. Introduced to a new enviroment, Sorata get's caught up in the random acts of the so called problem children. Although Sorata is the main character, the story primarily revolves around the daily lives of all the members in Sakurasou, Kamiigusa Misaki, Shiina Mashiro, Aoyama Nanami, Mitaka Jin and Akasaka Ryuunosuke. And the way it starts off, is Shiina Mashiro, a brilliant and successful artist moves into the dormitory. The catch is that despite being a great artist, she has no idea of  how to take care of herself which leads to Sorata becoming the 'Master' of Shiina, the rest of the members forcing him to take care of her. As you can already tell, Sakurasou is a unique anime, having 6 main characters which provides for an interesting plotline. The whole 'Master' and 'Student' aspect of it is a bit weird at first, but it creates funny, hilarious moments which fits in with the comedy genre of the show. One thing that Sakurasou does exceptionally well is capturing what life is like in the dormitory, how each character goes about their daily lives. Through the characters interactions with each other you get a feel of what each character is like and you can tell that they are all genuinly freinds. In a sense, the characters serve as a backbone or structure for the story and it wouldn't be able to progress without them. Another thing to mention is despite Sakurasou being a rom-com, I would say it's more drama than anything else. There are quite a lot of scenes in the show with moments of drama, and that's what gave the storyline depth. I also found that in those moments with drama, and emotions portayed felt very realistic, similar to the way we humans act in certain situations. It also creates a good amount of suspense, which keeps the story interesting, making you want to know what will happen next in the story. As far as the pacing goes, It was fine for what the story was worth. It didn't feel too fast or too slow, and it was consistent, which provided for good development for the characters and plot. The only issue I really had with the story was the romance. The balance between drama and comedy felt just about right, but honestly, the romance was horrid. It is touched on it the story, but it doesn't go anywhere or progress at all. The characters don't date or kiss, they don't even find out about each others feelings. I don't think it really took away from the show, but still, as a fan of romance, I was disappointed. Sakurasou is also a bit more focused on friendship rather than romance after all. There are some other important points of the story I could go over, such as the ending, but I'd rather not spoil anything. Overall, the plot was great. It holds it's own, and has structure, even though the romance was quite weak.\\n\\n\r\nArt: Two words, beautiful and stunning. The animation was perfect. Unlike other anime shows, Sakurasou uses a wide range of bright and warm colors to really bring out flat backgrounds and their charaters. The character details, scenery, all of it was very fluid and consistent. One thing that surprised me was simply the way Shiina's art was portrayed in the story. It was incredible how they could make a painting look so pretty and sharp. Not only does it show Shiina's love for art, but you can really comprehend the extent of her skill and appreciate it. \\n\\n\r\nSound: Honestly, I have never watched an anime where I just wanted to dance to the OP and ED before. Even when I don't look at the english lyrics and I don't understand the song, I just can't help but want to dance and sing along with the OP. Not only are they positive and upbeat, but they completely portray the mood of the anime. The BGM's sounded quite nice and were unique to the show. Overall, the music was good, the BGM's and OP's and ED's did a good job of conveying what Sakurasou is all about and what it wanted you to feel. The graduation song near the end of the anime is a good example of what I am talking about.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: The aspect that makes Sakurasou as good as it is and stand out from all other anime shows is it's characters. Each charcter is unique with their own personality. Sorata is very kind and friendly and I would you say the most normal one in the dormitory. Shiina is a great artist, but can be random at times due to her inability to take care of herself. Misaki does the most crazy things, and is always messing around with Sorata. Aoyama is the most hard working of the group, and helps a lot with the chores around Sakurasou. Ryuunosuke is the smart one, and can't stand being touched or near girls Jin is the playboy, constantly messing around with women. With all these unique personalities in one building, it provides for interesting character dynamics. No matter what they go through, you can tell that are all genuinely friends and are there to support each other when needed. Each character has their own background and we get to learn about each of them, allowing us to connect with them on a deeper level. We also get to see how their freindship changes and strenghthen through their interaction in the story, how they come to love Sakurasou and appreciate each other, making for great character development. Overall, the characters are just great. The way they interact with each other is very fun to watch, and they are all likable. I didn't find myself hating any of the characters.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: I've pretty much said it in the intro, but Sakurasou is non-the less a masterpiece and I would give it no less than a 10. It exceeds in every aspect, and all together creates an interesting and compelling story. The romance was a downer, but that was just a small part of the story so it didn't take away from the overall enjoyment. To this day, I still hope Sakurasou will get a second season, because it deserves one. If you're looking for an anime show with great characters, and a solid story line with a mixture of light-hearted and serious moments, then this a good watch. I was very sastfied with this, and I'm sure you won't be disappointed.",

It may be my personal preference buti like watching male leads I can admire, sadly, after bearing to watch all his failures throughout the anime, there is nothing to admire about him. as the series come in to a conclusion, nothing changed about him and he did not achieve anything. One may ask, what is the point of watching an anime about him?\\n\r\n  While the two leads are failures, the story didn't get the series any redeeming factor. The conflict just came out of nowhere and really is not the original focus of the anime. after being magically resolved, the anime just ended, that's it.\\n\\n\r\n  I don't need to discuss every flaw in this anime both minor and major to get my message across; I regret watching this anime. It has a few laughs, good fan service every now and then but the story did not actually get anywhere \\n",

            "content": "You sometimes have that anime, that you don't realise you had so much fun watching until you finished it? That was the deal with Sakurasou for me.\r\nPlot 9/10\r\nThe plot tells a story of a teenage boy named Kanda Sorata. For keeping a stray cat in his dorm, he is forced to move to Sakurasou, which is basically the nut house dorm. The anime begins with him being bored. And right off the bat we know, that something is going to happen to make him un-bored (is that even a word?). The thing to end Sorata's boredom is Shiina Mashiro, a girl that moves to Sakurasou.She can't do any of the basic things herself, for example dressing. Sorata gets put on Mashiro Duty, and for that moment on, it's up to him to take care of the girl. Sounds interesting enough. The first 5 episodes or so are filled with ecchi scenes, but once you get through them, the plot takes a more serious route. The show itself is about talented people. We have  : the voice actress, the mangaka, the computer expert, the script writer, the anime maker, etc. The plot focuses on all of those people chasing their dreams, falling and getting up. At one point, the results of all the competitions, auditions were predictable, and that was what kinda annoyed me. Neverthless, this show was about struggling for your dreams, about finding love and making memories. The plot bought me entirely, except for the predictable results of the competitions and auditions.\\n\r\nArt 9/10\\n\r\nTHe art in Sakurasou was so pretty! The colors were really flashy and bright, the whole show bursting with blues, pinks and purples. But rather than hurting the eye, it was really pleasant to watch. The animation was very... lined. But that was in no way a problem. In fact, it gave the show a warm vibe, contrasting with the cheerful colors.\\n\r\nSound 9/10\\n\r\nThe music itself wasn't anything out of the ordinary. The OP's and ED's were very catchy and fun to sing. Even the second ED, which I hated so much, played on repeat in my head. The OST's were played in the right moments: the sad, emotional ones in the feely scenes, the happy, party ones in the cheerful scenes. The seiyuu's did a FAB job. Each of them fitted perfectly in his/her role. Ai Kayano made Mashiro sound sort of like Kanade from Angel Beats, but it fitted just fine.\\n\r\nCharacter 10/10\\n\r\nAll of the characters in Sakurasou were unique. There had to be at least one character that you loved (Misaki) and at least one character you hated (Aoyama). But no matter which characters they were, you got so hella attached to them! All of them had their flaws and good sides. I think that if it wasn't for the characters, I wouldn't have enjoyed Sakurasou as much.\\n\r\nEnjoyment 10/10\\n\r\nThis show will make you take out the tissue box, will get you laughing out loud, going \"Aww\", and give you a ton of other emotions. You won't regret any of the 24 episodes you spend watching this anime. It was enjoyable as hell, funny and overall just nice to watch! Anime is supposed to entertain you, and Sakurasou fits this bill perfectly.\\n\r\nOverall 9/10\\n\r\nIt was a little predictable. Mashiro could be sort of annoying with her poker face. [SPOILER] We didn't get a Mashiro and Sorata kiss. But those are only minor flaws that this anime possesses. And you don't mind them at all. I strongly recommend Sakurasou no Pet na Kanojo. \\n\r\n\"I believe in panties\"~Shiina Mashiro",

But, Sakurasou is diffrent, i feel from  3 first episode ( The Third One ) makes me speechless. i have high expectation that this anime have DRAMA - in genre's. \r\nwell, the storyline is about kanda sorata the art students. He live in reguler dorm, but because his habits ( cat Maniac ) he cant leave cats alone and that's why he transfered to Sakurasou Dorm. in sakurasou there are many people with BROKEN Characteristics but very talented ( i wonder they are exists ). And then sorata meets someone that he never expectbefore, Shiro. She is very calm person ( Actually She is EXTREMELY CALM ) and sorata has job to take care for her. Shiro's identity is Famous International Artistic.

            "content": "EDIT: Fucked up with the studio name. Sorry, my dear J.C.Staff.\r\nSakurasou no Pet na Kanojo: The Masterfully Crafted Cringefest\r\nSakurasou is one of the most hyped romance anime series made in recent times. A lot of people think that it is one of the best shows ever made, and the amount of 10\u2019s in the review section is overwhelming. However, while this show is certainly above average in several aspects, Sakurasou isn\u2019t even close to being something which deserves all those Masterpiece-ratings, and for a variety of reasons, such as bad writing, shallow characters and cringe-inducing, awful drama, which completely stomped my happy thoughts about thisshow after the first cour.\\n\\n\r\nLet\u2019s start with some good things.\\n\\n\r\n**START OF GOOD**\\n\\n\r\nI see people praising this show\u2019s art a lot, and it certainly is very good. I liked the character designs: the characters were distinguishable and pretty unique in their appearances and were drawn pretty nicely. The background were alright, the animation was fluid and crispy. JC Staff continues to impress me with their art.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound was decent, too. Nice OPs, nice EDs. It is nothing to write home about, but the soundtrack does its job well, it nicely accompanies the action on the screen. Nevertheless, it failed to impress me as a standalone piece of music, it\u2019s not one of those OSTs which I can listen to without context.\\n\\n\r\n**END OF GOOD**\\n\\n\r\nBecause of the next paragraphs I\u2019m going to become hated by a lot of people, I\u2019m sure.\\n\\n\r\nThe show serves nice as a comedy, however it fails in a category which is supposed to be main here - romance. Romance is one of the worst parts of this show: it\u2019s unbelievable, it\u2019s cringy, it\u2019s just poorly written. It\u2019s SO bad that you care about the romance of the side-characters more than about the mains'. And that\u2019s not even the worst part about Sakurasou.\\n\\n\r\nThe author knows how to write decent comedies, but when he dwells into the drama category, he ultimately fails. I\u2019m going to be honest with you and myself: I enjoyed the first half of Sakurasou. It is genuinely one of the funniest shows I\u2019ve ever watched, and only because of it I can\u2019t say that Sakurasou is plain bad. It shines in the beginning, only to be consumed by the black matter of unbelievably bad drama in the end. \\n\\n\r\nThe amount of melodrama is about the same as you would find in your typical show for teen girls. Something bad happens unexpectedly, which affects everyone, everything suddenly goes to ashes, the main characters decide to save something valuable for them, one of the characters makes a speech, everyone cries, mains win. And while sometimes it certainly works, unfortunately, Sakurasou itself fails to execute this trope somewhat originally. It just pulls this trick out of the blue and leaves you with a constant situation of you having a palm on your face. Furthermore, when the writer REALLY had a chance to execute a drama properly, he screws up again. Several times. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters are not THAT bad though, however they are zero-and-a-half-dimensional, especially mains. The protagonist-kun just screams \u00abI\u2019M AN AVERAGE JAPANESE STUDENT\u00bb, the main girl is just meh as a whole, also we have an English bitch, a hikki, a gigolo, an alien girl and a light tsundere, who actually is the most entertaining character in the whole series. They aren\u2019t that bad-written, but they are certainly nothing deep.\\n\\n\r\nI tried to enjoy this show. I honestly tried. Yet, the lack of good writing and the bullshit drama ruined Sakurasou for me. \\n",

            "content": "\"I believe in panties.\" -Shiina Mashiro Episode 11\r\nUpdated for the last episode, thanks for following! ;)\r\nTo be honest, I've seen this anime about 4 months ago on the anime's to watch list back in 2012, but I had skipped over it thinking it was another standard harem. However, this is one of the best anime's I've seen, combining comedy, romance, unrequited love, an innocent girl, girl looking guy, crazy girl, and light fanservice all into one.\r\nStory 9/10: The plot of the story doesn't sound all that interesting by itself, but what really shines is how each character will interact with the story. Though it's abit predictable, each character throughout each \"arc\" will encounter a problem that takes the collaborative efforts of everyone to push through it. \\n\\n\r\nSlight spoiler, but toward the end the story really touched my heart, and was very emotional. I thoroughly enjoyed the ending, and I'm quite impressed at the ending. (someone pointed it out that it's based on the light novel or something, but nevertheless it is still an amazing story). It's one of the few animes that has actually left me with goosebumbs as the series finished.\\n\\n\r\nArt 7/10: The artwork that they show in the anime itself is amazing, showing some amazing computer artistry. However, the characters themselves are fairly normal, with the only exception being Mashiro imo, who has the \"dont care\" look about her. \\n\\n\r\nSound 7/10: I hardly ever pay attention to the sound in the anime, so take this part with a grain of salt\\n\r\nNothing amazing, nothing horrible.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 8/10: Mashiro seems to be the only character that develops at all, but all the characters fulfill the roles that they are in fairly well. Akataka is amazing in his own right, however, being the anti social person he his, but still having a unique personality. However, Jin is the real gold gem among all of them, having such humorous dialogue that goes really well with Mashiro's actions.\\n\\n\r\nUPDATED VERSION: I feel the need to amend my earlier review on the character. All the main characters, par Jin, Misaki, and Chihiro-sensei, have developed throughout the anime. I think that no anime is good without some sort of character development, because without it I feel like I've walked in a giant circle and remain unsatisfied. However, Sakurasou fulfills my desire for change, and really left a lasting impression on me. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 10/10: I could hardly stop laughing between all the gags in the shows. I won't spoil anything, but Kanda's reactions are hilarious.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 9/10: Fairly standard slice of life ish anime (sorry if I'm wrong, just tryig out some new lingo) but amazing in its own right. If you enjoyed any comedy romances, then this is an amazing pick up.\\n\\n\r\nUpdate: The anime honestly has been one of the most shocking, influential, and touching anime that I've ever watched. The feeling I had toward the end definitely left an impact on me, and I wish that they would add a sequel or something of the like, as I'd love to see what would happen later. However, I doubt this will happen, as it ended on a solid and satisfying note.",

            "content": "I still remember the time when I was waiting for the release of this anime. It was one of those that I was most looking forward to. For me, it seemed very good and a bit more original than all the \"weird dorm\" anime. Now that I've finished it, I can finally see whether it was up to my expectations. And I can tell you that it was exactly what I was expecting from this anime, but better.  At first, I wasn't expecting so much from it but I was expecting something at least as good.\r\nThe plot is concretely about a \"special\" dorm, alittle different from the others. Up to that point, you're thinking \"meh, already and often taken\"\\n\r\nEven if the beginning looks pretty stereotyped, it's still \"masked\" by the humor that makes me laugh a lot, so I thought it was forgivable and that the side \"included\" was well covered. However, the sequence the events is the same. The \"d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu\" feeling is still there, and the same humor is always used, and as a result, you get tired of it. The same situations keep coming up, the same scenes and again the same humor.. It gets boring around episode 7-8, and I was thinking \"But when is it gonna start for real?\".\\n\\n\r\nAfter some pretty \"ordinary\" episodes (for some of you, involving \"torture\" and \"perseverance\") we start to see an interesting plot. For the few times in Slice of Life anime, the main character, or even all the main characters actually have a goal. They're not only living their student life \u2013 they really care about their future, and it's not as grand as it may seem. So we\u2019ve got an anime with at least a degree of realism, even if it doesn't look that way (especially with that kind of humor). And the future of our character isn't all that bright: in this anime, we also have good things happening, but mostly bad ones! There is drama to it all the same, even though it's not often very \"powerful\".\\n\\n\r\nWhat I truly liked in this anime, is that I had the same feeling of \"Clannad\" while watching the 23rd episode : They ensure that the characters are having good times together, and that, even if these moments are ordinary, the characters are happy and live normally together. But in the end, they ensure that these feelings and emotion are delivered forward to make you regret to not being able to see more. That's what I felt in the end of Sakurasou (even if it's not on the same level as the one Clannad that thoroughly made me cry).\\n\\n\r\nThe graphics were nice, the sound and all the things that go with it weren't perfect, but they didn't bother me. The first ending with the song is the one that marked me the most \u00a0(And I was very pleased to hear it a last time in the end)\\n\r\nThe story first goes slowly, but it's worth it! The characters all have real personality and have their own story, as well as their own future.  The characters are so well workedout ! The only problem was that, it was too \u201ccopy-cat\u201d in some scenes, the plot was sometimes clich\u00e9 and the end seemed like, \"We take new characters, and we do it all over again! \".  They could've done better on that point.\\n\\n\r\nIn short, Sakurasou managed to really give me the \"shivers\" properly, and far exceeded my expectations.",

            "content": "...an ordinary boy and a brilliant girl must live like \"a master and his pet.\"\r\n- Thus ends the synopsis for The Pet Girl of Sakurasou(Sakurasou no Pet na Kanojo)\r\nReading such a synopsis, and noting that the genre was another comedy + romance, I saw another brainless anime with a typical anime guy getting a lot of girls, a typical dumb-blonde, etc. at first.\r\nYou see, I was getting tired of seeing the same romcom animes again and again, and this is the reason I've been putting off from watching this series for so long. The only reason I decided to watch the series was because ofits unexpectedly high rating.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, I couldn't have been more wrong about this series, which I am happy to give a 10/10 rating, putting this series up there with SnK, SAO, and CGLR in my humble opinion.\\n\r\nThe Pet Girl of Sakurasou is another masterpiece by J.C.Staff and I would compare it to their other great anime Toradora!, which has a similar feel.\\n\\n\r\nNow, I shall stop my useless babble and get right on with it:\\n\\n\r\nStory: 9/10\\n\r\nTo be honest, in the first few episodes I had my doubts. The anime starts out with a guy moving in to a dorm, which happens to let students to do as they please, and then an attractive+clueless girl. Oh, and did I mention that the girl also happens to be dumb to the extent that the guy needs to help her get dressed, check that she's actually wearing underwear, dry her hair and stuff? There's also the typical nekos(cats) that keep appearing everywhere.\\n\r\nHowever, I still had to give a 9 out of 10 because the story turned out to be very good.\\n\r\nI won't go over the plot again (you can find that in the synopsis above or just google it or whatever), but the story sure has some very touching moments in it, and despite being a romcom, the story explores various themes in depth.\\n\r\nThe pacing is great, and not too unrealistic as well.\\n\r\nThere still were some parts of the story that were a bit too cliche (not much, but some), which is why I docked one point :P\\n\\n\r\nSound & Art: 10/10\\n\r\nThe director of this anime is known to have deep interest in both music and art, so maybe her influence helped out here?\\n\r\nWell I don't know about all that, but my point is that the artwork of this anime is very pretty and the characters are also drawn nicely.\\n\r\nI also liked that the artwork was mostly bright and colorful.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound was also great.\\n\r\nI liked the OPs & ED, and the background music was always fitting and pleasing.\\n\r\nThe voice actors were very passionate (especially a certain alien) and the way they talked had me laughing quite often.\\n\r\nTherefore, 10 out of 10 for sound as well! (mainly because of the great VAs)\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10/10\\n\r\nI've somewhat mentioned this in the \"Story\" section, but anyways: The characters are pretty realistic and are interesting. Each character is unique and has their own interests and goals. They all have some flaws which they themselves recognize, and they will each face problems because of this, which they eventually learn to accept or overcome.\\n\r\nThere is some nice character development here, and many characters has changed drastically(for the better i think) throughout the series.\\n\r\nLike most anime of this genre, the characters decide the quality of the anime, and I have to say that the characters were very well thought out indeed.\\n\r\n10 out of 10.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\r\nBecause of all the reasons above, I give this anime a 10/10.\\n\r\nThe anime sometimes made me feel happy, sometimes sad. There are those nice tear-jerking moments, and then those hilarious moments when one of the lovely characters does something stupid.\\n\r\nAnother good thing = No unnecessary fan-service (Nope, sorry for those ppl just looking for naked women in animes, but people don't \"accidentally\" kiss or get their clothes torn or whatever in this anime).\\n\r\nThere is some nudity here and there, but it's explained in the plot as due to the Pet Girl's lack of common sense or courtesy.\\n\r\nOverall a very enjoyable and commendable anime.\\n\r\n10 out of 10.",

            "content": "Sakurasou no Pet na Kanojo is a school romcom anime that has received much praise and popularity over the past 5 years with it's debut in 2012, and since then, has become one of the many enjoyable series if you're into the slice of life genre. Sakurasou has many comedic moments which will make you laugh, hardships and challenges the main characters go through which will make you sad, and important messages for the viewer to follow along as the show progresses. If you haven't had the chance to view Sakurasou yet, I'm sure your time will not be wasted on this series.\r\nThe story ofSakurasou is very unique and enjoyable. Often, it is classified as a tragic, yet very rewarding show in the end. I too am on the same boat with that setting, however, there were also many memorable and enjoyable moments that drove the plot from getting stale and making me excited after every new episode came on. People also mistaken it for just being a romcom, when in fact friendships plays a more important and significant role in the story telling.\\n\\n\r\nA short summary of the beginning of the story plays out like this: Kanda Sorata, one the main characters, moves to a school dorm called Sakurasou, because he wasn't allowed to keep cats that he found off the streets in the regular dorms. One day, another main character, Shiina Mashiro, who excels in her artistic works and drawings, moves into Sakurasou. The unique and interesting part of Shiina though is how she doesn't know how to live a normal life as a teenage girl. The other characters at Sakurasou, primarily Sorata, are tasked to take care of Shiina, and the rest of the story tells the relationship that evolves between Sorata and Shiina, as well as the other members of Sakurasou. \\n\\n\r\nSakurasou does an amazing job on letting the viewer know how each character is their own individual self with many realistic traits and goals that they strive to get to throughout the show. The show also does a great job of storytelling the comedy, drama, jealousy, heartbreaks, hardships, envy, and satisfactory in each scene and characters. It's one of the many slice of life animes that each individual can relate to with many realistic scenarios and challenges each character goes through.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, the story isn't perfect. Minority of scenes were dragged on, and there was a lot of unnecessary fan service from time to time, but that is excused from the excellent portrayal of the characters are their situations. It rightfully deserves it's praise of making the viewer feel emotionally attached to the drive of the story. You feel as though each one of these roommates at Sakurasou are a family that support and love each other.\\n\\n\r\nThe artwork in Sakurasou is a prime example of what every art style should like in an anime. The warmth and elaborate color schemes definitely stick out and scream at you when watching. The character design, especially Mashiro's, really had an impact and made me fall in love with each character's artistic style. The scenery was very well done and there wasn't a single time where I found one piece of the art didn't belong there. The artwork was an overall phenomenal and definitely had an impact on my enjoyment of the show.\\n\\n\r\nLike the artwork, the sounds and music from Sakurasou are also phenomenal. The music when certain scenes are played connects very well to the mood and setting, as well as sets up the tension in scenes most of the time. The voice acting was pretty spot on with convincing emotions of the characters. The opening is very warming and friendly, along with the ending theme. A specific track in Sakurasou, Namae o Yonde, definitely made me feel emotional at times, as well as very happy at others. Easily my favorite emotional soundtrack of all time. \\n\\n\r\nWhat makes Sakurasou so unique is how each main character is connected with the plot of the story. In my opinion, there was not one main character who didn't contribute or get in the way of the flow of the story. The beauty of the main characters is how they fail at times and learn from their mistakes to overcome the challenges they are faced with. Each individual characters are all under the same roof of Sakurasou hall, so you get to see each character grow in depth, the relationships that are built, the romance and love that envelops, and the individual struggles that each character must go through in order to overcome their challenges.\\n\\n\r\nAll the main characters are good at something, with some characters being more gifted than others. This sets the stage for the characters without a special talent to go through hardships and despair as their creations and shadowed over. One of the main characters, Sorata Kanda, is an example of someone who doesn't have special talents like many of his roommates in Sakursou hall, with his work constantly being overshadowed by Mashiro's art and natural talent with drawings. There's also a sort of love triangle between 3 of the main characters and 2 other significant relationships between 4 characters that a first seems like a typical romance genre type of relationship, but overtime it shines out and develops further to make it a very unique situations from the rest of the shows out there. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, most, if not at least one of the characters in the show have a good chance of being related to the viewer in a way. Some have to grind day and night just to have a chance of getting somewhere in their life, while others have talents just naturally and don't put in much effort as much as the other characters do. Some characters have feelings for one another, while others are so consumed in their work, they don't notice someone else's feelings for them. I enjoyed the characters personalities and qualities a lot. \\n\\n\r\nMy enjoyment of Sakurasou was very high and had me engaged with it's heavily story driven plot of hardships, relationships, and overcoming obstacles in life, it's highly lovable and relatable characters, and it's fantastic art and sound. If you're the type of person who liked an anime like Toradora, or has a interest in a realistic aspect slice of life to an anime, I would definitely recommend giving this show a chance. I don't think you will be disappointed, as it rarely never staggers in quality and always has you being engaged with what's going on. At moments it had me at the edge of my seat in anticipation, had me sad when characters failed at something they worked so hard on, and happy at the end of the story.\\n\\n\r\nPersonally, when I started to watch this anime, I didn't expect much impact and drive would come out from it. The ratings were high but not great, and if I wasn't recommended to watch it, I may have never found Sakurasou. But boy I'm glad I did, because Sakurasou has had a huge impact on me and how I view challenges that I'm faced with. The characters taught me no matter how hard you try, no matter how hard you fail at the things you're passionate about, you should never give up and never look away, all the hard work will eventually pay off one day. I would definitely recommend this to anyone who is a huge fan of anime, or is just getting started.",

            "content": "The Pet Girl of Sakurasou is very very relate-able and enjoyable on a Toradora level. Anyone who is/has been/ will be in the studies of the arts will enjoy and appreciate it even more so.\r\nWhat it\u2019s about: Sorata is your average nobody with a big heart who, due to his acquisition of a stray cat, is dumped into the notoriously zany world of the dorms at Sakurasou Hall until he finds an owner. Unfortunately, he seems to have given up finding an owner and has only taken on more cats as time has passed. Then Mashiro arrives. To add to the already insanely varied residentsof the hall, she is a girl from England who is an artistic prodigy that has no concept of social norms or how to take care of herself. Needless to say, Sorata begins to take care of her as one would do for a \u2026 well\u2026 pet. This is a story following the day to day life of the hall\u2019s residents; their friendships, romances, issues, and struggles with the real world.\\n\\n\r\nArt: Though perhaps not THE best I\u2019ve seen, the quality is up there, and considering it\u2019s all about art in the first place, it kinda has to be anyway. 8/10 \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Very relate-able, very diverse, and lots of fun. All are remember-able and show some sort of growth throughout the series. Designs are well done for almost always sticking them in uniforms. 9/10\\n\\n\r\nMusic: Pretty good. Nothing too amazing, but it\u2019s used well, and the OP\u2019s and ED\u2019s always managed to get me to bob my head. Enjoyable, but not remember-able. 8/10\\n\\n\r\nStory: The story might have been slacking a bit at first, since it was mostly intro for all the characters and the hall trying to figure out what to do with Mashiro, but as the characters began their own struggles and friendships grew, things got a lot more interesting. The second half did seem to start becoming almost too plot driven in that it almost started taking away from the characters, but in the end it turned out to be enough of an emotional wringer that it didn\u2019t matter. It has a definitive end, but it was definitely left open for a possible future season which has me on the fence. Since so much has been settled and changed, unless it\u2019s handled well, it can only go downhill. 7/10\\n\\n\r\nSome points I found good/ bad/ interesting:\\n\r\n1.)It was a real life approach to the romance between a caring guy and a hopeless girl. (Extreme yin yang of social aptitude and talent.)\\n\r\n2.) Lots of real life struggles, and the characters didn\u2019t always \u2018win\u2019. Not your typical approach to an anime where typically hard work will always pay off.\\n\r\n3.)The love triangle was well handled and believable. It wasn\u2019t really one sided or a ping pong match between the interests. It was more of a tug of war; it generally stayed in place, but the tension kept growing until one side caved in to defeat.\\n\r\n4.)The last arc seemed too haphazardly thrown in and drawn out, but led to a very good, emotional ending.\\n\\n\r\nI feel like the staff had fun reliving their college days with this one. Between master painters, manga artists, voice actors, video game programmers, script writers and anime producers its like they were creating a version of themselves and showing all the struggles they had to endure to get where they are today. Having been a part of this culture as well I can certainly relate more than the average person probably will, especially when it comes to those all nighters and the 3 hour naps before your final exams. However, as much as I can picture every character of the cast as almost an exact replica of someone I\u2019ve met along the way, I\u2019m pretty sure even those of you who haven\u2019t been exposed to the zaniness of the art students can find something/someone relate-able to each of them as well. \\n\\n\r\nWhat\u2019s great about this show is the wide range of cast it carries and the depiction of all the real life struggles the characters have to go through. They don\u2019t all just get free passes through everything and aren\u2019t invulnerable which is something I give major kudos to the creator for. You\u2019ve got extroverts, introverts, geeks, ladies men, socially inept geniuses and struggling caretakers. They all manage to mesh and balance perfectly which is essentially what Sakurasou Hall is all about: the bond between a bunch of oddballs from all walks of life who don\u2019t quite fit in with the norm.\\n\\n\r\nNow, if you\u2019re into action\u2026 this probably won\u2019t float your boat that well. This is more of your slice of life with character driven episodes and love strings galore. And the last quarter or so of the season will definitely pull at your heartstrings for better or worse. It\u2019s a fun little ride with some comedy throughout and something towards the top of my list that I would recommend to almost anyone. \\n\\n\r\nJust... don\u2019t choose Plan C. \\n\\n\r\n------------- In Depth Review Contains A Few Small Spoilers-------------------\\n\r\n-----------Surrounded by \"***Spoiler***\" Continue Reading-------------- \\n\r\n-------------------------------At Your Own Risk-------------------------------------\\n\\n\r\nWhat do I think about the characters?\\n\\n\r\nSorata: A good natured main character out to help anyone he can to a point it makes it a fault. A lot of the jokes are on him for misunderstood intimate occasions. I see him as the ultimate wish fulfillment character for any girl who wants a \u201cgood boy\u201d or caring husband. He is by all means mediocre, and we get to see him struggle through all the issues there are for an average person trying to get into the professional workplace. I found myself wanting to whack him upside the head for being so damn dense at times, but I suppose it helped keep the suspense up between which of the girls he\u2019d choose since it led to making it seem solely dependent on the girls to come up with a way to confess to him.\\n\\n\r\nMashiro: On the other hand you have the completely beautiful yet hopeless girl that can\u2019t even dress herself trying to learn what love is and understand why everyone else isn\u2019t a genius like her. What she wants, she gets simply because of her talent. It\u2019s fun to watch her slowly learning and becoming more human throughout the show, but sometimes it also feels like she\u2019s just not even trying. I almost expected a few episodes to make it out that she was just trolling someone with stupidness to get her way. She\u2019s just not all that relate-able to most, and at times she\u2019s written in a way that almost feels as if she\u2019s there to alienate the audience as well to keep the suspense and shippers balanced on the Nanami side. But there are also those cute moments of helplessness and innocence that call Sorata to her side and make you melt down and say \u201cthey should be a couple\u201d.\\n\\n\r\nNanami: An average girl forcing herself to live by her own means. She puts everything on her shoulders, and refuses to let anyone help her with her burdens. Though it\u2019s always nice to see this sort of thing, she doesn\u2019t know her own boundaries and often winds up finding it backfiring horribly. She\u2019s very determined, but is a complete tsundere so when it comes to anything about love she quickly becomes wishy-washy and shy. It doesn\u2019t help that she\u2019s also extremely jealous and obviously has a crush on Sorata from the get go. You often see her and Sorata in the same light; going through the same struggles of mediocrity and such, and they would clearly work out as the perfect couple. However, they always seem to be pulled apart or set back whenever something happens with Mashiro, and she is constantly reminded that no matter how close they are, Sorata just never quite cares as deeply for her in the same way.  The last half of the season made me wish she would find it in her to grow a backbone and confess, but she never really does.\\n\r\n***Spoiler***\\n\r\n Instead, she objectively looks at the situation and decides it\u2019s better to save their friendship and herself from a very likely heartbreak to back down. I don\u2019t exactly know why, but she won a lot of kudos from me on that one.\\n\r\n***End Spoiler***\\n\\n\r\nMisaki: The crazy \u201calien\u201d. She\u2019s an anime artist who is so energetic, so raunchy, so\u2026 eccentric that you can\u2019t really help but laugh at her character alone. Mostly played for comic relief, you kinda just wish she was your friend to see what kind of crazy stuff she might drag you into. Of course her and Jin have had a long, drawn out \u201crelationship\u201d if you could really call it that. She is always smothering herself all over him, and though he pretty much shoots her down every time, you can tell that he does really care about her as well. Though she is very determined to make him hers, she is constantly reflecting on why he won\u2019t just accept her and for the last half of the series, it almost gets overdone to the point you wish she\u2019d stop moping and go back to her usual crazy self. \\n\\n\r\nJin: Misaki\u2019s love interest and all around ladies\u2019 man. He is the cool, calm, collected one that everyone seems to go to when looking for answers from someone a bit more mature. I never really cared for him all that much, and he became such a mess of a character towards the end that I couldn\u2019t even really follow his motivations. He liked Misaki; he didn\u2019t want to hurt her, but never seemed to stop doing it. \\n\r\n***Spoiler***\\n\r\nI could see possible fears of a long distance relationship since he was going to a different college, and the pressure of cold feet trying to propose, but he wound up being another numbskull who didn\u2019t know how to react when it came to confessing true feelings. \\n\r\n***End Spoiler***\\n\\n\r\nRyunosuke: Your typical anti-social computer genius with a fear of girls.  The first half you never really see him; the only interaction he has is through Maid-chan, his personal messaging AI. He manages to deliver a lot of hard truths to the characters because of his general disinterest of empathy and way of looking at things in a calculating black and white manner. His growth is very clear, even if it doesn\u2019t get very far from where he started. He begins going to more classes, stays out of his room more often, and begins showing a little more empathy towards the rest of the cast. I suppose having that bombshell Rita making advances all over you just might do the trick for anyone though.\\n\\n\r\nRita: Plot device and support character. Not much to say.\\n\\n\r\nChihiro: Obviously a desperate female who is a teacher and overseer of Sakurasou hall. Not a whole lot of screen time.\\n\\n\r\nYuko: Plot device and comic relief. Typical jealous little sister with a brother complex.",

            "content": "\u201cWhat color do you want to be?\u201d\r\nWith this strange question starts the story of a couple of \u201cproblem children\u201d at Sakurasou. A dorm for students who have violated Suiko (a.k.a. high school affiliated with Suimei University of the Arts) policies, Sakurasou shelters a diverse group of students each with a unique personality. As a result, there isn\u2019t one day that the dorm stays quiet, and the students are free to express their creativity without worry of getting kicked out. \r\nAt the start of the story, everyone starts on an empty canvas, each with a brush that has yet to be dabbed in any specific \"color.\"As viewers follow along the process of each character realizing his or her dream and pursuing that dream, it starts to become clear who they are, or what \u201ccolor\u201d they paint with. With its many heartwarming as well as heart-wrenching moments, this unusual group of friends at Sakurasou all together paints a masterpiece that will leave the viewers smiling from start to end.\\n\\n\r\n(Below I provide the \u201cpluses\u201d and \u201cdeltas\u201d of the show. Pluses will signify the positive aspects of the anime, while deltas will signify aspects of the anime that could have been changed or improved upon.)\\n\\n\r\nPluses:\\n\\n\r\n(+) Overall message: The world is unfair. Those who are gifted are acknowledged and those who cannot keep up are left behind in the dark. Sooner or later, the feeling of frustration, depression, and helplessness will overcome anyone left in the dark, pulling them further and further back. The main protagonist, Kanda Sorata, suffers the most from the unfairness of this world, and cannot help but vent his anger out on others and blame others for his misfortunes. However, the anime sends out a positive message for those who suffer like Sorata, and that is to accept the fact that the world is indeed unfair and face the failures head-on instead of trying to run away. The anime reinforces the fact that failure is but a stepping stone to success, and there\u2019s no need to become discouraged from it. Seeing Sorata overcome his struggles and move on with his life to tackle his next challenges is emotionally satisfying and surprisingly inspirational. Sorata proves that being optimistic and never losing sight of what you want to do will eventually lead to better results. With such a deep and meaningful message for the young demographic, it\u2019s hard not to like this anime.\\n\\n\r\n(+) Character development: Everyone in this anime has a goal that they want to reach. The anime shows the process of each of them trying to reach that goal, while they constantly go through struggles. And along that process, viewers see the characters gradually learning, maturing, and becoming better people overall. As much as I would love to expand on how each character changes throughout the series, I\u2019ll leave the joy of watching each of them change to the viewers. The developments are perfectly paced so that they help viewers naturally develop deep connections with the characters. Towards the end of the anime when time inevitably drifts them apart, there\u2019s a strong sense of bitter sweetness because one side of you is happy for them and the other is sad that they\u2019re moving on.\\n\\n\r\n(+) Realistic emotions: The emotions expressed and experienced by the characters as they go through their individual development are all too realistic and relatable. The fun yet exhausting nights of working on a project or practicing for a competition, the anxiety before an interview or presentation, the joys of getting accepted, and the frustrations of getting rejected \u2013 these are all experiences that all of us have experienced at one point or another in our lives. And some of the emotions that we express during these times are not pretty. This anime delivers the raw and ugly emotions such as jealousy, anger, bitterness, and hopelessness. Sakurasou no Pet na Kanojo is indeed darker than it seems. The anime is not about the characters starting from the bottom and making it big within 24 episodes, but about people starting from the bottom and struggling to make it big. Such is the stark reality of society right now, and the anime teaches the painful lesson that people who think determination and hard work are all they need to reach their goal are overly na\u00efve.\\n\\n\r\n(+) Well-developed ending: Unlike most anime whose ending comprises of both the climax and resolution of the story, Sakurasou no Pet na Kanojo manages to space out the climax and resolution over the last three episodes of the series. As a result, the ending is perfectly paced and not rushed at all; the buildup of emotions leading up to the climax is perfectly delivered; and the resolution is overall satisfying and doesn\u2019t leave the audience wanting for more.\\n\\n\r\nDeltas:\\n\\n\r\n(-) Fan service: Anime productions often seem to feel a need to please the fans with underwear scenes, cleavage shots, and sexual innuendos. As enticing as these scenes are the first few times, the fan service quickly becomes stale, repetitive, unnecessary, and uninteresting. If anything, fan service hurts the value of the anime because it demonstrates the desperate measures that the production took to maintain or gain popularity. Sadly enough, Sakurasou no Pet na Kanojo is no exception. Expect a lot of underwear scenes, cleavage shots, and sexual innuendos whenever the anime isn\u2019t trying to be serious. \\n\\n\r\n(-) Stereotypical characters: When it comes to school-life + romantic comedy anime, nothing bothers me more than seeing the same personas fulfilling the same stereotypes. For example, there is always the overly enthusiastic character that usually brightens up the mood. There is always the quiet one with an emotionless face or a soft-spoken voice, and these characters tend to be airheaded, socially awkward, gifted with a talent, or all of the above. There is always the hardworking one that often works his or herself to the point of becoming ill. There is the overly cynical or critical one that says what is on his or her mind, but doesn\u2019t mean it in a bad way. There is the tsundere, or a typical girl that is tough as nails, but emotionally sensitive. And of course, there\u2019s the average male or female protagonist that is overly optimistic and unnaturally oblivious to the idea of romance. Of course, these stereotypes are simply some of the most common personas that I see in a school-life + romantic comedy anime and thus might not apply to a lot of school-life anime that I have yet to see. However, at some point I, as a viewer, will get tired of seeing the same persona, with more or less the same backgrounds, and more or less the same problems. Having said that, Sakurasou no Pet na Kanojo fulfills MOST of the stereotypes mentioned and thus their personalities felt familiar at best and not really interesting. What kept me interested in the characters was the realistic side of them, the side of them that tries to reach their goals.\\n\\n\r\n(-) Lack of Art: As an anime about students at an art school, there is an unsatisfying amount of artworks shown. Also, as an anime that explores the world of painting, voice acting, anime, manga, and gaming, the anime only touches upon the surface-level knowledge of each world. However, the lack of art and the knowledge doesn\u2019t take much away from the anime. This delta is more of a personal complaint, because the anime seems to only be TELLING how hard the characters work and how passionate they are, rather than taking the time SHOWING these things through artworks that characters produce.\\n\\n\r\n(-) Depth of the relationships: There are romantic relationships developing left and right between the characters, so it is quite difficult to take all of them seriously. There is only one relationship in this anime that is explored deeply, and that is the only relationship the viewers should have been introduced to (namely, the Jin and Misaki couple). The other relationships take the focus away from the anime because they are neither realistic nor relevant (to the main story). For example, there is nothing more frustrating than an oblivious protagonist failing to notice two girls trying to get his attention. Many times I had to skip through the scenes that show the \u201cprogress\u201d of the protagonist\u2019s relationship with each of the two girls, simply because the conversations, the reactions, and the progress of the relationship seemed too clich\u00e9 and superficial. Not to say I disliked the characters, but I preferred to see their serious side more so than their awkward romantic side. (If you\u2019ve grown jaded from the harem-type anime, you\u2019ll know what I mean).\\n\\n\r\nOverall: Although Sakurasou no Pet na Kanojo fails to escape the stereotypes of a typical school-life + romantic comedy anime, the masterful development of the story and the characters, along with several enjoyable and hilarious moments, is enough to make this anime a must-watch.\\n\\n\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n\r\nReview by MAL criteria: \\n\\n\r\n(This section will be kept short because I will simply be summarizing some of the points I made above)\\n\\n\r\nStory: 9/10 \\n\\n\r\nThe masterful development of the characters as they pursue their dreams, along with the various emotions that they express or experience, are very relatable and real. The story is perfectly paced and tries to deliver a positive message for those troubled like the characters.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nEven if I complained about the lack of art in this anime, I could tell that the production spent countless hours trying to perfect the additional artworks while having to animate the characters. The watercolor artworks, the 3D rendering portion, and artworks for games were all beautifully done and with great detail.\\n\\n\r\nIf that wasn\u2019t enough, some of the scenes in this anime were drop-dead gorgeous and stunning. I will leave the surprise for the viewers, but don\u2019t underestimate a school-life + romantic comedy because of its school-life setting.\\n\\n\r\nIt goes on without saying that the characters are well-designed and beautifully animated. The style of characters is kind of generic and simple, but each of the characters have distinguishing features that make them unique.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 7/10 \\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is nothing too special. Most of the tracks are short so that they fit a certain situation or mood in the anime. Both the openings and endings are your typical upbeat cheerful songs that are catchy but not quite noteworthy.\\n\\n\r\nWhat gives the sound at least a 7 is the perfect voice acting, especially when the actors express realistic emotions like sadness, anger, bitterness, hopelessness, and jealousy.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nAlthough all the characters are well-developed and lovable, they still fail to be 100% relatable due to their clich\u00e9 personas of a typical school-life + romantic comedy anime.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nThere is not one moment when I felt bored while watching this anime (maybe except the clich\u00e9 romantic scenes). The anime elicited out of me various emotions, so a lot of the times I found myself laughing one moment and then choking up the next.\\n\\n\r\n8.4/10\\n",

I'm still thinking about it now, as a matter of fact, even though I finished the final episode last night.\r\nI'm thinking about Sorata and Mashiro, about Misaki-sempai and Jin. Aoyama and Ryuunosuke. These characters that meant nothing to me just a few short days ago, but now evoke strong feelings in me. Why do I love these characters so much?\r\nI think it's because even in though they are somewhat caricatured, they are so human in so many ways. Their experiences remind me of my own when I wasyoung, not so long but seemingly forever ago. \\n\\n\r\nThey remind me of what it was like to love for the very first time; that awkward, heady romance that dies ever so gradually as you grow up and grow jaded. They remind me of what it was like to have friends back then-friends that you could only make when you were young. The kind that you don't have to think twice about trusting.\\n\\n\r\nAnd even more than these memories of the past, Sakurasou evokes this sort of wild inspiration in me, the everlasting call throughout the series to \"try your best\", even if you fail. Even though the chances are that you will fail. Because eventually, if you're quite lucky, one day you will succeed.\\n\\n\r\nHow could an anime create so many feelings in me? How could 24 23 minute episodes give me so much hope and such drive to push on? This can only lead me to believe that this show is a masterpiece. A beautiful representation of everything entertainment should be. Shows should create these feelings in us. That should be the point.\\n\\n\r\nDo you want to feel again? Do you want to remember?\\n\\n\r\n10/10 across the board.",

            "content": "Has there ever been a time while watching anime where you, the viewer, dislike a part of an anime that is objectively very well done? For me, that is the case with Sakurasou no Pet na Kanojo. \r\nNormally, romance shows generally don't have much to talk about story-wise, as they are more or less completely character driven. And even though Sakurasou is more or less completely character driven, the story holds up on it's own fairly well. What I liked about the story is that it never takes too long on a particular topic, but fleshes each topic out enough to give it weight andmeaning. They managed time and pacing really well in this aspect.\\n\\n\r\nOne of the best aspects of Sakurasou is it's themes. One such theme is failure.\\n\r\nWhen a character fails a particular goal, you feel so much pain for them because of the amount of time and effort they put into that goal. Themes such as this make Sakurasou feel very  relatable and close to home. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters in Sakurasou is easily what you pay to see when watching this anime. What I liked about these characters was that, at the beginning, they seemed very generic and arc-typical. You had the quiet girl, the tsundere, the cheerful bouncy girl, and so forth. However, each character is so much more than just that. \\n\\n\r\nLet's start off with my favourite character, Mashiro. She has easily become one of my favourite female characters in anime. Mashiro is an extremely phenomenal artist, to the point where she leaves everyone else in her dust. However, she lacks basic everyday knowledge, such as washing or putting on clothes, cooking, etc. She is an example of the quiet girl archetype done wonderfully. Although she is quiet and seemingly emotionless, she cares deeply for the friends she meets, and shows that eternal bond of friendship through her emaculate paintings and manga drawings. This is going to sound kind of misleading, but she is the indirect cause of a lot of the conflict in this show because of how great she is at painting, as she is a character that keeps achieving her goals whereas many other characters fail, which leads to jealousy, another theme shown prevalently throughout the show. But the lengths she goes to correct what her position in the world has done to her friends leads to some of the more emotionally powerful scenes in the anime. One last thing that made me love Mashiro as a character was the few times where she struggled to come to terms with her feelings. Those moments were truly interesting to watch, and makes Mashiro even more dynamic. \\n\\n\r\nKanda Sorata, the main male protagonist, is a lot less gifted that Mashiro, and has to work tremendously hard to achieve his dreams. What made him interesting was his relationship with Mashiro. When Mashiro succeeds in her dreams, he fails in his, and he, at points, shuns her as she is on a whole other level than her. On the other hand, he looks up to Mashiro as a sort of goal line; something to keep him motivated to complete his goals. However, what I really liked about the relationship was how balanced it was. While Mashiro helped him with motivation, along with other things, Sorata was always there when Mashiro needed help with social aspects of life, creating this kind of give and take relationship. Their bond created from leaning on each other was fantastic. \\n\\n\r\nBut this is where I dislike the series. It was the objectively good thing I was talking about. The love triangle between Aoyama, Kanda, and Mashiro. The thing is, Aoyama is a great character in her own right, and the love triangle does work. Aoyama is also someone who has to work hard to achieve her goals, and sometimes fails in spite of her hard work. In this aspect, Aoyama and Kanda understand what the other is going through. This is the main problem I have with the series. Both Sorata's and Aoyama's relationship is developed, and Mashiro's and Sorata's relationship is developed. When the anime ends, there is not a clear line of the romantic outcome that should have taken place. Both of these relationships are very enjoyable to watch, but it leaves the viewer muddled and confused. \\n\\n\r\nThe other relationships are handled nicely in my opinion, albeit to a lesser extent. Jin and Misaki's relationship had a good feeling to it, and had a nice message behind it, but it left a lot to be desired. I feel more time could have definetely been put to flesh out their relationship more. This goes the same with Ryuunosuke and Rita's relationship. Their relationship is focused on even less, but it had a great plan for success. It's just that that plan was never fully acted upon.\\n\\n\r\nThis is more of a nitpick than anything, but it would have been nice to give the characters reasons for their dreams. Why did Sorata want to be a game designer? Why does Aoyama want to be a voice actress? This isn't that big of a deal because their passion for their dreams overcomes this minor gripe, but it still would have been nice.\\n\\n\r\nThere isn't a lot to talk about art and sound wise. The art had a very refreshing feel to it, as there was this pinkish gradient to everything. I know it sounds weird when I phrase it like that, but trust me, it looks good. The actual animation is standard fare. Romance shows aren't known for having bountiful amounts of movement.\\n\\n\r\nOne thing I will say about the sound was the voice actress of Mashiro's character. From the first few episodes to the last few, you could tell the growth of her character just by the emotion being slowly brought in episode to episode by the voice actress. Great job there.\\n\\n\r\nThe actual music was pretty good, but I was much more focused on the story and characters than the actual music. It worked, but there isn't else to it outside of that. The opening and endings where definitely better than most, though.\\n\\n\r\nOne last thing presentation wise. Ryuunosuke's character design and voice. It is VERY MISLEADING. He looks like a girl with really long hair, and even has a female voice actress, but he is indeed a dude. It was a little jarring at times to be sure. \\n\\n\r\nSakurasou no Pet na Kanojo was a great reminder of the potential a romance show can bring. In a day and age where there is so much fanservice and little depth to shows of this nature, it is refreshing to see a fairly new title such as this one with so much emotion and depth. This isn't to say that there is no fanservice in this show, because there is plenty, but it get's toned down later in the series when the more dramatic scenes start to roll out. Same goes for the comedic aspects as well. You watch this show for the characters, their relationships, the drive they have for their dreams, and the emotion they bring. Some scenes almost brought me to tears at how emotionally powerful they were. And speaking of, the ending of the show was fantastic. I won't spoil it to you, but if you have seen Angel Beats, think that but much better. However, the romance itself, although fleshed out, feels confusing as, by the end of a show, their is no clear romantic conclusion. All in all, if you like romance shows, this is one you cannot miss; it is truly fantastic.",

            "content": "\"Ordinary high school boy meets special/gifted high school girl. They fall in love.\" It's that simple... while not being that simple. Allow me to explain in my review of Sakurasou no Pet na Kanojo.\r\nSynopsis/Overview: Sorata Kanda, the male protagonist, is an ordinary high schooler with no special talents, average looks, and is just going through the motions of life with no real goal. In contrast, Sorata's roommates all excel at something. \r\nOne day Chihiro (a teacher at Sorata's school and dorm supervisor of Sakurasou Hall) tells Sorata to pick up her cousin, a transfer student from England named Mashiro Shiina (female protagonist), and bring herback to Sakurasou Hall. Sorata does as instructed and the next morning Sorata realizes something about Shiina... she has no clue how to live on her own and needs constant help and guidance. And so begins the relationship of \"master and pet\".\\n\\n\r\nStory - 9\\n\r\nThe story is good, but far from innovative or original. As explained in the synopsis, an ordinary high school boy meets a special high school girl. Not original. Boy has to take care of girl who is incapable/barely capable of living on her own... I believe a recent very popular high school rom-com took this approach as well (Toradora). Again, not original. Hmm, why did I give it a 9 then? Why not a 7 or a 6?\\n\\n\r\nSo while the most basic premise of Sakurasou no Pet na Kanojo may not be unique or even creative, it does have 1 thing very few high school rom-coms REALLY explore... self-discovery.I'm not just talking about shallow emotions, I'm talking about questions like \"What am I really? What am I good at? What can I become?\" One of the major plotlines in the story apart from the romance, relationships, and the everyday life of the people in Sakurasou is also Sorata's frustration and feeling of ineptitude and how he struggles to find a goal. That is why I give it a 9, because it's fucking real.\\n\\n\r\nArt - 10\\n\r\nJC Staff, by far my animation studio. I have 0 complaints as far as art is concerned whenever they work on an anime. Loved the art in Nodame Cantabile, Maid-sama, Toradora, etc etc. I'm no art connoisseur so I won't pretend to know a bunch of technical terms, all I can say is the simple \"I love the artwork and animation JC Staff brought to the show\".  Art, for the most part, is purely subjective. I enjoyed it a lot, others may not.\\n\\n\r\nSound - 9\\n\r\nNot a big sound guy, as it's not horrible/repetitive, and as long as the voice acting is believable, I'll most likely be favorable. I really enjoy the opening and ending to Sakurasou. Other than that, nothing really stands out to me. Voice acting is good, no complaints here.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 10\\n\r\nI'm going to as blunt as possible. The reason I'm giving Character(s) a 10 is because of Sorata Kanda. The supporting crew (everyone but Sorata and Mashiro) are entertaining and multi-dimensional. With that being said, they borrow a lot of common themes/traits popular among similar animes, but it's also a very daunting, underestimated task of making a truly original AND interesting supporting character(s), so I don't really mind that much. I won't go into much detail, or really any at all, about Sorata's and Mashiro's roommates/peers, I'll leave that for you to discover. Now on to the main course.\\n\\n\r\nSorata Kanda - Sorata is, as previously described, an ordinary high school boy with no particular specialties. He is nice and always willing to lend a helping hand, but at times can become frustrated at others. The source of his frustration is really just his own issues, being particularly good at nothing while being surrounded by talent. His frustration, self-discovery, and romantic feelings take off when he meets Mashiro, whom at first he is tasked to take care of, but later begins to enjoy of his own will. Sorata is interested in video games, both for personal enjoyment and later aspires to be a video game creator. Sorata is the kind of character you root for regardless of the situation and circumstances, and I rarely ever find myself doing that.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSorata is probably one of the realest anime characters I've ever seen and that makes it all the more interesting that he's surrounded by, relatively speaking, unbelievable characters. To make a popular parallel, although I haven't seen a whole lot of Melancholy of Haruhi, he's similar to Kyon.\\n\\n\r\nMashrio Shiina - Unaware of most things other than painting and drawing, Mashiro is the oblivious, mono-toned, extremely gifted heroine of the Sakurasou no Pet na Kanojo. Mashrio is a world-renowned painter who comes to Japan to become a manga artist, something she's new to, but shows she excels very quickly in the world of arts. While being extremely gifted and brilliant at art, she is a complete dunce when it comes to even the most basic form of living. She doesn't know how to clean her room, wash her hair, and gets lost on her own; however, throughout the progression of the series, she begins to learn how to live on her own, little by little, thanks to the help of Sorata. Mashiro is interested in Sorata, and with his help, she slowly breaks out of her emotionless, hapless shell.\\n\\n\r\nMashiro Shiina has some pretty unrealistic qualities, but at the same time, she's very interesting and can show genuine, believable feelings such as loneliness, love, and joy.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 10\\n\r\nI love this series, it's definitely one of my favorite... although I wish they turned down the ecchi/fanservice a little. Some scenes are completely unnecessary and only exist to satisfy some fan's ecchi needs or whatever. With that being said, there really isn't a lot of it so it doesn't derail from the show itself so it's okay. Other than that, not only do I have no complaints, I look forward to watching this show the SECOND it airs every week. If a show elicits that kind of a response from me, it's an automatic 10 in terms of enjoyment.\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 9\\n\\n\r\nToradora 2.0 delivers in a bigger and better way. I can see me giving this series a 10 when it's all said and done, but for now there isn't enough depth and the ecchi-esque air of the show detracts from what is really could be, a masterpiece.\\n\\n\\n\r\n1st review plizz b gentle thxthx\\n\\n\r\n(This review was written without reading any of the manga and having watched 12/24 episodes [episodes available at the time of the review])",

A amazing artist moves to Japan to start a manga series, and just as luck would have it, her aunt is the manager of Sakurasou, so she moves in there. No problem right? WRONG!!! She hasnever had to be independent due to her up-bringing, and she does not even know how to dress herself, and just because all the other people there are mad, it is left to Sorata to care for and run this persons life.\\n\\n\r\nThe art in this anime is my favorite type, lots of happy, bright colours, lots of detail and lots of miss-coloured objects (blue trees anyone?) \\n\\n\r\nWhat really makes this anime special are the characters, the crazy, funny, retarded, mad, carefree characters. Sakurasou houses all kinds of people, from contract programmers, to animators and script writers, manga artists and voice actresses, they have them all. All these characters are special and unique, making them just right for this anime.\\n\\n\r\nThis is a love and laughter anime, for making a person feel good, even on a horrible day =)",

            "content": "Whenever I start to watch a new anime series I always look at the genres and brainstorm some simple thoughts of what type of show this could be. So for this show before even watching it these were the 3 ideas that came to mind.\r\n1. A bunch of girls congregate around 1 guy, and this guy is normally very shy and \u201cuncool\u201d as we may speak. This category could sometimes fall under the genre of \u201cHarem\u201d (To Love-Ru)\r\n2. The guy is a complete pervert who chases after those \u201ceye candy\u201d girls that stand out and call for attention. (Sunabouzu [Desert Punk])\r\n3. The guy is acomplete pimp who all the girls like and he gets with all the girls he wants. (Hagure Yuusha no Estetica [Aesthetica of a Rogue Hero]). There are very few wishy-washy moments and it is normally straight to the point.\\n\\n\r\nAs it was seen from the beginning of the show, this one defiantly is under category 1, but this show is not a Harem at all. As the title says this show is going to mainly revolve around a girl named \u201cMashiro\u201d and a guy named \u201cSorata\u201d.\\n\\n\r\nStory:\\n\r\nThe plot of the story is quite simple. Sorata is designated to take care of Mashiro. We know this is a typical romance show so we as the viewers don\u2019t hope for much because from the beginning we have a good feeling of what the outcome of this show is going to be. But there is more! Lucky for us aside from this being about Sorata and Mashiro, a huge part of this show is also about confessions and people being heartbroken. In a way this show tries to take a real high school environment, but show a different perspective of what life is really like.\\n\\n\r\nArtwork:\\n\r\nI honestly don\u2019t like talking about this much because unless the artwork of an anime really sticks out and has its own personality, I will most likely see it as \u201cmediocre\u201d or \u201caverage\u201d. That is the category this anime falls under, it has its \u201cWOOOAAAH AWSOME\u201d moments and then there is also those \u201csure whatever lets just continue the show\u201d. This anime artwork is just very simple and I don\u2019t mind it, but I am not going to praise something like this.\\n\\n\r\nSound (OP/ED):\\n\r\nI honestly think that most shows do a really good job at choosing opening theme songs and ending theme songs. Most of the time I have not been disappointed by them and I find that for this show the songs were very fitting. The opening song is just very full of energy and spunk, which is something this show has a lot of. The ending song I am absolutely in love with! Like the transition that they managed to do from the ending of an episode to this song is always amazing and brings warmth to \u201cmy\u201d heart, I don\u2019t know what others think but this is just my opinion. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nWell I kind of already introduced the 2 main characters in my opinion. But just to add on to where I started in the beginning this is obviously a love show, so there is going to be many characters who fall in love.\\n\\n\r\nMisaki: She is just an overly energetic girl who does not accept \u201cno\u201d as an answer. Her energy levels are just on another level\\n\\n\r\nNanami: She is childhood friends with Sorata and the rest you will figure out soon after\u2026\\n\\n\r\nJin: Honestly he is just a player who loves to mess around with girls. That is all there is to him.\\n\\n\r\nHonestly though, especially for this show you kind of expect, or already know that the main characters all tend to fall in love with each other and have their own stories, it is now just the who/when/and what happens that you are looking forward to.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nI enjoy many shows, actually more like 95% of the animes I watch but does it mean it is good? Not at all! So I will say, I do enjoy this show but what do I really think about it? Its kind of just like your typical Romantic shows. Everything happens either during Christmas, Valentine\u2019s day, or at the festivals. Like why can\u2019t they make a show that all the confessions happen at such a predictable time, for me it just ruins the moment a lot. Like I am hoping to find a Romantic show that just goes out of the ordinary and uses more creative methods to show people confessing their feelings to each other. Like I wont criticize this show for just being the \u2018follower\u2019 and going with how most romance shows are, but when will a show manage to break the chain and start a new one?\\n\\n\r\nWould I recommend this show for others to watch? Ofcourse! It is to me a very light hearted romantic comedy show that has a good flow to it, but is like your typical romance shows. I personally find nothing special about this show, aside from the character Mashiro. She is a very unique, dynamic character that just makes this show soo interesting to watch. Like in our lives we don\u2019t really imagine taking care of someone to that extent who is our age. Maybe if they were younger than us or a senior that is fine, but someone who is in highschool (or whatever grade they are in), this is almost unthinkable. But that is what makes this show so interesting to me, being able to see the kindness that some people are able to go to, and how far they are really willing to go for what/who they care for. I do consider this show to be a bit different from the typical \u201chelpess girl meets overly-friendly guy who them takes care of her\u201d. The storyline isn\u2019t far off from that but the ONLY difference is the extremeness of this case and how much help is actually needed.\\n\\n\r\nAlso, when I am watching an anime I like to see if I can pull out life lessons that people could learn from and the biggest one is \u201calways give it your all for everyone and never leave someone out\u201d. This relates to school also, don\u2019t leave people out because they are a little different; just try to accept everyone for who they are, not for what you want them to be.\\n\r\nWell that\u2019s it folks! If you have any questions or comments please just send me a pm or write on my wall, I will try my best to answer to the best of my power! I will accept any type of feedback on to how to better improve my reviews, but please be constructive as well!\\n\\n\r\nOverall Grade: 7.5",

            "content": "So, I recently watched this anime. I went into it not really knowing what to expect, and I must say I was pleasantly surprised! I breezed through all 24 episodes in just two days, and it isn't too often an anime keeps me so hooked I have to marathon it nowadays, especially a school anime.\r\nWhy is Sakurasou so god damn brilliant? Well, for starters, let's discuss the story. It starts with a kid named Sorata Kanda getting kicked out of his school's regular dormitories for keeping a stray cat. He is presented with the options of either getting rid of the cat, or moving toSakurasou - the school's dorm for problem children. Because Sorata cares so much for his cat, he chooses the option of moving to Sakurasou, a place of which he plans to escape from. One day, a girl named Mashiro Shiina moves to Sakurasou all the way from England, and it turns out she is completely dependent on other people.\\n\\n\r\nI must say, out of all the school anime I have watched so far, Sakurasou probably has the most unique plot - it's completely different from the many basic romance anime that don't feature much besides kids going to school and falling in love. The story is very well constructed and I feel the producers handled all six of the main characters perfectly. I would have liked to see a bit more of Ryuunosuke as he isn't even properly introduced until episode 9. That said, he is a shut-in so there is an obvious, acceptable reason for his lack of appearances.\\n\\n\r\nThe show contains some hilarious moments, some extremely sad moments and some truly great scenes.\\n\\n\r\nNow onto the next point - the (absolutely brilliant) art style! At first, I thought the art seemed pretty standard for modern anime, but as I continued watching, I realised just how beautiful it actually is... The art, the animation, Shiina's paintings, it's all great! In fact, I'd go as far as to call it some of the best art I've ever seen in anime. I especially love the eyes as I can really see the emotion in them.\\n\\n\r\nOh, where do I begin to talk about the characters!? I loved them all so much! They are all incredibly well written and if it weren't for them, I seriously doubt I would have enjoyed Sakurasou so much. Sorata and Jin are both pretty ordinary guys. Well, sure, Jin was a bit too obsessed with women, having four different girlfriends at the same time, but let's face it - an obsession with girls isn't too abnormal for man, is it?\\n\\n\r\nRyuunosuke is a slightly awkward shut-in, programmer and a genius of sorts.  He is a very interesting character who tends to communicate via email or text message. Despite creating Maid-chan, a female AI, he strongly dislikes women.\\n\\n\r\nShiina is very cute. Her inability to care for herself leads to its fair share of problems, but it is easy to tell her heart is in the right place.\\n\\n\r\nMisaki is completely crazy, to the point where she is commonly referred to as an 'alien'. She loves creating anime, and she also loves Jin.\\n\\n\r\nAoyama works ridiculously hard, largely due to the fact her father did not want her to follow her dream of becoming a voice actor. She obviously cares very deeply for Sakurasou and it's residents and is frequently offering to help out with chores.\\n\\n\r\nNow, unfortunately, I didn't find the sound in Sakurasou to be quite as good as other factors. While there isn't anything particularly wrong (in fact, it's all pretty good!) with the music, sound effects or openings, it doesn't contain anything I'd really want to listen to again. It's good enough, but I feel it lacks uniqueness. Overall, the sound isn't bad; it's just not particularly excellent.\\n\\n\r\nAs for enjoyment, I feel it's a thoroughly enjoyable show for anyone who enjoys comedy or school anime, or just cute stuff in general. There are lots of emotional moments, and finishing it made me sad because I didn't want it to end. As I stated earlier, I finished the entire show incredibly quickly. Each episode left me wondering what was going to happen next. It sure has been a while since I watched an anime as enjoyable as Sakurasou.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I feel this anime deserves nothing less than a rating of 9/10. A very enjoyable watch!",

            "content": "I went into this anime under the promise that all is not as it seems. That what started as quite banal, somewhat annoying, rather tasteless... and frankly off-putting could turn into something beautiful. Something you'd remember. \r\n24 episodes later (and after marathoning the last 5), my cheeks are sore from smiling like an idiot for so long. And I'm feeling more than just happy I gave it a chance. In fact, I'm feeling a lot of things. But mostly, its satisfied... a little inspired... and touched. \r\nIn a way, that journey... that transformation is representative of the story of Sakurasou. And in retrospect, I wouldnot have it done any other way. Other reviews say that Sakurasou starts shaky, and turns into something wonderful later on. I say that this anime knew exactly what it wanted to be from the get-go... even if you wouldn't like it, it stuck to its quirks and celebrated them. I'll just say right now, this is not some weird perverted harem romcom, even if it comes across that way at first.\\n\r\nThis is the story of a dorm seemingly for misfits, who for some reason or other needed a place to escape the harsher world outside, and pursue their dreams away from society's captiousness. Or... they just needed a place, really. \\n\\n\r\nSakurasou though is a strange habitat, eccentric... and to put you in a prepared state of mind as you enter this show, I'm going to tell you right off the bat... its a place where its almost completely OK for a boy to be given full responsibility of a girl who can't do much of anything for herself aside from paint(including cooking for her and helping her ahem...dress herself), another hyper-charged girl to go rampaging around and (among other things)practically flaunt her sexual availability, a laid-back average looking joe to score attractive(sometimes married) chicks seemingly every night and a computer savant to construct a maid-themed AI to handle virtually all his social obligations. There is also gratuitous, cringe-worthy fan service and many many (all narrowly avoided though! phew)sexual situations. Well, you know where I'm going with this. You'd be forgiven for wanting to leave... but that's where it starts getting fun. How you don't want to. How SnPnK makes you absolutely fall in love with every single one of its quirks, or at least, make you accept them even if you don't like them. Because you love it as a whole. The story is full of twists and turns, and is as real of a life journey as you can put its curious cast of characters through. Its sincere, realistic(for the most part) and relatable in the struggles, situations and feelings it portrays. There is lots of strife and it reveals the makeup of each character it introduces, and along the way, you see them all grow, learn and become closer together. \\n\\n\r\nThe strength of Sakurasou, as you'll find, lies entirely in its cast, their evolution and their interactions, which were full of a certain charm, and chemistry. They may not seem like a realistic bunch, but by the end, they felt that way. I couldn't help but grow attached. Each of them have many different facets to them, which all develop as the show goes on. Though they admittedly may be very weird, their trials and emotions, their thoughts and fears... their love and friendship, they resonate with many of us. Their passions and their aspiration to succeed seem genuine and infectious and sometimes you can picture yourself in their very shoes as they face joy and disappointment alike. Their conflicts and insecurities come across as quite lifelike and sometimes made it hard to choose a side because you can empathize with both so much... Perhaps I'm biased, I admit(you can probably tell as you read this review) but I found myself relating to them quite a bit, and got unexpectedly emotional during the scenes which showed them each at their very most vulnerable. \\n\\n\r\nI should mention that the voice acting, while pretty well done almost everywhere else, really carries through in the important moments. I didn't like the MC's voice much, but even he delivered when he had to. Great performance by the VAs, and the music and sound effects were very appropriate as well. Never quite taking away the spotlight, but noticeably enhancing the immersion. The fade in effects to the EDs were also a nice touch.\\n\\n\r\nAt its heart though, Sakura no Pet na Kanojo is a pretty silly series. It never loses that spirit for long or tries to. But its serious and emotional moments always seemed just as natural and effortless as its silliness. That charm is ever present. Maybe I should've stepped back a bit before writing this review to present a less biased view, but IMHO, the in-the-moment impression is the most honest, and that's all I'm trying to convey here.\\n\\n\r\nThat isn't to say Sakurasou isn't without its flaws. I disliked the character Ryuunosake Akasaka(to be fair, he never was really trying to be liked) and his romance felt very forced and pandering to an asocial audience. The panty-shots and underwear shots were somewhat unnecessary and became tedious. And the art while well-drawn and sometimes very cute was very average when compared to shows from the same time-frame. I also disliked the fact that since the show is about art, none of the things produced by the characters seemed particularly impressive, even though they acted as if it was.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, this show is well-worth your time despite the bad first impression, and is a welcome respite from the monotony of the harem and high-school romcom genre. This is definitely one of the better ones and I have to give it a 9(great) rating overall.\\n",

            "content": "When you first start the anime, you may think that this is just another crude and clich\u00e9 anime. You have the boy who thinks life is absolutely dull, and in the first sequence, you have the same character looking straight up at a girl's butt. But please don't be deterred by that fact! The story gets much better from there.\r\nSakurasou no Pet chronicles the life of our male lead Sorata as he tries to find his place in the world. To his misfortune, he ends up in this \"residence hall\" where its inhabitants are \"weird\" people. We have Misaki, a girl with a wild imagination,Ryuunoske, a computer whiz with a charming maid AI, and Jin, a promising script writer who is very good with the ladies. The place only gets even weirder when Shiina moves in with them. At that moment, the story takes off. \\n\\n\r\nThe story is fairly engaging. At times, I felt warm and fuzzy inside (the Sakurasou traditional hot pot dinner), and at other times, I would feel that I was hit by a train of emotions. The story is definitely a roller-coaster ride. \\n\r\nI really enjoyed how most of the challenges the characters face are ones that we all face in real life: finding our niche, finding a place where we are accepted. Although the story does have romantic elements, they are not as central as the ideas of the struggles in life and our place in society. The comedic elements arise from Shiina's awkwardness. She needs help getting dressed everyday and she has trouble interacting with others. I laughed whenever I saw Shiina and Sorata getting into awkward situations. My only complaint about the story was the romance.  At times, I felt that the romance was an extraneous element. I'm going to go a little into the romance below so if you don't want to read into it, skip down to the END SPOILER mark.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\n---START SPOILER---\\n\\n\\n\r\nI am on #TeamAoyama and rooted for Sorata and Aoyama to get together at the end. Although it is pretty clear that Sorata had his eyes on Shiina since the first day she set foot in town, they are not a match made in heaven. All Sorata reveres in Shiina is her determination and her ability to draw stunning manga. The story did not support their love with any scenes where I felt that they had great chemistry together. Further, I was really frustrated when Aoyama was unable to confess her feelings to Sorata. Whenever she avoided the question, I found myself yelling at Aoyama to express her feelings! So definitely, the romance could have been much better.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\n---END SPOILER---\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nI really enjoyed the artwork in this anime. It had really bright and warm colours and the characters were drawn in a very charming manner. I felt that the artwork of the anime was best showcased when they showed Shiina's drawings. I felt it was like I was in a museum looking at the actual painting. One of Sakurasou's strong points is definitely its artwork.\\n\\n\r\nThe opening and ending music were spectacular. You will definitely find your head bobbing to the rhythm of the second ending. What made the opening great was that it captured the cheerful aspects in the anime. By the end of the opening, I was pumped up and ready to experience the daily life in Sakurasou.\\n\\n\r\nEach character was easily distinguishable as each one had their own \"quirkiness.\" When they combine all of their quirkiness, the whole show just comes to life. If you were to remove even one of them, the party would feel incomplete. The character that spoke to me the most was Sorata. He's trying to find his place in the world and at times, he finds the world is unfair. In terms of his aspirations, Sorata was well-developed. The only downside to him is his love life. Let's just say that at times, you will find yourself either scratching your head or simply frustrated by his actions.\\n\\n\r\nSakurasou definitely lived up to its hype. By the end, you may not find yourself crying but you will definitely feel touched. I assure you that you will definitely find a character that you can relate to and root for during the entire show. \\n\\n\r\nFinal thoughts: If you are looking for a romance-driven story, you may be very disappointed. But if you don't mind the romance playing second wheel, you will definitely enjoy the journey that our friends at Sakurasou will take you. \\n\\n\r\nAll in all, definitely give Sakurasou no Pet na Kanojo a try! \\n\\n\r\nThank you for reading my review!",

            "content": "\"Character cannot be achieved in ease and quiet, Only through experience of trial and suffering can the soul be strengthened, ambition inspired, and success achieved.\"\r\n-Helen Keller\r\nAmbitions, It's Sakurasou's main theme and I personally think it strikes home to just about anyone who has life goals. Upon first impression, Sakurasou is your ordinary Rom-com harem with a dense boy as a protagonist with quite a bit of fan service from time to time, but dig deeper and you'll see just how well made this anime is.\r\nLets start with the art and music.\r\nThe overall animations look pretty detailed and quite beautiful at times. As a Slice oflife anime that has a considerable amount of talking, the background is always something pretty to look at. The music is no exception, the piano OST's sets the mood quite well in the entire series and is quite pleasant to listen to.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters.\\n\r\nWhen I'm trying to find a good main character in an anime, I always try to look out for conflicts, not just with other people, but with themselves as well, as it would (most likely) make good character development, and to cut things short, all of the main characters in Sakurasou have quite the character development. Every single one of them has this inner conflict that will result in pretty emotional, and at times moving events throughout the series. \\n\\n\r\nLets talk story.\\n\r\nSakurasou is a slice of life, which is pretty hard to make a reasonably appealing story to make of it. There is no specific goal that the main characters try to get to from the beginning; but rather events that make the characters try to reach a certain goal. Liking this type of story is really just up to personal preference, but Sakurasou does have an interesting story to people who quite enjoy it. Don't expect slow pacing in this anime as well, problems and conflicts usually get resolved in 2-3 episodes and a new event comes anew.\\n\\n\r\n?\\n\r\nFan service. Its an on the fence point, but it has to be said nonetheless. \\n\r\nThe Lines the characters say can also be something that can be rather cheesy or annoying at times.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment\\n\r\nThis anime made me laugh, cry and generally grow with the characters as the story goes and satisfied me with its conclusion. most of the questions of the story are answered in the final episodes of the anime and made me applaud at my monitor, with my sister walking in my room midway, asking herself what is wrong with his brother.",

            "content": "First time to do a written review of an Anime, Please bear with Me\r\nWhen I first saw the poster of this anime, I wanted to watch it due to the cuteness of the characters named Mashiiro, and Aoyama. The first part of the anime was full of fanservice without much development among the character especially Sorata (Main Protagonist), wherein He was given the duty of taking care of Shiina who can't take care of Herself.\r\nAs the story revolves around 6 Protagonist: Sorata Kanda, Mashiro Shiina, Nanami Aoyama, Misaki Kamiigusa, Jin Mitaka, Ry\u016bnosuke Akasaka with the Supporting characters: Chihiro Sengoku, Rita Ainsworth, Ayano Iida. Wherein thecharacters are situated within the Dorm named \"Sakurasou\" wherein story is just the daily life of the residents with their own set of unique talents\\n\\n\r\nBut as the anime progresses, the development among the characters starts to build up. The insecurities of Sorata which isn't given much credit in the first episodes are being developed slowly by the talents of the \"Great Painter\" Shiina; Jin  who has been secretly fond of Misaki and is trying to prove himself worthy to be with Misaki has his own deal of inner conflicts due to the extreme talent of Misaki. The addition of Aoyama to the residents of Sakurasou initiated another big step in the development of the anime due to the similarities in experience (hardship and Hardwork) between Aoyama and Sorata. The anime may be characterized to be a Drama and Slice of Life due to the deepness of the portrayal of Human Aspects.\\n\\n\r\nThe Anime portrays the hardship and difficulties in life, the unfairness that divides great talent and diligence/ Hard Work. For me, the anime's character portrays the state of society today which divides the hierarchy among the poor and the rich, may no be in terms of money but in terms of talent and resources. Due to the deepening of characters within every episode you can't seem to skip watching the episode upon release. Every episode in itself takes the story into another level, showing each characters developments, successes, failures and inner conflicts which adds to the serious theme of the Anime\\n\\n\r\nSo if you like Angel Beats, Ano Hana, Maybe you will also like Sakurasou no Pet na Kanojo.",

            "content": "I was relatively new to watching anime at the time of starting this show. I had only finished watching around 2 shows prior (summer 2013). At the time, I was also going through a stint of being jaded and slightly \"depressed.\" Interestingly enough, I found some sanctuary in this medium: anime. Watching SNPNK might have amplified some of my emotions. My opinion might be biased, especially because i was new to anime at the time of watching this, but I firmly believe this is one of the best--if not the best--shows I have seen so far.\r\nBare with me, as this review may be long windedand incoherent at some points. This is more for my personal reference, just to get my thoughts down. I quickly wrote down chunks of information&descriptions without comprehensively proof reading. Therefore, this review may be a bit flawed in regards to the construction of a review and might not be well fleshed out. I'll edit parts over time.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nFirst off, i would like to discuss fan service and this show.\\n\\n\r\nPeople say the show is riddled with improper fan service (e.g. panty shots) or that the fan service gets in the way of the show. The thing is, TONS of shows have fan service. It is almost a staple of the anime industry. It is the norm now (not saying that the \"norm is good\"). Plus, there isn't even loads of fan service. Like i said, \"I was relatively new to anime at the time of watching this show\" so the fan service was not off-putting--almost as if it was shock humor, which made me go \"omg what is going on; this show is ridiculous\" with spurts of laughter in between words. Thus, this fan service experience was not overdone, nor generic, and basically added to the hilarity of the show.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt & Animation is fantastic. Smooth, fluid. not lazy.\\n\\n\r\nI love the way J.C. Staff animated everything and how they portrayed all the expressions and actions of the characters. Some people might say it isn't anything special, that the expressions are all generic, but i would strongly say otherwise; in fact, there are many animes that have a different style and evoke different expressions. For example, golden time has quite a different approach on expressions. It is nice, but i much prefer the way Sakurasou did it. It was perfect. The expressions were spot on for the situations at hand. The art quality was fantastic. Many people argue that the quality is \"standard\" and they would not \"expect any less\", but there are lots of shows even now that seem to get \"lazy\". The animation is, from what I recall, fluid and not stagnant. There weren't many \"still frames\" and it was very well-made. Some studios seem to get \"lazy\" in their approach. Honestly, I wouldn't want any other studio to have animated this show. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe voice actors were memorable and perfectly fitting (with shiina maybe being an exception)\\n\\n\r\nI loved the voice actors. Their emotions were well executed; their characters were realistic; their acting was spot on. Shiina's voice was the only issue. I understand it was supposed to be melancholy and monotonous to fit the role of the character, but i just did not like her voice; though it was somewhat more enjoyable when she did express some emotion, in the 1 or 2 scenes of the whole show. Nevertheless, it would have been a flawless cast, in my opinion, if shiina had a different voice.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nI really connected with the story-line/characters and thought it was enjoyable and realistic. \\n\\n\r\nIt hit home. I empathized with their situation and sympathized with the characters. The storyline and plot was realistic and modern. The main character wasn't impervious to defeat; he was real and didn't get his way all the time. But that is not to say that the story was perfect in my eyes. I do wish the story played out a little bit differently, and I do wish that Nanami got with Sorata. I wish she weren't so sad. You can say i got really attached to the characters and engrossed in the show lol, but i digress. There was a good amount of drama throughout, and it was balanced with a good portion of comedy.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nQuality sound and memorable music.\\n\\n\r\nI loved the OP's & ED's. Days of Dash, to be specific. It stuck with me for weeks. It brings back all the emotion and intensity that i experienced during this show. The song is so nostalgic. No other anime's OP/ED can compete with Sakurasou's, in regards to how memorable and enjoyable it was. Few shows made me WANT To listen through the whole OP and/or ED. Few animes had catchy&interesting enough OP/ED's. Granted, many of the animes i've watched have interesting OP/ED's but a select few stood out from the rest and was on a whole 'nother level.\\n\r\nAll of the music was well placed and did not get stale&old. I don't believe any of the pieces played throughout the episodes became overused. The music was fitting and enjoyable.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nStory:9\\n\r\nArt:10\\n\r\nSound:10\\n\r\nCharacters:10\\n\r\nEnjoyment:10\\n\r\nOverall:10\\n\\n\r\nI loved Sakurasou no Pet na Kanojo. This was such a great show.\\n\r\nI personally found this show near perfection, and it will be, and always will be, near the top of my list of the best and most enjoyable anime.",

            "content": "Prior to watching this, my only experience in romantic comedy was Chuunibyou Demo Koi ga Shitai!, which some would argue isn't even that much of a romantic comedy anyway. Since this might have a bearing on my perception of this anime, if I were you I wouldn't rely solely on my review as a basis for judging this show.\r\nI won't bother with plot summaries or character descriptions or the like, since you can find those anywhere. So, let's begin, shall we?\r\nPLOT/GENERAL COMMENTS:\r\nI was first introduced to Sakurasou no Pet na Kanojo (\"Sakurasou\") based on its (relatively) lighthearted nature and its portrayal of the theme offailure. Being a person quite big on themes and messages in stories, as opposed to just the story, I was rather intrigued - and when I watched the first few episodes, I wasn't really disappointed. I rather liked how every character was portrayed as flawed or weak or inadequate in some way, and how, over the course of the story, they grew to overcome their flaws through a combination of determination and hope and hard work. Sakurasou also features numerous contrasts between the genius of the pros - Ryuunosuke, Misaki, and, of course, Mashiro - and the more ordinary, second rate characters of Nanani and Jin and Sorata, which really just emphasises the theme of failure and its overcoming that the show presents.\\n\\n\r\nBut, just a few episodes on, it fell flat on its face. Out of nowhere, Sorata's little sister comes to stay over - and cue the love triangle/romcom/fanservice episode that pays almost no regard to what the story was trying to do earlier on. Admittedly, there are probably people to whom this kind of thing will appeal. But, for me, it was just to shallow given the subject matter of Sakurasou.\\n\\n\r\nThis keeps up in the latter episodes, which is when Sakurasou transitions from having a thematic story to simply having a romantic comedy story. Sure, coverage is given of the theme of failure, and sure, it does play a somewhat large role in the plot there - but the focus seemed no longer to be on each of the characters trying to achieve their dreams (although they were in fact trying to do that). No, the latter episodes were more about the relationships between the characters - the conclusion of the love triangle, the long-expected couple finally getting together, the power of friendship, and a disaster averted with that power of friendship. I have nothing against any of that. This is a romantic comedy, after all; and in any case, love and friendship are powerful things, and it's good that this show reminds us of that. In fact, I rather enjoyed the character development and relationships in the later episodes. But they eclipsed all that stuff about failure sufficiently that failure became not a theme but merely a plot point. And that was this show's greatest failing: in telling a good story, it sacrificed the theme it worked to develop.\\n\\n\r\nNow, I understand that writing a good story is damn hard. Writing a good story with a good theme is even harder. So I can't really blame them for what they did. But because the developers sacrificed their theme, I can't call this show amazing. And of course, the ridiculously shallow Yuuko plotlines only made it worse.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS:\\n\r\nBut if there was one thing that redeemed (carried) the show, it was the characters. I don't know much about anime stereotypes, not having seen that many anime before; but, stereotyped or not, Sakurasou's characters were strong. They were real and developed and each had a distinct personality, so that they seemed to carry themselves out of the screen and into the world. Plus, they were personable and likeable. I'd liked to have seen a little more development for Chihiro-sensei and the game designer (what was he called again? Oh, right, Fujisawa), but given the strength of the other main characters it's really just pedantic I-want-to-know-more needling on my part. Oh, and Nanami is a pretty awesome character. Mashiro is obviously very likeable because she's a kuudere, and everyone likes kuuderes; but Nanami's struggle for her dream and the hardships she overcomes just make her, to me, a better character. And she's just so damn nice that it's sad to watch :(\\n\\n\r\nYeah. I hope I made it clear enough in the above paragraph, but Sakurasou's characters were watch got me watching past the bad parts of the show. I kept watching not because I wanted to know what happened next, but because I wanted to see more of the characters. And, given the importance (and difficulty, too) of getting characters done right, I should think that Sakurasou's characters are pretty amazing.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND:\\n\r\nI suppose I should talk about this as well. I don't have have any complaints about the voice acting (aside from the fact that the show sometimes uses comedy right after serious moments - but that's a wrangle with the plot and not the acting): the seiyuus did a great job of making their characters real. The music of the show fits what happen well, and one or two tracks are particularly nice to listen to. As for the OP and ED songs, they weren't anything particularly special - but after listening to them so many times I've acquired a liking for them. Days of Dash, the first ED, is particularly catchy and just...just generally awesome. It's not anything that'll grab your attention when you first hear it, but after you've become familiar with it I daresay you'll like it quite a bit.\\n\\n\r\nSakurasou no Pet na Kanojo isn't a particularly amazing show. It doesn't compare, for instance, to that other romantic comedy I've watched - Chuunibyou - in that it doesn't have any particular purpose or message, and that it contains episodes shallow enough to be fillers. But it's still fun to watch, and therefore not a bad show either.",

            "content": "~ Let me chase my dream! ~\r\nI distinctly remember hating the hyperactivity and vibrant, yet generic nature of Sakurasou's first episode. It was as if the show was TRYING to hit every single imaginable Slice of Life cliche, and it was just plain headache-inducing.\r\nDon't get me wrong, i'm all for comedy, i mean, without that then a Slice of Life would literally be just... life. I had my doubts that such a \"dumb looking\" show - one that can quite plausibly conjure up negative first impressions for itself along the lines of Slice of Life mediocrity, would be even able to delve into the depthsof weighty emotions and meaning. Thankfully, having pursued the series to completion, my doubts have since been put to rest.\\n\\n\r\nAs is illustrated by my opening points, Sakurasou is very often dismissed too early, and alike the way that i began on a low note; it's often because of the dumb way it advertises itself: as another one of THOSE comedy invested, laughing and \"skipping merrily down the street\" type of shows... This is simply the WRONG idea...\\n\\n\r\n*Actual Review*\\n\\n\r\nBut i digress, Sakurasou leaps beyond the boundaries of mediocrity, and once the novelty of Shiina's alien personality wears off, it actually turns itself into a very real, very meaningful and personal story about the way life works. The whole show revolves around the topic of working towards achieving a dream. The very broad plight of working hard and not getting far enough, is one that resonates deeply within all of us, and so this ironically adds a great sense of realism to this seemingly go-lucky, generic title standing before you.\\n\\n\r\nThere is indeed a lot to be found, and a lot to be appreciated in the anime - even though from a technical standpoint, it doesn't shine nearly as bright. Sakurasou is built on a one-of-a-kind, un-imitable sense of cooperation, understanding and camaraderie - as a group of late teens, with extremely differing outlooks on life, come together to work on a few personal projects by using eachothers' talents.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is told traditionally from the viewpoint of a seemingly average male, who comes to greatly appreciate this new spectrum of personalities before him. He's quite generic and un-specialized in comparison, and so although he often feels as if he's missing out, he's the most easily swayed and captivated by them as people. He acts as the neutral centerpiece to the group in a way, as his presence allowed them to collaborate frequently, and strengthen their all-important, group/team spirit.\\n\\n\r\nAs is also traditional in the Slice of Life genre, when dissected, its story is quite straightforward, and instead is quite obviously a character-driven show. There are many personalities of Sakurasou to be in awe with, perhaps most prominently that of the very soon-introduced  Shiina Mashiro - who is often mistaken for being Kanda's \"pet\" by the show's poor description. It's true that she is essentially a variant of the \"emotionless\" personality type to begin with, and that on the lesser hand, brings with it a lot of enjoyable comedy. More significantly however, it's quite beautiful to watch her blossom from an ironically blank canvas of a person, into the dedicated and understanding individual she later turns into.\\n\\n\r\nShiina acts almost as a scale for the show's progression, as she's always gently being shaped by minor social situations the arise throughout. Though obviously there is a significant change of heart in many of our main characters comparing the start, to the finish.\\n\\n\r\nI found it really enjoyable to watch as the show integrates a heavy sense of realism, and by covering the topic of \"hard work doesn't pay off\", it really hits home well. Failure, and losing become familiar themes, and the emotional aspects come in full-force on the lines of \"not giving up\", and surprisingly vivid, personality shaping back stories. \\n\\n\r\nEach member of this group adds something unique, and allows for a beautiful state of interdependence to come into being. Together, the main cast of Sakurasou help each other through the \"highs\" of accomplishment, and \"lows\" of emotional strain, and wanting to give up - as they are burdened (alike myself) with a heavy workload, high expectations, and high pressure to become whom they each aspire to be. \\n\\n\r\nThe anime depicts life within a certain building. It's warm, welcoming, and is able to be both inspirational, but not cheesy (okay, a little bit), funny, but not shallow and deep, but not heavy-going. \\n\r\nWelcome to the building where this really enjoyable journey of growth, and friendship takes place.\\n\\n\r\nAs for you formulaic MAL review fans... (TL;DR)\\n\\n\r\nStory - It's pretty simple at a glance, but trust me, there's more.\\n\r\nArt - Top notch: very inspiring, colourful, and imaginative\\n\r\nSound - A pretty generic sounding soundtrack, but very fitting, and well crafted as is shown at times.\\n\r\nCharacter - Top Notch: they're all very interesting, and have unique ways of life. Their diverse designs are pretty masterful, and it enhances the group's sense of team work and interdependence drastically.\\n\r\nEnjoyment - Top Notch: Sakurasou gave me miles more than i bargined for. It's highly relatable, heartwarming and inviting. I enjoyed the whole atmosphere immensely.\\n\\n",

            "content": "Warning there will be spoilers and what not.\r\nThis is solely due to my own opinion, if you disagree with this i respect your own opinion to do so. \r\nRead on if interested.\r\nI will start with a general first impression.\r\nI first picked up this anime because i thought the art looked kinda interesting and that it was a school/drama/romance, which is the 3 genres i mainly look for in most animes.\r\nWhen i watched the first episode i thought the way they introduced the characters was just effing hilarious. The way they introduced Jin was one of the funniest ones, a high school player who gets droppedoff by car and leaving by giving the girl a kiss. That is just simply hilarious IMO. Misaki had an funny introduction too, when i first saw her butt and realized that she was in his room i immediately thought she was one of the \"crazy but funny\" characters of the show and i was pinpoint on that guess. \\n\\n\r\nSTORY: 10\\n\r\nThe story was seriously an excellent one. It starts off slow and filled with comedy which was really nice. It gets serious and dramatic later on but it did not feel at all slammed into us, all of the drama is mostly built up or made sense. Most of the events that took place in this anime seemed pretty realistic to me. The characters reactions and what happens afterwards and whatnot. \\n\\n\r\nThere is so much i want to say about the story but i don't want to end up writing an essay so ill just keep it extremely brief. Ill just list a couple of scenes and my opinions of it.\\n\\n\r\nMashiro's introduction:\\n\r\nAs an introduction scene i thought this was really well done. it kind of reminded me of Clannad, Where in Clanand Tomoya walks towards school and sees Nagisa at the bottom of the hill and hears her talking to herself asking \"do you like this school?\" and what not. In the case of Mashiro she asks Sorata what color does he was to be.  I thought i was really interesting how they did not thought i am sure it was not intentional. Great scene, really makes me think of what kind of character Mashiro is what what kinds of hidden meaning is behind what she said.\\n\\n\r\nNanami's first failure:\\n\r\nI already noticed how she works seriously hard to try to achieve her goal but she was working too damn hard. Everyone has to know their limits, it doesnt matter if you can do a lot of amazing things it it kills you in the end. I felt really sad for Nanami and kudos for Sorata for being there for her.\\n\\n\r\nNanami's Second failure:\\n\r\nAt the beginning when she opened the letter and that pause i thought she failed and was sad but then she smiled and faced them and i instantly got a smile of my face but then she went \"I didn't make it\" i was like FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFUUUUUUUUUUUUUU....... But how she decided to stay high spirited and happy and not let everyone else worry about her, at first i thought that was really strong of her to do but slowly i thought that she should just let it out and i guess she held it in too much that whatever was trying to hold in the tears for her just broke and all her tears fell out. That was seriously a pretty heart breaking scene, so not only did she learn that it was bad to hold something in that much, even i learned that it was a bad thing to keep something like that to yourself. This was scene that I would probably never forget since i actually learned something out of this. Even though this seems like common sense it was just not something i put too much thought into.\\n\\n\r\nSaving Sakurasou:\\n\r\nThis is a great scene of this anime. They all put so much effort into trying to save Sakurasou and it was really touching just how much they cared about Sakurasou and how much they really loved being with each other. Even the mighty DRAGON who never really helps anybody ends up making a website that informs people of what is to happen to Sakurasou. \\n\\n\r\nGraduation:\\n\r\nThis is the MOST AMAZING Scene in this anime. I kind of just expected them to accept the demolishing of Sakurasou and not let the destruction of a building stop their friendship. But HOLY CRAP!!!!! I did not expect Misaki, MISAKI of all people to do something like that. It was just amazing. BIG KUDOS TO MISAKI. she is seriously an awesome character, her thanking each one of them was also really amazing, it shows just how much she really cares about everyone, how she was originally alone in Sakurasou and ends up with everyone else in the end.\\n\\n\r\nEnding Episode:\\n\r\nRita goes back to England, tricks Dragon into a kiss, THAT WAS GREAT. I support DragonxRita a lot. Then Misaki and Jin parts ways with Jin kissing Misaki and giving her the marriage registration form. Then later Misaki drops off Dragon, Sorata and Mashiro and Dragon says he has to go to a meeting and that made me smile, it means that he has opened up a little bit. I say congratulations to him.\\n\r\n(If you guys cannot tell yet, Dragon is my favorite male character in this show) Later on finding out that Nanami actually budged her father into letting her continuing to chase her dream, i just thought that Nanami finally got a break. Nanami's father was the one who was against her becoming a seiyuu and Nanami pretty much ran away from home to go to Sui academy and now that she went back to Osaka and ends up getting permission to continue her dream, man i was really happy for her, something GREAT happened after so much terrible and bad things happened to her. Chihiro sensei also was a great help in this episode, telling her that the last two years was not wasted effort and how it never will be. \\n\r\nAlthough having two new random characters to join the Sakurasou dormitory is great and all i kind of wish that they didn't. That is purely my opinion, i kind of thought it was too random and sudden and it didn't really add to the mood. Well i guess its more happiness and that the new \"guy\" is a pervert so it adds excitement. Also having Misaki living right next door. That is just a Big LOL!!!!! \\n\\n\r\nAhhh i ended up saying a lot more than i wanted to. Oh wells... \\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nART: 8\\n\r\nEven though art was one of the things i said that drew me to this anime, the art in this anime isn't INCREDIBLE but it was something that looked simple and good, not something incredibly flashy that would make me freeze in amazement of how pretty it is and end up skipping important scenes in the anime.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND: 8\\n\r\nThe music in this anime was pretty  good. The choice of timing of certain tracks was pretty genius and really added to the mood of the scene and what not. Overall there was maybe like 3 or 4 tracks that i really liked. The main tracks that they used got extremely repetitive the more i hear it. What I mean is that the tracks themselves were not so stupendous so hearing them over and over again gets just a teeny bit annoying. An example is the track that they used every time when they screw around or are just having a fun time. For some reason i just did not like that track, in fact i could almost say that i hate it.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER: 10\\n\r\nI feel that the character is one of the greatest things about this anime. \\n\r\nI will go into each character.\\n\\n\r\nKANDA SORATA:\\n\r\nThe main protagonist of this anime. At first i thought of him as a pretty normal guy with a some what normal life except it was really normal at all. okay i take it back his life is no where near normal. The main things that makes him special to me is how REAL he feels. When he got that letter saying that he did not pass and then he sees how well Mashiro was doing, he was mad pissed, he was consumed in anger and even yelled at Mashiro who did nothing wrong. THAT IS REALISM. In a lot of anime the dude would just be sad while keep cheering on the girl and then continue being sad and some retarded miracle happens and they both become happy. That's uhhh great at all but lacks so much realism. I love how real he was. Other than him being incredibly real, i liked how he was so super tsukkomi about everything, he would take a jab at literally everything every opportunity he gets, which makes him all the more funny and interesting.\\n\\n\r\nShiina Mashiro:\\n\r\nShe is the main Heroine of this anime. TBH the first thing that came to mind when they introduced her character was welll.... retarded.... IM SORRY FOR ANY MASHIRO FANS OUT THERE...but that is the truth. It was just a sudden impression that i got, she couldn't do so many normal day things i just thought that, sorry for my childish mind. Anyhow, as the story progresses i got to see who she really was and why she was like that and that is when i really understood who she was. One of the great things about Mashiro was how even though she seemed to be unperceptive she was indeed quite perceptive, she pretty much knew what was going on most of the time. And also he's pretty cute and moe and her \"Plan C\" was effing funny and hell. I give her points for thinking of that.\\n\\n\r\nAoyama Nanami:\\n\r\nSorata's normal friend. Yes i called her normal. When she was first introduced in the anime i automatically thought that she is going to end up as my favorite female character of the show and i was right. The kind of person she is, is just truly truly admirable. She works incredibly hard in order chase the dream of hers to become a seiyuu. Every single time when she fails it just hurts so much to see it. I also like to refer back to the whole Sorata being real thing, Nanami's character being in this show adds realism. There are people out there who try so hard and get pretty far but in the end it doesn't even matter. I just can't stop saying that this show is so real. ANYHOW, i really wished that Sorata ended up with Nanami, they are both really hard workers and it looks that their possible future professions can compliment each other. e.g: Nanami voice acting for Sorata's games and what not.\\n\\n\r\nAlso how she goes into Kansai ben mode when she's really pissed/depressed or i guess serious, is a pretty interesting things. And i found it cute.. wwwwwwwww\\n\\n\r\nKamiigusa Misaki:\\n\r\nMisaki has got to be one of the most interesting characters in anime history. She is incredibly gifted in making anime's. Her personality is just crazy good. She is always happy and full of joy. She loves Jin and does a lot of crazy things to get his attention and i find them crazy funny.\\n\\n\r\nMikata Jin:\\n\r\nThere is usually the cool and clam character that knows a lot of things and always helps the main character out when they need it. Jin is one of those people. Jin has this inferiour complex where he thinks hes not worth of Misaki and wouldn't date her even though he loves her. He's a cool character.\\n\\n\r\nAkasaka Ryuunosuke:\\n\r\nAKA DRAGON. Dragon didn't even show his face for like the first half season and i always wondered if he was a he or a she because he had long hear and was voiced by Horie Yui, which is a seiyuu who also voiced soft voiced guys in many animes along with female characters too. So i was confused with his gender but later on i had a confirmation that he was indeed a dude. His character is the typical \"know it all\" kind of character, who just knows all the small things and details and is the smartest one of them all. Not only does he know how to program and hack into the school to get information he wants, he understands friendship. When Sorata was all depressed that the school was gonna shut down Sakurasou and thought it would end his friendships with everyone else, Dragon responds\" Is your friendship with everyone so small that the collapse of a building would tear it apart?\". Even thought Dragon experienced something terrible in the past where he lost all of what he would call friends, he sure knows a lot about it. I liked how he ends up helping everyone save Sakurasou even though it seemed like he didn't want to do anything with it. Now he has people that he can truly call friends. It's a beautiful thing really...\\n\\n\r\nAinsworth Rita: \\n\r\nMashiro's painting friend who lives in England. Not much to say about her other than her existence in the show makes Ryuunosuke...uhh i mean DRAGON a lot more awesome. \\n\\n\r\nSengoku Chihiro:\\n\r\nBADASS SENSEI! \\n\r\nSHE DRINKS!\\n\\n\r\nFujisawa Kazuki:\\n\r\nThis guy is pretty awesome. He definitely has a crush on BADASS SENSEI and he really does help Sorata with everything. If i ever had something to work with that is as cool as Kazuki is, I would be a happy man.\\n\\n\r\nThere are other characters but i feel that their role in this was pretty minor. There's Miyahara, the friend of Sorata, he's a pretty cool guy, even though he was rejected he still cheers Nanami on. Great guy really.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9\\n\\n\r\nThis anime was really great, one of the better ones i have seen in a long while. I really really enjoyed this anime, this is one of the animes that i would anxiously wait each week to watch. I would honestly say that i am sad that this anime is over. And also this was done by JC STAFF!!!!!! A lot of people always say that JC STAFF ruins a lot of animes and ends up rushing endings, cough** cough** TORADORA*** cough*** cough****. But I think they outdone themselves this time. \\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9\\n\r\nThis was a really great emotional roller coaster ride. I definitely recommend this to ANYONE who enjoys drama. I cannot say that the romance of this show was strong, in fact i felt it lacked A LOT. It really feels like the show could've been roughly the same WITHOUT any sort of romance. It would take some drama out though, I just feel that the romance between Mashiro and Sorata is pretty dull. \\n\\n\r\nTHIS IS JUST MY 2 CENTS. FEEL FREE TO LEAVE A COMMENT ABOUT ANYTHING ON MY PAGE, CHANCES ARE I WOULD RESPOND.\\n\\n\r\nTHANKS FOR READING.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "So, this is my first review, I hope you all find it enjoyable, let's begin.\r\nLiving life is like being in a constant fight with life itself. Life will fight unfairly and when you get knocked down it won't wait for you to get back up, it'll just keep hitting until you eventually die. Sakurasou no Pet na Kanojo shows this very well.\r\nThe anime starts off very stereo-typically, very similar to other animes of the same genre. A main character that has lost his or her way in life, and seeks to find meaning or something he/she is talented at. A genius that befriends him, abig brother who gives him advice, a big sister that cheers him up, a logical genius that helps him with objective thinking, and a childhood friend that encourages him to keep working hard. The story is very well written, with great plot twists all around and just reinforcing the idea that life is unfair, it won't wait for you, and if you want to survive in this harsh world, then you need to get back up and hit it with all you've got. The story is written in a very unique manner, I can't dive into it very much because I don't want to spoil anything, but I just have to say, the story alone without any music would still grant this anime at least an 8/10 in the overall rating. The story is just so strong and so well written, I hope to see more from this author.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are developed extraordinarily well, a big problem with this genre is that most anime won't bother to show the weakness of every character, and you get some characters that are deemed \"perfect\", and that's just not right. In this anime you really get to see everyone's weaknesses seep out of the masks they hide behind, and you can appreciate and relate to everyone. \\n\\n\r\nThe art really made me feel what was intended for the anime. It goes back to the basics, using bright colors to make a warm feeling and using dark colors to make a lonely and cold feeling. I feel that the art goes further than that though, there are many subtleties that you could pick up on that really affect the atmosphere of the anime, and I believe without the art, the anime wouldn't be as good as it is now.\\n\\n\r\nFor sound, I might just be new to the genre, but I thought the music and the sound effects they used were very supportive of the scenes that they used it for. The comedic music or comedic sound effects really made me laugh combined with the action in the scene, and i'm sort of soft when it comes to piano music, but I have to say, the main piano theme they used for this anime made my eyes water and my heart heat up. Anime in this genre really need to pay special attention to the background music, because it is a huge supporter for the scene at hand, and this anime did it perfectly, with a slow melody, they effectively emphasized sorrow and depression, and changing up the music, they managed to hit all the emotions extremely well and accurately. I think this anime has some of the best music i've ever heard. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, I enjoyed this anime very much, I give it 10/10 in enjoyment, but I can't rate it overall 10/10 because even though I think it's one of the best anime that came out this season, 10/10 is reserved for legendary anime, and even with all of the great ideas it presented to me, I feel it's lacking a certain creativity. I hope you enjoyed my review, I hope to be writing more.",

            "content": "I believe this anime to be a masterpiece. It has its flaws, yes, but so does every story in existence. This was one of my first animes I ever found and watched on my own. Despite my nostalgia, it's important to be objective as much as possible. The easiest things to start with are those which are without question, namely the Art and Sound. \r\nThe artwork is some of the most beautiful I've ever seen in an anime (not including the in-universe artwork). Its used to a great degree of effectiveness. Take the first episode for example. At times it uses cheesy news-like graphics (likethe introduction stats) but other times it has the most beautiful uses of color, motion, and form (like when Sorata meets Mashiro). Nearly every scene is packed with some tidbit of interesting information, symbolism, foreshadowing, and easter eggs.  (An example of this is while the first opening shows Sorata trying to take out a wasp/hornet nest, this is never shown in an episode. However, the labels on the chore chart (if shown) have \"Wasp Nest\" under Sorata's duties.)\\n\\n\r\nWhat pulls the artwork together is really the sound. Their audio engineers are definitely top notch. Things can go from loud to soft, simple to complex and layered, and vice-versa without hitting you too hard or too little. Again, using the first episode as an example, lots of detail was put into the sound, especially environmental sound. From the musical-type sounds that help guide the story to the hot pot bubbling layered underneath to the way the evening market street sounded or the way the wind whooshed around with the cherry petals or the trains.\\n\\n\r\nThe voice actors are really great as well. They fit their characters perfectly and don't turn it into a stereotypical pile of rubbish like many very flat animes do. Together with the sound and art, truly you're pulled into the show. You may have heard a term for extremely realistic art - hyperrealism; this anime is like the perfect fusion of hyperrealism and hyper-idealism.\\n\\n\r\nNow the story is interesting. Animes/manga based on light novels tend to have a better story in my personal opinion. The characters all have big strengths coupled with big flaws. The emotions and desires they express feel real. All characters have moments when they act human and \"break character\" instead of playing to whatever character sheet they have. Everyone benefits and suffers. Growing up is hell and Sakurasou is definitely an interesting pressure cooker of sorts.\\n\\n\r\nSome might say this anime is predictable, which it is sometimes. If you begin it with an open mind and few expectations, you'll probably be left feeling like the story's progression and any predictability it had was rather natural. Those who latch onto something and preconceive the story in their heads are the ones who will be left disappointed; they will either be correct and cast aspersions or be incorrect and cast blame. I feel it's important to left this story play out.\\n\\n\r\nTheme-wise, this anime discusses so many: hard work (how it works and how it doesn't), talent and skill (what is it and when does it matter), relationships and feelings, love and acceptance, unsupportive parents, what is important and what's not, childhood friendships and their issues. I also like the positive look they take at Mashiro's condition, which is something like high-functioning autism.\\n\\n\r\nOverall it's just a wonderful story and anime. Watch it and let it wash over you. Don't try to swim upstream but let the show carry you along with it. You'll laugh, you'll cry, and you'll feel a lot. After all, that's what it is to be human.\\n\\n\r\n10/10",

            "content": "Ahhh Sakurasou no Pet na Kanojo - an anime with the most confusing title ever conceived, or perhaps - the most misleading?\r\nI have tried my best to avoid any spoilers however there are some unavoidable informations about the story - probably up to the first 3 or 4 episodes (but you'd still have to watch at least that to figure for yourself if the story interests you right?).\r\nThis is a first rewiev I have ever written so I might not be good at writing them, but it doesn't matter - as long as I'm able to give you my reasons and at least one personfinds it useful - then it was well worth it.\\n\\n\r\nLet's get down to business shall we?\\n\\n\r\nStory\\n\\n\r\nAs I mentioned - this anime has probably the most misleading title ever and when you first see it you think - \"wow, that's probably another stupid harem comedy series based on guys seeing each girls' pants and getin' into ecchi situations and getting punished for it\". And when you start to watch it - this is impression only intensifies as the very beggining concentrates on just that. However you quickly realize that this anime is not about that at all. \\n\\n\r\nIn the first moment I actually felt that the early episodes very rushed and I wondered why would they do that? Why would they not focus on their weird relaionship and showcase more of the embarasing situations they probably get in? Ah that's because - it's not what this anime is about. It is not a stupid harem ecchi comedy show - their somewhat weird relationship is there for a reason and is not a reason itself. Other series would just introduce us to the guy and girl and let us laugh at them for another 12 or so episodes.\\n\\n\r\nIf so, then what is this anime about? Is it a romance? A drama? A comedy after all? Well it's a little bit of all of those - and more. The leading motif of the series is hard work. Gambatte is probably the most often used word here - and not without reason. You will very soon find out that this anime is first and foremost about victory and defeat. The live out their everyday lives and try their best to achieve victory, but of course you cannot win outright - it requires a lot of effort.\\n\\n\r\nArt & Sound\\n\\n\r\nI decided to put them both here because I don't think much needs to be said - it's a relatively new anime and the art is good. Not extravagant like let's say Kill la Kill but it's pretty standard. And since I like this kind of visuals - I give it an 8. Same for sound - I didn't really enjoy the music that much but it also didn't bother me so I guess it's on equal note and there were no voice actors that would annoy me - I think they fit pretty well so same as art - an 8.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters\\n\\n\r\nI could just say one thing here and be done with it - I love the characters. But I wouldn't be myself if I didn't elaborate on that.\\n\r\nFirst and foremost I'll say this - there is not even a single character that I didn't like. And that is really something considering I get irritated by some really easily - this time however that was not the case. Every character has a thing that makes me want to see more of that character. Every character has also a second side of himself - you think you know everything about them? Well then you're up for a surprise. Every time an episode comes to an end I already can't wait to see my favourite characters in the next one. And at least for me - that is simply amazing.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment\\n\\n\r\nI cannot write much about my enjoyment here because if I tried to I would only end up repeating my self over and over again. And over again. And again. I started watching this series in the evening and couldn't let go marathoning one episode after another untill it was very late in night and I had no choice but to go to sleep unless I wouldn't be able to go to work in the morning. And you know what? I still regret I didn't stay up and watch the entire series in one sitting.\\n\\n\r\nOverall\\n\\n\r\nA series I expected to be just a silly harem comedy good for laughs turned out to be a real adventure that would teach about victory and defeat, following your own dreams and not getting discouraged along the way and finally - finding someone to share them with.\\n\r\nThis series has become one of my all-time favourites and I'm truly grateful I found it.",

The main characters are fleshed-out and likable and the show doesn't fall into the harem trap where all the girls end up having a thing for the main character. The \"main girl\" (of sorts) is a cute denpa-character that offers a few laughs and several very cute moments.\r\nDespite having everything one would think it takes, this show still just had episode on episode where I found myself checking how much was left. I can't really put my finger on it, but even as a person that can easily breeze through a mediocre harem I found this show lackingin ability to engage me in any way (and it tries, perhaps too hard at times).\\n\\n\r\nI'd personally give this one a miss. There are plenty of other good shows in this genre around.\\n\\n",

            "content": "Sakurasou no Pet na Kanojo started off quite brilliantly and so it\u2019s a shame that the second half couldn\u2019t live up to its first half.\r\nTo start off, the one thing that remained absolutely solid throughout the show was the fantastic direction. Scenes transitioned smoothly to the next, everything was set up in a logical manner whereas many romantic comedies seem to go from scene to scene doing whatever\u2019s best to explain the story and I was pleased that Sakurasou didn\u2019t walk down this path.\r\nIt was the first half that really kept me interested in Sakurasou. It set up the main cast really well, distinguishing eachcharacter and giving them a lot of vigor. The chemistry between all of them was great, especially the love triangle between Sorata, Mashiro and Nanami and it was really nice to see everything unfold.\\n\\n\r\nAnd so I was quite disappointed when Sakurasou decided to go down the path of being a generic romance. The anime started using elements we\u2019ve seen over and over again. Now using generic elements certainly isn\u2019t a bad thing if it can present it in a way that feel fresh, but Sakurasou failed to do that. The energy it once had in the first half suddenly turned into a slow melodrama. But the ending was by far the most disappointing, as it was sappy and very unresolved.\\n\\n\r\nThat being said, that second half isn\u2019t as bad as I make it out to be as there were still a couple of powerful and heartfelt moments. But overall, it was still quite lackluster compared to the first half and mediocre at best.\\n\\n\r\nSo overall, starting off with a bang and losing speed at the end, Sakurasou no Pet na Kanojo was still a fairly enjoyable anime to watch and I really wished they could have kept it solid throughout.",

            "content": "EDIT: There has been improvements. Characters, although still far fetched, become somewhat more fleshed out. It's no where near the degree of 9/10 epic level drama's (FMA:B comes to mind) which pack about the same amount of character in 5 minutes Sakurasou has managed to put out in 5 episodes, but the comedy and character have, thankfully improved. If there was one way to describe Sakurasou, it would be a comedy show with bits of character and plot scattered throughout. Thus my rating will increase by 1.\r\nSeeing a shockingly high 8 for a show like this... I'm not sure what to say. Admittedly, it's onlybeen five episodes out of a 24 episode anime, but to be frank I fail to see the prospect of in depth character development or plot. It's off to a rough start.\\n\\n\r\nI've watched a lot of dramas. Bad ones and good ones. Some I score very high - such as Hanasaku Iroha. Some are are quite good - the overly melodramatic Kokoro Connect comes to mind. Some I don't think really focus on the drama, like FMA:B, but was equally superb. All of these share one thing in common: an unpredictable yet compelling story line and \"interesting\" characters. It brings freshness to anime. Now when I say interesting, I mean characters that have a back story of sorts - something that makes them uniquely interesting. Unfortunately, Sakurasou has none of that. The main character is your typical cliche'd, insensitive main with an inferiority complex - his flaws lie with his overused personality seen time and time again. The female lead is an emotionless walking blob of fanservice, moe and boringness. Sure, she might be completely socially dysfunctional, but it does not interest me to the very least. And I forgot to mention, there's also the not-so-secret-crush-but-main-character-is-too-dull-to-realize, the supportive-knowledgeable-guy and the irresponsible teacher. The characters feel misplaced, and no, it isn't because they are very quirky. Other anime have managed to make quirky characters fit together snugly as a jigsaw, so there's no excuse why Sakurasou couldn't do the same. IMHO Jin is the most interesting character.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the comedy, I am a fan of comedy SoL anime and that was what drew me here. Sadly, the comedy is mediocre at best and mostly from ONE character who I feel is there for the sake of being a source of comedy, namely Misaki. In my eyes, comedy revolves around the skillful utilization of each character's quirks. Sakurasou lacks the skillfully element, and simply features ridiculous, ludicrous situations that I find mildly amusing at best.\\n\\n\r\nThe plot.... oh god. It was 100% predictable. Not my cup of tea.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the art and sound, both were on the positive end of things. OP and ED are your typical J-pop, soundtrack is your typical SoL soundtrack, and art is what you would expect from your average modern anime. Not bad, but nothing really stands out.\\n\\n\r\nTo be frank, Sakurasou is one of those typical forgettable anime. It's only been 5 episodes so far, and hopefully there will be something enjoyable within 19. As for now, this review is sticking. It's an O.K. 6 - just watchable.",

            "content": "(This review may contain spoilers because I will just type out whatever comes into mind)\r\nFirst of all, my impressions on this anime were really bad and I thought it was gonna be another fan service type of anime like Highschool of the Dead. But I was glad that I was wrong. (\r\nSTORY : 8/10\r\nComparing this to other animes that are the same genre like Clannad, I know that  it isn't the best, but its certainly enjoyable and easy to understand. The story's pacing however was a little bit rushed here and there but nothing major, and I do agree that this anime deserves asecond season because of the extra characters that were introduced in the last episode. But it does a really good job at showing how people with talents and people without them deal with each other, showing that nothing is impossible in life. Sorata's relationship with Shiina shows the best explanation as to how it would become if one would get jealous of the other. Story gets a solid 9/10.\\n\\n\r\nArt : 8/10\\n\r\nThe animation was not bad but its not the best either, but it definitely shines when it shows the sakura trees and the leaves (I thought that was absolutely beautiful). Characters were well drawn and some might say its too cute, but I don't really care if the story is good. Colors were easy on the eyes and vivid. \\n\\n\r\nSound : 10/10\\n\r\nThe sound. Hmm, I loved it. The openings and the ending themes fits the anime story perfectly and the background music for the special scenes fit in so well too. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters : 7/10\\n\r\nI do admit the characters are good but they are not that great. And due to the extra characters in the last episode being introduced I was thinking really hard on deciding the score, but this is due to the lack of a second season. I'm not demanding a second season but I wish they announced a few OVA's to conclude the relationships for the characters. (I hated the cat at the end).\\n\\n\r\nOverall I did enjoy the anime and it did make me cry at the end. I would recommend this anybody. For me its a must watch if you love romance and comedy. 9/10",

            "content": "Cute girls? Check. Comedy? Check. Stunning animation? Check. Interesting storyline? Read on to find out more.\r\nSakurasou no Pet na Kanojo is definitely one of those shows you shouldn't judge by its cover. Although the initial couple of episodes give the watcher the impression that the series is just comedy and ecchi, the later episodes show more serious and mature themes. True love, determination, and failure are all major themes in this show. The producers do an amazing job making you feel and relate with each character, and when something happens to the character, your heart breaks. That's the story in a nutshell. Without spoiling anything,it is without a doubt the most simple yet complex love story out there. A story between a boy and a girl and their fated encounter. A story about the two of them as they struggle to cope with one another.\\n\\n\r\nNow, for the animation, there's no doubt that a show revolving around art would have some jaw dropping scenes. Sakurasou is just that. Each character is drawn vividly, and the backgrounds even more so. 9/10\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack in Sakurasou is pretty darn catchy. Even a year after watching the show, I still listen to both of its openings and endings occasionally. They are that catchy. I also love the song \"I Call Your Name Again\" sung by Mariko Nakatsu. It's catchy enough that if you listen to it once, you'll most likely be humming it for the rest of the day. As for the background music, it isn't as catchy and as memorable as the songs that have vocals. They aren't bad, mind you, but I feel that they could have done a better job at them. 8/10\\n\\n\r\nI already mentioned the characters above - they are all likeable and relatable. Unlike most anime characters, these characters have flaws. Some of them are selfish, others are selfless (to the point that they hurt others), and others struggle with themselves. While Mashiro appears to be a complete dandere, she understands each and every character's feelings. She (as a source of inspiration) pushes Sorata, and Sorata, in return, changes Mashiro for the better. I feel that the characters made up the series. Sure, the animation and soundtrack were well done, but without these dynamic characters, I probably would have dropped the show early on. 10/10\\n\\n\r\nNow, the comedy doesn't necessarily go away after the first half of the series; rather, it is simply more subtle in the second half. The producers do such a good job with the transition between the serious and comedic moments in this series. Kudos to them. :)\\n\\n\\n\r\nInitially, I thought this show was boring, but decided to continue on (I saw it as a recommendation after watching Toradora!). Man, was I surprised. I never expected that such an initially lighthearted show would have such a lasting impact on how I perceive various aspects of life. Family, friends, time, love, and the experiences we go through are responsible for who we are as an individual. Perhaps the best way to learn a lesson is to fail at something every once in a while.\\n\\n\r\nSakurasou no Pet na Kanojo is without a doubt a show that should not be looked over. It is a simple story about a boy and a girl, and their day to day lives.",

            "content": "Reality is a shitty game.\r\nBut, if you don't finish it, a shitty game will remain a shitty game.\r\n-Keima Katsuragi\r\nMy first impression of Sakurasou no Pet na Kanojo, just based on episode 1, 2 and 3, was a simple \"oh this is just another love comedy\".\r\nIt wasn't.\r\nSakurasou no Pet na Kanojo, or just Sakurasou, as I will use it in this review, follows the lives of not one, not two, but five residents of Sakurasou, a place where problem children go. The story starts with the \"main character's\" meeting of a girl who had spent her life doing nothing but drawing, therefore not having a verygood common sense.\\n\r\nLovely theme for a love comedy.\\n\r\nHowever, this was way more than just a love comedy.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 8\\n\\n\r\nThe best thing Sakurasou the anime did was how real the circumstances and the results were of the endeavors of the main characters. Instead of giving children hope of \"all is fulfilled in hard work\", the producers of this anime coldly spats to the viewers, \"Reality doesn't work that way.\"\\n\r\nAnd, as much as we all hate it, it is true. Reality does not work that way. No matter how much we struggle to achieve something, there is always a small alteration that screws up everything that we had planned for months and possibly years.\\n\r\nThe anime features five characters of the Sakurasou in which the anime Sakurasou focuses on the most--a normal everyday boy who has a passion for making games, a girl who tries her absolute best at everything, and three geniuses. The story does not focus on the normal everyday boy unlike other animeographies. This anime, instead, splits up the views and entangles all the problems together, making the conflicts more dramatic. By showing how all the characters, not just the normal endeavoring ones, but all five of the residents, suffer in their own way, the anime creates a balance in the story region.\\n\r\nHowever, in the end, the anime started to wrap up things a little too quickly. The sum-ups of the story is a bit too quick for the timeline it sums up, especially the last episode. If the anime simply pushed the \"afterwords\" into the next season, or an OVA, it would have been marvelous and the story spectrum would have easily gotten a nine, and possibly a ten, but because of this, it was not easy to give the story a nine and much less a ten.\\n\r\nThen again, it still does a wonderful job of balancing out. There were not too much conflicts as to make the viewers feel less pressured while watching the anime, there were not too much love comedic scenes as to keep the viewers feel satisfied of the story, and the main characters' viewpoints were  nicely balanced, not focusing on one character too much, although it is true that the normal boy's standpoint was focused the most.\\n\r\nStory is balanced and great.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9\\n\\n\r\nThe animation was not outstanding, and the characters' details weren't too specified, but still, J.C.Staff did a wonderful job of animating this for one primary reason: the art itself.\\n\r\nThe anime takes place in Suisei School of Arts, and it's natural that there needs to be more than the usual amounts of focus on this anime than on anime with different settings. The drawings of the \"genius artist\", Shiina Mashiro, is breathtaking and quite a scene to see. The artworks were as if done by a professional artist, and as if the producers hired an artist just for Shiina's drawings. Whatever was the choice of the producers, it was the right choice because the drawings and some of the animations of another genius girl, Kamiigusa Misaki, were outstanding and therefore were able to deliver the points that the producers wanted to get across the viewers.\\n\r\nThe only problem with the animation--hence the nine--is the second ending, in which the six residents--including the teacher--of Sakurasou simply shake their heads sideways for most of the ending. While it is understandable that it links to the filial bonds of the dorm and reacting to the rhythmic tone of the song, it was too awkward to watch, and decreased the quality of the ending itself. So, it was not easy to give a full ten for the art.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10\\n\\n\r\nWhile I am quite skeptic about sounds, Sakurasou the animation's theme songs and insert songs did their job wonderfully that I could not find any flaw at all. The openings was catchy and done well, and so were the endings. The insert songs created a dramatic mood for the animation at times, created a sad and dull mood at times, and created a heightened mood at times, especially when the anime spat on the viewers and revealed a cruel enemy called \"reality\".\\n\r\nHowever, most of all, the best part of the sound was the final song. It was very related to the situation and was not only happy but also sad, creating the air that was needed to be created at the scene. The songs deserve a ten.\\n\r\nAnother excellent job the producers did was with the voice actors. Kayano Ai and Yoshitsugu are experienced and excellent voice actors, and so with the rest of the team, but my focus is in Aoyama Nanami's voice actor, Mariko Nakatsu.\\n\r\nAccording to MAL, Mariko is a new voice actor who was not given that much voice acting jobs. And, very similarly, Aoyama Nanami is a student at Sui High who wants to be a voice actor. The producers actually managed to find a voice actor who was used not that frequently and was excellent. Aoyama Nanami's voice was perfect for her character and not to mention difficult, considering how Aoyama used Kyoto dialect when she was upset.\\n\r\nThe voice acting choice was superb.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10\\n\\n\r\nAnd now we're at the interesting part.\\n\r\nThe characters, as said before, are balanced in their usage, but there is a drawback to this sort of balancing. The viewers can either hate all of the characters or love all of the characters. Thankfully, in this case, it was the latter.\\n\r\nThe characters were all lovely but not just that. They were the best a character in anime could hope to be--real.\\n\r\nOf course, the situation and the theme was very unrealistic, but their character and their response to the problem were very down-to-earth and quite factual. The geniuses weren't cold bastards or tsunderes who would be only nice to the main character. They were proper geniuses, and they had problems too. Their area of expertise was so excelled that they weren't able to cope up with the society and the other expertise needed in our world today, and this is how it is in real life. Most of the real-life geniuses have difficulty finding jobs because they don't understand how normal people think. For example, Einstein dropped out of school not because he was dumb, but because he couldn't cope up with his teachers and the school system.\\n\r\nHowever, this is not all that the anime does great in the character spectrum.\\n\r\nBesides the geniuses, the other kind character that exists is the endeavoring people or the \"ordinary ones\". These people do not look up to geniuses for no reason and just keep praising them. They don't envy them continuously and wish to kill them in their sleep. They come in between. They envy the geniuses yet still admire them, creating a sense of psycho-conflict, a battle of self. While one side keeps ranting about how the reality is cruel, the other side is siding with the geniuses and telling the other side to be a \"nice person\". This continuous clash of self was a wonderful job for the script writers and almost made me wonder if this was a real-life experience.\\n\r\nBottom line, the characters were so real that they gave me goosebumps.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8\\n\\n\r\nThe prime reason for giving an eight after ranting on and on about how great the anime is on how hurt I was after watching the anime.\\n\r\nThe anime pierced me every time the reality struck. I was hurt to see the characters burn their heart to crisp and feel utterly crushed. I felt so hurt because the characters were so real. I was hurt even more because of the excellent sound. I was hurt even further because of the amazing voice actors.\\n\r\nThen again, the anime did end on a happy note, and it was soothing. It had all four elements of a story: fun, sad, touched, angry. It was another balance. This time, however, the balance was a little too leaned on the \"real world doesn't work that way\" theme, and therefore I gave it an eight.\\n\r\nStill, people can ignore this. Some people might have gone on with life, found a goal in their life, achieved that goal and maybe satisfied with what they've got. For them, this anime must be a 10. Still, I know and we all know that...well, real life doesn't work that way. So, unlike one of my past reviews, I will include this score to the overall score.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9\\n\\n\r\nProbably the most \"real\" anime of all time.\\n\r\nGo watch it.\\n\r\nYou will laugh, you will cry, you will \"really\" cry, and...you will laugh again.\\n\r\nIf you have already seen it, go watch it again. It's worth it, right?\\n\\n\r\nThen, as always, happy anime-ing.",

            "content": "I have been looking for a good romantic comedy for a while, as the ones I find have a very basic story and are too focused on the drama and romance for the anime to be funny.  Sakurasou was recommended to me through Toradora, and since I enjoyed Toradora, I'll give this anime a shot.  I am so glad I did.  This anime surpassed all my expectations and more!\r\nStory: 9\r\nThe story isn't too focused on the romance, as most romantic comedies do.  It is the life of students who are outcasted by their school and the story is of their yearliving together as a new student enters the dorm.  As you get farther into the anime, the story develops more, producing funny or dramatic moments that causes you to question what will happen next.  Not only that, but the story relates so well to life, the events in the story can be taken as life lessons that I will remember forever.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 10\\n\r\nHOLY CRAP. This anime is BEAUTIFUL, I mean it should be, since most of the students are very artistic.  The colors are amazing and everything is drawn so well.  \\n\\n\r\nSound: 8\\n\r\nNo complaints on the sound, a typical soundtrack for an anime, nothing to outstanding.  It kept the mood going, but I wouldn't go out of my way to look up the songs, besides the first introduction song.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 10\\n\r\nI love every, and I mean every single character in this anime.  They all have a certain thing to them that makes them all unique but work so well together.  Even characters with minor roles have a unique personality of their own. Not only that, but each character actually teaches you something about your own life and how to handle certain situations such as failing or feeling alone.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9\\n\r\nIt has been a while since I have laughed and smiled at an anime (but I guess it doesn't help that I have been watching more serious ones...).  I enjoyed all the jokes, and the drama, everything was enjoyable.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9\\n\r\nNot one of my absolute favorite animes, but this anime still has a spot for favorite.  I will for sure be recommending this anime to my friends as an anime when you need to laugh, or needs to be taught a lesson by the characters.",

            "content": "An exceptionally brilliant masterpiece. That's pretty much how I'd describe this anime. Packed with vibrant characters, sweet romance and unparalleled comedy, this anime never has a dull moment.\r\nThe story is pretty straight forward. You have your average high school guy forced to move to the Sakurasou dorms because his old dorm didn't allow him to keep pets. There he meets the cast of this show, a crazy senior and her childhood friend, a NEET living in the next room who communicates to the outside through an AI program named maid-chan, and the newest resident named Mashiro who our protagonist needs to take care of becauseshe has 'issues'. Add in his classmate who has a crush on him and your set for a crazy ride through happyland. For the most part the show is pretty upbeat and fast paced stressing on the bonds of friendship and the courage to stand together through thick  and thin.\\n\\n\r\nArt gets a 10 hands down. Art is a main theme in this anime and they sure don't disappoint us when it comes to the anime style. Colorful and able to convey the mood be it happy or sad. No problems here.\\n\\n\r\nSound gets a 9. A stunning opening soundtrack and decent closing one make you want to listen to em through each of the 24 episodes. That coupled with a nice selection of background music really helps to bring out the characters feelings.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter development in this anime outshines most others. It delves into the hearts of each of the characters, exposing to us the other side each person has. You really start to laugh with them, cry with them and root for them when the going gets tough. By the end of this anime I personally loved each character, despite their initial impressions.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 10 !! There's a reason its on my top 5 anime list out of the 300+ I've seen so far. One of the few anime that made me laugh out loud and kept a smile plastered on my face from start to finish. Its not all about comedy, there's a great romance in this show, more than 1 in fact, and it keeps you hooked all the way.\\n\\n\r\nOverall a 10 on my list. A must watch whether your looking for romance,  laughs, or simply a great anime to watch.",

            "content": "Story:\r\nThe interesting story of a group of geniuses who are living together in a house near their high school.  One day a transfer student joins them. Talented for drawing manga but has no connection with real life. This story follows the struggle of Sorata Kanda who needs to teach Mashiro the freshly transferred super genius who has no real connection to the real world.  There are some romantic connections between those two and I will stop there to not ruin anything for you guys.\r\nArt:\r\nGreat work by the staff , that's all I can say about it. My eyes were happy watching the beautyof this anime. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nHow can you explain a girl without a connection to the real world..well a alien would fit the description but Mashiro is something other than that. Like all the members of the special dormitory Sakura  she is a genius, while on the other hand she cant really handle anything else or knows anything else . What her character really brings out is her ambition to do what she loves, drawing manga. At her side are the other inhabitants of this special dorm. Her biggest help of course is Sorata who is the only one who came into the dorm without any special talent. But  he knows how to handle things and keep the house clean and have food on the table for every meal. There are 4 more people living there,  a writer , a anime maker , a programer and their supervising teacher. I wont go into much detail of what exactly they are up to or what personalities they have, but its a real treat to follow their stories. \\n\\n\r\nMy Thoughts:\\n\r\nThis was a really refreshing anime to see for me . It opened me a gate into a world I knew but that I didnt really realize I was in. You know when you gaze your days away doing only one thing and when you look around yourself you notice a messy room...oh never mind I got a bit carried away there. Well its a interesting story that has some romance in it and the development of the characters is just wonderful. The thought of having a house full of geniuses is just inspiring. The whole point of this anime for me was the ambition of Mashiro who focuses all her time on manga and her \"care taker\" Sorata who mostly focuses on house work. He develops later a ambition and sets a goal for himself but that's how much I want to spoil it for you so I wont tell you what it is :)\\n\r\nAnyhow this anime is very good and I would recommend it all day, one of the animes that I am willing to rewatch for fun .\\n\r\nI hope you enjoyed my review if you feel like something is out of place or want to discuss this topic even more feel free to pm me or leave a comment on my profile :)",

            "content": "** This review does not contain any spoiler. Moreover, I summarize at the end the main points if you want to have the basic ideas of my review without reading it all.**\r\nStory 9/10: Even though nothing is wrong in the synopsis of the anime here on MAL, I don't think it is enough to grasp what Sakura-sou no Pet na Kanojo is really about. In fact, the Synopsis is only the starting point of the events that occur in the story. The story is more about the life of the Sakura-sou residents, their dreams, and the confrontation of their expectations and the reality. Most ofit is believable, and following the characters into their adventures and misadventures is a real pleasure. It is a real lesson on life that is about success, failure and how to deal with both of them. In a word: beautiful.\\n\\n\r\nArt 9/10: I don't have much to say about the art except that it looks great and fits very well with the anime as a whole. Some scenes are truly beautiful and they really stand out.\\n\\n\r\nSound 10/10: I don't think this could have been done any better, that simple. The OPs and EDs are great, so much that I rarely skipped them (event though I was watching a bunch of episodes at once). The themes in the various scenes hit the mark each time and supported the action in the most efficient and artistic way.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 10/10: The characters in Sakurasou are great. They have personality, don't fall in any usual stereotypes and have actual character development. All of them ! And their behavior and development feel realistic. And more importantly you will care about them and what they feel, you'll feel it too. And even Mashiro Shiina which you think will be a \"bland\" character is indeed an interesting and deep one.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 10/10: I've watched a lot of anime for a long time now, but I don't think I enjoyed one more that Sakurasou. I actually laughed watching it, cried at some point (not only of sadness, but also because of some beautifully moving scenes) and I found it as a whole really heart-warming.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 10/10: Considering some other grades I gave to some other animes, I feel that I should lower them to be fair with the quality I found in Sakurasou. Not that they were bad, but that's simply how overwhelmingly good Sakurasou is.\\n\\n\r\nMy advice would be try at least the first episode to check if it fits your tastes. If you like the comedy part of the first episode, you'll like it all along, if you don't unfortunately I don't think you'll like it more later on. As for the story, it take a little more time to really start, but it is worth the wait (around episodes 4-6).\\n\\n\\n\r\nTL;DR:\\n\r\nMain good points:\\n\r\n+ Believable (and very likeable) characters making believable choices\\n\r\n+ Lots of emotions (laugh, sadness, heart-warming and so on) that are well conveyd. Biggest success of this anime.\\n\r\n+ Interesting story that is more a \"coming of age\" story as it deals with dreams, hard working, disappointment, succes and obviously romance.\\n\r\n+ The story follows a path in a way that you cannot really foresee it but that feels logical and believable when you discover its parts.\\n\r\n+ Really good art that fits perfectly with the anime in addition to be good-looking by itself.\\n\r\n+ The OST is great: check it up before watching you will like it, check it up again after having watched it and you'll love it.\\n\\n\r\nMain bad points:\\n\r\n- The anime currently ends on a sort of \"open ending\" and it is not sure at all that the missing part will be animated in the future. BUT the end is already satisfying as it is and shouldn't stop you from watching this anime.\\n\r\n- You may need to spend some time removing one point to all your other anime rates to be fair to this one ;)",

Is that career too risky? Why do I keep failing even though I've worked so hard for it?\" This show pretty much goes into sync with all that.\r\nBy watching the first few episodes of the show, I already could imagine myself being the character. No, I could imagine almost anybody that I know in the main character's position. As the show progressed, I begun to see the struggles that most ofus face. The show has displayed many instances of experiences we have faced in daily life, and showing that we are not alone. Friendship will always be there.\\n\\n\r\nOf course, the show isn't just one big ride of melodrama and sadness. It's funny, amusing, and can touch your hearts at the times when you least expect it. Though, to be honest, the OST could have been better.\\n\\n\r\nI won't spoil anything. I won't say much else. But in short, I believe this show is something that most of us, even adults occasionally, can relate to this. Two thumbs up. And I literally cried more than Angel Beats for this all in one episode... xD",

The characters began to develop and for each development, some issues were inevitable.\r\nOverall, it is a must watch anime which integrates romance with the daily struggles of school life.

You may think: \" whats new in that\"... I will agree its not something new, but I found it very very enjoyable because of its simplicity and because they value friendship.\r\nIts also shows us what awaits after the sweet short years of high school and our image during the momentin which we look in the past and say: \" Those were the good times\".\\n\r\nLong story short.. enjoy your childhood while you can",

I am excited to watch episode 5 at tuesday.\r\nOne of the things I loved and one of the first things I noticed on this series is it's comedy. I feel like, Misaki-nyan keeps us from getting bored from watching. Although the other characters are funny, yet not as funny as Misaki (my opinion atleast). Meh, never mind but you do get the idea right?\r\nThe animation is awesome! It is expected from the new generation anime though. But J.C Staff still did great on this, pretty muchexpected from the makers of Toradora!\\n\\n\r\nOther than that, Shiina Mashiro-nyan has this cool, innocent and at the same time cute look that makes her soooo adorable and lovable.\\n\\n\r\nThe music seems catchy to me but I'm not that fond of it. Other than that everything seems flawless to me.\\n\\n\r\nSo far, no annoying characters have made and I hope there isn't any. And I did enjoy a lot from the anime.\\n\\n\r\nI wouldn't give a score YET to the story because it is still an on-going anime. Although, I gave it 9 on the overall, I recommend Sakurasou no Pet na Kanojo to anyone. :)",

Some of them simply realistic and makes me change my view about world and how I should face my problem. however there are still some miss-match if you looks it thoroughly, but you can ignore it. We are not researching like a scientist in laboratory right? Well o put bluntly,  Sakurasou gives you a warmand heart full impression and more than just a male main character that chased by bunch of girls.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9/10\\n\r\nI can not say much about art, however the way they draw and animated it is so good and match for the genre\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9/10\\n\r\nThe Opening and Ending for 1st and 2nd season is good and vibes off a enjoyable atmosphere\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10/10\\n\r\nThere are no background character in Sakurasou, you may think they are just typical classmate or something but they will undergo a development like other main character. And how the author describe every character is just too perfect and makes no character disposed in ravages of time.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\r\nBelieve or not I already watch Sakurasou for 3-4 times already, there are some heartwarming scene and the story is just too fabulous. I find myself still enjoy it even though I have already know the plot. This is a fine example of good plot combined with good character\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 10/10\\n\r\nThis anime is beyond stereotype harem genre. Anyone who watch this should be prepared for amazing event and prepare a lot of snacks because maybe you will find yourself watch the entire 24 episodes in 1 day. Enjoy~",

            "content": "**NO SPOILER RELIEF**\r\nI searched for the anime with Shiina Mashiro in it. Sakurasou no Pet na Kanojo was already in my Plan to Watch list, a list I don't bother to look at like my New Year's resolution. I'll write another one next year anyway.\r\nThere are no spoilers, but the characters are more spoiled than I am. For that, I envy them. They had the high school life I hoped to have when I was the first to show and sign up for a bunch of things my freshmyn year. Grr!\r\nI began by watching 2 episodes daily instead of binge-watching. The day after episode 16,yesterday, I watched the rest. After episode 23, I considered never watching the final episode like a Gekiganger fan and going to sleep. I decided to leap into space and saw things to the end, as the characters of S.n.P.n.K. did, and became compelled to write this review, which is coincidentally a year after my first-ever MAL review. I've also been programming and wanted to go into game design, pure coincidences.\\n\\n\r\nI expect that there won't be a second season. I totally saw it coming for Code Geass. Let it be like K: Return of Kings. That's how it is with endings. All things must come to an end. I don't think I can handle all the memories if I became immortal. If I could store them and forget everything except that I can remember that I forgot, maybe. But then that would make me curious, so an organic or inorganic being can remind me instead. What if my completely removed memory \"returning\" causes a worldline jump or me to scream and see a Shinigami? It makes me think that I'm merely a vessel containing information, and when I pass away it will be given to someone else, and I am merely a tool for the \"beings\" that simulate this universe and love is an illusion like time and I've been deceived. I digress.\\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed the characters' developments and interpersonal relationships with each other. Things are predictable in hindsight, and we might not have predicted them at all. We also make predictions that are \"between these two possibilities, it can be either.\" Oh my gah, I'm correct. When it's neither, we complain. Things will not go the way we want them to, and when it comes to shows, it's not live and has been predetermined. You cannot change the outcome. I have no preference for any ships. I will say this: \"I don't recall allowing you to be polygamous.\"\\n\\n\r\nOf the 60 points I can give, 10 in story, art, sound, character, enjoyment, and overall, I give 60.\\n\\n\r\n*Gives Sensei-is-proud-of-her-students countenance* I'm tired, even though I may not feel it like I don't when I'm dehydrated when I'm. Or that I should use the water closet until I unbuckle. Time to doze.",

            "content": "The school romance is a crowded genre with a large amount of content that always seems to feel very tired and rehashed as time goes on. This 2012 anime based off a series of light novels sports an interesting premise, but does it manage to distinguish itself from the pack? This will be a spoiler free review.\r\nSakursao starts by shoving panties in our face, which to me was very troubling, but thankfully this series is so much more than fan-service and old tired themes. Sakursao is a breath of fresh air due to its fantastic unique characters and the bonds that they form throughout theshow as they work together and try to help each other accomplish their goals. The story really clicks when it shows the struggles of the layman trying to succeed against the elite, who seem to have to be to accomplish anything they set their minds too. This is a central theme of the anime as it shows its characters at their lowest points, and its fascinating to see their reactions and even to wonder how they will be able to bounce back from yet another failure. Romance is heavily ingrained in the plot, and their are several relationships that could possibly blossom before graduation are all fun to watch. \\n\\n\r\nThe relationships of the supporting cast are an interesting  spectacle to watch unfold due to the zany antics of one and the actions of another which come full circle with some of my previous points later in the story. The main character Sorata finds himself in a harem of sorts, but its hard to call it that when its pretty easy to predict and see what the writers had planned for this relationship. The pacing of the story is pretty fast as the some of the episodes seem to fly by as you learn more about the main cast, who all have some doubts about themselves but are pretty damn unique and fun to watch. The plot is mostly driven by the characters, but there are some major goals that work towards the ends of both halves. The later half of the series really goes for the feels, and turns on the water works, but its beautiful to watch. \\n\\n\r\nThe lead up to the ending and graduation was honestly one of the most inspiring and emotional moments captured onscreen that I've watched in recent memory, but the actual ending itself leaves much to be desired. \\n\r\nA fair warning like other anime based off of a light novel of manga, it just kind of ends without a real ending, which is quite unfortunate as I wanted to see more of the characters or at least seem them off with a real conclusion. The art of the series is really nice, and is bright colorful and crisp. Overall its a wild ride from start to finish that turns on the feels and has given me some genuine chuckles from start to finish. It's a must watch for fans of romance or the school genre, as it characters go through some substantial development as we see them at their highs and lows. \\n\\n",

Sakurasou is a rom/com anime, in this anime I teared up, got angry, and happy. The reason why you should watch it is because this is unique, it has enough romance to satisfy me, and has the right amount of comedy. \r\nStory - It is about a guy who gets put in a dorm room for keeping cats and meets this professional artist who he then builds a romantic triangle. From the synopsis you might thinkthis is a generic anime, but please continue to watch it you wont regret it. \\n\\n\r\nArt - Was beautiful, the animations were very fluid and the character designs were also very nice.\\n\\n\r\nSound - I usually don't pay attention to the sound too often, but it was very enjoyable.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters - This is the reason why Sakurasou is a 9. The characters in Sakurasou has depth, the 5 main characters are all very likable. We empathize for all 5 characters as they go through troubles and drama. The show makes you feel what defeat feels like, it has left a huge impact on me.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - I enjoyed this show so much, it was fantastic. When this anime ended, I went into this euphoric state. I needed more rom/coms, I was troubled because I couldn't find a rom/com that matched up to the standards Sakurasou put.\\n\\n\r\nOverall- This is definitely the best rom/com of the year no doubt about it. I recommend everyone to watch it, if you can get pass the first few episode you will no regret this feel train.",

The main reason this anime will grow on you is with the development ofthe characters. From beginning to end, you witness the cast mature, developing in their own direction. Unlike other anime, Sakurasou no Pet na Kanojo doesn't use typical devices to appeal to the viewer, but through a method much more closer to reality, it entrances viewers. Instead of a fantasy theme filled with monsters and other beings of lore, or using tried out methods to advance plot, all the characters in this anime has certain flaws akin to most normal humans in reality, all which helps nurture a sense of relation to the characters. The series go by in a nice pace, filling in most holes in the story, leaving you thoroughly satisfied. Once you finish this series, it will undoubtedly leave a hole in your being, leaving you longing for more.",

            "content": "Title is a bit misleading. At first glance it sounds like it could be some highly perverted harem or something, but truth is just the opposite. In fact there's no blunt fanservice at all. The catch is that Sakurasou is not a person but a place. Romance mentality is very anime-ish (indecisive nearly asexual beta male, but it makes more sense than usual). However, with that said, it's still one of the best romance anime, on similar level with Toradora. This is mostly due Mari Okada being in charge of script and series composition for both of them, and with being in the same genrethey end up feeling similar, but note that they do have different writers when it comes to source material. \\n\\n\r\nIt's hard for me to be objective about Sakurasou because I'm as target audience as it gets. It's like they asked me what kind of romance comedy anime I'd prefer to watch, and then made it to my specs,... almost. Pretty much every complaint I had had some sort of excuse to be found about it. All I can say is don't expect too much from the ending, it's the journey that matters here, not the destination, though that said, I did love the ending myself. Also note that this is adaptation of an unfinished novel series, while Toradora is an adaptation of a finished work. So naturally, one shouldn't expect an actual resolute ending in Sakurasou. \\n\\n\r\n How do we know when romantic comedy is doing it right? When you're crying and laughing at the same time. Same as with Toradora, the animation, sound and visuals are very dynamic and in perfect harmony. Animation quality is just beautiful to look at, and character design is absolutely amazing, both visually and personality-wise, it has pretty much all the qualities that made Toradora great. Soundtrack and OPs/EDs are awesome. Voice acting is god tier. \\n\\n\r\nHow much you'll love this anime, depends on where you draw you disbelief line. It depends on your taste, and it will decide if you'll be annoyed by half of the stuff that happens or if you'll enjoy every second of it. Moe is god tier as well, I don't even know why. It took me 2-4 episodes to figure this anime out and really start enjoying it fully, so I'd say that the 3ep rule applies. I'm finding it incredibly difficult to compare this with Clannad and Haganai, as in which deserves a higher grade. Because Haganai is great in a totally different way, and it's been too long since I've seen Clannad for me to say anything for sure. Finally an anime that deserves as many episodes as it has, and doesn't waste a single one (again, kinda like Toradora in that regard). \\n\\n\r\nAfter discussing this anime a lot with bobduh, I'd like to add that writing itself is not very good in Sakurasou, unlike in Toradora. But then again, neither is it in Clannad and yet it very much succeeds in it's goals of making the audience experience a huge range of emotions very effectively, and is famous for it. I argued that writing isn't everything there is to an anime, and that even with imperfect writing this is still a great anime overall. Still, it really depends on the following questions: are you romantic type, one that wants to be emotionally manipulated by the show, to be brought to tears. Are you willing to forgive its writing/narrative flaws to embrace and enjoy it in an intended way? If so, then it's an anime for you. Or in other words, if you liked Toradora and Clannad, chances are you'll love this. If you're very critical, and care mostly just for story, chances are you'll both love and hate this.",

            "content": "Story: 9/10\r\nOh man! My emotions have been toyed with so hard from this anime. After watching this, it's hard to figure out whether I'm happy for the characters or sad for them. I will admit that the beginning was a little slow for me. I couldn't really see where this was ultimately going to end up or how they actually made this into 24 episodes, but now that I think about it, I'm happy I didn't know. One of the great things about this anime is how unpredictable it is. Many times I thought ---- would end up one way when it ended up inanother way.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 10/10\\n\r\nThere's nothing to complain about with the art. Everything's vibrant and what the animators wanted to pop POPPED! And because there's a famous artist living with our protagonists they sorta had to make the artwork she created look good and I think they pulled it off and them some. It really looked good (especially the portrait with everyone in it).\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8/10\\n\r\nWell I loved the openings and endings so much! They were very catchy and fun to watch. However. I will say that they had a problem where in 1-2 episodes they had a really sad intro and then they jumped into their opening song which really ruined the mood. Now in the anime many of the scenes seemed to have no music whatsoever and the sound was just fueled by the characters talking and while that may seem boring, you won't notice it unless you're looking for it so I thought that was nice.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10/10\\n\r\nIf I could give an 11/10 I would. Oh my gosh, every single character just made this anime. None of them were easily forgotten and you had to love each of them! They all had diverse personalities ranging from a complete shut-in with gynophobia (an abnormal fear of girls) to a loud, eccentric girl. And can I just say that the character development is amazing! From start to finish you see everyone slowly change who they are, or how they feel about someone else and it's really heartwarming. Plus they were made very realistic with how they reacted to the many tragedies that befell each and every one of them.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9/10\\n\r\nThis is an anime that you don't expect much from, but after you see it you realize you're wrong. It's quite the journey from when you first start to the last words said and all I (and many other people) wish is that there'll be another season someday.",

            "content": "Sakurasou no Pet na Kanojo is one of those anime that would definitely want you to beg for more. Being one of my personal favorite anime, with the series recently ended, i was thinking if i would want to see a season 2 of Sakurasou no Pet na Kanojo. Watching the ending of the final episode gave me the answer to my problem. The answer is... No.\r\nStory - 9/10\r\nThe plot was outstanding. It totally gives the \"Drama Romance Comedy\" feel. It also gave me this unpredictable feel of whats going to happen next while watching the series. The story is not complicated, i can tellyou that. But still, it gave me a hard time to tell whats going to happen next. The story also points out things about hard-work, efforts, friendships, and slices of life. I can't tell much about the story because i cant seem to point out everything in detail, but watching the whole series will surely let you understand what i'm trying to tell.\\n\\n\r\nArt - 9/10\\n\\n\r\nThe artwork was not \"moe\" but its also not that rough. The animation was smooth. The paintings and manga works of Shiina were realistic. Their school festival project, Nyaboron also has an awesome artwork in the making.\\n\\n\r\nSound - 10/10\\n\\n\r\nDefinitely a 10 out of 10 in this one. SFX really synced together with current feel of the situation, The two Openings and Endings were my favorites, it really gives this good anime feel. And i have to admit, i usually judge the anime by the attractiveness of their OP and ED songs. Also, please do listen to the OP and ED of Sakurasou, you'll know what i mean (if you're looking for it, it can be found on Sakurasou's MAL link.)\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 10/10\\n\\n\r\nThe characters here are very unique, never seen anything quite like this. Each of them has their own specializations. Some are Misaki - Professional animator, Ryuunosuke - Professional Programmer, Shiina - International level artist and more. Each of them also have their own story that will be shown through the series.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 10/10\\n\\n\r\n1 week of waiting for the next episode feels like ages because of the enjoyment and thrill that it leaves per episode. Now that the series ended, i have this mixed feelings(Constipation, lol jk.) of sadness, contentedness and happiness. Re watching the whole series ain't bad at all.\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 10/10\\n\\n\r\nWhy not? Story didn't leave any questions for you to search the internet for some answers. It was outstanding the way it is. Let me state here why i wouldn't like this anime to have a second season. Watching the ending of the final episode(ep.24) gave me this nostalgic feeling like, \"Hey i watched the whole series, and only seemed like it started last week.\" The ending flashed the whole story of sakurasou. Leaving me wanting more, but satisfied on the ending.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime really made a mark on me, i'll never forget this. And here i am now, trying to get over that this anime already ended. Kudos to the creators of sakurasou, definitely one of the best anime ever. I now say goodbye, and thank you for the enjoyment this anime gave me. I will now continue to watch more anime, trying to find an equal series as this. But this feeling, this feeling of hunger, hunger for more.",

            "content": "The romantic comedy genre is incredibly saturated and filled to the brim with ridiculous cliches, to the point where seeing one kinda means you've seen them all. They tend to have interesting themes and concepts sometimes, sure, but tends to only look at one layer or aspect related to a character, which is usually filled up with melodrama, poor resolution to interesting subplots and a habit of focusing on the least interesting characters in the show.\r\nSakurasou isn't a particularly unique addition to the genre, and actually follows a good portion of the standard cliches down to the last letter. What is unique is how they'reimplemented and what they add to the table, making a fairly captivating and heartwarming story out of something we've seen done many times before.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is simple yet effective, and revolves around the main characters each finding a purpose or a passion to live for. The themes are well explored and easy to understand while not sounding too preachy or shoving a specific perspective down our throats.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of perspective, the show shines best when delving into the various mindsets of the various characters and how they view passion and finding something to live for. The character dynamics are wonderful and filled with wacky humor, interesting dialogue, and while the drama gets overblown sometimes in the second half of the show and there are weaker episodes throughout the show (the little sister episode in the first half is a particular example of this), the characters carry the show incredibly well.\\n\\n\r\nNone of the characters are simple or defined by one particular trait or the themes of the show. They are all multi-layered with many things that define them, whether it's the passion they follow, their character dynamics with other characters in the show, their relationship with their respective families, how they each perceive teamwork, not to mention different perspectives on life in general.\\n\\n\r\nIt works incredibly well and all of the characters feel resolved by the end of the show, which is rare considering that romantic comedies have a notorious habit of focusing on one set of characters and ignoring the rest. \\n\\n\r\nThe character interactions are also a great pleasure to watch, and I can't recall any episode where I wasn't laughing or at least grinning from ear to ear.\\n\\n\r\nThis show certainly is great at cheering people up, which is always a good thing if someone is in a bad mood.\\n\\n\r\nThe artwork is incredibly detailed and beautiful to look at, and the backgrounds are jaw-droppingly beautiful and stylish to look at, particularly in scenes where the paintings are brought to life. The character designs are simple but fit the characters and look distinct from one another, which is a pleasant change from simply coloring them with different colors over the same face.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of colors, did I forget to mention how absolutely gorgeous the show looks? The lighting and visual effects are incredibly beautiful and mesh perfectly with the animation quality, which is consistently beautiful and never loses quality throughout the show. The direction is amazingly done, and a great deal of care and passion went into many of the scenes, especially in the middle of the show.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is solid and fitting with the overall mood of the show but lacks hearing value outside of the show. The sound effects are exceptionally well-done and well-placed, never ruining immersion or making me feel that it's misplaced.\\n\\n\r\nThe voice-acting is also splendidly done, and it's very clear that the voice actors not only cared about doing a good job, but were also having a great deal of fun over the course of the show. This is particularly true of Yuki Kaji, who does an absolutely amazing job as Sorata and fits in exceptionally well with his character in what is arguably his best role that I have seen to this day.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Sakurasou is a fun and refreshing romantic comedy that doesn't deviate much from the formula, but is fun enough to watch, emotionally engaging and has a satisfying enough conclusion, not to mention never insulting the audience's intelligence or making them suspend too much disbelief.\\n\\n\r\nIt is bittersweet yet heartwarming, funny yet dynamic and is a great deal of fun from beginning to end. Sure, the drama can be weaker at certain parts and the fanservice is a bit annoying at parts, but it's a great watch and I wholeheartedly recommend it.",

            "content": "What happens if you take the immature, loud and emotionally dysfunctional boy of a shounen and put him in a romance/drama? Well... not good things.\r\n-\r\nI watched Sakurasou about a year ago when I was on a roll of drams like Toradora, Anohana etc., but I dropped it after a few episdes because the writing in general was meh, but more importantly because the MC was absolutely unbearable. Now I picked it back up because it's written by the same guy that's writing Bunny Girl Senpai, which supposedly is very well written (not watching until it's finished), and I hoped it might get better over it'sduration since I'd watched just ~1/4th of it. Well no, it didn't. I really hope my main issues with Sakurasou don't carry over too heavily to Bunny Girl, because I was looking forward to that show based on the things I'd heard. \\n\\n\r\n-\\n\\n\r\nThis show might have the most annoying, least charismatic MC of any show I've ever watched, and that's a huge problem when the show is basically a semi-harem, where the girls all cling to him and the guys all respect or admire him. \\n\\n\r\nThis guy not only has absolutely no social tact, no empathy and understanding of social situations & others' feelings, so sense of humor or wit, no self control, no ability to mask his feelings or constrain his reactions, gets surprised and flustered by the same things every time, and screams and shouts obnoxiously at any chance, but he's even petty and cruel at times. This guy has literally zero redeemable qualities, and yet everyone loves him which makes it REALLY hard for me to empathize with any of the characters. \\n\\n\r\nThe other characters are also nothing to write home about, with many of them being overly wacky or caricatured, to the point where they don't really fit in with the (sometimes) serious plot(s). The main girls seems to be a romanticized autist which probably brings with it it's own issues, but I'm not gonna bother with that.\\n\\n\r\nThe writing in general suffer from heavy cliches and shallow emotions, and like a lot of anime have fan service that's played as slapstick humor (which is made even more unbearable by the MCs terrible reactions (this dude literally has no reactions other than shrieking and putting on a shocked face, or sighing dejectedly)). The overarching plot isn't terrible tho, it's more the writing style, dialogue and characterizations that bring it down.\\n\\n\r\nI often get the feeling that a lot of the scenarios in this show is like in one of those sitcoms where all of the main actors have clauses in their contract that they need to have a minimum of X minutes of screen time every episode, regardless of whether they're relevant to the current plot; often the rest of the cast will just drop out of nowhere into a scene with 2 or 3 characters to comment on whatever they were talking about/doing (mostly while in the Sakura dorms).\\n\\n\r\nThe art and sound was decent, nothing that blew me away or anything, but more than ok-.\\n\\n\r\n(Sorry for excessive parenthese use)\\n\\n",

The story is excellent and one of the best that I have seen. \r\nThe art work is what makes this anime so unique. The artwork is beautiful. Full of colours and life which just enhance the story and the characters who live it. \r\nThe characters are just wonderful. They all go through their moments and can all be annoying attimes, but in the end you love them all. They all progress and become people that even you would want to be friends with if you would. \\n\\n\r\nOverall I would recommend this anime. This is one of my favourite anime's of all time and really is one to watch.",

It'll be probably changed when more episodes come out.\r\nSakurasou no Pet no Kanojo is one of those hard to rate series. On one hand it isn't really that great compared to legends like Death Note, but on the other it's outstandingly awesome compared to series of harem genre. I was expecting less, so my rating may be a little over top.\r\nThis anime is a funny comedy, good fanservice and beautiful romance in one. We have interesting characters, interesting story, great art, and really tempting ecchi scenes mixing with each other. Overall this makes an incredibly funto watch anime, one of the best ones I've watched for some time.\\n\r\nThe reason why I didn't rate it 10, or even 9 is mainly because the more episodes I watch, the less funny it is, and is going in a direction of average romance tearjerker. I didn't really liked this, but I can honestly say it still makes a beautiful romance.\\n\r\nIf you like series like this, Sakurasou no Pet no Kanojo is something for you. I'm personally really enjoying it.",

            "content": "The daily trials of a student is no stranger to the anim\u00e9 world; it's been constantly the focus of many titles that have gone by. Whether extracurricular activities (like a certain light music club) or high school crushes (like a certain girl with delinquent tendencies)--almost the entire spectrum of student life has been animated in one way or another. Yes, even the worries of a student approaching graduation has been in constant focus; the protagonist always searches for himself, wondering what he should do for the future after he leaves his high school. What should he aspire for? Will he succeed? Is it the rightdecision? The student spends the majority of the storyline wondering what he should become. Yet, sometimes, even this simplest of questions becomes the hardest to answer.\\n\\n\r\nHow do you think of what you want to become, when it seems that there's always someone out there who's leagues ahead of you? How will you stand out when you're surrounded by people who are already at the top? How do you get a chance at the spotlight when you're covered by the towering shadows of the people around you?\\n\\n\r\nThese questions are the concern of the main protagonist, Kanda Sorata, in this light novel-based anim\u00e9 entitled Sakurasou no Pet na Kanojo, or The Pet Girl of Sakurasou. The first volume was published in 2010 as a work by writer Kamoshida Hajime, with the help of Mizoguchi Keji as illustrator. As of October 2012, 10 volumes have been released; the anim\u00e9 series based on the light novel series started on this same month.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nThe story is centered around the Sakura Dormitory (the namesake of the title), a student dormitory of the Suimei University for the Arts Affiliated High School. The dormers in this particular place are of the rather odd kind, being troublemakers and whatnot. However, making trouble is not the only thing they're good at; the dormers are known for their exceptional talent in their respective chosen fields. Animator, scriptwriter, programmer--the dormitory is home to students who can be called geniuses in their fields.\\n\\n\r\n...well, except for one at least. This is the dilemma of Sorata. He can't seem to find his nich\u00e9, especially now that he's (quite literally) surrounded by prodigies. He's not even supposed to be having this problem; he just ended up in the Sakura Dormitory after refusing to let go of a stray cat he found in exchange for his stay in the regular dorms.\\n\\n\r\nThe \"pet girl\" in the title refers to the newcomer, Shiina Mashiro. Being a new transferee in the Arts division of the school, she stays in the Sakura Dormitory out of recommendation of her cousin, who works as a teacher in the school and is also a dormer. Sorata ends up taking care of her, though, because the girl is the airhead that towers over all other airheads; it's almost as if she can't take care of herself. Thus, the \"pet girl of Sakurasou.\"\\n\\n\r\nThe story is assembled just like any other romcom, with the overly dramatic first meeting and the artistic wind effects that come with it. Hidden beyond this, though, is a surprisingly deep story about how one normal guy finds his aspirations and dreams while living alongside prodigies that seem to be the best at what they do. His co-dormers don't step on his dreams, and they're certainly friends with each other, but he can't seem to take his first step towards his dream when his friends seem to have set the first step a bit too high for him to climb.\\n\\n\r\nWhile maintaining the consistency of romance and comedy in each episode, the story does not fail to remind the viewers of the main protagonist's dilemma. Each scene reminds the viewers about how hard it is to get your momentum towards that one thing that you can call your mastery, when everyone else seem to be masters already. It hurts each time you fail and they succeed, and sometimes you just wish that they'd fail too, just so that they'd know what you're feeling. The constant pressure hurts, too; you feel like you need to be so much more than what you already are, since your peers seem to be doing the same thing. And it hurts even more when you notice that you're trying so hard just to attain so little, and yet they manage to do so much more without so much as breaking a sweat.\\n\\n\r\nDon't let this theme steer you away, though. While this show has drama on all the areas where it needs it, the rest is covered by over-the-top reactions and hilarious situations. The show has watermelon paths, cat-based mechas, pantie horoscopes, players, messy hair, and... kickboards to the face. There's also the pantyshots, the see-through shirts, the fanservice, and the slightly lewd references that are a mainstay of romcoms. Comedy certainly doesn't lack in this show.\\n\\n\r\nAnd where both comedy and drama is absent, romance is present. The broad spectrum of characters comes with the various love interests that seem to cling on to some nobody with nothing special about him. This show shuffles situations between girls, and each episode devoted to a girl develops both her and the main protagonist as a pair. Heck, you can find the pairing you'll root for by the end of episode 1 alone. The tears, the hugs, the blushes--romance certainly doesn't lack either.\\n\\n\r\nIn short, while romance and comedy is certainly a driving force in this show, what really got me hooked was the underlying question that's always on Sorata's mind. While something you won't usually encounter in a romcom, the show managed to blend both drama and romcom into a show that works so well you can cry twice in one episode, with two completely different reasons. You don't even know anymore if you're crying because you can relate to the protagonist, or it's simply leftover tears from some extremely hilarious scene a few minutes before.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nIf you're going to base an anim\u00e9 around an arts-oriented high school, you're gonna have to step your artwork up a notch. This show delivers this well, showing images of artworks that look professional. (Heck, chances are they were made by professionals anyway.) One scene in particular stand out for me, though. The characters were shown a painting of the deep, blue sea, and suddenly the scene shifts them to some surreal underwater world--as if they dived right into the painting. Putting it simply, it was one of the most beautiful scenes I've ever seen.\\n\\n\r\nThe rest of the scenes don't fail, either. When it's about comedy, we get over-the-top reactions, exaggerated faces and expressions, and bright, poppy colors. Shift to romance, and we get the red-pink overall tones, the sakura leaves flying along the breeze, the blushes on the character's cheeks, and all that should be there. If it goes to drama, we get the slightly darker colors and the backgrounds required to do some soliloquy or whatnot on part of the character.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter designs are simple and clean, too--pretty much the way I like it. Nothing too complicated to look at, and certainly nothing unnoticeable.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nTo be honest, I don't really just stop to listen to the show's background music, but I haven't felt that the music doesn't fit some particular scene, so it should be fine. It's worth noting, though, that the opening and ending themes are quite entertaining to listen to. Frankly, it's hard to skip them.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nHere's the second shining part of Sakurasou no Pet na Kanojo. Being a dormitory that's home to odd geniuses, the character roster is far from boring. We get a hyperactive animator, a scriptwriter who's a part-time player, a hikikomori programmer, and an airhead mangaka. Even the main protagonist, who's a self-proclaimed nobody, isn't as substandard as he thinks he is. They're both simple and fun to watch. Their interactions won't bore you, I can assure that.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, character development is where they shine. Character interactions reveal other issues that would otherwise remain hidden to both the characters and the viewers. Hidden love interests, angst, envy--pretty much the sort of things you'd expect in a romcom like this. However, alongside emotions you'd feel in situations involving love, there's also those feelings you'd get when surrounded be people who succeed--loss of self-confidence, envy, and sometimes outright annoyance and hatred. The show reveals what people usually keep hidden inside themselves, and that's where the show is good at.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nIf it wasn't obvious to you before, I should probably say it now: Sakurasou no Pet na Kanojo is well on its way to becoming one of my most beloved shows. Pretty much all that I look for in an anim\u00e9 is here, and they managed to make it work for once. I sympathize, I laugh (real hard), I get all fuzzy inside, and I sympathize all over again. It's a unique formula that I think makes this show one of the best out there.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9/10 (Great)\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, Sakurasou no Pet na Kanojo is a blast to watch. Best part is, it's only halfway through. As far as the 12 episodes go, I like this show so much I placed it on my Favorites list already. It's funny, it's beautiful, and it's heartwarming. I felt the issues directly, because I pretty much live in the same situation. (Just without the \"pet girl\" part.) I can only stress how beautiful the story is so far, but I'll have to wait 'till the ending to give it my final rating. For now, I'll be watching. And so should you.",

            "content": "The synopsis doesn't do this series justice. You heard me, a lot of us decide on whether to watch a show or not based on the synopsis, so I thought I'd just give a heads up. \r\nIn describing this series with a single word, I'm going with \"refreshing\". The series is another one of those pseudo-romance shows where it does have bits and pieces of romance here and there but it isn't really the center of it all, well as far as it's 24 episodes spanned that is. This show is more about realistic drama and \"actual\" funny comedy. Realistic you ask? It's realistic becauseit's relatable and it's not over-the-top melodramatic shit.  By actual, I mean no boob humor and cliches.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are awesome and they feel connectable and humane. They aren't stale like all the other standard MCs. Another bonus is that it isn't really just about the MC and his girl, the cast really feel like a cast where-in they all play a part and add in something to the story. I'm sure we're all sick and tired of side characters created for the sole purpose of fan service and comic relief by now, so have no fear because the ensemble that makes up this one is far from that.\\n\\n\r\nThe art and animation are awesome. Very modern, crisp, vividly colorful and fluid. Not much to say about that. As far as enjoyment goes, I was hooked from the very first episode and finished the whole series within a day. I'm sure you all know what that means. *wink* I rated this a 9 because honestly, my only complaint with this show is the fact that I wanted to delve in deeper into the \"romance\" part of Mashiro and Kanda's relationship. :3\\n",

The comedic parts are also hilarious at times \u2026those puns \u2026.just epic.\\n\\n\r\nFirst the relationship between the main characters, I dare say it almost reaches perfection during the graduation speech, I have never cried so hard at any speech before. There are no words to describe the feelings that this anime invoked in me during the graduation speech.\\n\\n\r\nThe second thing it does so well is to make you really feel for each character (may it be their successes or failures) and there are few anime that did that for me (Clannad Afterstory is one anime that could invoke something similar form me)\\n\\n\r\nAnd the third thing they did really well is the \u201cromance\u201d and love part. Given the only ones that mattered were the Misaki/Jin couple and the love triangle between Aoyama Shiina and Sorata though the others did add some interesting flavors to the anime as a whole. Why I think they did a really good job with this other than the Misaki/Jin couple (man that ending to it \u2026just perfect I think very few people could be that dedicated and serious about their relationship at that age\u2026) is the love triangle .\\n\\n\r\nThe love triangle, I will have to admit that up until the end confession I couldn't decide who Sorata would chose because it was just an impossible choice\u2026..literary impossible and I think that this is something insanely hard to pull off as both Shiina and Aoyama had some impressive and interesting character developments\u2026.specially Aoyama :\u2019(",

            "content": "By reading this synopsis of this anime you might not be inclined to watching this anime but that will be a big mistake because you're missing out. I'm not going to lie I didn't even know about this anime whatsoever and the only reason I even decided to watch it was because my favorite voice actor Takahiro Sakurai is in it as a main character named Mitaka Jin. \r\nBut boy was I in for a surprise. I never expected an anime to be so well written and so freaking real. From the very beginning you are shown characters who are all in some way orform \"strange\"  or what people call them \"wierdos\".  However, each character especially Kanda Sorata the true protagonist of the anime all grow and develop in a way that people in reality can relate to. What I truly love about this anime is the fact that the anime does not just glorify all the good things that happen but also the harsh reality of the world. The characters go through pretty rough patches that essentially put all of them in a spot where they have to change. That is something not a lot of animes show. Not many animes have it that every main character go through a major change. Another thing about these characters is that all of them are true friends and have each other's back true thick and thin. They literally are always there for each other. Plus all the relationships between characters are so dynamic because every character is vastly different. There is no one character that is like the other. Each character has its own special upbringing and special storyline that has some relatable aspect that to it.  For example people  understand what it feels like to be in an unrequited love like Misaki, a struggling artist like Aoyama. The thing about this anime is that the characters are all human and not in a sense that they're \"not aliens\" but more in the fact that they have faults. No human is perfect and that what makes this anime truly amazing because it shows how human the characters they are. Their faults, mistakes, personalities are all real and none of them are glorified in away that makes them not relatable. The relatableness of the characters allow you to feel like you're in the anime and that is something all great animes do, pull you in and this anime was no exception. \\n\\n\r\nWhat is awesome about this anime is that is actually plausible. This whole storyline can actually be something that can happen in reality. This is what makes the anime really feel relatable. It's because it feels real. The only thing I would change about this anime is it's genre. It isn't only a romance or comedy or drama it really falls under \"Slice Of LIfe\". Actually, in my opinion, this anime really should be top of the \"Slice Of Life\" anime category because it's just that good. \\n\\n\r\nAnother good thing about this anime that I love about it is that it gives closure but also is still open for a new season. Not many animes know how to do that. Either an anime gives the potential for a new season or they just end it. Never have I seen an anime end so well but also kept me wanting more. I like that there was an ending but a potential for more as if to show that this story doesn't really have an ending. It's like saying \"Hey this anime is over but look the characters still are developing\". The characters do end up growing but by the end of the anime it shows that the characters still have room to improve and that they aren't perfect and they aren't fully developed. So yeah this ending was very well written because it shows that even though the anime ended doesn't mean the characters are done developing.\\n\\n\r\nIf you like animes that have relatable characters that go through major developments in a world much like actual reality then you'll love this anime. Even if you're not fan of Slice Of Life animes you should give this anime a shot because it truly will be worth your time.",

There is the sexy but lazy and nonchalant teacher, the crazy upperclassman, the playboy senior, the strictfriend that will remind you of the right thing to do, the friend that will occasionally give you exactly the kind of advice that you need to get on with you life (while never taking any advice given to them despite having problems just as big as anybody else') and the one person that you can't help but feel responsible for, so much so that you give up many of the things that a normal high-school student would normally get to do, but you never regret it in the end. All of these are represented in this anime, along with many more that it would take to long to describe.\\n\\n\r\nIn summary; by the time that you have finished watching this show, you will feel that it was not what you were expecting, you will have grown to love the characters, you will appreciate your time in school more, whether it is over or not, and lastly you will most definitely not feel that you have wasted your time in the slightest.\\n\\n\r\nNow go on and enjoy 'Sakurasou no Pet na Kanojo'",

            "content": "This review like series of paragraphs does contain minor spoilers as to certain couples and implies the endings of certain archs so gonna point that out now \r\nSo Sakuraso was an anime that i at first at least had very high hopes for. This anime took a very good topic which i found to be not explored nearly enough and decided to make an anime about it. This topic was one very close to me in my personal life and it was that of inferiority complex. I find this to be a brilliant topic that needs exploration. Then in the first 4 episodes it doesjust that, it has the main character accept the fact that he wanted her to fail but then realize that in the end it was her hard work that allowed her to prevail and in reality he just has to keep working harder. Now that's fantastic i love that and then you realize, wait this anime has like 20 more episodes to go. And so we continue the story of how every character INCLUDING the main character keep on suffering this inferiority complex. Well not EVERY chacacters problem is inferiority complex but most of them are and really it just confuses me, why have the same thing over and over again like after he deals with it once why does the same thing keep happening it baffles me. Hell this even happens to Jin and Jin was the one who mentored him through it. Now the second kind of topic of this anime is overcoming defeat. This is handled even worse than before because it is the same cycle over and over and over and over IT NEVER ENDS they just keep on failing and i keep on asking myself will it ever be over but no in the end it just keeps going.\\n\r\n I guess i should talk about the characters. Well not much to say here Mashiro is kinda a very boring character if i can even call her a character... shes like a dog without her own kind of story she is just there for everyone elses story and for all of them to feel inferior same with misaki she just server the purpose of having Jin feel inferior to her. There is a romancish plot with them which is kind of boring but it does give Misaki some character so i guess thats fine. Some other characters like Rita exist although she is just there to also feel inferior because we simply didnt have enough of that. Ry\u016bnosuke is there i guesssss as a tsundere. Really i have no idea what his place is in the story and i find him to be very unnecassary and just there as a guy for a shoe horned in romance plot between him a Rita and also as a character to move the plot along since he gives Sorata the incentive to start his video game making project. Lastly we have Nanami who is there for the aforementioned topic of overcoming failure and really she just fails so much and she just keeps failing i mean my good lord Nanami and Sorata just fail so much in this anime and they just repeat the process of overcoming it over and over, i find it terribly boring and also at some point i felt like they could give these characters a break. I mean sure it is realistic that someone could fail that much but this is an anime after all and it's less that i feel bad and more that i feel that there is very little progression going on with that whole plot of them failing since there is never any success and so it ends up being repetitive and unnecessary.   \\n\r\nNow that we have the characters rounded up i can talk about the romance plots because i feel these deserve a special looking at as being separate from the main plots since they do not fit in with any main theme of the anime. Therefor i want to assess them independently. These are very lame to watch starting of with the one between the two main characters. This just feels boring considering how boring of a character Mashiro is. Like i said before she doesn't really have any problems that needs resolution so she ends up being very static and so her romance ends up being as standard and boring as any other where you  have her slowly realizing her feeling until the long a-waited for payoff offffffffffff... a kiss on the cheek ... a manga about crossdresser's had the main couple have sex like 40 chapters in im sorry a kiss on the cheek aint gonna cut it honey. But in all seriousness this would have been fine had the anime been simply a cutesy romance but in the end the anime does try to bring in bigger more important themes and therefor there is no time for the romance to actually develop between the two and so it just ends up being very boring to watch. Then we have Jin and Misaki. Similar problem but in this case Misaki at least has the problem of that she is already in love with Jin and can't see why he wont date her which gives her a problem to deal with, or so you would think but once again this problem does not rely on Misaki taking action but rather Jin coming to terms with his feeling of being too inferior to her which he already told everyone how to overcome in the 4rth episode... i guess he forgot. But i will say it is a tad better than the romance between the leads because it does give Misaki more of a character since she clearly has problems she to cannot deal with. As well, on a side notel it seems very stupid that he would reject her for him not being good enough i dont know may be just me but if you love a girl and they love you back like what does not being a good writer have anything to do with anything ugh well whatever next we have Ry\u016bnosuke and Rita. Next we have Nanami who is the other love intrest to Sorata. This goes nowhere\\n\\n\r\nAs well i don't really feel the need but i guess i should talk about the music and art. THe tracks are mostly fine with the opening being pretty stupidly catchy i didnt find any problems its your standard fair but i also didn't find anthing amazing. I dont find a need to comment on the art of an anime like this since it's art just has to present cutesy characters and cutesy scenes and it does that although it does get nice when they get to the serious scenes the art did actually surprise as to how good it was but other than that not much to say. \\n\\n\r\nIn the end i enjoyed the first 4 episodes and then got bored watching the same thing over and over. Also there that whole thing about the building being torn down that had nothing to do with the main themes of the anime and I guess it was to show that umm errr their bonds are so fragile that by not living together they would stop being friends... i don't know it was just kinda put in there so that the anime could end. I guess someone finally told them they should end soon rather than just write the same plot in different scenario's over and over.\\n\r\nYa i gave this anime a 4 equal to the amount of episodes i enjoyed.  \\n\\n",

            "content": "I heard a lot of good things about Sakurasou no Pet na Kanojo, so I decided to try it out. I didn't know too much about it besides that it was sad at times with good comedy. I had high expectations for this anime, and i was not disappointed in the slightest except for the last episode which i'll get to later on in the review. Surprisingly the anime was much more dramatic than I expected and i hadn't seen much dramatic anime before, but overall I liked the dramatic feel to the show. I'll tell you why my expectations were met and/or exceeded inthe categories below.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters/Development: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nThe reason for me loving this anime so much was because of the characters at Sakurasou. I think why I enjoyed these characters so much wasn't because of their individual personalities because honestly their personalities who pretty cliche with the crazy-energetic girl, the shut-in, the quit innocent girl, the womanizer (at first), and the normal guy just goes to high school, but with all that said I extremely enjoyed the relationships between the characters. How everyone interacted with each other and cared for each other why quite outstanding. It was joyous and saddening to see what these characters went through TOGETHER and how they developed as characters TOGETHER. This is what makes this show great in my eyes. Just how the relationships all have an important and crucial meaning to the anime and helps with the overall enjoyment of the show. I really wish more shows had this kind of style with their characters. Also each character had a decent past/development time to get to know the characters even more and understand why they make the decisions they make. One of my favorite cast's ever along with Steins:Gate.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nThis was probably the weakest part for me about the series. But that doesn't mean it was lacking. It just seemed the story wasn't very clear to me. Basically things came up and the characters got involved into some activity and did whatever activity it was or some character had an issue to be solved and it was solved. I don't want to say too much more or else I will spoil everything. Do not worry too much about the story going into this, the characters are well enough to make up a good story and all intertwines together. In short though, Sorata (the male protagonist) doesn't know what he wants to do with his life, so he thinks of something and wants to work really hard as everyone else at Sakurasou and thrives off of their hard work to work hard by himself, all the while having to take care of Mashiro. \\n\\n\r\nHere's what bugged me about the story, I didn't like how the romance was played out. Without spoiling anything, the romance in the anime seems confusing and all out of the place and it made me disappointing because some characters weren't treated fair or payed any attention to when they should be. I may sound confusing right now, but if you should ever watch this all the way through, I think you'll understand what i'm trying to say.\\n\\n\r\nOh, there's a lot of feels and drama in this anime, which can be a good or bad thing. I personally liked all of it and I don't even like this kind of stuff. But I had the waterworks almost runnin at times. This anime is saddening but in a good way. You'll like it.\\n\\n\r\nArt 10/10\\n\\n\r\nI didn't have any complaints with the art or animation at all. It seemed very fluid and crisp to me at all times. Great choice of colors throughout the anime and the character designs were fantastic. Nothin much to say here. One should not be disappointed in this category. No scenes ever lacked any detail. They always put the most detail into every scene which I liked.\\n\\n\r\nSound 10/10\\n\\n\r\nI looooooved the openings and ending in this series. Especially the first opening and ending. I could listen to them all day! The second opening was good as well and the second ending. They fit well with the series quite smoothly. The OST's were excellent as well. They played a \"serious\" song when things got serious and were completely appropriate for the times. They had \"comedic\" songs during comedic times. Basically, they played the right music at the right times to fight with the current scene.\\n\\n\r\nOverall I enjoyed this anime so much due to its characters togetherness's development. It was great to watch what they went through in a good way and how they accomplished their tasks. Episode 23 was hands down one of the BEST EPISODES IN ANY ANIME I have ever seen. I LOVED this episode more than any other one and 22 was good too, but 23 was AWESOME. The emotions were running VERY high and I just loved how well-executed this episode was. During the middle of the series you might start to get bored, but trust me if you do, just wait it out. It only gets even better. I would say the enjoyment levels are high towards the beginning and end of the anime, not to say the middle wasn't enjoyable, it was, but not as much in my opinion. With all of that said, I enjoyed this anime thoroughly from start to finish.\\n\\n\r\nNow please, just watch this and enjoy some Mashiro",

            "content": "It's about time I wrote a review for my favorite anime of all time! You hear that? Favorite anime. That means I like this anime more than any anime ever made! Calling me biased at this point is as much of an understatement as saying One Punch Man is overrated.\r\nI love Sakurasou. It is one of my first ever anime series (definitely one of my first 15 series) and also the only 2 cours anime series that I finished in one day. So why do I love Sakurasou no Pet na Kanojo? Is it because it's flipping hilarious? Or is it because the romantic tensionis literally out of this world? Is it because of the intense drama about the war between hard work and talent? Or is it because of the amazing character dynamics and development that other romcoms can't even hold a candle to. Obviously it's the combination of them all!\\n\\n\r\nSakurasou no Pet na Kanojo hit my heart like a wrecking ball. Chasing your dreams has always been a heavily used theme in anime, but Sakurasou nails it so damn well. By the way guys, the theme of chasing your dreams is the main story. Sure, it's a romantic comedy, but the romance is nothing compared to the struggles of the characters trying to do what they do best, and even better. Did I mention characters? Of course, since Sakurasou has probably the most deep and well developed character cast of any romantic comedy ever made. There aren't just 2 main characters like most romcoms, there are 5! FIVE! That's 2.5x more characters, with 2.5x more character development. \\n\\n\r\nAh, and of course, the great war between hard work and talent. Something that as a musician, I am extremely aware of. The hard working ones are always jealous of the talented ones. The talented ones are sometimes misunderstood. People dedicated to art find doing their craft incredibly easy, as well as finding everyday chores extremely hard. Sakurasou captures this boundary between the hard workers and the talented extremely well. It's like my life was unfolding in front of my eyes. \\n\\n\r\nPros:\\n\r\n- One of the best cast of characters in romcom history.\\n\r\n- The amount of character development this show has, especially for its large cast, is unrivaled.\\n\r\n- Genuinely hilarious! It has slapstick comedy, amazing skits, great character interactions, as well as Mashiro! A recipe for laughs!\\n\r\n- Breathtaking art and character designs! The background art is lovely and the characters are full of energy!\\n\r\n- Great soundtrack as well!\\n\r\n- Beautiful depictions of its themes. It really highlights the differences between hard work and talent.\\n\r\n- Great depth and suspense during dramatic scenes.\\n\\n\r\nCons:\\n\r\n- Despite being a romcom, the romance is fairly lackluster.\\n\r\n- Some characters are fairly cliche. Sorata is pretty generic.\\n\r\n- A pretty hit or miss series, especially when it comes to the comedy and drama. \\n\\n\r\nStory: 10\\n\r\nIt's a romcom, but the story really isn't about love. Well, the story is actually all about love, but not the romantic kind! Sakurasou is a story about your love for what you have, as well as your love for what you can have. It's about love for your friends, love for your dreams, love for your talents, and so much more. As stated before, the romantic aspect of this series is definitely its weakest link, but its weakness is overshadowed completely by how this show dives into love in general. Some people are talented! Those people must learn to love what they have and to never take it for granted. Some people aren't born with talent! They must learn to love what they want to do and work hard at it, and to chase your dreams until your legs give out. \\n\\n\r\nSakurasou is a story about life. Life is full of struggles and hardships. Life is full of happiness and laughter. Different people live different lives, and that means you won't agree with each other all the time. That's a natural part of life, especially if you live with many others. Sakurasou jams different characters under one roof, and through the interactions that they have, teaches you that to live life to the fullest, you don't have to understand each other. You simply have to accept each other, and to carry on with each other.\\n\\n\r\nAnd of course, Sakurasou is really about the war between work and talent. These are two ends of the spectrum that never understand each other, but Sakurasou shows that opposites complete each other. The two will always have qualms with each other, for that is natural. But that doesn't prohibit love from developing between the two.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 10\\n\r\nSakurasou, aka Porn For the Eyes, is incredible art wise. The background art is just simply breathtakingly gorgeous, especially that sakura tree scene in the beginning of the series. Just completely eye melting. The character designs are also very detailed and full of energy! Mashiro's design is absolutely adorable!\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9\\n\r\nThe soundtrack for this show is also incredible! However, as good as the soundtrack is, it isn't anything particularly mind blowing. The OPs and EDs are very catchy. But in the end, let's be honest. Sakurasou isn't a show known for having a legendary soundtrack.\\n\r\nVoice acting? Now that's a different subject. The seiyuus nailed the characteristics of each character perfectly! Mashiro's introverted nature was captured especially beautifully, and added on to her endearing nature.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10\\n\r\nThe main gem of this treasure trove, the characters of this show are what make this show stand out from other romcoms. With a much larger cast than other romcoms, one might expect this show to have less character development than other romcoms. Well, the thing is, this show surpasses other romcoms in terms of sheer character development. Each character is developed so much that they become full fledged protagonists. It really doesn't feel like a show with one protagonists, but a show with five! That just shows how amazingly well executed the relationship between the five friends are. While yes, the show does focus more on Sorata and Mashiro, it really gives every character a lot of love. Each character has their own dreams and ambitions. They have their own flaws and insecurities, and they are quick to become jealous of each other. However, even through massive misunderstandings and falling outs, this group of friends still manages to join together in the end to become the most united group of friends in anime.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10\\n\r\nLike I mentioned before, this was the only 2 cours show that I have ever managed to finish in one day! That's how drawn in I was to this show.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 10\\n\r\nIt's my favorite. Sure, maybe its because it is one of my earliest anime series. But it's also because it hit me right in the kokoro. I am someone who knows the struggles of hard work vs. talent more than most people, which made this series incredibly impactful. I highly recommend this to someone who wants a romcom that dives much deeper than simple romance, as well as to those who have dreams and aspirations of their own to chase.\\n\\n\r\nTL;DR: You ain't gonna watch it? I guess I'll have to resort to Plan C.\\n",

            "content": "There are moments when watching a show where you feel entirely disconnected from some of the characters and you struggle to understand there actions and you question them. Sakurasou no Pet had these moments, but it made up for them with the complete variety in the characters. To script and weave the story to make you whole heartedly understand who these people were, made this for me, an outstanding and different show. All to often, shows are made with an aim to bring an audience in by making it look pretty and shiny and then the story lacks.\r\nBut Sakurasou no Pet felt like it hadsomething to say and by the end made itself clear. I do feel that the constant morale bashing of hard work put a bump in an otherwise straight road. (Possibly due to my own inability to work hard). On the other hand the themes of realism and what motivates people did fall in to place nicely. It has to be said that I feel the \"Romantic\" side, was at time forced and I can't help feeling it ignored certain characters; like Miyahara, who had more of a story to tell. I'm not sure how invested I was in  the romantic side because everybody and there mothers seemed to be in love. I honestly believe that they could have delved more into Miyahara's and Nanami's story, which when you look back on it makes you question her actions entirely and in terms of realism they could have left at least a couple of people alone. \\n\\n\r\nBut only a small part of the story is sacrificed to add this romantic side and the rest of it I truly enjoyed.  It was at times seriously funny, Misaki being one of the funniest characters I've ever seen, and it had a very obvious charm to it. You were invested in the characters, there friendships and their struggles and sometimes depending on the character the love story. Definitely one I'd recommend.",

            "content": "Pet Girl of Sakurasou is a romantic comedy-drama focused on our male lead, Sorata, forced to take residence at a school dormitory of eccentric students skilled in different talents. Upon becoming part of Sakurasou, Sorata has to wind up caring for a female resident named Mashiro Shina who is a world-renowned artist having a completely ridiculous lack of common sense as such where she does not understand basic things such as dressing herself and appropriate social interaction.\r\nBefore I tackle what I did enjoy out of this, I might as well address my issues with the series. A good chunk of the comedy for this relieson the eccentric quirks of many of the Sakurasou residents to carry it along and these habits tend to either give one the impression that this baby will be typical fare for a rom-com or the traits in question border on obnoxious or absurd, notably Mashiro's ridiculous lack of common sense and Misaki's \"genki gal\" archetype. It also doesn't break any new ground for a rom-com as Sakurasou milks the typical character types and cliches of the genre, as well as the series usually getting overbearing with the drama it delivers with major developments in its run.\\n\\n\r\nStill if you can endure the series long enough, you will come to see that Sakurasou has more to offer up with its story thanks to the problems facing its cast. Many of the residents at the dormitory are outcasts of the school despite their talents and each find themselves struggling to overcome their own personal ordeals as a result of whichever talent they have. Some of the residents are struggling to be successful at whatever medium they would like to be involved with, while others are talented as such where it is easy for them to get by while oblivious to how envious others may perceive them. These struggles are believable and relatable as there are points in life where one can find themselves frustrated with setbacks to their goals and may take their frustrations out on someone they know who would be more talented than them. Each resident, including Sorata over time, comes to rely on one another for emotional support in their struggles and even develop romantic interests throughout the show's run and said feelings are also genuine despite the show's occasional slipping into melodramatics.\\n\\n\r\nWhile not groundbreaking in any way, Pet Girl of Sakurasou still carries some rather solid character exploration and chemistry in regards to the challenges of gaining fame and acceptance in spite of having an introduction that would have you assume it would be typical rom-com fare. It won't be everyone's cup of tea, but the series it least offers something to connect with beyond dabbling into the normal rom-com antics.",

            "content": "You know, the phrase \"never judge a book by its cover\" is something that is thrown around everywhere in all sorts of situations.  Ranging from describing people, to describing a show like this.  This review is on the wonderful anime known as \"Sakurasou no Pet na Kanojo\", or in the english translation, \"The pet girl of Sakurasou.\"\r\nStory (9/10): The story of Sakurasou, as I will refer it to as henceforth, revolves around the life of our main protagonist Sorata.  Because of his obsession with saving cats from the streets, Sorata is deemed to be kicked out of the dorms of his prestigiousschool, and forced to live in a small dorm known as \"the sakura dorm\", a place where all the reject and strange students go to.  Until one day, the dorm manager of the sakura dorm tells him to go pick up her relative, which results in Sorata, meeting the lovely kuudere Mashiro, the newest member of the Sakura dorm.  Unable to take care of herself, Sorata is deemed on \"Mashiro Duty\", meaning, he has to take care of essentially all of her basic needs.  And well, hilarity ensues.  Regardless of the fact that I said \"hilarity ensues\", the story of Sakurasou is incredibly deep.  The main focus and the high point of the show, are its characters.  (I'll get onto that later.) The show itself has great pacing and can hook the watcher into the show with its drama and comedy.  However, I have to say that the way Sakurasou shines the most, is in its realism.  Even though the characters themselves don't face ordinary problems like most people do everyday, each of them is relatable in some way, and that just makes the show fantastic.  It's the pure fact that the characters can be portrayed as real people, that the show excels at doing so.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters (10/10): Rather then doing my normal spiel of naming off certain character names and describing their personalities and whatnot, I'm going to go a different route in summarizing them and explaining without heavy spoilers.  (Cause doing that WILL give huge spoilers away.)  As I have said before, the reason why this show is such a gem, is in its characters.  Each of them starts off as a basic one-liner cardboard cutout where they're only defined by that specific trait.  However, as the series goes on, each character is hit with certain problems that pertain to them, that change them drastically.  By the end of the series, they're almost completely unrecognizable from when they were from when they started.  The characters are also great because of the show's length.  With 24 episodes, the show has so much time to work with, using every bit of that timespan to give gradual changes that make the characters wonderful.  Another thing that makes the characters great are their bonds.  The main characters in this series are seriously tied together and as the series goes along, the way the characters grow together, is a gem in and of itself.  It was fantastic to see such great development as they all laughed and cried with each other.  The supporting cast isn't anything to shy away from either.  Though they barely play a role, they do a good job at interacting with the main characters, and helps progress the story further in their own special way.\\n\\n\r\nArt and Sound (9/10 and 8/10): The art in this animation is very nice.  It uses a great palette of light colors and give it this nice and fluffy feel.  On the other hand, the palette can be used in its more dramatic scenes and give a fantastic contrast compared to the normal fluffy feel.  Although, I would be lying if I said I didn't like the actual paintings that was featured in the anime.  As for sound, the anime hosts 2 Op's and Ed's.  The first OP is probably my favorite track out of the 4.  It's sounds just so happy and fulfilling, that it just wants to make you smile.  Not to mention the scene in the OP where all the characters are covered with paint, great touch there.  The first ED is also good and gives a nice resolution feel with the anime.  As for many anime, the OP's and ED's are replaced with new tracks.  Which can or cannot turn someone to skip them.  For the second OP, I have to almost put it up with the first OP.  It sounds good, it does, but it sounds a bit more sad and less upbeat then the first OP did.  As for the second ED, I don't like it.  The first time I saw it, it just made me turn away from it.  In my opinion, it doesn't sound good.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (10/10): Ever since I watched Clannad:Afterstory, I could never find a good enough anime to fill the void it left me with.  Angel Beats! was good, but it wasn't able to do enough for me.  Until this show came along.  Sakurasou is definitely one of those shows that touched my heart.  Just to see the beauty of friends getting along, the trials and tribulations that they had to go through, the bonds that the characters achieved along the way, it was all nice to see.  Also, to see such change from the main character, I was just happy.  I think I cried a few times as well.  The story of this anime is very touching, and I would highly recommend this to pretty much anyone because of just how wonderful these characters are.  Although, one thing that bothered me a little bit, was the slight inconsistencies with the story telling.  It jumped from one person to another, and it seemed a bit random at times.  Another thing that bothers me is if I want a second season or not.  The thing is, the anime opens itself to a second season, but I feel as though the second season wouldn't be as great as the first.  There's also the matter of following the light novels, which according to what I heard, ends a bit weird, so I'm a bit skeptical.  On that note, I love Sakurasou.  There, I said it.  And you should to.",

However, every once in a while you make the plunge and end up immersed in a wonderful new world. \r\nI believe Sakurasou no Pet na Kanojo is one of those beautiful gems. This is an anime that really shines the more you watch. The artwork and the music are very good, but these aren't even it's strongest fortes.That impressive feat goes to its amazing characters. \\n\\n\r\nSakurasou no Pet na Kanojo is one of those standout slice-of-life, romantic-comedies that is truly character driven...their feelings, interactions, and growth both as individuals and as a group really transform this from a run-of-the-mill show into a unique, emotional, and powerful series.\\n\\n\r\nI don't want to spoil it for you, and I doubt I need to tell you that I highly recommend it. \\n\\n\r\nWatch a few episodes of Sakurasou no Pet na Kanojo, realize how awesome it is, and then sit back and enjoy this wonderful experience.   \\n\\n",

Unlike other stereotypical rom-coms, Sakurasou no Pet na Kanojo does a great job with originality and enjoyability, it just made me want to keep watching.\r\nStory [9/10]: The story of course is probably one of the most important aspects to a show and Sakurasou no Pet na Kanojo does it right. The main character Sorata goes through some things that are very relatable which shaped the entire story. There was a good amount of drama in the show that made me want to watch more and more after each episode ended. The romance in theshow can be seen as kind of tragic in my opinion. It was a little weak and could have been developed a little more throughout the series but it was still solid and I enjoyed every bit of this show.\\n\\n\r\nArt [10/10]: The art was fantastic in this show. It may not have the crazy attention-grabbing action scenes but the art style was sort of unique and bright. Everything was drawn out nicely, especially since Shiina is a artist! I don't know what else I can ask of the artwork.\\n\\n\r\nSound [10/10]: I really enjoyed Sakurasou no Pet na Kanojo's soundtrack, especially when they played in the background during special scenes. I enjoyed all of the funny sound effects too. Nothing else to say here.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters [10/10]: This is where Sakurasou no Pet na Kanojo shines. The main characters who reside in Sakura Hall all have extremely good depth and development throughout the series. It truly made me feel for each and every one of them. We learn the backgrounds of all of them and it just really added a extra layer to each character.  For some reason they all just seem to be so geniune.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment [10/10]: I enjoyed the hell of this show. I did not expect to fall in love with it that much but I did. I don't know what else to say but I loved it and I truly enjoyed watching each and every second of this show.\\n\\n\r\nOverall [10/10]: Sakurasou no Pet na Kanojo is an amazing rom-com that impacted my life. It truly exceeded all of my expectations and I just wanted more every time I watched it. It can be hilarious at some moments and it can be tear jerking at times but overall it had a perfect balance. I laughed, I cried, and I fell in love with the characters. Sakurasou no Pet na Kanojo is truly a masterpiece that deserves a 10/10.\\n",

            "content": "To me Sakurasou no Pet na Kanojo seems like a hugely overrated anime with its medium rating of 8.44. You may or may not agree with me, but it's a simple fact of life that my opinion is far superior to yours.\r\nThe \"Review Tips and Guidelines\" tells me not to include any story summaries. This shouldn't cause much trouble to anyone reviewing this anime, since there really was little to no actual story going on. Any small hint of a story that may have come up during the course of this anime was stretched to unbearably dreadful lengths in the presentation, and in the end,left me feeling like the whole show could have been summarised to less than 12 episodes.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, watching Sakurasou no Pet na Kanojo could be compared to looking at a blank piece of white paper. You start looking at it, hoping that if you look at it long enough, there might appear some porn on it. After you have been watching a piece of blank paper for several hours, you have already given up any hope of said porn appearing. However, as it turns out, you have autism (you are an animefag afterall), so in order to gain some sense of completion, you simply must watch the piece of paper for another six hours.\\n\r\n The process of watching the blank piece of paper is mostly just boring, but not any worse than that. However, as the hours pass, you'll start to notice that the paper is somehow getting a bit annoying. You're not sure what it is excactly, after all, it's just a piece of nothingness. Maby its slightly impure shade of white is gnawing on your subconciousness, or perhaps it's that fucking noise it makes with the wind. Whatever it is, after a few more hours, you'll find it infuriating. Here you'll start to consider just throwing the piece of paper out the window, and never bothering with it again. Still, on the other hand, as the task would be completed in just another hour or so - you might as well tough it out for a little further.\\n\r\n You are filled with rejoice, after your 8 hours of looking at a piece of blank white paper is over. Sense of completion fills your mind as you burn that cursed piece of paper to ashes. Never again shall you bother with such a ridiculously tiresome task, and you decide to take any action necessary to help any other poor souls who might find themselves considering to do something similiar. Luckily, you know just the thing to do: You'll log in to myanimelist.net, find Sakurasou no Pet na Kanojo and rate it \"1\". Be it fair or not, you simply must get its medium rating down radically, for it shall never again trick another healthy minded person into watching it.\\n\\n\r\nTL;DR:\\n\r\nIt's not any good. Don't bother watching. Rate it 1 to get its scores down to a more realistic frame. Oh, and all the characters are annoyingly retarded.\\n\\n\r\n- Papumaja, your expert in anime and all things retarded",

            "content": "Sakurasou no Pet na Kanojo (hereby referred as SPK) is probably one of the best slice of life anime of 2013.\r\nI found SPK to be a very enjoyable anime that explores themes that much of the audience will be familiar with, especially if you're an adult. The characters in this story undergo trials and suffer depressing setbacks. Through these trials, characters achieve progression. Anyone who has been disappointed in life - whether it be rejection from a college or from someone you loved will relate to the story very well and begin to sympathize with them.\r\nLike many anime (unfortunately), there are elements of ecchi andfan-service that can detract the story from its course. However, I found the story and characters to be COMPELLING - which in my opinion, makes it the best.\\n\\n\r\nThe production value of this anime is incredibly high. Big kudos to JC.Staff for delivering such a polished product. The soundtrack for SPK contains appropriate music for variety of situation the characters face in the anime. My personal favorite was Days of Dash piano arrangement. I believe this particular piece embodies the emotion of the story. The artwork also deserve high praises. The one particular scene with sakura tree was... indescribable. Oh my gosh. It's just pure beauty. It just captures your emotion.\\n\\n\r\nThere are many criticism directed at this anime - some of them fair, some of them undeserving. The biggest criticism of this anime (actually, the whole series) is that, it fails to deliver an appropriate resolution. This is in part due to fact that anime finished around vol. 7 of the light novel. There are 12 light novels (2 side stories), so it's understandable that they could not give a happy ending many of us are familiar with. My biggest pet peeve is talent vs hard-work theme that receives a dead-horse beating and sends a wrong message to the audience.\\n\\n\r\nI still however, wholeheartedly recommend this anime; if the author of the series had better writing abilities, this series could have been the best slice of life since Toradora!\\n\\n\r\n(Warning: DO NOT READ THE LIGHT NOVELS, and second season is in doubt due to poor merchandise sales and the fact that there are not enough materials in the new light novels to deliver a second season. OVA may be a possibility and second season could be a possibility if JC.Staff decides to diverge from the light novels)",

That in itself raises the score for me. But other than that it's a nice slice of life, where the way the main character acted I felt like that would be the exact way I would act in certain situations. So for me, a great story.\r\nArt-9\r\n-------------\r\nEverything in this anime is pretty. Everything. But particularly I like the way the characters look.\r\nSound-8\r\n------------------\r\nOk op and ending. Great voice acting from everyone!\r\nCharacter-9\r\n-------------\r\nThe characters make this show. I love the romance and heartbreak of theshow as well. And most everything feels sincere.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment-9\\n\r\n------------------\\n\r\nI was always left wanting more. Wanting to know what would happen to Shiina(my favorite character), and in the end felt satisfied, though I'd love more!\\n\\n\r\nOverall-9\\n\r\n------------------\\n\r\nGreat character interaction. Solid story. Love done right. I love this anime and I hope to get more of it, whether it be a continuation of this anime through OAVs or a sequel, or just a similar story that can make me tear up for my favorite characters. I'll definitely buy this as well as soon as we get a Blu-Ray!\\n\\n",

There is only a few episodes (24), however, the Quality amazes me, its just a unique one out of all the anime I have seen, especially the story.\r\nThe story is sad and can also be funny at times. The anime is so fascinating that it can change a person by just watching it. It can make a person think in a unique way and change one's opinion about other people. Its a great anime, featuring great art for 2013, a story that can reach out to people, theuniqueness of each character and the comedy is quite amazing if you are into people trying to act dumb or something, can't really describe it, however, you will see as soon as you watch it.\\n\\n\r\nI hope they make season 2 however, I doubt they will make a 2nd season due to the fact that it ended in 2013 which was long ago. I sometimes wonder what would the story be like in 4 years time, will they all be back together? Who will Sorata be with? If they were going to end the anime, they should have done something like 4 years later or something. :/",

A romantic would probably hate and love the series seeing as the main character makes questionable decisions that cause him to seem \"dense\" but also turns around and fixes his mistakes. \r\nIf the decision of watching this anime takes too long to think about, it's probably not for you. The tags really do this anime justice as each category is very pronounced especially through the dialogue. I see a lot of reviews going against the characters of the show and that is respectable. They aren't perfect. you're not going to like/love all of themfor such reasons:\\n\\n\r\nOne is absurdly loud and obnoxious but is also one of the most sensitive ??\\n\\n\r\nOne is bad at dealing with touchy conversations and acts according to his shyness but is also daring and brave with some of his actions for those he cares about. \\n\\n\r\nOne seems like he's wayyy too mature to be in the series\\n\\n\r\nOne is held up by her emotions but never truly lets them surface for an annoying reason\\n\\n\r\nOne is stale and doesn't have many characteristics other than clueless and innocent\\n\\n\r\nAll these describe the characters in simple terms based on my opinion. \\n\\n\r\nBut like I said before, this show is for all you romantics and believers that will stick to an anime based off the motive and eagerness of the main character getting the female he desires.     \\n\\n\r\nThe story is genuine, it's stereotypical in a good way, and it's for sure worth watching in my humble opinion. \\n\\n\r\nThe bottom line is that the main character was forced to move into a dormitory with a \"special\" group of people.\\n\\n\r\n-He meets a girl and is slowly realizing his feelings for her without saying.\\n\r\n-His actions slowly reach out to the girl but a problem occurs, she is compelled to move back to Europe.\\n\r\n-At last, the guy makes a brave move and what-do-you-know, the girl never wanted to leave (m.c didn't know) and his feelings come out. \\n\r\n-The story slowly unfolds into a happy ending but in a not satisfying way. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, I still give this a 10 solely based off bias and the feeling you get from watching the main character struggle; to making a huge scene expressing his love once and for all. I'm a romantic what-can-I-say, the love story was just heartwarming enough that it gets me to write this review to get others to watch. This is an underrated series in my book.  \\n\\n",

            "content": "First time writing a review and I chose this anime to review out of the many that I have watched solely because it really deserves my time to review the series.\r\nStory=10\r\nThis show is about literally the lives of people from many walks of life and their true thoughts and feelings. There are 6 main characters in the show. Each of them represent a specific standpoint in life. You got talented people like Mashiro who is a world renowned genius in art but she is near useless in daily tasks but yet she gets fame, recognition and basically everything goes well for her while on theopposite end of the spectrum you got Sorata who works really hard, tries multiple times with all his might to win a competition but fails relentlessly and is jealous of how well things go for Mashiro. This is but 1 of the many problems the characters face in the series. I doubt anyone cannot find one of the characters to relate to. I for one relate to one of them which makes the experience much more immersive.\\n\\n\r\nThe story has it all. Jokes, romance and most importantly audience-character relationship. You experience each of their ups and downs throughout the 24 episodes. You feel happy when they are and you clutch your own heart when they stumble and fall. It is truely an experience to behold. It is the experience of life in a nutshell in the form of anime. It is literally in all sense of the word an EXCELLENT anime to watch!!!\\n\\n\r\nArt=9\\n\\n\r\nI don't know what is excellent artwork for anime thus I can't give a 10. But I do know that the artwork is my \"type\". They properly dress the character for the appropriate occasion and setting which improves the immersiveness. When a character is talented, their drawings are significantly stepped up to showcase the fact. Mashiro is an artist and her paintings befit the image set for her.\\n\\n\r\nSound=10\\n\\n\r\nI am a connoisseur for sound tbh so trust me when I say it is worth listening to. I never skip the Opening and Ending tracks and enjoy them along the way. It fits the anime in my opinion.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter=10\\n\\n\r\nCharacter development is what this anime is so good at too. Each character is made specifically to direct the story in the right direction. They aren't just there to be idle but instead they all have a part in the show. They each represent a view in society and the people you may find in life. Each has a realistic response that one may have in the real world when facing a taunting task, someone much more superior than yourself and more. They all have backstories that explain their current state of life. In one way or another, you will have to relate to them in someway.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment=10\\n\\n\r\nYou can tell that I really enjoyed the anime if you read the review through. I love the characters and hate them at the same time not because they are bad but because they represent some mistake in my life so accurately. Literally a first person view of life.\\n\\n\r\nOverall=10\\n\\n\r\nWatch it! You won't regret the choice unless you are some emotionless fool. This is the top anime in my list no matter what the ranking is in MAL. Have fun watching it!!!",

The story keeps getting more complex, it's not like your typical \"slice of life\" where everyday feels the same and the characters usually doesn't progress. This anime envolves themes like failure, and hope. The drama keeps getting bigger, while not being out of hand, and making the story as beautiful as it can be.

It does tick most of the usual boxes, the main male protagonist is a babe magnet, lots of high jinks, drunken adult giving words of wisdom, stressing the importance of friendship and high school life is the best time of your life. \r\nThe thing is that it ticks theseboxes really well. The series is bright and a hell of a lot of fun. However, for me what makes it different is that it gives a lesson it life and that is some people are born geniuses and will always be successful where as the rest of us have to work hard for it.\\n\\n\r\nThis is the lesson that Sorata has to learn as he moves in to the Sakurasou dorms for problem students. Problem students read geniuses. He soon finds himself feeling out of place and jealous of his housemates. However, this is what drives him to try and make a success of himself.\\n\\n\r\nSorata's housemates range from the strange, Mashiro, to wild, Misaki bringing the anime alive. The colours are bright and the theme tunes are fun.\\n\\n\r\nWhere the characters are the strongest point of Sakurasou no Pet na Kanojo, the story is the weakest, however, who cares because it is still good. The anime may of faltered but with the characters you really cared what happened.\\n\\n\r\nHigh school slice of life, bright and lots of fun. What more do yo want?\\n\\n",

            "content": "STORY: Well, beginning with the plot, the plot is quite interesting, a guy without any hope or desire on his life, living in Sakurasou and one day he met a girl from England named Shina Mashiro, and his life breaking into a better way.\r\nWhy do I gave to the plot a 8 over 10? The main trouble that this anime has is the coexistance between the comedy and the drama. Sakurasou no Pet have many dramatic situation and may be at least 2 dramatical moments in each episode, the coexistance between the comedy and the drama is broken by the excesive use of the comedy,in this serie appeared a trouble, for example, on the chapters 11/12/13 and how is solved is pretty pretty bad, really, this dramatical moment made me laugh but was quite dissapointing, the dramatical feelings are corrupted by the comedy and you won't be marked by the dramatic moments despite the chapter 23, the best episode of this anime. 8/10\\n\\n\r\nART: well the art is a little moe but is good, may be so shining but isn't bad. 8/10\\n\\n\r\nSOUND: the soundtrack is good, but no more than good, have good moments but any song mark your brain in this anime, is simply correct. 8/10\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER: well other trouble of this anime is its characters. For example, I'm going to discuss the final chapter and this will have SPOILER so don\u00b4t read this if you don't want to be spoilt\\n\r\n-------------------------------------SPOILER----------------------------------------------\\n\r\nThe final chapter is quite dissapointing, this anime have romance and the problem is that nobody have a romance and the final are so open. When you finnish the 24 episode you will hope that the anime would continue with a movie or with the light novels but OH SURPRISE, the anime and the light novels have the same ending, and only a pair of side stories explain a few the ending of this anime. Other problem with the characteres are their personalities, yes at first all have a complex personality, complex problems that need be solved but their personality in many moments are incoherents, for example Jin, is stupid his behaviour with Misaki, yes, I understand why He behave with Misaki like that, but in the reality that situation is impossible, is unreal, nobody with a good brain behave like Jin with a girl that he love. For that the Jin's behaviour could be considered as overdramatical. Misaki is a good character and I don\u00b4t have any complaining with her. The main character could be hateful on many moments because is like Ichijou (Nisekoi) he behave well with Shina, Shina fall in love of him, and is quite sure and all could notice that Shina fall in love of him, all with eyes on his face, but no, he only behave rude with her during all the anime and hurting her, for that, GJ you are stupid. The other girl that I don't remember the name have a good personality and a nice trouble but thanks to god isn't solved easy like the other problems.  8/10\\n\\n\r\n-----------------------------------SPOILER END------------------------------------------\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: well the enjoyment is good, how I said before have excesive comedy, for this reason if you are searching an anime that make to you laugh this anime is perfect to you. 9/10\\n\\n\r\nIn my opinion Sakurasou is a good anime but the development of this anime is incorrect, the final is incorrect, is an anime to have a good time but no more than a good anime. \\n\\n",

            "content": "The story of the Pet Girl of Sakurasou is, probably to your discontent, definitely an ordinary slice of life anime. The main character, Sorata Kanda, is kicked out of the normal dormitory at Suimei High School of the Arts for keeping a cat, and is forced to move into Sakurasou Hall, which is a congregation of the school\u2019s most eccentric, trouble causing students. As he gets accustomed to the dorm, a world renowned painter who cannot care for herself, Mashiro Shiina, also moves in. The story progresses by illustrating the residents\u2019 daily lives, romantic relationships, and hard work and talent. \r\nPretty clich\u00e9 and corny huh?Well let\u2019s get straight to the point: it definitely is. There honestly is nothing too unique about much of the anime. But before you skip the rest of this review and vow to never watch this peculiar-sounding title that resembles tons of other shows in its genre, listen to what I have to say. What could such a genre of anime do that makes it totally stand out from the rest of the crowd? In my opinion, it can\u2019t do too much that is different. The Pet Girl of Sakurasou may not stand out, but it excels at many aspects that are representative of a slice of life/romance show. Most significantly, it is extremely down to earth and relatable, and that is the true embodiment of the slice of life/romance genre. \\n\\n\r\nThis will be one of my longer reviews, since it does take some effort to put an \u201cordinary\u201d show in a good light, so please bear with me. \\n\\n\r\nStory: \\n\r\nThe main problem with the show, is what I have stated before: it is very cheesy at times. If you\u2019ve played Pokemon, it\u2019s kind of like listening the talks about the power of love and connection between Pokemon and trainer. A lot of the show focuses on a couple of themes and traditional slice of life stereotypes, that come up over and over again. The first half of the series demonstrates the typical Toradora style like qualities, where the characters are introduced and develop, and in general, is a lighthearted and humorous portion of the show. There is nothing you probably haven\u2019t seen in the first half, and honestly, some portions of show just made me cringe from how hackneyed it was. \\n\\n\r\nThe anime really started getting good when it reached, specifically, the Christmas episode, when the interactions in the first half began to turn into more serious drama. The hard work that they put in towards their goals that started in the first half was translated into authentic results, and romance begins to unfold. In the second half, the show becomes very realistic, especially focusing on hardships and how things don\u2019t always turn out the way you expect them to. Although the same themes came up, they took a different approach to portraying it, by instead focusing on keeping it realistic by using a hint of unfortunate events, and it was done admirably. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: \\n\r\nIt is not unheard of that some characters do a complete 360 degrees on their original personality after experiencing an extremely traumatic event. While some people might call this good character \u201cdevelopment,\u201d when does this happen in real life? When you are getting close to adulthood, certain ideologies, emotions, and attitudes definitely shift, but much more likely, you stay true to yourself at the end of the day. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters in The Pet Girl of Sakurasou experience all those changes, encounter hardships, and sometimes can\u2019t help but to release their emotions. While some episodes did very little to advance the character\u2019 personality traits, many of the crucial episodes did a good job of making you feel like you are in their shoes. The only problem I have is that some character's traits don't seem to explained very well, and some characters just have obliviousness that may make you annoyed. \\n\\n\r\nIn my opinion, the cast is likeable, but some characters lacked very \u201coutstanding\u201d features. As it is a major character oriented show, understanding the character\u2019s emotions and past experiences is a necessity for finding the show to be relatable. But with the wide variety of characters, I would say it is is difficult to find someone you cannot relate to. \\n\\n\r\nSoundtrack and Art: \\n\r\nThe soundtrack consists of mostly lighthearted, upbeat tracks, especially evident in the first half of the show. I did feel a lack of emotional tracks, evidently by how there was this one piano song that played constantly towards the last few episodes. The openings and endings were likeable, especially the second ending, which might be one of my favorite anime endings ever (it was actually the reason I found out about this anime, after hearing it on an anime station). Besides that personal favorite, I found that many tracks tend to be reused in similar situations, and not too much of the OST was memorable. \\n\\n\r\nThe art heavily fitted the lighthearted nature of the show, and was quite accurate. Many of the paintings and drawings in the anime, you could tell, had a lot of detail and effort put into them to live up to Mashiro\u2019s prodigy status. In an attempt to unite the art and soundtrack, the show did a lot of overlaying of the dialogue and theme songs, putting some scenes before, during, or after the theme songs. The transitions they had with these were very well done, and added very much needed variety. \\n\\n\r\nBeginning, Ending and Influence: \\n\r\nThe start of the anime was really something that probably turned a lot of users away. It instantly started off with fanservice, seemingly superficial humor, and the fact that the main character is stuck with a girl who doesn\u2019t even know how to dress just screams pervertedness. The anime then continues to gives off vibes of sexual tension for quite a few episodes that makes it seem like a harem, fanservice-based anime that immediately gives off a feeling of shallowness. Not to mention the title sounds kind of\u2026suggestive. During some parts of the anime, even towards the ending, it feels like it is trying too hard to make you care, when all it needs to do is just simply tell the story.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, the anime more than redeems itself with its very down to earth nature and superb character development. Although it was never very addicting to me, the superb pacing and execution made every episode satisfying to complete. The ending of the anime is a very appropriate closing, leaving you to your own imagination and preference to what happens next, and can be emotional when you are very attached to the characters. \\n\\n\r\nThe hard work ethic and courage that the characters embody are very applicable to reality, and thus, can definitely inspire others. No matter how corny that last sentence sounds, it doesn\u2019t have to be if it is executed and portrayed properly, and that aspect is what The Pet Girl of Sakurasou excelled at. \\n",

            "content": "High school rom-coms are a staple of anime these days, it seems we get at least three or four each new season. Granted, the target demographic of most anime is high school students, the rom-com is fairly safe genre (there are some tried-and-true plots and character archetypes that can at least guarantee modest success), and the fairly light demands on animation undoubtedly save money ( you can reuse the same backgrounds and the movements of the characters are usually simple). So from a production company's standpoint a show of this genre is a sound business decision, but in a genre this popular it can behard to stand out. Does 'Sakurasou' achieve this feat? (OK, you can see my overall score up in the corner so my opinion is probably not hard to guess).\\n\\n\r\n'Sakurasou no Pet na Kanojo' is licensed by Sentai Filmworks and can be legally streamed on Crunchroll.\\n\\n\r\n-Story-\\n\\n\r\nOne life tip you might hear a lot is that multi-tasking is counterproductive, that trying to do too much can actually cause you to accomplish less overall. 'Sakurasou' is a series often compared to 'Toradora!' and the latter certainly tried to do too much. 'Sakurasou' went with a much simpler focus and ended up doing better overall. Not stellar, but still better. \"Average guy finds himself in a situation where he is innocently living in close contact with a number of beautiful women- hilarity and fanservice ensues\" wasn't new when Love Hina used it a decade ago, but premises are cheap anyway, so let's look at the execution.  The first half of the show is about as generic as it gets, mostly relying on creating situations where Sorata will encounter Mashiro in various states of undress, or Mashiro will say something loaded with sexual undertones without realizing it. The second half does improve, going for a more interconnected plot and having a distinct theme (\"How do you handle being an average person in the presence of a genius- somebody who will probably always be better than you no matter how much effort you give?\") and it even manages to create some emotional moments when various characters encounter adversity. Genre cliches still abound, and the final arc is pretty generic and without any kind of romantic conclusion (this show is adaptation of the only the first part of a series of novels) but points for having at least a few bites of substance.\\n\\n\r\n-Art-\\n\\n\r\nPretty, with numerous bright warm colors. The palette looks like flavors from an ice cream shop (odd way of describing it, but that's the best way I can think of). The animation quality is fine and I don't really have much else to say.\\n\\n\r\n-Sound-\\n\\n\r\nMostly light and happy J-Pop. I still listen to the first OP on YouTube from time to time, so points there. The OST is fine for the show, but nothing to write home about. The voice actors all seemed to fit, with Mashiro's abnormal personality coming through well.\\n\\n\r\n-Characters-\\n\\n\r\nSorata is a thoroughly average, hapless nice guy- dime a dozen in this genre. He's there to be an Audience Surrogate and that's what he does. Then you have the mysterious girl in Mashiro, the romantic foil in Nanami (who did have the most interesting arc, being the most devoted to what she wanted to do but also encountering the most difficulty- I was definitely rooting for her by the end) the best friend who's far more outgoing, the teacher who doesn't act remotely responsible enough for the position of Community Leader, and a couple oddballs for comedic effect. Cut and dry standard fare. They have their moments of being entertaining, I won't say these are botched characters, but they're still playing close to the archetypes. The highlight of the cast is the computer genius recluse Ryuunosuke- I have a personal preference for snarky characters who are perfectly willing to ruthlessly cut through another character's BS right in their face and give them the cold hard truth regardless of how they feel about it. \\n\\n\r\n-Enjoyment-\\n\\n\r\nI came to watch an enjoyable romantic comedy, I got an enjoyable romantic comedy. No complaints here.\\n\\n\r\n-Overall-\\n\\n\r\nPretty animation and a little substance to plot save 'Sakurasou' from complete mediocrity, but generic characters and an inconclusive romantic ending keep it from being anything more than just a bit above average. I've waffled between giving it a 5 or a 6, so... 5.5",

            "content": "Our Lord Almighty \"J.C Staff\" has yet brought us another anime that will go down in my books as one of the best animes that they ever made along with Railgun, Toradora, Little Busters: Refrain, and probably Index II. Scratch that, screw Index\r\n(There will be some SPOILERS in my review)\r\n[Story]: (8/10) (SPOILERS)\r\nThe Pet Girl of Sakurasou is a rom-com anime that focuses on a second year high school student named Sorata who lives in a dorm named Sakurasou, the dormitory for delinquent children at the school where Sorata goes to. One day, a dumb cute blonde girl named Mashiro who happens to be a greatpainter and artist moves into Sakurasou. \\n\\n\r\nThe first half of the series was, honestly, not that great. At first, you'll probably think that this is another one of those cliche rom-com animes where the main character is going to take care the blonde girl because she's too dumb to take care of herself. I've seen these kind of animes before, to the point where it's just getting very annoying. You might also think that this is going to be a harem because Sorata lives in a dorm where the majority of the occupants are females. There's also the pointless fan-service, typical slice-of-life fooling around, Ecchi elements and many more cliches. At this point, I was ready to drop the show then the 2nd half came.\\n\\n\r\nThe second half of the series was awesome. If you were planning to drop the series because of how awful the first half is then don't. Just wait till the second half arrives and the wait will be all worth it. The second half is seperated into 3 plot points. \\n\\n\r\nThe first is the love triangle between Sorata, Nanami, and Shiina and a love story between Misaki and Jin. In my opinion, the story was told perfectly and it further developed the main characters. It gets you thinking..who Sorata is going to be paired up with. Sorata looks up to Shiina because of how dedicated she is to her work. Shiina, at this point, probably started gaining feelings for Sorata but I'm not exactly sure. The way she's acting sometimes gets me confused as to whether or not she gained feelings for Sorata or she's just acting like that because she wants too. Nanami gained feelings for Sorata because she thinks she's a cool guy who picks up abandoned cats. This is why I liked the first plot point of the first half. They didn't just randomly gained feelings for that person. There was a relationship development. Now..the love story between Misaki and Jin. The love story here is bit complicated. It's not your usual \"I love you, let's go out\" love story. They eventually knew they had feelings for each other but Jin rejected her even though he loves her and he had his reasons. His reasons are very good and actually made sense. \\n\\n\r\nThe second is the characters chasing their dreams/career. This is the BEST plot point out of the 3. Let me ask you a question..Have you ever experienced something in your life where you got rejected because there's that one person who is better than you? Have you ever experienced something in your life where you worked hard for years because you wanted that job/position but got rejected because there's that one person who is better than you? If you say yes then you will love how the show depicted the characters going through that stage. Yes, I've been there. That's why I knew what the characters were feeling,especially Nanami, where she worked hard for 2 years to pass the audition but failed. The world is unfair and we gotta learn how to live with it. \\n\\n\r\nThe final plot point is the bond and feelings that they have gained for each other by living in Sakurasou. I found this  somewhat cheesy but it's still great to watch. This basically shows the strong bond that they have towards each other and will do everything to make sure it doesn't break. *hint the final 4 episodes will put them through that test hint* \\n\\n\r\nThe pacing, in my opinion, is slow but I actually prefer slow story pacing. It means the show gets to further develop the characters and I get to know what's going on. The ending didn't felt rushed and it was a satisfying ending. \\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\r\n[Art/Animation]: (8.5/10)\\n\r\nThe animation looks great to me. The roads, houses, sun, etc are well designed. The character design looks amazing to me. It's nice to see a great character design after looking at some anime that was made from 2005 with those crappy character designs. There were some lack of details in the animation and the design in the cars and some buildings looked somewhat bland. \\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\r\n[Sound]: (9/10)\\n\r\nThe soundtrack, in my opinion, is great. The background theme that plays during the comedy scenes and emotional scenes are great and it fitted that corresponding scene. There are 3 OP theme songs and 3 ED theme songs.\\n\\n\r\nThe 1st OP is \"Kimi ga Yume wo Tsuretekita\" by Pet na Kanojo-tachi. The 2nd OP is \"Yume no Tsuzuki\" by Konomi Tsuzuki. The 3rd OP is \"I call your name again\" by \"Nanami Aoyami\". Wait what?! I didn't know the 3rd OP is sung by Nanami. Whatever... The 1st OP is great. It was sung by the female characters of Sakurasou dorm. It became obvious after hearing the OP song in the 3rd episode. The 2nd OP is pretty decent. I still prefer the 1st opening. The only part I love in the 2nd OP is the violin. The 3rd OP is also pretty decent. I mean, it was sung by Nanami but I didn't even recognize her voice. \\n\\n\r\nThe 1st ED is \"Day of Dash\" by Konomi Suzuki. This ED song just became my new favourite ED theme song. I just love her voice. The 2nd ED is Prime number ~Kimi to Deaeru H by Asuka Ookura. I actually like the 2nd ED theme song but I still prefer the 1st one. 3rd ED theme song is Kyou no Hi wa Sayounara by..........8 people sung this song?! Jesus. I never heard the 3rd ED theme song so I can't give out my opinions. \\n\\n\r\nThe Voice Actors in my opinion are great. Their voices fit the characters, especially Nanami and Shiina. \\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\r\n[Characters]: (9/10) (SPOILERS)\\n\r\nI must say, they did a great job with the characters. The 1st half of the show revealed these characters as a generic cliche characters but the 2nd half showed us how they developed and how they transformed over time. \\n\r\nSorata changed from an unlikable idiot to a likable idiot who helps his friends. Shiina changed from a dumb blonde girl who needs help to a blonde girl who actually cares for other's characters feelings. Nanami is still almost the same but still changed.  She had a reason as to why she was working hard, to the point where she almost passed out. Misaki changed from an over-energetic cheery girl to a depressed girl. I mean, she went back to being an over-energetic girl later on but that's her....let's say...true side. Akasaka, who is a shut-in girl *ahem* I mean boy changed to a boy who actually has a caring side. The flashback showed us why he's a shut-in kid. \\n\r\nTo summarize, the show did a great job developing the characters and they actually have a reason on why their personalities are changing. \\n\\n\r\nI just want to get this out of the way. I like Sorata as a protagonist but the way he over-reacts sometimes pisses me off. The way he takes out the blame on someone else also pisses me off. \\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\r\n[Enjoyment]: (9/10)\\n\r\nMost of my enjoyment rating came from the 2nd half because of they did a great job with the love story, the depiction of the \"unfair world\" that we live in, and the fact that not everything will go your way. \\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\r\n[OVERALL]: (9/10)\\n\r\nThe reason why I'm rating this show a 9 even though the first half sucked ass is because of the reasons I listed in my Enjoyment Category. If you enjoy a romantic/comedy/drama anime that is done right then I recommend that you give this show a try. If you're a fan of Toradora then you obviously need to give this show a try. \\n\\n\\n\r\nPros:\\n\r\n+Great and Heart-warming Story\\n\r\n+Great Animation\\n\r\n+Great Soundtrack\\n\r\n+Developed and Fleshed out characters\\n\r\n+Realistic depiction of an \"unfair world\"\\n\r\n+Successfully executed dramatic moments\\n\r\n+Funny moments\\n\r\n+Satisfying ending that didn't feel rushed\\n\\n\r\nCons:\\n\r\n-Some melodramatic scenes\\n\r\n-1st half of the series\\n\r\n-Few fanservice scenes",

            "content": "I watch anime to feel for the characters and to be moved by their struggles, failures and successes. If like me, you find enjoyment in being a part of a rom com, slice of life anime which can make you laugh, feel and cry then you should give Sakurasou no Pet na Kanojo (Pet Girl of Sakurasou) a watch.\r\nAs a reviewer, I am biased by the fact that the first 2 anime I watched were Code Geass and Clannad/Clannad AS. Since then I've watched over 50 anime including the top 20 romance anime as listed on myanimelist. I tell you this, to help you todecide how I rate my anime, since such a process is as you'd expect a subjective opinion.\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of pure emotion or 'feels' my top 3 anime would be Clannad AS, Code Geass then Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso. Sakurasou would still easily fit into the top 10 and particularly towards the end of the series, it becomes far more drama than comedy, as good shows do. I was spoilt in the sense of expecting all series to move me as much as my first 2 anime, but it is actually a huge struggle to find series that can touch and move you. I am pleased to say that this show can hold it's head high knowing that it has almost reached those heights of immersion and emotion.\\n\\n\r\nSo what makes this show special?\\n\\n\r\nThe story itself is based on the idea of an artistic genius who is however so gifted in art that she is unable to manage in any other sphere, be it, taking care of herself or understanding her emotions. She is thrown into the mix of sakurasou - which is a dorm for misfits who do not fit into the regular student dorms for whatever reason, whether it is because they keep pets (Sorata), too poor to afford it (Nanami), a geek shut in (Ryuunosoke), an anime genius (Misaki) and a playboy (Jin). Although it starts out with a bit too much fanservice for my liking, this quickly settles down as the story plays out and is not really a distraction later on.\\n\\n\r\nThe wide variety of character tropes means that there is something for everyone. At the heart of the show, there are 2 main themes - friendship and the balance between talent and hard work. One of the interesting things about the show is the focus on failure. Most shows just have characters succeeding at everything they try. Here we have characters experiencing defeat after defeat and we can watch them grow and mature as they deal with it. This opportunity to watch the characters grow and change is perhaps the best part of the series as there is nothing more annoying than characters who don't learn a thing over a series of 20+ episodes (one of the reasons I disliked My Teen Romantic Comedy SNAFU - which is also highly rated and may suit some).\\n\\n\r\nThe character designs are fabulous and the colours and artwork/animation is top notch, which is a given, since the genius in the show Mashiro is a painter. I also particularly enjoyed the soundtrack, including the openings and endings, which are mostly sung by the cast. Suffice to say that those 2 elements enhanced the experience and did not in any way distract from the show.\\n\\n\r\nSummary:\\n\r\nA top grade rom com slice of life drama.\\n\r\nIf you enjoyed, Clannad AS or am looking for an anime that can give you the 'feels'/emotional involvement - be sure to check this one out.\\n\r\nYou will laugh, cry and grow to love the characters in this story. I know I did!",

            "content": "Let your dreams be bigger than your fears and your actions be louder than your words.\r\nSakurasou no pet, or also known as the Pet Girl of Sakurasou, is about a teenage boy named Sorata Kanda who attends Suimei High School, a special school for students who wish to polish their skills and talents as artists. This school is always the best place for each student to chase their own dreams. The main storyline starts when Sorata is driven out from the regular dorm due to his irresponsibility, of keeping a wild cat. One of the dorm rules is that pets are not allowed in thedormitory. Thus, begin a new story for Kanda at Sakurasou dorm, a dormitory for troubled students. The series of hardship in achieving a dream while on the other hand full with romantic relationships with each other. \\n\\n\r\nHowever, it would be a great mistake to simply judge and dismiss this series based upon first impression.\\n\\n\r\nThe main star of the series is nobody else than Sorata himself, who is the earnest type of man, absolutely zero experience with girls, and although Sorata is na\u00efve, Sorata always has been caught up in embarrassing situations with every girl. Precisely, our main lead is a person who ends up in sexual situations as well as being easily flustered. Who cannot love this type of characters? Obviously this is your typical type of main character in shows nowadays. Sorata is also a serious type of person; this has been shown since the first episode up until the bitter end of the series. He takes up every matter as something important, which results in problems for himself and others. In other words, his actions are always exaggerated in each situation he faces. Do not involve others in your own pride. This is not a useless statement as Sorata always takes up his pride damn too high which results in hurting others without realizing it. Undeniably Sorata has egos that show in their own class level without revealing too much. \\n\\n\r\nAfter a few minutes into the story, we\u2019ve got our main girl Shiina who is also known as the pet girl. The way Sorata and Shiina meet is undeniably romantic and full with sorrow, and yet it feels mysterious in its own way as it was a fate. Shiina was born with unparalleled talent who has already made huge gaps between people who work harder to achieve something. A person naturally talented even as a kid, Shiina is already in her own league, but no one tries to become her friend. This results in Shiina almost possessing no emotions, causing problems for her to understand people's emotions. I think Shiina is like a robot or some kind of species of rare aliens at first. Shiina is also apparently unable to handle even simple tasks like dressing herself, and yet the one who helps her is none other than Sorata. This kind of scene is making fan service complete their role in the series. Each character started their unique appearance and in a matter of seconds, makes us interested without being aware of it. While on the other hand, we\u2019re addicted to see the unique side of each of the characters.  One of the characters who I think is really special and catches my eye is Mitaka Jin. He has been described as your playboy type of man but his eyes show otherwise with this feels with sorrow. You can see it if you give a really high tense of attention. I even rewatched the episodes just to make it crystal clear. And, yes, my accuracy is absolutely right when the story goes on deeper and tense. I, without any ill intentions to spoil you further, want to say his love story is also the best one in the series. \\n\\n\r\nShiina always looks emotionless and kind of slow to learn the feelings of emotion. Surprisingly, Shiina does quickly learn the meaning of Jealousy. The girl who successfully helps Shiina develop the feelings is none other than Nanami Aoyama who also has a crush on Sorata. Yes, Nanami is also one of those \u2018childhood friends\u2019 who always have a deep relation with the main lead. Nevertheless, all the classmates of Sorata and Nanami already knows Nanami's feelings. On the other hand Sorata is ultimately dense about Nanami's crush on him. Our main character is pretty typical again even in this kind of things. Although this series this series looks like a harem show, but as I stated at my friends before, Harem, at the minimum should at least consist of 3 females trying to catch the main lead\u2019s love. Otherwise, there are only two females who pursuit Sorata\u2019s love. Yes, it is Shiina Mashiro and Nanami Aoyama. \\n\\n\r\nThere also one character here looks like a Kuroneko form Oreimo series, the only difference is, and in this series the guy is named Ryuunosuke. Who doesn\u2019t believe and understand in the concept of companion. Deep down to the core he looks like kuroneko from appearances and mentality. Even his cold attitude and sarcastic tendencies of looking down at people before his heart warms up to change. Yes, tsundere type of boy is here. Siamese twins maybe? Surprisingly, he also gets his own love story, though in his case the female is from foreign countries. Which I think defeats Sorata in his own way.\\n\\n\r\nUndeniably, the problems faced by all the characters in Sakurasou dorm is a very first class issue that it is all relative in its own way. The director Atsuko does a wonderful job by linking all the problems to each of the characters. This makes the dilemmas in Sakurasou, successfully present a real and emotional story. All the scenes were well set-up, with a plenty number of sharp characters, playing good roles whose lines pierced through all pretense actions. Thus this series becomes a roller-coaster of emotions for us. Sometimes our feeling rise and sometime we down as our feelings flow the way in the story series. It\u2019s a shame, really when the series has been put to the end. All the characters in the series play up their roles efficiently by making mistakes each times, showing there are flawed human beings who can make stupid and irrational decisions, but is rewarding in the end. Even some scenes where all the characters have been put together is bursting with energy and lively moments up suppressed any other shows. \\n\\n\r\nThe series animation is actually great. The art in its own way is already beautiful. With the fabulous Ops and Ed there is no better mark for the series. This series feels like reflecting our slice of life. The world is not what it seems but by leaving behind your old self and taking a leap of faith into the unknown. You find out what you are truly capable of becoming. \\n\\n\r\n\"Perfection is not attainable but if we chase perfection, we can catch excellence.\" - Vince Lombardi\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment and Overall\\n\r\nI must admit, this series successfully made me cry in the end. The bittersweets love and the hardship they have gone through. Just makes you want to cheers for them more until the very end. Even though, most part of the series is a duel between Shiina and Nanami to catch Sorata\u2019s attention. The destiny and fate is just a new beginning for them. In the end, I can\u2019t just describe it easily as I want but I still don\u2019t doubt my feelings as I think this is one of my favorite anime all time. The beauty in the series is outrageous. It is such a tense story right at the start to the unexpected ending we could think of. I love all the characters that make this series such a tear jerker even in the final end. \\n",

Some people feel depressed at this point and just give up, this is exactly how you fail. You need to take that feeling and use it as motivation to get better and achieve your dreams! You'll never be able to succeed if you give up the moment someone better than you shows up, there will always be someone better, you just have to face it head-on and give it your best. *//End my pretending to be a life counselor*\r\nPet Kanojo is an anime that focuseson a boy named Sorata Kanda and his trials in a dorm called Sakura-Sou, whether it be romantic, school, family, work, or just every problems. Sakura-Sou is a place where problem children from Suimei High reside, it has low rent and virtually no rules. Although, Sorata isn't a problem child, he just can't bear to lose his cat without giving it an owner. Thus, our story begins.\\n\\n\r\nNow for you hardcore romance fans out there, like me, you are probably wondering, how far could the romance possibly progress in a setting such as this? And honestly, not as far as we would like, but that goes for many rom-com animes. But if you enjoy a good romance/comedy like I do, then you'll still enjoy this anime very much.\\n\\n\r\nNow onto my specific review points.\\n\\n\r\nStory 9/10\\n\r\nI really enjoy anime that have new and interesting story ideas, Pet Kanojo being one of them. It's not your typical romance, comedy, drama type anime, it has a lot more around it. It deals with large problems. Such as someone being so amazing at something they put everyone around them down. This story has much more than just that, but that is a big part of it. It also deals with romance, drama, and of course, hilarious comedy! There are little things in the background in some scenes you will have to rewind in order to make sure you saw it, they are absolutely hilarious.\\n\\n\r\nArt 10/10\\n\r\nThe art in this anime was fantastic. it was detailed, colorful, fluent, and symmetrical. The backgrounds had lots of detail and color, which is always nice to see. The characters were very well drawn and symmetrical, whether it be them talking, moving, or just their general art.\\n\\n\r\nSound 9/10\\n\r\nThe sound in this anime was really nice as well. The voice actors all matched up to their characters nicely. Specially Mashiro's voice actor, that was a great match. All of the OP and ED songs were also very enjoyable. I actually found myself listening to the second ED song quite a bit, it was a catchy song :)\\n\\n\r\nCharacter. 9/10\\n\r\nThey did a very good job on portraying these characters. Also, they had a good background to each main character, which is always a treat. That allows you to really get sucked into this anime. I for one can't stand an anime with no background on characters or lacking background, I like to sympathize with the characters or sometimes even relate to them. So for the characters I think they did a very good job on allowing the audience to get to know them.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 10/10\\n\r\nI thoroughly enjoyed this anime, whether it be comedy, romance, or the SoL part. The comedy was absolutely amazing. The little things killed me, like hearing what someone said in the background or some random persons face during a scene. The romance did not progress as much as I wanted it to, but I can say that about most rom-com anime I have watched. It was also nice to see the little bit of SoL in it Them living their lives during their high school days and planning their future.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 9/10\\n\r\nI don't like to give 10's on a review unless the anime was truly amazing and had everything I like perfectly done. Not that this anime isn't amazing, it definitely is, but for the there were just a couple things I wish were done a little more, but I completely understand the reason they ended the romance the way they did, they want to try and apply to all demos and make sure they can grab the largest audience possible, which I would do the same if I were in their shoes. So overall I really loved this anime and found it to be a pleasure to watch through and through, so I definitely recommend this to any comedy/romance lovers out there! So I'll end it here, thanks for reading! Any comments/suggestions are greatly appreciated! but for now, I think I'm going to go try and find a Sakura-Sou for myself >.>",

            "content": "I've never written a review before and I'm not a very 'reviewy', critical person but here goes!\r\nSakurasou was one of my all time favourite animes. It is a rom-com, slice of life anime which focuses on the troubles, hardships, friendships and romance between students in an infamous dorm called Sakura Hall. \r\nAt the start of the anime it seemed a bit odd, and the story progressed quite slowly. However it soon developed into a very complex story which drew me in. It focused on different characters, how they perceived their lives and how they fought towards what they wanted in life. It was different toother rom-coms I have seen in that it didn't just focus on romance and heartbreak, but intertwined this with the characters desire to achieve their goals and dreams which often led to them falling short of these dreams. However the characters kept pursuing said dreams. It focused mainly on the main character Sorata who was an average student pursuing a career in game design. He was a character who was very easy to relate to, as I'm sure many people see themselves in the struggles he went through trying to do what he loved whilst comparing himself to those around him. All in all the story line was complex, deeply moving and often saddening, however it was filled with hilarious moments. \\n\r\nThe art was beautiful. The soundtrack was also beautiful and complemented everything well. The story was complex and had many good life lessons such as learning to cope with hardships, falling short of your dreams and pursuing what you love no matter what. The characters (apart from Mashiro she was pretty bland sorry, but still an interesting character) were complex, yet had that element of comedy in them all also. \\n\\n\r\nAll in all it was a brilliant anime and was by far a favourite of mine. I would recommend it to anyone who is looking for a comedic, romancey, yet complex story full of extremely emotional moments.",

            "content": "Summary: If you're into slice of life comedy/romance anime, you're sure in for a treat! This might be the best slice of life anime I've ever seen. The art is beautiful, the characters are absolutely wonderful and fully developed, the story is fairly simple and straight forward, taking a few dark turns just long enough to explore a few interesting concepts but still keep the mood light. It has comedy, romance, sadness and tons of character developments. Plus it has a satisfying and complete ending that doesn't feel rushed or leave me wanting more (in a bad way). If you're into high school slice oflife anime this will likely be a winner for you!\\n\\n\r\nStory: 9/10\\n\r\nAbsolutely fantastic. The story isn't terribly complex and mostly follows slice of life type daily activities focused around growing the characters bonds and fleshing out a year of high school. There are some pretty interesting elements, especially the darker tones. Other than the typical slice of life arcs (and a few that would contain spoilers), the secondary theme behind building relationships is jealousy. It is facing the hard truth that some people are just born naturally amazing and gifted and that all the hard work in the world can't always make up for that fact. Granted, this isn't the main arc of the story and doesn't derail the feels, but it is definitely a darker theme for a slice of life and added a new angle I found fascinating. Also, the anime ends in a perfect place after they took the time to flesh out the ending and I wasn't left wanting more.\\n\\n\r\nSidebar: I didn't completely love the romance arcs and the direction the authors took it, but it wasn't bad just a personal preference.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9/10\\n\r\nGorgeous. Everything was drawn extremely well, the color choices were excellent and I loved all of the character models. This is definitely top quality animation!\\n\\n\r\nSound: 7/10\\n\r\nThe sound was pretty good. Nothing memorable (including the opening and ending themes) but it definitely got the job done.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9/10\\n\r\nI loved every main character! They were all fleshed out extremely well and I felt that I knew and understood each and everyone one of them by the end. They made mistakes, they went through pain and hardship, they had fun together and built relationships, but most of all they grew and evolved as people and they were all markedly different by the end of the anime. A few of the characters could have used a bit more development (the sensei in particular) but I can't complain too much. I can see how others would have wanted a few relationships to evolve in a different way but I completely understood the characters and their motivations to where I was OK with how everything turned out even if it wasn't ideal.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\r\nI absolutely loved it! It took me on an emotional roller coaster, covered things that are atypical of a slice of life anime and made this stand out as something special in a fairly saturated genre. I didn't think there was much filler and I enjoyed almost every single episode.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9/10\\n\r\nI recommend this to anyone who enjoys slice of life anime. It is definitely head and shoulders above anything else I've seen in the genre. The characters and story were both excellent; I felt by the end that I truly knew and liked all of the characters and was glad to get to \"know\" them. With a very diverse cast and several atypical and interesting subplots, I think this is likely to appeal to almost anyone into slice of life. Add in the fact that the ending is complete and thorough and there really isn't much not to like.",

            "content": "Personally, i think that Sakurasou no Pet na Kanojo was a really great series. The main story was about a boy named Kanda Sorata and his dorm, Sakurasou. Sakurasou is a dorm for the problem students and that sets up a a huge story when a girl named Shiina Mashiro comes to live in Sakurasou as well.\r\nStory: 9/10\r\nSakurasou is a really interesting anime when it comes to the story. The genre it is labeled as is comedy, drama, romance, and school. The story itself does include a lot of the points of comedy and romance. There are many times where the romance between two ofthe problematic students/residents make it very hilarious. There is a lot of drama when it comes to the conflicts that Sorata encounters with Mashiro. Thus, the story shows that it truly is a piece of art.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9/10\\n\r\nThe art in this anime is amazing since Sakurasou has a famous artist, aka Mashiro. Mashiro is a manga artist in the anime and her drawings are outstanding. The anime had a lot of details and the way colors were chosen brought out the potential the setting had. The combination of the two works of art made it seem like it would be difficult to try to replicate since Mashiro's drawing was more detailed than the scenery.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9/10\\n\r\nThe audio in the anime was really well done. The songs are such as the opening and ending are really amazing. I really love the songs since they are very enjoyable. Mashiro's voice actress made Mashiro sound amazing at almost every part of the story. Sorta's voice actor voiced out Sorata's feeling when he was feeling down and depressed. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10/10\\n\r\nThe personality of each character made the anime amazing since each character was very different from one another. One was a lonely insider. Another one was like a girl magnet. And the other ones were really strange like Mashiro who can't seem to take care of herself. They all had a fun personality and attitude when they were in Sakurasou.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9/10\\n\r\nTo me, i really enjoyed the anime. The anime had many parts where i couldn't help laughing. I enjoyed the romance since it was really funny by how Misaki(a resident of Sakurasou) tries to earn someone's heart. I thought that there would be more romance between Mashiro and Sorata, but there wasn't much. Their school life was really amazing since they are very different from the \"normal\" students.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9/10\\n\r\nPersonally, i don't think this can be called a \"10\" since i believe that the romance part could have been much better. Mashiro made a lot of the moments awkward, or very hilarious. I would recommend it to people who are interested in comedy animes and such. There is romance in it so i would also recommend it to romance lovers, but not as much. The anime truly is amazing since it brings out the potential of each character.",

            "content": "*Warning may contain spoilers*\r\nSo based on the synopsis, Sakurasou is a rom-com, high school slice of life anime - a genre that is pretty standard and generic, and one which I tend to avoid. As I was just looking for something light and easy to watch to pass time, I didn't have alot of expectations going into the show. However, by the end I was left pretty dumbstruck by what I've just watched. Sakurasou is really a case of \"dont judge a book by its cover\", it will definitely take you by surprise.\r\nSTORY: 8\r\nThe story in Sakurasou starts off fairly slow and generic, our mainprotagonist Sorata moves into a dorm full of problematic students, or the misfits of the school. He is initially set on moving out at the first opportunity, however as the story progresses we find that he eventually becomes attached to Sakurasou and its eccentric residents. However, the other much more interesting aspect of the story is on the ambitions and dreams of each character in the story, and how they struggle to achieve their own goals. Personally, this is a concept that's very relatable to me at different stages in life - whether its studying for grades, college applications or career aspirations. The show really manages to highlight the realities of life, where we're often met with failures before we find success, do we simply give up? or pick up the pieces and start again. The plot also plays around with the idea of people who are naturally talented vs those who have to try - and again this is a very interesting concept which adds alot of depth to the story of the anime. A number of reviews have commented on the (lack of) romance between the main characters, and I agree that this hasn't been very well executed. However, personally I didn't find that the romance was a very important element to the plot in Sakurasou and so I didn't really have any problems with it. \\n\\n\r\nART: 9\\n\r\nThe art is another very strong aspect of Sakurasou. The anime is beautifully animated and utilisese a very bright palette of colours which I find very pleasing to watch. Most scenes, particularly the important scenes were very well executed and its evident that alot of attention was given to very small details. The character designs are also very well done.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND: 8\\n\r\nThe sound is generally well done, and both the OP/ED are good and complements the overall theme and genre of the anime.  \\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS: 10\\n\r\nThis is easily one of the most important aspect of Sakurasou, and what really sets it apart from the cliches that we find in other similar high school animes. The thing is, Sakurasou's characters are not particularly unique, in fact many of them can easily fall into the generic stereotypes that we find in many animes. However, each character was so well executed that together they really created a dynamic that was very unique to Sakurasou. In my opinion all the characters were pivotal to the main plot, and none of them really felt like extras to the show. All of the characters were very well developed, with their own unique backstories. Because of this I was able to connect deeply with the characters. I was able to relate to their motivations, and understand why they reacted in a certain way to various events. At times Sakurasou was also an emotional roller coaster. I experienced different emotions together with the characters as events in the anime unfold - happiness as they celebrated their success or sadness and anger when they were met with failure. \\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT: 10\\n\r\nSakurasou was a very enjoyable anime, one which I think many viewers can truly relate to. It successfully manages to play around with a seemingly generic high school setting to create a very enjoyable anime. An interesting and surprisingly deep story, an eccentric array of well developed characters which together create a very unique atmosphere for the show.\\n\\n\r\nTo sum up, Sakurasou is definitely a must watch for any slice of life and rom-com fans, but also for other viewers because its very unique and different from the cliches that are common in this genre.",

Keep in mind that I watch and finish about one anime a day and I don't give out a full score very often but this one got it. It made me reminisce about watching Clannad and Chobits, combining a fine mix of romance and the adversities of just being as normal as anyone else. Although these characters are still in high school, they still overcome some adversaries that most won't have to by going to a normal school because they go to a school for the arts. Choosing your path in lifeand having to come to the realization that there are others better than you is something most people have to do in their life and this anime conveys the frustration that one feels when they have to go through such a thing. Also throw in the feelings of love between people that may or may not reciprocate just makes the show that much more wrenching to watch as each character tries to find their own way. In the end, trust me, and give it a watch.",

            "content": "This one is surprisingly good. Some of the reviews are correct, at first it seems like an ecchi harem or fan service. But its a lot more than that. The anime goes into some deep themes of genius level talent vs average talent and hard work and how lesser people try to measure up to those \"out there\" kind of people who live in a questionable reality but have a genius level talent they can never compare to, yet loving and appreciating them while they make them feel an inner worthless at the same time. \r\nIt goes into the trade offs of those who livein this reality, and those who live in their own. \\n\\n\r\nBut what truly makes this anime special is the characters. They are every bit as out there as you'd expect, and the normal ones are responsible and down to earth while the genius level ones can't even figure out how to put their own cloths on. \\n\\n\r\nHonestly though... this one needs a DUB to be truly appreciated. Many times the characters are so energetic they will talk right over each other, so you have two dialogues going at the same time, which makes the SUB version not as easy to watch. While you can listen to two voices talking over each other and pick out the conversations, many times in the SUB you have to stop the video to catch the full measure of all that's being said. \\n\\n\r\nArt style is pretty good, character interaction is spectacular, Story is very good, and its an incredibly enjoyable, funny, and touching story where the characters just make you smile. \\n\\n\r\nIts the same kind of interactions you find in Love, Chunibyo, and other Delusions minus the cool special transformation into the imagination type shots, and its every bit as good.",

            "content": "Pet Girl of Sakurasou is one of those anime where I went into it expecting an anime like Toradora. And to be honest, since Toradora I haven\u2019t really watched a Slice of Life like these two. I\u2019m not really sure as to why that is, but to me those kinds of anime these days haven\u2019t really aged as well. This anime comes from the era when Slice of Life was WAY more popular than it is today. You could say this came out near the end of its big run at the top, since then in anime, Slice of Life I feel hasn\u2019t really beenthe same. These days I feel anime has moved to a more fantasy setting what with the proliferation of SAO style MMO Anime and the re-explosion of Shounen. Honestly I\u2019d be lying if I didn\u2019t say I (for the majority of this series) didn\u2019t enjoy this.\\n\\n\r\nBackground\\n\\n\r\nThe Pet Girl of Sakurasou is based off the Light Novel of the same name written by Hajime Kamoshida who is working on this season\u2019s original anime Just Because. The anime released in Fall 2012 and finished airing in March of 2013 with 24 episodes running for a total of 24 minutes. It is also directed by Atsuko Ishizuka who is known for; No Game No Life, Monster, Nana and MapleStory. \\n\\n\r\nStory\\n\\n\r\nSo I first want to say this anime does really well with building up these characters. By episode 2 I feel like I know more than enough about our two main characters to feel more than attached to them. Not only that, they set up the pacing pretty well by episode 3 and continue on with the same pace a majority of the series. I\u2019d say the series slows down at right around the last 4-5 episodes, but everything before that is pretty well. There are no setbacks or the dreaded confession at a random time then another character comes in to set up a love triangle. Everything in that regard is handled with some amount of decency and care. I also feel the dialogue, at least for the subtitles are well put together here. The characters stay true to their writing here, down to Nanami\u2019s accent. It\u2019s pretty well accounted for and it\u2019s very consistent in its presentation. But let\u2019s start now with the ultimate downfall of this series.\\n\\n\r\nThe Pet Girl of Sakurasou on paper is this Slice of Life anime that\u2019s set in school with a main character who looks generic, and a main female lead who has no emotions to speak of. These things are mostly true and are a big problem. This series cast was basically a bunch of misfit kids, which was unique, but they took away these unique qualities by making them seem to generic by the end. Throughout most of these series the story is pretty good, it\u2019s well paced and enjoyable. The story is easy to follow and the characters are simple, but complicated enough to have some form of depth. But by the end the last two episodes seem to completely negate the whole struggle these characters have. I don\u2019t say spoilers or anything until the very end so stick around if you\u2019ve watched it it already. But I feel this show relies WAY too heavily on melodrama and they lay it on incredibly thick too. I feel that by episode 17 I am neck deep in melodrama and honestly it suffocates the series to death by episode 20. Much of my original enjoyment of this series was killed by these last two episodes. I can forgive a boring run of episodes if the ending is good, but by the end they just go all in and create the most generic ending to an anime I have to this day I have ever seen.\\n\\n\r\nCharacterizations\\n\\n\r\nCharacters here like I mentioned before are very well set up by episode 2 and everything after just seems to be bonus for our main characters or are there to develop the rest of the cast. Even characters like Sengoku we don\u2019t see often, I feel like I know pretty well. She\u2019s also the cousin for our main character Mashiro, and she often gives Sorata bad advice or is trying to get drunk and date men. That\u2019s pretty much her whole character, and shows that this show really gets you invested in characters even if they\u2019re not that integral to the overall show or plot. As for our main characters\u2026\\n\\n\r\nMashiro Shiina is an incredibly talented artist who comes from the UK to work on Manga in Japan. And throughout the series she is constantly touted as this super genius when it comes to her drawings and stories. As for her personality, she is kinda absent minded if that makes sense. If I were to compare her, she\u2019d be most similar to Rei Ayanami from Evangelion. Although I\u2019d say the main take away from that is she\u2019s everything Rei is, but with half the emotion of Rei. In fact, there are really only a handful of times we really get to see Shiina be more than a 1-note generic lifeless husk of a human. Where her character really shines is when she\u2019s interacting with Sorata, I feel every other time she\u2019s just kinda in the background to everyone else. But here is the cool part about her character, they don\u2019t outright say it, but they strongly hint at there being something wrong with Mashiro. They constantly mention in the first 3 episodes how she needed a nurse to take care of her, and they she wasn\u2019t exactly like normal people. They never really explained this in series what it was, but it was a nice way to give a reason to her being so lifeless instead of just having you be a generic lifeless character with no reason as to the way she is.\\n\\n\r\nAs for Sorata Kanda, he\u2019s a second year who lives in Sakurasou after not getting rid of a stray cat. Kanda is often described throughout the series as normal boy with no real hidden talents, and is one of the reasons he feels so inadequate to everyone else. Everyone in Sakurasou is extremely talented and the only thing Kanda has is his cats. This does play up the whole \u201cgeneric MC\u201d thing, but this show takes it in a different direction. He isn\u2019t useless per se, but he just can\u2019t compare to everyone at Sakurasou. Think of it this way, it\u2019s like being roommates with all the members of The Beatles and Pink Floyd. You have your own usefulness and are talented yourself, but you don\u2019t notice because your roommates are two of the greatest musicians the world has ever known. This is Kanda\u2019s character and his ultimate reason for being such a well written character. He sticks out like a sore thumb even though he\u2019s so (for lack of a better term) Generic.\\n\\n\r\nArt\\n\\n\r\nThe art here is nothing special at all, coming out in 2013 this anime even back then would seem really generic and it does look generic. Every character looks exactly pretty standard, like I\u2019ve seen them 100 times before in other anime. Which is very strange thinking about this because, the character aren\u2019t themselves generic in the way they\u2019re written and portrayed, but they certainly are in the way they look. The best design for a character in this series isn\u2019t even featured throughout the whole thing and that\u2019s Rita. She looks distinct and has a certain feel to how she\u2019s designed and presented. I feel like ultimately this design choice was just that, a necessary design choice to make a relatable looking anime. To play Devil\u2019s Advocate here, you could make the argument that these are students who aren\u2019t leading extravagant lives, I men Sakurasou is meant to be a low rent dump. So these characters maybe not looking special is probably for the best. And it is odd I say Rita is the most distinct, as she doesn\u2019t live in Sakurasou. Overall though, the anime does pretty solid everywhere else though. The backgrounds are pretty well detailed for what they are, but sadly a lot of them are used as panning shots, which kinda sucks. Sadly, I think saying this anime\u2019s art looking rather bland will be the dominant opinion here, but I think this may be a case of age coming into play too.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation\\n\\n\r\nThe Animation is pretty solid all things considered, everything is smooth and there is no choppiness or eye catching mistakes. Most of the animation I feel is spend animating Misaki\u2019s boobs, but everywhere else it\u2019s pretty good. Cats bobbing their head to Kanda using a hammer is a pretty nice touch and adds a little bit of real life detail. Something that bothered me though was the usage of panning shots here. And I didn\u2019t really notice this until now, but panning shots aren\u2019t used much these days. So when I saw these panning shots I was kinda taken aback with nostalgia. But either way to me panning shots that use static backgrounds are just the worst. It takes me out of the show when it\u2019s used in such a lazy way. Immediately there aren\u2019t a lot of these, but when they do happen it\u2019s just kinda uncalled for in my opinion.\\n\\n\r\nFinal Rating\\n\\n\r\nThe Pet Girl of Sakurasou just did not age well in my opinion. Looking at My Anime List and other websites score this so highly makes me wonder why. After careful deliberation and much discussion with a couple people who\u2019ve watched it the only thing I can think of is it just doesn\u2019t age well. Now this is not to say this show is a bad show, all things considered it does everything as well as it can be done with it being a Slice of Life set in school. But is this the best Slice of Life I\u2019ve ever seen? Well no, I think the whole second half of this series was a massive let down. It lays on the melodrama, and the last two episodes are some of the worst anime I\u2019ve seen in a very very long time.\\n\\n\r\nThe Pet Girl of Sakurasou receives a 7/10",

It was a complete experience for me, gave me bunch of laughters, lessons in life, and it tugged my hearstrings a few times. \r\nFrom the get go I thought that it'd be a normal rom-com anime. Where a lost girl meets a boy who'll guide her. But then it made me realized that they were both (everyone really) lost in one way oranother. Just like how we are in different points in our lives. The lessons given here, the things that they share about life can be applied to how we approach our everyday battles. \\n\\n\r\nThe comedy provided here is just the right amount as to not ruin the overall vibe and experience of this work of art. This anime will always keep you wanting to watch it for more. It had the perfect ingredients to make it one of the best in my world.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime will be a worthwhile experience. Highly recommended. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoy!",

            "content": "\"The Pet Girl of Sakurasou\". Doesn't seem very appealing.. Firstly, I don't like ecchi, so when I first saw the first few episodes, I wanted to stop, but I was curious. One thing I'll say is that I'll never forget this anime and I don't ever regret watching it.\r\n(9) Story - The story starts when Sorata Kanda moves out of his normal dorms because he was attached to cats - into a 'problematic' dorm: Sakurasou. Then not long after, a girl, Mashiro Shiina moves in. Sorata has to take care of her like a 'pet' because Mashiro can't do anything right.  It has abit of romance and huge bits of comedy and sadness. I was surprised of the slight twists of the story along the way. Yes, it has ecchi throughout some of it, but that's what makes it funny.\\n\\n\r\n(9) Art - I liked some of the faces they'd make, and since this anime is fairly new, it's modern art. I didn't think there was anything wrong with it.\\n\\n\r\n(9) Sound - I loved the openings. But that's my opinion. Again, nothing really wrong with it.\\n\\n\r\n(8) Character - I, personally, loved most of the characters. If you didn't at first, you'd come to feel their pain and love them eventually. They were unique - and they also changed slightly throughout the anime. \\n\\n\r\n(9) Enjoyment/Overall - Also, it went in the realistic side of things - most anime are always over-the-top with things. That was one of the things I enjoyed the most. It almost brought me to tears when the it ended. All in all, it'll always be one of my favourite anime.",

            "content": "What's the difference between a genius and the average person? Majority would say that the genius has natural talent that far exceeds the average joe, effortlessly doing things with ease whereas on the other hand the non-genius is handicapped and has to work harder to reach his objective. Well, Sakurasou is here to show you that, genius or not, life's still gonna give you a hard time. (NOTE: There'll be SPOILERS ahead, TONS, so continue at your own risk. Recommendation wise, you have to watch this series!)\r\nLet's start with the general opinion of the public. Toradora and Sakurasou are very similar. Yes that is true,from the unique characters to the straightforward storyline I would have to agree. However, the main concept of the show is absolutely different, with Toradora's being about love and the trials and tribulations you have to go through to keep it alive, and Sakurasou's being escapism. (Side note: If I ever hear someone say Sakurasou is better than Toradora, heads will be flying.)\\n\\n\r\nTime to focus on the anime itself. Animation, sounds, voices, aesthetic stuff are top notch, not much surprise there. Everything compliments itself perfectly so I won't go much into the technological stuff.\\n\\n\r\nNow, here's the part which I love about Sakurasou. The characters and their interactions with each other. Half of the characters are unimaginably fake, you won't get to see them in real life, yet they portray themselves too realistically in such ways you can easily relate to them. Now that is the where the anime gets you good.\\n\\n\r\nThe theme of escapism nurtures these characters into outstanding and deep individuals, with the exception of Mashiro since she's still developing her emotions, being the well pampered genius she was. She does play one of the most excellent and pivotal role in the escapism part, and that is competition. Throughout the series, if not for Mashiro, our main protagonist might've still needed some anger management classes.\\n\r\nNow let's put some focus on Sorata. He's that typical guy that always wants something to change in his boring life and he meets really amazing people and they have fun together. Yep, pretty standard, but with a twist. He meets Mashiro, who's a genius in the field of contemporary art that suddenly wants to become a mangaka, and that's where the escapism comes in. Feeling aspired, he decides to start creating games, or rather coming up with game ideas to submit to a company that's hiring. However, not all is fair in love and war, or the industry for that matter, and he is denied many times. Meanwhile Mashiro is doing fantastic in her new line of work and that starts to break Sorata's humanity. Just like Rita, both have experienced the pain of being close to those of higher skill, feeling inferior, and they don't have the gall to face their problems, thus they run away from it. Escapism is not only limited to the main protags, but to the supporting characters as well, which brings another point up.\\n\\n\r\nNo characters are neglected and they each have their own roles to play, be it the cute little sister character of Sorata, or smartass Ryuunosuke. Specifically Jin and Misaki, the ones that suffer from escapism the most. They play a vital part in the main protag's life, teaching him various life lessons and always being there for him. What's best about them is their relationship, they both love each other, yet appear so distant because of mutual misunderstanding which leads to supreme escapism. These factors make them so distinct, you'll never be able to forget them. For Nanami, she's pretty much in the same situation with Sorata, except instead of going on a tantrum, she bottles it up until eventually breaking.\\n\\n\r\nEveryone has their fair share of pain and sadness, and at the end of the day, everyone helps each other to get over said pain and sadness. They mature, they bond deeper, and they move forward into the future. Reaching the end of the series, one can easily see loose ends being tied up, and in case you didn't get any emotional scenes, the anime conveniently spoon-feeds you by having a character describe the scenario out loud afterwards. The usual graduation separation part starts and a heartwarming recollection of past events start to slowly sink into everyone, including you, the viewer, because it's just too damn touching. Ultimately, the ending sends you off with a smile on your face and an impact on your heart that'll stay for a few days.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, the theme of escapism is delivered perfectly, there's no useless characters and everything about the anime is very enjoyable and relatable. Sakurasou is definitely worth a watch, now here's to hoping they kick it Hidamari Sketch style and make season 2 with the new juniors!",

            "content": "After reading what a friend of mine thought about this anime, I decided to put a review here in MAL.\r\nCompared to writing lengthy reviews on deserving anime [whether anime-fans find it helpful or not, well, criticizing anime-fans isn't helpful alright XD], I'll keep this review for this anime short.\r\nWatching 14/24 eps, I want to say I want to take back the time I lost in watching those 14 eps. Ep.4 and it was already dreadful as going to hell's bowels, and I still strived for the other 10 episodes to finally call it quits.\r\nSTORY = 4\r\nThere are numerous and more decent anime than this, likeKaichou wa Maid-sama for example [and the tsunderes which Rie Kugimiya has dubbed, you know their title and that's it].\\n\\n\r\nART = 9\\n\r\nYes, I strongly agree it's the art itself that made Sakura Pet established a MAL rating of 8+. Other than that, it's all hapless.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER = 3\\n\r\nA whiny guy who just can't man-up, and a girl good enough for hentai. Hell, even collaboration-works' hentai-girls have more characterization than Mashiro here. There are ways and creativity to going \"weird\", like Rikka from Chuunibyou, and Fino from Yuushibu; as well as the wacky shoujos from D-Frag~~Shiina Mashiro is just weird enough and good-looking for fap material. Nothing more. \\n\r\nAs for the guy, Kanda, there are better sissy guys than him. Watching Kanda makes Shiro Emiya from Fate/Stay Night a true magnificent hero on the whiny-shounen category.\\n\r\nAlso, there's nothing deep or intriguing on the other characters (Misaki, Jin, etc); smut stories or those silly novels written in Wattpad have the same \"depth\" of characterization they have.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT = 1\\n\r\nI literally find looking at the minute-hand and second-hand of the clock more enjoyable than this. \\n\r\nYou know, I kept looking at the clock, wanting to see when will this certain episode end, what time can I get to the next episode just to get over with this, and after finishing ep.14 I was like~~okay, switch to the next anime on the list.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL = 4\\n\r\nI'll quote what my friend said, she's the one WHO FINISHED watching Sakura Pet after all:\\n\\n\r\n\"It's really dragging, the plot i mean\\n\r\nthe protagonist? what's his name? Kanda? well, he's shit. for I all I know, it goes around and around about his testosterone pride on how he couldn't be successful on anything no matter how he worked hard, unlike the people who surrounded him. He whines a lot, like grow some balls dude. what the actual f*ck. and then he goes around people by taking his frustration out on them? Deal with it. Don't look for f*cking excuses for you to put your blame on them. You can take your sorry of an excuse and leave, or you can swallow your pride and learn how to face reality head on.\\n\r\n-end of rant-\"\\n\\n\r\nYep, that's juz how she worded it so I need not edit the things she said: she's a girl, she finished Sakura Pet, she loves shoujo romcoms like Maid-sama, School Rumble, KyoAni anime, loves AnoHana---and yes, she blurted those words out after finishing Sakurasou no Pet.\\n\\n\r\nAnd why did I even watch this even if I don't like Sakura Pet? It's mainly because of the \"challenge\". Challenge myself to watch this, try to see and keep an OPEN MIND of watching this---just to prove to anime fans or SakuraPet-lovers who MIGHT say \"why don't you watch it?!\" or \"why hate it if you haven't watched it?!\". These kind of statements happen. Well I did watch it. Sadly this anime just didn't work out.\\n\\n\r\nBUT I know a lot of anime-fans out there will watch this for the art and the sexual-innuendo, I can assure that much [and the rape-able main heroine, too].",

            "content": "\u201cTRIGORIN: Yes. Writing is a pleasure to me, and so is reading the proofs, but no sooner does a book leave the press than it becomes odious to me; it is not what I meant it to be; I made a mistake to write it at all; I am provoked and discouraged. Then the public reads it and says: \"Yes, it is clever and pretty, but not nearly as good as Tolstoy,\" or \"It is a lovely thing, but not as good as Turgenev 'Fathers and Sons,'\" and so it will always be. To my dying day I shall hear people say: \"Clever and pretty;clever and pretty,\" and nothing more; and when I am gone, those that knew me will say as they pass my grave: \"Here lies Trigorin, a clever writer, but he was not as good as Turgenev.\u201d\\n\\n\r\n\u201cSORIN. I am going to give Constantine an idea for a story. It shall be called \"The Man Who Wished\u2014L'Homme qui a voulu.\" When I was young, I wished to become an author; I failed. I wished to be an orator; I speak abominably, [Exciting himself] with my eternal \"and all, and all,\" dragging each sentence on and on until I sometimes break out into a sweat all over. I wished to marry, and I didn't; I wished to live in the city, and here I am ending my days in the country, and all. \u201c\\n\r\n-\tChekhov\u2019s The Seagull\\n\\n\r\n\u201cGlenn mortally wounded Wertheimer with his loser, I thought, not because Wertheimer heard this concept for the first time but because Wertheimer, without knowing this word loser, had long been familiar with the concept of loser, but Glenn Gould said the word loser out loud in a crucial moment, I thought. We say a word and destroy a person, although the person we\u2019ve destroyed, at the moment we say out loud the word that destroys him, doesn\u2019t take notice of this deadly fact.\u201d\\n\r\n-\tThomas Bernhard, The Loser\\n\\n\r\n\u201cEvery superior human being will instinctively aspire after a secret citadel where he is set free from the crowd, the many, the majority, where, as its exception, he may forget the rule \u2018man\u2019\u2026 all company is bad company except the company of one\u2019s equals.\u201d\\n\r\n-\tNietzsche, Beyond Good and Evil\\n\\n\r\nI don\u2019t trust geniuses. Neither do I trust the concept of \u2018having a special something\u2019. What we attribute to talent is merely a combination of two things, experience and code. We cannot create anything of significance without having frequent discourse with life. We also cannot create anything of significance without having a crystalized coda as to why we create. I don\u2019t trust \u2018great men\u2019 theories of the world.\\n\\n\r\n\tChekhov\u2019s The Seagull is probably one of my most favorite plays in the world. The story is relatively simple yet also complex, simple in its plot but complex in its execution. It was Chekhov\u2019s first \u2018theater of moods\u2019, a type of theater that focused less on running action, plot arcs, narrative and focused more on the underlying interaction of the moods between characters. It\u2019s a very honest, subtle play. Treplieff, a budding experimental playwright, lives in the country near a lake where he spends the days planning his new plays with his actress friend and lover Nina. The play opens with Treplieff planning a play to show to his mother, a famous actress from Moscow. His mother also brings along her lover, a famous romantic novelist called Trigorin. During the course of the play aesthetic ideals clash with one another, romances are made and broken, and it becomes a great tragedy. Trigorin is the \u2018mainstream\u2019 novelist made cynical by his realization that no matter how famous his works are to the general public, he will never reach the heights of genius as that of other great Russian novelists such as Tolstoy. Treplieff finds himself at odd with his mother because his plays are too daringly experimental for her tastes. Nina (the \u2018seagull\u2019 who wishes to fly from the lake) is a complete idealist that wishes to become a famous actress in Moscow and finds herself falling in love with Trigorin solely because of his status as a \u2018famous person\u2019. \\n\\n\r\n\u201cNINA: You work too hard to realise the importance of your writings. What if you are discontented with yourself? To others you appear a great and splendid man. If I were a writer like you I should devote my whole life to the service of the Russian people, knowing at the same time that their welfare depended on their power to rise to the heights I had attained, and I would harness them to my chariot.\u201d\\n\\n\r\n\tThis occurs in one of the climatic moments of the play, when Nina has a long talk with Trigorin about his fame. She believes him to be an \u2018untouchable\u2019 entity though he firmly denies it. As a result she falls into a self-destructive romance with him. By the end of the play her ideals have changed firmly, as a result of much suffering and hardship.\\n\\n\r\n\t\u201c\u201cNINA: I know now, I understand at last, Constantine, that for us, whether we write or act, it is not the honour and glory of which I have dreamt that is important, it is the strength to endure. One must know how to bear one's cross, and one must have faith. I believe, and so do not suffer so much, and when I think of my calling I do not fear life. \u201c\\n\\n\r\n\tThis statement was revelatory to me. The idea of creation was not distinct from the idea of living. A creator\u2019s \u2018artistic vision\u2019 was not separated from the way he lived, from his own personal ideals. It was not a personal realm that he withdrew himself into to deny life in art but it was a realm where he extended his own life by crystallizing his thoughts and experiences into acts of beauty.\\n\\n\r\n\t\u201cTREPLIEFF: The conviction is gradually forcing itself upon me that good literature is not a question of forms new or old, but of ideas that must pour freely from the author's heart, without his bothering his head about any forms whatsoever.\u201d\\n\\n\r\n\tTreplieff makes this change as well when, after being deserted by Nina, he eventually forges a small name for himself through writing his own novels. He deserts the idea of creating a \u2018grand avant-garde\u2019 and focuses on using the writing process as a way to live. Sadly this realization occurs as a result of much despair and he is irrevocably broken in the process.\\n\\n\r\n\tIf I were to make comparisons though I would think that Misaki or even Mashiro represents Treplieff the most. He is definitely the \u2018genius with a special something\u2019 in the play, being both psychologically off and tempestuous in his emotions and aesthetic ideals. But instead of being lauded by the public, like what happens in Sakurasou, he finds himself decaying in a small countryside. His psychoses make him pathetic and delusional even though they fuel his creative drive. This is Chekhov\u2019s version of the revolutionary talent, an impotent madman with delusions of grandeur. Yet he, along with Nina and Trigorin, are stupendous characters to me. Both Nina and Treplieff are extremely na\u00efve and overabundant with feeling and youthful vigor, which in the end becomes disastrous for both of them. Yet Chekhov doesn\u2019t judge them for it but rather merely shows them as they are; this is his strength as a playwright, to portray rather than moralize. It even depends on which version of the play you watch. They can either be caricatured into great fools too caught up in idealism or beautifully portrayed as youths struggling with their own dreams and life against a massively cruel world that breaks them.\\n\\n\r\n\tTrigorin even regains some of his idealism when he meets Nina, which of course makes things all the worse by the end of the play. Does that make The Seagull cynical in its ideas? That every dream chased can easily be broken? I think the play is much more complicated than that. Even though Treplieff\u2019s play is booed and jeered at in the first act, one of the audience members, a doctor called Dorn, finds himself silently enraptured by the play. Treplieff\u2019s vision managed to reach a single person, and later he actually gets the recognition he deserves, although it is already too late by then.\\n\\n\r\n\tThere is another novel by Thomas Bernhard, definitely the polar opposite of Sakurasou, called The Loser. Bernhard is famously known for his raging anger and spite in his books. His style of writing is usually a ranting stream-of-consciousness filled with general disgust at everything in life. The Loser is about two pianists who make friends with the real life genius pianist Glenn Gould, and how they are destroyed as a result. Gould\u2019s genius becomes too much for one of the characters so much so that he commits suicide, while the other, the narrator who is visiting his funeral, has left piano playing forever. Both of these characters are Rita taken to the extreme. Genius is seen as a monster in The Loser, not a God but a Demon that wrecks the lives of everyone around for the worse. In Sakurasou the talented characters eventually become motivating figures for the rest of the cast. The Loser makes the statement that those with talent are really alien to the \u2018norm\u2019, completely untouchable. Sakurasou portrays them as human gods; they reached their position due to hard work but also due to certain \u2018problems\u2019 which make them alienated but masters at their craft, and they can still be reached but only with tremendous effort on the part of the rest.\\n\\n\r\n\tI don\u2019t trust either The Loser\u2019s view of genius nor do I really trust Sakurasou\u2019s view of it. The Seagull is, to me, the most brilliant and powerful vision of the creative process. It is an act of love but it can also be a self-destroying act, but it is never placed in a sphere away from humanity; in fact to create is an extremely human activity.\\n\\n\r\n\tYet despite my tract on the ideals touted by Sakurasou, I still feel a certain admiration for the show. It\u2019s entirely a light novel rooted in the Coming-of-age or Bildungsroman genre. It has the same atmosphere as stories \u2013 stories like The Magic Mountain or Demian. It has a lesson to impart and it does so with the greatest Romanticism. The characters are brimming full of passionate intensity. Many of the conventions prominent in the medium are still there: The standard Japanese openness to nudity, running gags, romance subplots, cherry-blossom and sunrise scenes. In a way its familiarity can be detrimental to some who feel its too clich\u00e9d, there are too many evocations of Toradora or Clannad like shows, but its flaws are curbed by its pathos and ethos.\\n\\n\r\n\tA flaw that is more glaring to me though, is that we can\u2019t really see the \u2018genius\u2019 of the geniuses in the show. Mashiro seems to be a painter of the Impressionist Romanticist vein like Caspar David Friedrich, J.M.W. Turner or James Whistler, but of course the show glosses over her actual works and proclaims her as a genius. I have nothing wrong with this part, since we can\u2019t expect a light novel to make a masterpiece painting just for the sake of an animated show. Likewise Misaki is sort of a creator like Gundam\u2019s Tomino with a Trigger-esque (as in Imaishi\u2019s new studio, split from Gainax) insanity. Mashiro\u2019s manga is also far from Inio Asano or Chris Ware standard; it seems to be a standard shoujo work. I\u2019m also okay with this part, just some thoughts that entered by head. What I have gripes with is once again what I meant earlier when I said an artist must have \u2018coda\u2019. It\u2019s also the problem when you place \u2018genius\u2019 in a realm away from humanity and nature, like its an alien or divine object that has nothing to do with one\u2019s personal life.\\n\\n\r\n\tEvery work of art has its driving force in the person\u2019s life. Sakurasou\u2019s characters generally see the drive for their creation as \u2018the love of the creative process\u2019. But this love is crystallized in various different forms and ideals rather than just being a force on its own. By this I mean that we can say Richard Wagner created Tristan and Isolde because of his \u2018love of the art\u2019, but this love was crystallized in his Schopenhauerian aesthetic ideology. Dostoyevsky and Tolstoy wrote because of their Christian spirit. Kafka, partially out of therapy due to his overbearing father and the ennui of his life, but also due to his revolutionary ideals about modernity and alienation. The Beat Generation wrote to express individuality and wildness. Proust wrote to cherish his own memories and sensuality. The fact is that a creative person is utterly haunted by his art. His art is not distinct from his life. But generally artists are portrayed in fiction as placing creation in a separate realm (In Sharin no Kuni, Sachi\u2019s arc is pretty much Sakurasou condensed and probably done better, but it stills lacks this aspect). Sakurasou\u2019s characters do much to talk about the will to create but never about the things they actually create, never about why they create. Artists, though they are animated by the Muse, still have a reason for creation, still have something to express. The creators of Sakurasou seem alienated from their art, like it\u2019s only a profession rather than a way of life.  \\n\\n\r\n\u201cTRIGORIN: I see nothing especially lovely about it \u2026 Let us discuss this bright and beautiful life of mine, though. Violent obsessions sometimes lay hold of a man: he may, for instance, think day and night of nothing but the moon. I have such a moon. Day and night I am held in the grip of one besetting thought, to write, write, write! Hardly have I finished one book than something urges me to write another, and then a third, and then a fourth\u2014I write ceaselessly. I am, as it were, on a treadmill. I hurry for ever from one story to another, and can't help myself. Do you see anything bright and beautiful in that? Oh, it is a wild life! Even now, thrilled as I am by talking to you, I do not forget for an instant that an unfinished story is awaiting me. My eye falls on that cloud there, which has the shape of a grand piano; I instantly make a mental note that I must remember to mention in my story a cloud floating by that looked like a grand piano. I smell heliotrope; I mutter to myself: a sickly smell, the colour worn by widows; I must remember that in writing my next description of a summer evening. I catch an idea in every sentence of yours or of my own, and hasten to lock all these treasures in my literary store-room, thinking that some day they may be useful to me. As soon as I stop working I rush off to the theatre or go fishing, in the hope that I may find oblivion there, but no! Some new subject for a story is sure to come rolling through my brain like an iron cannonball. I hear my desk calling, and have to go back to it and begin to write, write, write, once more. And so it goes for everlasting. I cannot escape myself, though I feel that I am consuming my life. To prepare the honey I feed to unknown crowds, I am doomed to brush the bloom from my dearest flowers, to tear them from their stems, and trample the roots that bore them under foot. Am I not a madman? Should I not be treated by those who know me as one mentally diseased? Yet it is always the same, same old story, till I begin to think that all this praise and admiration must be a deception, that I am being hoodwinked because they know I am crazy, and I sometimes tremble lest I should be grabbed from behind and whisked off to a lunatic asylum. The best years of my youth were made one continual agony for me by my writing. A young author, especially if at first he does not make a success, feels clumsy, ill-at-ease, and superfluous in the world. His nerves are all on edge and stretched to the point of breaking; he is irresistibly attracted to literary and artistic people, and hovers about them unknown and unnoticed, fearing to look them bravely in the eye, like a man with a passion for gambling, whose money is all gone. I did not know my readers, but for some reason I imagined they were distrustful and unfriendly; I was mortally afraid of the public, and when my first play appeared, it seemed to me as if all the dark eyes in the audience were looking at it with enmity, and all the blue ones with cold indifference. Oh, how terrible it was! What agony!\u201d\\n\\n\r\nThis is perhaps Trigorin\u2019s best lines in The Seagull. He is haunted by art. It creeps into every moment of his life. The fervent need need need to create, to let loose all the ideas in one\u2019s head on the world. It haunts him to the point of pain and great insecurity. The real love for art is signified not by just talking about the will to create, but by talking about your creation, as if it was already there in your hands, everything it means to you and how it defines your life, even though you have not seen it come into fruition. The impulse to create is the impulse to live, to make something that can be lived greater and better than anything you have lived before.\\n",

            "content": "To start off with, I'd be one of those people who rate generously and completely biased. This would also be the very first review of an anime I'd contribute on MAL.\r\nSakurasou, the one place where the \"outcasts\" and \"geniuses\" of society go, perverts, rebels, famous artists, anything goes. The main focus of this anime was learning a sense of unity, belonging, friendship and life barriers that can be overcome.\r\nWhen your not good at anything and everyone seems better, doesn't it seem better off to never get your hopes up so you'll never be disappointed? The story and plot as a whole brings you along thejourney with all the characters that are incredibly unique and unraveled as the story goes. The characters are each presented with a challenge in their life, a crisis, whether be it producing a game, learning to interact and trust others, or chasing after their dreams and passions.\\n\r\nLike any good anime (at least in my own taste), it has it's touch of romance, it's a thing where after seeing all the episodes you can look back and think, \"Oh, so and so have changed so much because of...blah blah and blah.\"\\n\r\nWhether most people would admit it or not, sometimes in life there are just things that would make you throw your fists in the air and smile from your heart or cry your eyes out from the aching in your chest. That's a constant variable in life, to know when to give up and keep pushing. Sakurasou brings you all the feelings you could imagine, depression, rejection, love, passion, happiness, gratitude, change, relying on others. Truly can't live life to the fullest without experiencing the ups and the downs.\\n\r\nThis wasn't very long compared to other reviews but I feel like I've contributed in my own way to this wonderful series. I enjoyed every minute of it and unlike many other shows, the ending was left open but closed and with a feeling of contentment. Also teaches many important messages. I'd recommend this to anyone with the time to sit down, watch, enjoy, cheer, cry and cheer again.",

            "content": "Sakurasou Pet no Kanojo, my 2nd review for a story-driven anime that was being subjected to the \"generic slice of life\" trope, I'd like to point out that any person who assume things from the get go without actually plunging into it is sort of a blockhead. Viewers shouldn't really judge the show by it's thumbnail cover or trailer pv, since the mission and vital scope of it will be lost or left behind, and neither will it show unless you watch it to the end rather than criticizing it first. The reason i putted this in as an intro cause i have seen somepeople irl and the net who turned this show down since they assumed a wrong basis of the show's premise, which is a let-down, really...\\n\\n\r\nNow moving on, I first like to point out that the art and sound of this anime is spectacular, very bright vivid colours matched with cheerful personalities that definitely lightens me up whenever I watch an episode of it, and the opening/ending soundtrack of this anime is something I rarely skip if I have the spare time to listen to it, i wouldn't want to miss out on a daily serving of sweet dessert if it's given out to me for free, I might as well enjoy every last second of it ;3 \\n\\n\r\nThe characters like I said were very bright and cheerful, all of which are likable yet there are some which i got annoyed a little time to time, I know it's not all about Kanda Sorata & Shiina Mashiro, (aka best Kuudere girl in my book), Nanami, my favorite Kansai girl, Ryuunosuke the hikikomori, and the senpai duo, Misaki and Jin, with all due respect to their relevance to the show, but by annoying I mean mostly the side characters, i know some of them have their own interesting stories to tell but i'm not fond of the fact that they sometimes overshadow the MC's presence in some of the episodes, resulting in me being left in a state of anxiousness, edgy in most cases, I know i'm probably nitpicking by now but I personally enjoy watching a whole episode of just few characters involved in a scenario rather than a whole bunch of all these other side characters trying to squeeze in the same picture, and with that, I wouldn't mind Mashiro initiating her \"Plan C\" on all of them, yea, which is a pretty swell plan if I might say so myself, huehue.. Anyway... enough with my little rant, all in all the main characters were great, along with their quirky, weird behaviours and lovable atmosphere, it's always fun to watch their daily antics and endeavours.\\n\\n\r\nLastly the story... how should i start... i guess an envisioning story about my experience could work.. *clears throat* ehrm, well at first in hindsight it twas' a jolly carnival ride, with different places to visit and different people to meet, I enjoy them so much that I sometimes ride the same ride over and over again, mostly due to the amount of fun that I was having, and then suddenly I stumble upon a certain peculiar yet camouflaged attraction, the type that once you're in it, you can never go back the way you came from, it goes deeper as it goes on, and upon reaching the final stretch, a mysterious assailant struck me ping hard on my head, that moments later my sensory started to react and I realized I was induced with a shock of emotional trail of beautiful thorny petals drifting along my brain, amplifying little by little while receiving a mix of euphoria and nostalgia that subsequently faded away slowly by slowly... At the end of the tunnel, i went out, shook my head, and transitioned back to reality! \\n\r\nBased on my theory that the likelihood of this happening to you, is either you didn't expected any of it, and was taken aback surprisingly from the string of events that transpired, or you half-expected it, but a part of you keep on denying that it will not happen but still happened anyway, mm.. the above paragraph was just a dumb metaphor so no need to rationalize as such, I wrote everything just to describe the feeling i had while experiencing the show and at the same time trying really hard to avoiding any spoiler reviews for it :) \\n\\n\r\nAll in all, Sakurasou Pet no Kanojo, I had a bittersweet ride but thorough enjoyment all throughout the series, hopefully for you too!! ^-^",

            "content": "tldr no spoiler - its like honey and clover, but good.\r\nIf you liked honey and clover you probably wont like this show because this show takes the same concept and actually makes it watchable and entertaining. i really didnt expect to enjoy this show this much but i flew through the episodes. if i had to compare the two sensations, honey and clover would be  like my deceased grandmother pulling out my pubes one by one using her \"homemade tweezers\". not that bad? females have to do this all the time? her \"homemade tweezers\" just happen to be her dentures.  SnKnP was morelike when i spread peanut butter on my balls so my dog; Buddy, would lick it off. It was pleasurable and enjoyable.\\n\\n\r\nIt is however somewhat comparable to the GOAT anime toradora. both have such a strong cast of characters that are explored with good story telling and depth drawing the viewer into the show making them empathise with said characters. each member has his/her own charm that i thoroughly enjoyed. It was one of the very rare (talking like entei, suicune shit) animes where i liked every single character and felt that i had a good understanding of their viewpoint. They were relatable. More amazingly, it did this without being boring. Outstanding.\\n\r\nTo compare the two, Its like smoking weed with your friends friend who swears hes a total stoner  and gets high all the time but is way too obvious that its his first time smoking weed and he gets way to into it. youre still high as fuck but theres this annoying fuck telling you how stoned he is every minute. that is SnKnP.\\n\r\nToradora is like smoking crack for the first time at a private box at a miku hatsune concert whilst you drink weaboo tears out of a champagne glass as your dick is being sucked my kim jong un.\\n\\n\r\nIt wasnt perfect tho. I couldnt quite place it as high as i wanted to despite having a warm fuzzy feeling after each episode ( a result of the anime, not because of my 300 pound physique of straining my heart). \\n\r\nThe main character is such a fucking whiteknight sometimes. it really angers my neckbeard and i admit i was so frustrated my fedora tipped off my head and i knocked multiple bags of doritios onto my newly drycleaned waifu pillow.\\n\r\nThe ending wasnt really what i wanted out of it. I want closure at the end of an anime. I dont want my donger half teased into a romance that just turns out to grow and develop and just abruptly stop. He has two great waifu's that want his donger and ends up with none. He doesnt need to work hard, he just needs to get a brain. The ending few episodes are definitely a let down for me.\\n\r\nMusic game wasnt that strong. All the opening and endingthemes for this show were really great and went with the theme of the show really well. It was more the in between which was lacking. Some emotional scenes and happy scenes could have been really improved with a better score.\\n\\n\r\nThis review turned out to be far more serious and heart felt that i originally intended (for me anyway) but i think this is a testament to how much i really enjoyed this cartoon. Damn son, where'd you find this?",

            "content": "Sakurasou no Pet na Kanojo tells us the story of Sorata, who was thrown out of his high school dorm for keeping a cat and had to move to Sakurasou a house where all the problematic students live. There he has to take care of Shiina, an eccentric girl prodigy, that came from England to the Japan to draw manga. At first he hates it there and he only wishes to get back to his previous home, but he slowly starts to form strong bonds with the other inhabitants and realises he belongs there.\r\nThis is a show that I have been subconsciously avoiding for quitea while, because normally I am not one for romantic comedies, so going in I was sceptical at how would an anime fare at this genre, but as I found out my fears were completely unfounded. This show manages to balance comedy, romance and drama unbelievably well and that combined with one of the most interesting and diverse cast of characters makes for a truly great anime. One thing that especially impressed me was the anime\u2019s willingness to tackle failure which is in itself extremely rare nowadays.\\n\\n\r\nWell now I am going to dig into the characters a bit more. The thing I found especially great about this show is the astonishing amount of character development. They all go through a lot in the span of one year and they are all slowly growing up and becoming better people. Also the back stories of everyone are presented so we can understand the motives behind their actions. All of this is best seen in the evolution of Shiina. She starts of as a completely eccentric painter that is unable to understand what is going on around her, but she slowly starts to get used to the outside world. The other characters are also essential to the success of the show, there is not one that I felt was unnecessary.\\n\\n\r\nThe audio-visual side of the anime is great as well even though it is not exceptional. The openings and endings are all completely enjoyable and they convey the positive atmosphere present in the anime. The soundtrack throughout the show manages to capture the mood perfectly, but rarely shines through enough to become a highlight. The animation is professionally done and can be stunning at times but it is rarely awe-inspiring. The best part of the animation are Shiina's paintings and manga drawings which are all extremely beautiful and fit extremely well into the anime. \\n\\n\r\nAll of these positives are shown especially well in the end of the anime where it really shines, the art is amazing the story is touching the characters shine as bright as ever and in my opinion is one of the best endings I have ever seen, especially if here was a second season, which now seems unlikely, but is still possible. What else can I say, if you haven\u2019t seen this already what are you waiting for, start watching it now, you won\u2019t be disappointed.",

            "content": "It's difficult to pair Clannad/After Story with another anime series...Kanon 2006 would be only natural, but its basically Clannad-lite; still great, but only watch it as a supporting series next to Clannad.\r\nBut I think I recently found another series which mirrors the emotional onslaught of Clannad...but does it in another way. Whilst Clannad deals with more...imaginative or dream-like subjects like Japanese legends of spirits, The Pet Girl of Sakurasou is rooted deeply within real human experiences...so real, in fact, you cannot but feel for the characters. (Well...unless you are one of those ivory tower kids who lived your life eating from diamond-studded silver platters...Why don'tyou go and watch Ouran to learn some decency before coming back here.)\\n\\n\r\nGranted, the fan service in this show can be a bit too much SOMEtimes (NOTE episode 7 bath scene...skip 10:30 - 12:25 if you want to escape the worst of it...but you will miss the humorous dialogue)...but the humour in this show are beyond gold, and they don't always rely on near-naked situations...Many of them rely on clashing personalities of the characters, the best being Sorato with his sister Yuuko and Mashiro. Watch until Episode 10...and guess where the show would go next (hint: its way more depressing AND inspiring.)\\n\\n\r\nOk, Sakurasou review time. It's a series that BEGS for a sequel (because it was so good), but is already complete in its story arcs. It follows characters who live in Sakura dorm, a place where the high school they attend would separate 'problem' students from the regular dorm. What we get is a group of students who are unique, quirky, likeable and RELATABLE, and we get to experience their everyday struggles. \\n\\n\r\nSo about these characters...one is a hyperactive, bright girl who lives and breathes animation, plus a young, celebrity artist who might be brilliant with a paintbrush, but useless at everything else. Among them are 3 more: a normal boy who was placed in Sakura dorm for keeping cats (against school rules); who fights with jealousy and envy when he witnesses the geniuses around him at work. Another is somewhat a playboy who wants to live up to his true love's high achievements before admitting that love, and a workaholic (but otherwise still normal) girl who wants to become an voice actress.\\n\\n\r\nOk, I separated the main cast into 2 main groups...because the series relies on this skill/ability distance between them to deliver the story: one which centres around the conflict between 'talent' and 'hard work'. The former group are geniuses in their craft, all of which are born with talents; the latter group being those who wishes to achieve their goals through sheer will. Life is unfair to them, as their hard work were repeatedly ignored, this being completely relatable to me. \\n\\n\r\nLife is not fair. True words that no one wants to believe, and work hard to avoid submitting to; the raw human emotions of jealousy, doubt and fear of failure are all dealt with surprisingly objectivity and no-so-heart-warming ways in this show, but enough amount of silver-lining around these sickening grey clouds were provided to allow us some breathing room for hope to prosper (urgh...I think I just vomited at my own words).\\n\\n\r\nWhat I find most striking about this series is Mashiro: the genius artist. Her character as a quiet girl with an born inability to properly express her feelings, makes it even more touching when her usually expressionless face leak tears, or a tiny twitch of her lips, which soon reveals a smile. \\n\\n\r\nFor that perfect final cry-fest...just you wait till episode 23.\\n\\n\r\nPersonally, since I have no knowledge of the Japanese language; save for a few phrases that are all too commonly used in anime; I have no reliable ground to judge the Japanese cast: but I can confirm that all the voices gel well with their respective characters; the emotionally distant Mashiro to the hyperactive Misaki. Perhaps the only disappointing aspect is the rather conventional rom-com/SOL soundtrack, which, while served their purpose, does not attempt to do anything more; something I demand for all film music and series soundtrack.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation in this series is sort of like Clannad-lite...but its unique colour palette of more bright colours and sequences of blending animated oil PAINTINGs are absolutely PERFECT. If you split the art & animation into different aspects for more fair judgement: what this show truly excels at is when comedy comes into question: a great show of unrestrained hyper-active character facial and body language truly makes those scenes enjoyable to watch. Background art is standard fare. With more regular scenes such as talking heads and walking, animation quality tends to dip down; albeit barely registering to a regular viewer to become an nuisance.\\n\\n\r\nI recommend this series with the same enthusiasm as Clannad/After Story; both masterful in their own ways; yet both are impossible to rate above one another for me. \\n",

Honestly i would have dropped this anime pretty quick if i didn't find it so funny, that really was it saving grace. Coming up to the end they really mix some heavy drama which didn't hurt but after the show beingso light hearted and chill to super heavy and almost sad at parts, it was just a pretty fast transition. As far as the story goes it wasn't fantastic and didnt really have anything to keep making you want to watch the next episode (apart from the latter half of the show with the heavy drama). \\n\\n\r\nShould you watch this anime? This is a hard one to call, i really enjoyed but i can see why a lot of people would be put off by the first half of the show. Id give it a trial run, if you can make it though the first few episodes and still want to watch on you will not be disappointed as the story does get a little better and more interesting.         \\n\r\nHope my review helped \\n\r\nMurphy",

            "content": "(This review may contain spoilers)\r\nStory: 9/10\r\nSakurasou No Pet Na Kanajo is a story about a boy who adopts pets and takes care of a talented artist. It is the very definition of a Slice of Life mix School mix Romance anime and does it very well. The story folds well together and develops the characters as it goes along. The story was mainly continuous yet it was episodic between each main story. Most of the story was original, except for one of the continuous storyline, but with each new episode comes a new fresh story that is completely unpredictable, This originality is what differentiates thisanime from the rest. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nThere honestly isn\u2019t much to say about the art other than the fact that it was smooth and wasn\u2019t a pain to my eye. It was actually quite pleasing and to me it has a high quality and due this is one of the reasons I continued watching it after the 1st episode. The shades were natural and the backgrounds were beautifully drawn and breathtaking; however, it may be too \u201cshiny\u201d for certain people, but that\u2019s what makes the anime so memorable. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nThe music and soundtrack was memorable and unique, catchy even. The special Christmas episode even had a Christmas special opening to it that fit the theme very well. The music doesn\u2019t just act as a background but rather absorbed me into the scenes. The voice actors were extraordinarily well casted. With Ai Kayano voicing Mashiro with her soothing voice and Matsuoka Yoshitsugu voicing Kanda Sorata, there couldn\u2019t be a more fitting choice. Even the supporting characters had excellent voice casting such as Takamori Natsumi with her sharp yet energetic voice fitting the bubbly nature of Kamiisuga Misaki. With these elements combined, it was an easy decision to give the sounds 10/10.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters : 9/10\\n\\n\r\nThough the characters may seem simple and obvious, the whole story is far deeper, such as Rita\u2019s jealousy towards Mashiro and Jin\u2019s feelings for Misaki, the relationships go further than what meets the eye.  The developments for the characters made it heartwarming and pull my heartstring as I watch the characters grow and graduate and it is due to this unbelievably realistic relationships and developments that I gave it 10/10\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nThe anime made me laugh, cry and empathize with the characters. The repetitive comedic skit such as \u201cPlan C\u201d made me laugh without fail every time and just like most school genre anime, the students come to an end and graduate. This in episode 23 is probably the best episode Ive ever seen as it brings out the music and casting, the story and scenes that will etch in my head. Hence if I were ever to be asked whether I enjoyed this anime, my answer would be yes I f***ing have. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion, I have no regrets giving this anime a 10/10 with their original plots, well done music and casting, memorable art, realistic character development and unforgettable comedy skits.  \\n",

The idea to make a romance/comedy in a mix dormitory is really a perfect match.\r\nIs really bad thethe OP/ED not sing by a famous singer like LiSA or CHiCO with HoneyWorks which will suit perfect for this kind of anime, but the current singer put a really good work on the song.\\n\\n\r\nEvery residents of the Sakurasou have uniqe personality, especially the main Heroine that basically the main reason why I watch this anime.\\n\\n\r\nIn this type of anime there is dark times and there is fun times, when dark times happen I oftenly wish to get it over as soon as posibble but when fun times happen I wish it never ends, so its kind a balanced.\\n\\n\r\nOverlall:\\n\\n\r\n\"10/10 will watch again.\"\\n\\n\r\nIf you didn't watch Sakurasou yet, trust me you wasting your live.\\n\r\nIf anyone that sick to wait for a second season to come, I recommend to read the light novel version, it got really good ending.",

            "content": "This was the very first Anime series I watched all the way through. It's the series that has so much right about it, that it completely changes your opinion of it over the course of the series.\r\nStory:\r\nWhat starts off as a quirky Slice of Life series with bizarre characters, soon becomes a heartwarming and emotionally driven series with real character and heart. Sorata is a guy who has let his compassion for cats get him kicked out of the regular dorms and into the infamous 'Sakura Hall'. From that description, it seems like it's going to be a reoccurring joke and plot-line that he wantsto get out of the crazy dorm, and for the first few episodes, this is the case, but it soon becomes an Anime that is rich with beautiful messages and cleverly written stories. The characters go through big personal changes in the stories, which then effect everything around them, including other characters around them and plot elements. \\n\\n\r\nThere are big emotional scenes that almost brought me to tears. Every character goes through their own story arcs, even if some of them are smaller than others, but they are vital to the story's development, which isn't the most detailed story, but the way the story develops is very relatable to anyone who went through college (university over where I live). Even if you didn't go to College at all, the situations these characters go through will very similar to a lot of people.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\\n\r\nThe art in this Anime is beautiful, and is full of plenty of detail. The style is simple, but isn't too overly simple that it seems childlike. it contains lots of vibrant colors and has some beautiful lighting effects. I won't spoil anything about the story, but there's an episode where it's raining for most of the episode, and this is one of the most beautiful episodes art wise. The rain added a beautiful contrast to the usual style of bright colors, with it's muted and dreary color scheme. All of the girls are also extremely beautiful and cute, even for normal Anime and Manga standards, with big colorful eyes and lovely smiles that will make you fall in love with them even more.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\\n\r\nThe opening and closing songs of each episodes are your standard J-Rock/J-Pop type of songs that Anime is known for. They are very catchy however, and I had them stuck in my head for hours afterwards. During the episodes, the Music used is mostly soft, melodic Piano based music that really helps during the more emotional scenes in the series. I would feel the for the characters even without the music, but I feel the music just adds that extra little something that makes the scenes even better\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\\n\r\nLike most of the Anime I've watched, the characters are the best element of this show. At the start of the series, I thought the characters were exactly what i was expecting from this kind of show. You have the main male character (basically your troubled easily agitated 'hero') you have a a quirky kinda crazy girl (who is the point of most of early episodes' jokes and physical gags) and you have the quiet 'normal' sweetheart. The other main character is also socially deprived and doesn't understand how a lot of things are done, but she's an incredibly talented artist.\\n\\n\r\nIf the series were like this all the way through, I would have probably dropped it early on, but towards the 11th or 12th episode, the story begins to shift and the characters begin to go through massive developments that made me go from \"Ok, so I like this and character, but I'm not really keen on them\" and at the end of the series, I ended up thinking \"I really like all of them now\". All of the characters made me wish that they existed in real life, and that I wish I were friends with them. \\n\\n\r\nThere are emotional and near heartbreaking events the characters go through that really test the viewer's emotions and also test the characters relationships with each other. They fight and argue with one another, but it's the ultimate bond of friendship that keep them together for so long, and this is really why I love this show so much. Everything they go through is genuine and by the end of it, I didn't have a favorite character, but instead saw the appeal of all the characters.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\\n\r\nThis was one of the most enjoyable shows I've ever seen. i started watching one episode a night, but around the mid way point of the show, I bumped it up to 2 episodes a night, with last night watching the final 3 episodes. I was eager to find out what happens next as I saw what happening to these characters over the course of 24 episodes.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\\n\r\nThis was a masterpiece series that really tackles all the struggles that college students might go through at that age. I loved every character and they go through some very tough events. But it's their friendship with every each other that really makes this series and makes it one of my favorite shows ever",

            "content": "ok first things first............this is not a perfect anime in anyway and its wrongfully classed as a rom com...its not its a slice of life or becoming story.....in the anime there is romance but its just not that great\r\nI make this review straight after finishing what took me about...1-2 weeks to finish this 24 episode anime and im extremely glad I did and do recommend you watch if you havent already watched it....\r\nThe story as a whole isnt that great....its a boy Sorata  who is sent to live in a dorm (Sakurasou dorm obviously) and its a dorm for troubled youths because he canthave cats in the normal dorm... (ok first bad point why are these kids troubled??? ...jin is literally a perfectly normal guy who acts as the big brother in the whole anime giving advice to the stupid MC,  Misaki senpai is a bit crazy...akasaka is a computing genius who refuses to go to a school because hes too smart..shiro who joins basically has the mental age of an 8 year old and nanami who joins is perfectly normal but she joins to alleviate her money issues)....calling them \"troubled youths\" is wrong but it is touted in the later episode that they were sent there not to disturb the art degrees of the other kids???? whatever honestly the story of this is not great and thats not the reason you should watch this anime\\n\\n\r\nThe reason we call it a slice of life anime is that it follows the main character Sorata as he goes through various problems compounded not only by the fact he has to help the mentally challenged Mashiro who can't do simple tasks by herself....but also because we find out that she is a insanely genius artist who can draw and paint to a level where she is already world renowned at her age. \\n\\n\r\nThe main draw of this anime IS NOT THE STORY....its the emotional hardships that the characters go through with us the audience willing them to make it through...however this anime generally throws that back in our face at each and every turn so...literally nothing works out for anybody...but i dont really have a problem with that because it was dealt with pretty well...and let me just say the graduation episode (23) was unbelievable...not only because you couldn't tell that it would happen but just because of the emotions showed by each of the voice actors in that one episode you literally felt like you were there willing the characters on (in particular misaki senpai shined with her speech).\\n\\n\r\nThe emotional scenes were extremely well done and for me the 2 characters you really really needed to hold this anime together were Jin and Nanami....without these 2 it just would have gone from an 8 to a 0.8...........Jin brought about the maturity and advice needed to keep Soratas ridiculous outbursts in check (Sorata was a absolute d**k to mashiro at times for literally no fault of her own just because he felt sorry for himself) and Nanamis understanding, hard work, cuteness and her actual love for Sorata (unlike mashiros.........well I have literally no clue what mashiro was to Sorata because she cant show her feelings and it feels like throughout the show that Sorata has no feelings what so ever for Mashiro so ye I dont get it.....and for those who have read the LN will attest that the ending of the LN is so so so so so bad that im glad there's no season 2 as id hate it). But ye Nanami brought about a sense of realism and actual depth to the emotional scenes in the show which generally involved her and Sorata.\\n\\n\r\nNow heres the ridiculous part and why i downgraded the story score....the first is a smaller reason and its surrounding Chihiro sensei and Fujisawa...they had a very big opportunity to develop the background and character of chihiro sensei because you can tell she cared alot for these kids and tried her hardest to do what she could for them....but instead of letting us know what shes been through (with Fujisawa in the past) as well as what shes gone through for the kids, the show just hints at it and leaves the rest to the imagination hence why at the end her character becomes far more forgettable then she should have been. For instance by her saying \"i have to go to a meeting i really dont want to\" and we find out that she stood up for Mashiro saying it would make no difference where she lives.....or how she pretends to go austrailia but really is having the construction workers come to review the building....or even how fujisawa talks about a girl he used to love (we know its chihiro but why are we not told anymore about it)....and even just how fujisawa randomly always turned up when events were over but wanted to help like...were they trying to just make him useless or something??? i have no idea\\n\\n\r\nThe second is the biggest reason and it involves Nanami.....look if your going to have a MC end up with someone you make them have some commonalities and reasons as to why they should end up together....you don't just cop out and make the most compatible girl (Nanami) unable to profess her love for the MC so that eventually he no longer cares about her and just ends up with the other girl. For those saying they love mashiro....look she was a autistic beautiful and supremely talented girl........however that just shows how different and opposite she is to Sorata, who even stated multiple times that the fact that he and Nanami had to work hard (and together all the time might i add) and Mashiro just excelled naturally at any designing she did made him hate her. Now i have to make the connection to Nisekoi here, in Nisekoi the ending situation is similar but done in the RIGHT way....you may say \"oh but he ends up with the other girl who isnt his first and main love\" yes but the reasoning's as to why he ends up with Chitoge and not Onodera can be seen from the beginning, him and Chitoge have alot in common, they both care and protect each other, they both come from similar backgrounds and have been friends as kids and they both stuck up for each other when needed most....see where i'm going with this??????????? this is what Nanami and Sorata did for each other .................Mashiro and Sorata had nothing between each other...everything was just Sorata helping her because she was a autistic child minded girl ...and their personalities were so completely different it was embarrassing. The fact that the show strives to not have Nanami and Sorata together is a travesty and a ridiculous choice which can not be highlighted enough.\\n\\n\r\nSound: the sounds with the emotional scenes went together perfectly....however can't say i was much of a fan of any of the beginning or ending songs and some of the stuff was forgettable soon as you hear it....so 7 for that\\n\\n\r\nArt: Really liked the style of art, very colourful and the paintings (in particular during the game demo) were awesome and really well done...though at times i did think that a bit of the art looked a bit dated (though i may have just been spoilt too much by the garden of words..my god that is beautiful). So 8.5\\n\\n\r\nTo summarise......There's too many screw ups in the story to call this a perfect anime and giving it a 10 your not being subjective enough to the anime (or your just overwhelmed by the incredible emotional scenes and forget the rest of the crap which you sat through)....destroying one of the best characters in the show (Nanami), having a main character with ridiculous outbursts, and not developing Chihiro sensei enough bring the main score down. However I thoroughly enjoyed watching and was gripped to find out what would happen at various times as the endings of some episodes really make you want more, a testament to the brilliance of the acting and you really do want it to work out for the characters in the end. \\n\\n\r\nOverall id give it a score of 7.9.......I would definitely recommend a watch....however maybe the anime directors just stuck to the LN too much and would have been better off doing what Akame Ga Kill did and changing the ending more to how they wanted it.\\n\\n\r\nSeason 2???? after reading the LN??? no thanks don't screw up my enjoyment any more then you have done by bringing that piece of crap into existence\\n\\n\\n\\n",

I recommend watching this anime over, you will understand it more and it gives you more enjoyment watching the characters and the story develop. I would rate this anime 100 out of 10 because it actually taught me to be more determined and develop as a person. I wish there will be a second season of this incredible anime or at least some OVAs or maybe even a movie, who knows maybe they are making a movie.\r\n Note: there could've been less drama and more character bonding scenesor something like that.",

            "content": "I can't say that I'm a huge fan of all anime as Japanese culture isn't something that is easily accepted to a person who has been raised by Western culture. However, despite the generic ecchi-esque nature to this show as well as the slight innuendos that is frowned upon, I was still able to love this slice of life series. \r\nI actually skimmed the entirety of the first episode and was begrudgingly attracted to the show because of the incredibly awkwardness of the first episode at the very end. I thought the character interactions were hilarious and quite interesting even though it's a very dulland overused approach to introducing characters. Everything about the start of this show screams that it's already been done, but as soon as you hit episode 3 you start to recognize the underlying themes past the romantic aspect of the series. \\n\\n\r\nThe most satisfying feeling of watching an anime is when you're able to empathize deeply with a character even though it is fiction. This is why I think that love is such an easy and cliche method to elicit audience empathy. However, most animes don't emphasize the realism that exists in the world today while Sakurasou does beautifully. Although there are remnants of a slight harem around the character Kanda Sorata; the more profound themes of the series becomes much more relevant to the audience and you start to build a deep connection to each character while watching the series. \\n\\n\r\nFailure is something that is used as a catalyst to allow for the protagonist to grow as a person in most anime. Usually people have the tunnel vision thinking that mistakes and failures are steps towards success which is true in many cases, but that isn't to say that there are people who will never truly succeed in life. Sakurasou addresses the dark truth that sometimes your best isn't or won't ever be good enough. This contrast to the way that hard work is usually portrayed gives an intriguing look at the anime as something more than just a happy go lucky type of work. \\n\\n\r\nI was extremely fortunate to come across this rom-com and connected on a much deeper level than I have from other shows. The characters are developed extremely well and relating to each one is incredibly easy. I think the comedy is a bit unoriginal and at times repetitive, but nonetheless Mashiro Shiina provides more than enough to enjoy the series. \\n\\n\r\nThis is my first time writing a review and I think that I would most definitely recommend this show to all my peers and friends because it's a very easy watch and it'll keep you hooked.",

It was inspiring to the point where I started doing university work at 2 at night and I think of rewatching it from time to time just to remind myself of the feeling it gave me! The story is simple but yet amazing and very relatable (although not to the extremes show in it). It made me feel for the characters, holding my breath every time they were facing a difficulty and at the same time made me laugh outloud when they were having a good time! As you have probably guessed, it hasits ecchi moments but they are not much and become gradually less and less as the anime progresses. I am not going to do any deeper explanations on why I like the anime because in my opinion those extensive reviews ruin the fun of the anime, not to mention that most of them are written by people far too crittical for their own good.",

            "content": "I am going to preface this by stating that I have never written a review for anything before, let alone an anime. But, I feel this anime deserves it. Please excuse the format I am going to write this review in, because I am just going to put my thoughts done. Thank you. \r\n     Sakurasou starts off very mediocre, in my opinion. It establishes its characters somewhat quickly in the beginning, and it was very clear that a few of these characters were going to follow some typical anime cliches. I won't say who or what,but you will understand if/when you watch it. \\n\\n\r\n     Being someone who has watched tons of anime (more than I'd probably like to admit, my personal list doesn't cover everything I have seen), I thought knew exactly where the anime was going from the first episode. I thought it was going to be some typical teenage romance anime, and even though those aren't my cup of tea, I trudged through it just because I hate dropping anime and a friend profusely recommended it. So fine. I'll get through it.\\n\\n\r\n     But somewhere along the ride, I started to become interested in the show. I don't know when, but I noticed I actually started to like the characters. I noticed that, in each of their own ways, they were charming. And, as sappy as this sounds, I thought I saw a little bit of me in each character. I noticed that this anime somehow sucked me in. I started to feel how the characters felt, as if I'd been in their shoes. Because I have. \\n\\n\r\n     But now I wonder if my review/rating of this anime is actually influenced by my past experiences and feelings. I believe the answer is no. While I do seem to feel a personal connection to the anime, I don't feel as if my feelings affect my rating. \\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed this anime.\\n\r\nThe story is good. \\n\r\nThe art is great.\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is good.\\n\r\nThe characters, are, however, at times, lackluster. Which is what keeps me from giving them a 9, or a \"Great\". The MC seems to suffer from a typical illness in anime I like to call \"Moronitis\". He at times suffers from cliches, and will go on a rant/get angry and take it out on somebody else, but here's what I think makes up for MOST of that. He realizes his mistakes. He (albeit very slowly at times) will admit or notice he's wrong. \\n\\n\r\n     So, overall, why did I give this anime a 9. Because, when I think of this anime, I think \"great\". Because that's what it was for me. I may have also given this a 9 because best girl loses. And towards the end, in a scene between two of the main MC's, something that made me almost think I was watching a KyoAni anime happened. \\n\\n\r\n    And with that, I think I have said all I have needed to say. Go try it out.",

            "content": "Sakurasou no Pet na Kanojo is a very interesting rom-com slice of life to give a try. One of the best anime in these genres. Favorite anime ever. It introduced me to the world of anime. \r\nStory 9.5/10:\r\nWhy do I give a 9.5 to the story when the anime is a rom-com? Sakurasou does an excellent development when we talk about its story. At first, It can be seen as a clich\u00e9 anime with nothing new to show. As the story progress, its notable the development the story has. Drama scenes, comedy ones and obviously romance ones transform the perspective of a simple story toa very interesting and innovative story as it has 24 episodes. Believe me, when you watch the first 5 episodes, you won\u2019t be able to drop it. You want to know what\u2019s happening next.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation/Art 10/10:\\n\r\nThe animation in Sakurasou is completely amazing. It uses very colorful colors being very different from the rest of the animes. There are moments when you are amazed about the good animation it has. I personally love the design of all the main characters (Mashiro, Sorata, Nanami, Misaki...). The characters are very well designed. In general, Sakurasou does an excellent work when it comes to talk about art/animation.\\n\\n\r\nMusic/Sound: 10/10\\n\r\nWhen it comes to the music, Sakurasou openings and endings suit a lot with the thematic of the anime. At first, you may think that the music is generic/normal but then you watch the anime you discover the feels and story behind them. The music contrasts in evoking our feels, so when you finish the anime you can listen to them again and never get bored. Sequence of images is done beautifully, to show us the care they put in animation and characters.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters 10/10:\\n\r\nThis is the strongest point of the anime. The creator of this anime is such a incredible creative guy to imagine these characters. Characters are introduced as the story progresses. Character development is what impresses from this show. Every single main character has a development in the anime. They present the story and some sad moments where they are through hard times and how they feel with the other talented guys. This is the case of Sorata, a guy who hasn\u2019t a special talents and he is a hard-working guy trying to make a videogame. He goes through failure and he is frustrated by how the other members of Sakurasou reach their goals because of how talented they are. I like all the seiyuus (voices) of the show; they fit correctly with each characters and give them something unique to stand out.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 10/10:\\n\r\nHow can I say I didn\u2019t enjoy this anime if I watched in two days? As I said before, this an anime that has a generic introduction, but as the story progresses you want to know what is going to happen next. The funny, sad and romances moments are done correctly and you will enjoy almost all of them.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 10/10:\\n\r\nOverall, Sakurasou no Pet na Kanojo is not an anime that you can\u2019t forget to watch. It is a must watch if you are searching for an anime with good romance, slice of lice moments, comedy and a little bit of drama. It is a complex combination with a low start that ends up a little bit open but fine. A masterfully anime that is rarely seen in its genre. I would recommend you a lot to watch it.\\n\\n\r\nLeave me your feedback and critics. Don\u2019t be so rude it\u2019s my first review. I decided to do it because it became my favorite anime.\\n",

            "content": "First time I saw the title I think it\u2019s kind of anime which telling something about animal. I thought I was correct because the main char made some busy with a cat at the first episode. I continued watching this series every week until I realized that my assumption isn\u2019t true at all. Yup\u2026 the story was developing so much until it becomes another mainstream harem anime. Before I give to you all my opinion I would like to serve some synopsis about Sakurasou no Pet na Kanojo.\r\nKanda Sorata is just an ordinary high schooler who loves cats so much. Unfortunately his kindness to acat consequences him into some trouble. He was banned by school principal from staying in general student dormitory. He must stay in a certain strange mixed gender dormitory named Sakurasou. Well\u2026Sakurasou is a unpretentious dorm with several troublesome students who live into it. Live in Sakurasou is just like disgrace for other general students since Sakurasou is popular with disobedient inhabitant. Although he lives in the strange community like Sakurasou he still can be grateful because he can live with all of his dearest cat. The white one is named Hikari by him.\\n\r\nThere\u2019re other inhabitants in Sakurasou. First is girl named Misaki. She is third year and it means she is Kanda\u2019s senior in school. She is really cheerful person who often does many weird things like discards her underwear into Kanda\u2019s room, wears a lame cosplay suits, plays video games with him until dawn, etc. Actually she is genius student who got a high score in many times before when she was still in middle school. She\u2019s in love with another Sakurasou\u2019s inhabitant named Jin. He is her childhood friend. Second is a mysterious boy named Ryuunosuke. He\u2019s often called \u2018dragon\u2019 by Misaki because his name contains a word \u2018Ryuu\u2019 which means dragon in English. Ryuunosuke\u2019s face never revealed at the beginning of first season of this anime. He fends on himself at his room and never goes out even for school. Maybe he isn\u2019t otaku who likes to stay in the room in a long time for many useless things. But the fact is true that he\u2019s a computer genius. Third is a glassed gentleman boy named Jin. He is harem-master. He can easily beat women heart and then dating them. He was dating Misaki\u2019s sister in the first time but all of that is just a lie. He has been crushed at Misaki since they\u2019re kid. And the last one is Kanda\u2019s female teacher called Chihiro. She is alcohol maniac and hasn\u2019t married yet. She has a lot of bad manners. In the other hand actually she is really wise teacher who often gives Kanda many advices.\\n\\n\r\nThe story developed when Kanda met the newbie in the Sakurasou. She\u2019s Shiina Mashiro. She\u2019s blond haired woman with genius ability in art. She\u2019s well know painter in English who often paints many masterpiece art. But she has bad behavior in social life that she cannot take her own necessity like picking clothes, wearing pants, studying, etc. But it looks like she never studies because she is genius. Then Kanda is ordered to do all of Mashiro\u2019s necessary. When he realized Shiina\u2019s geniuses he started to think for himself about what talent that he had. After thinking for a moment he supposed to make some game software. He started to learn about how to make it. He get some help from Ryuunosuke who has mastered a computer things for long time ago. Then he decided to apply for some game software contest which was held by a certain company. Unfortunately it\u2019s too bad. He failed the competition and his game was rejected. He had some depression because of that. Luckily he has friends in Sakurasou who always support him. And then he tried to promote another his game concept. Eventhough he still didn\u2019t make it as the result. Someone named Rita tells him to not get along with Shiina. Since her geniuses can beat him down even she doesn\u2019t want it. It\u2019s a big gap after all.\\n\\n\r\nStory continued with the appearance of last newcomer of Sakurasou. She is Aoyama. She is Kanda\u2019s classmate as well. The love story developed between Kanda, Aoyama and Shiina. Shiina and Aoyama clearly have a crush on Kanda. But it seems like Kanda have a confusion at they two. There\u2019re any proofs that actually Kanda likes Shiina in several scenes but Kanda\u2019s also blushing when Aoyama was in his side. So I rather call it complicated.\\n\\n\r\nHere\u2019s my opinion. I would like to show my opinion as plus and minus analysis. I think I will say it from the minus of this anime\\n\r\nMinus :\\n\r\n-\tTo be honest this movie isn\u2019t more than mainstream harem anime. It means a lot of ecchi things are showed as long as two season in this anime. So if you ecchi manic I really recommend this for you. Since I\u2019m not good at something like that.\\n\r\n-\tThe biggest moral value in this anime, the gap between someone genius and general, isn\u2019t concentrated well. I think it would be a great anime if the struggle of Kanda Sorata had been more shown in the order to shrink the gap between him and Shiina. Since they\u2019re a couple of lover.\\n\r\nPlus :\\n\r\n-\tSakurasou no Pet na Konojo has a great animation and art. I can see Shiina as the cutest girl during this fall until winter anime season.\\n\r\n-\tI really like Shiina personality. She is genius but really dumb in many trivial things. I started to laugh when Shiina did her dirty jokes with her pants.\\n\r\nWith all of these plus and minus things. I think I cannot hate this anime. I have finished watching all of episodes without leaving even a single episode. In my conclusion, Sakurasou no Pet na Konojo is just ordinary anime with an extraordinary animation. Because I\u2019m easy on giving score. I think I should give it 8 in overall score.",

            "content": "There's always a time in people's lives, when they have dreams beyond what's conventional. Dreams that could imply not going to the University to become a Doctor/Lawyer and similar, but only a few people will have what it takes to stand up and go for it! These dreams always shake the vision that our parents have about us. It takes a lot of effort and mental strenght, and you have to sacrifice a lot of money, energy and even friends and family. The journey is a rather long course of obstacles. And one of these obstacles, could be no one but a very close personto you, if not yourself. There can and will always be someone better than you at what you are trying to become, and guess what: that someone doesn't give a crap, because he was somewhat born to do it.\\n\\n\r\nWelcome to Sakurasou no Pet na Kanojo. An anime that explores the rather introspective conflict of jaleousy and how people deal with this.\\n\\n\r\nSakurasou follows the story of a group of students who were, for a lack of a better word, exiled from their dorms because of their odd behaviors and activities, and thus, have to live at \"Sakurasou\" during High school.\\n\r\nSakurasou is full of eccentric people who have a close bond to artistic and non-conventional activities, and they all want to be the best at it, but there's an exception: Our fellow Main character. He was pretty much cast away into Sakurasou because he adopted homeless cats, and the regular dorms couldn't accept pets.\\n\\n\r\nOur Main character begins as a nihilistic person without ambitions or goals of any kind, but that changes as soon as he meets our female lead, a foreign lady who just arrived to Japan and has absolutely no idea of how to do everyday activities, but has an exceptional talent and is literally the best in the world at what she does.\\n\\n\r\nThe first impression that this anime gives could be a rather negative one if you are not into \"typical\" setups and clueless MC's, but the story telling and character development makes this anime an outstanding drama that you could relate in one or more ways. \\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed this anime way more than I thought I would. The drama and the feels are really touching.\\n\\n\r\nWatch this. It is a great experience!",

            "content": "I know i'll probably piss some people off here such as: PETA, kandaxmashiro fans, poultry, and whoever the subbing group was that did the videos I saw, among others. While the things I say here may sound like jokes, I should mention that I am completely serious.\r\nAnyways down to business.\r\nStory: A rather clueless male (of course its a male, do they make clueless females in anime?) has to move into the dorm named sakurasou because hes a really hardcore badass and kept a pet cat in the regular dorm so they decide this will be his reprimand. We begin the show with him having togo to the station to pick up Mashiro a new sakurasou resident who's supposedly the best painter ever. Upon getting to know her, we discover that she is completely helpless and 100% unable to take care of herself and otherwise function in society(hey, what do you know, they do make clueless females). This leads to him being on Mashiro duty, which pretty much means that he has to take care of her, and I suppose is the prerequisite to the blooming relationship that is at the forefront of this series.\\n\\n\r\nArt: It was good, no complaints to be heard from me. It was well done and able to carry the story nicely.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Sakurasou is inhabited by \"special\" individuals including but not limited to: a girl that seems very immature(but is the best anime creator ever), a man-whore(who writes her scripts), a kid who has long hair, lives behind a computer screen, and is blunt to the point of bordering asshole-dom(wait, when did I end up in this), and the teacher supervisor who is all the time having her boobs hanging out and trying to hook up with dudes. Wow, how is it that the vast majority of the issues here are sexually oriented? oh wait, ecchi series... Other than them we have Kanda who I think I did a good enough job detailing in the opening, mahiro who has a vendetta against underwear thus making her the resident comando, and a(nother) girl that's interested in kanda named aoyama who wishes to be a voice actress.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (time to piss people off): Okay for starters I didn't like that kanda was with mashiro (thats not a spoiler, its a given from episode one) and I thought that he would be better suited with aoyama because she at least had some personality which sad to say, mahiro is severely lacking. But you know, harem animes are kinda like chicken fights in a way, you get all the chickens(girls) in the ring and the battle begins, and even if your chicken(in my case aoyama) is losing, you keep tossing in your dollar bills hoping that it will pull through and defy the odds(here it happens to be the set-in-stone written story) and walk away victorious, but this time I wasn't that lucky. \\n\\n\r\nNext: the subbing group. All I can really say is that its a good thing that I am able to understand enough Japanese to get me through the massive gaps in the subbing. Seriously, I don't know if these were their coffee breaks or some shit like that, but I was disgusted by it because they just half-assed their job and I wish I knew who the group was because I would warn you all not to watch their version of this. Another thing was the words they used when subbing aoyama were the same that some southern redneck would use, I mean there were enough y'alls to sink a ship and just cutting g's off of the ends of words were enough to make me think that any minute \"THE SOUTH WILL RISE AGAIN\" was about to come flying across the screen. Now, this could totally be how she is supposed to be and I wouldn't know, I only know enough Japanese to get through anime, I don't know dialects or slang, but given the subbing quality overall, I think they were just being idiots.\\n\r\n--if I am wrong, and that is how she is meant to talk, I would like to know--\\n\\n\r\nOverall: I wasn't good with the kanda mashiro relationship, I wanted to ax whoever the hell subbed it, and was just irritated by mashiro's character in general. It was a fairly original pitch so I will give it points for that and I did enjoy it, just not \"i'm pitching a tent because i'm so excited\" enjoyment. Maybe it all has to do with that irritation i felt towards mashiro but I don't know, I will say that it was good in every other aspect and that most of what annoyed me  had nothing to do with the anime itself, so it was pretty okay.",

What is important in this anime is not just the romance and drama aspect of animes within such genre , but the emotions you can feel during this anime. Actually this is one of the few animes that affected me so much. Why? The answer is simple : in this anime you can feel the furstruation , the pain, sadness and probably sympathy with all characters in this anime. Ifu had any experience of hard working for reaching your dream but didn't come true u can feel the emotional aspect of this anime. \\n\\n\r\nAs for story : this story really made me think why all of this happening to the main characters , isn't strange for such drama and love anime to take a dark aspect of human emotions and describe it ? But this actually what you will like about this anime.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters: well, the character development is good enough but this is not the positive point about characters . What makes this anime really good is the unique qualities of each character. As for the main heroin making her emotionless in the first half of the anime really attracted me.\\n\\n\r\nThe art and music : are very good for this genre especially .\\n\\n\r\nReally I enjoyed watching this anime and recommend it to u all, but if u are depressed for any reason really don't try to watch as it may make u feel worse .",

            "content": "INTRO\r\nAnyone who has watched rom com animes for a long time will have a hard time engaging themselves in the first episode of this series. The whole premise is just screaming \"GENERIC HAREM!!\" and your belief is solidified during the first sequence of the very first episode. Bear with it since this series is one of the few romance/anime that has a lasting impression on any viewer.\r\nTHE REVIEW\r\nThe series touches on a few social problems that are well executed and portrayed. Anyone can really relate to the circumstances that the characters go through. \r\nThe pacing is good enough to keep the viewers attention and notlose its focus although there are times when a scene seems to drag on for no apparent reason. There are times when the drama is a bit overblown and could have used a more realistic approach but it is more of a personal preference.\\n\\n\r\nAs \"ROM COM ANIME RULES\" dictate, some cliches need to be present and Sakurasou has plenty of them. The good thing is, it is executed well enough to not hinder my overall enjoyment of the series.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters are well developed and interesting. There are just some  developments between characters that was suddenly thrown on the trash bin and it does not sit well with me (AOYAMA!!!)\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL\\n\\n\r\nThe ending was magnificently done; concluding the Sakurasou residents' journey and at the same time leaving it open ended enough for the viewer's own interpretation of the character's respective futures is a huge plus for me.\\n\\n\r\nMy scoring is system is a fairly complicated process: including the in-built rating board, my personal enjoyment, and a little bit of angst because the real world is constantly bombarding me of failures despite all the hard work that I have done and pairing me with a girl who is overflowing with talent who is further plunging me in the depths of despair because I really really like her makes me want to give Sakurasou no Pet no Kanojou a\\n\\n\r\n8.6/10!!\\n\\n\r\nFans of the genre are going to love this series despite its flaws. A goodl rom com anime that touches upon the harshness of society and the unfairness of the world.",

The OST and EST of episodes 13-24 which give you the more serious feeling, where everything is happening and they're fighting against it for their own reasons, while the OST shows how much fun they're having while it's playing, the EST shows them dancing and holding hands together, enjoying their year as the Problem Children of Sakurasou having fun every minute fighting against lifes cruelty of being unfair. As well as the other OST's and EST's throughout to make the episode get across it's feelings more. While the EST's and OST's are very good throughout, the songs in the series are also good, Graduation song and all the rest made you feel what Sakurasou no Pet na Kanojo was trying to put across to you and you can't help but feel happy and sad at the same time.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9 \\n\r\nThe characters; while they're all unique are all amazingly designed and their voice actors never loose concentration and always stay in character; portraying their traits, while the Alien, Misaki, just jumps in and does whatever she wants, Sorata knows his responsibilities and does them to a tee, helping Mashiro and they just seem to be able to get along perfectly, with Aoyama on the side watching Sorata. Then theirs the playboy, Jin who has dated almost every type of person you'd want, a nurse, a wife etc.. And then it all comes to life why he is like that and what makes him change. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10\\n\r\nI haven't enjoyed a series like this in a long time, it takes a lot of effort for a School rom-com to come out well and I think it was executed perfectly by the producers, I enjoyed this so much and the emotions you feel during a series are just phenomenal, you can't help cry, laugh, feel happy or sad, it just comes as it moves onwards, this was on of the most fun and joyful anime I've ever watched, even though their are a lot of sad moments for each character, it all comes to settle down and you just feel happy watching it. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9 \\n\r\nI don't think a 10 exists, nothing is perfect although this comes pretty close. When something you're watching makes you feel emotions that the characters put across, it has to be good no matter what. Don't blame me if you cry to a headache like I did, but you won't regret it; it was amazing watching this series.",

            "content": "Summary:\r\nWhen Sorata enters the notorious dorm Sakurasou against he eagerly awaits the day he can leave. However, the dorm leader assigns him to take care of Mashiro his outlook on life changes forever.\r\nThis is a touching story on the difficulties of acquiring our dreams, and of acquiring love.\r\nInitial Reaction:\r\nJ.C. Staff\u2019s art made me thing that this would be another run of the mill romantic comedy. The title really had me on guard since I don\u2019t know if I would name something as such unless it had an ecchi theme. The first few episode entailed Sorata dressing Mashiro, doing her laundry, and just about everythingfor her. Ahh, so that is why she is a pet. Overall, it seems mediocre at first glance.\\n\\n\r\nFinal Reaction:\\n\\n\r\nSakurasou overcame my expectations with ease, and left an amazing impression. As a college student myself, I could relate to the characters in the show as they struggle to get somewhere in life. The story isn\u2019t complicated, but it didn\u2019t have to be. The character development oozed out of every pore of this show, and I grew to love every single one of the characters.\\n\\n\r\nSakurasou didn\u2019t take the harem route, nor focus on a single couple. Instead it picked a group of characters, gave them dreams, challenges, and feelings. At times I am surprised that more authors don\u2019t recognize the value of having a cast of characters with equal importance.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\\n\r\nKanda, Sorata (Matsuoka, Yoshitsugu):\\n\\n\r\nSorata starts off as just a run of the mill high school student, but upon seeing Mashiro chasing her dreams he questions what he wants to do. Thus, he decides to become a game creator, and works hard to pursue his goals. While the most average of the dorm Sorata plays an important part in bringing the cast together.\\n\\n\r\nShiina, Mashiro (Kayano, Ai):\\n\\n\r\nMashiro arrives from England as a well known artist. However, she desires to become a mangaka, so she ignores all advice otherwise to pursue her dream. Mashiro doesn\u2019t really express much emotion, and also isn\u2019t capable of living by herself. Sorata teaches her to be independent, and helps her relate to her audience.\\n\\n\r\nMitaka, Jin (Sakurai, Takahiro):\\n\\n\r\nJin is a senior who is notorious for being a playboy. However, he attempts to hide his true feelings so he won\u2019t who he really cares about. He gives out good advice to sorata and the others all the time. He is childhood friends with Misaki, and writes scripts for her all the time. While people see him as a good writer he does not have enough talent to write scripts for Misaki.\\n\\n\r\nKamiigusa, Misaki (Takamori, Natsumi):\\n\\n\r\nMisaki is a senior whom is head over heels for Jin. She always is overenthusiastic about everything she is doing, and never runs out of energy. Her animation skills are top notch, and animation studios have hired her before.\\n\\n\r\nAoyama, Nanami (Nakatsu, Mariko):\\n\\n\r\nNanami pursues her dream of being a voice actress. Her parents did not consent to her dream, so she works part time to cover costs. She acts as a voice of reason to the crazy members of sakurasou. She is under a lot of pressure to land a acting job since it is her final year of acting school.\\n\\n\r\nAkasaka, Ryuunosuke (Horie, Yui):\\n\\n\r\nI couldn\u2019t even realize Yui voiced him\u2026 She did a good job I guess. Akasaka is talented at computer software, and doesn\u2019t have to attend class since he runs a business out of his dorm room. While at first a hikikomori he evolves out of that initial role.\\n\\n\r\nStory:\\n\\n\r\nThe viewers take the perspective of Sorata, but it never focuses solely on his part of the story. The story swings naturally between each characters current conflict, and how it relates to the focus of the entire sakurasou dorm. It sets up a perspective of successful talented people against those who are struggling to achieve their dreams. While the feelings of failure are weak at the start they increase as the characters encounter more and more walls.\\n\\n\r\nAt first the story evolves around Sorata getting accustomed to the craziness of Shiina who seems incapable of doing anything other than drawing. Experiencing her amazing dedication to her dream, Sorata starts to question his dream in life. The plot always heavily influences the characters which allows the amazing amount of character development in 24 episodes. The most enjoyable aspect of the show for me was that every single member of sakurasou had an equal presence in the show. Designating Sorata as the main character would be correct, but counting anyone else as side characters would not fit.\\n\\n\r\nThe show manages to give us Drama, without romantic mishaps, or car crashes. No, instead the story tells us the disparity of chasing our dreams, and the jealously of those who it appears to come naturally to. Nothing is worst than watching 2 people try to communicate their feelings for 12 episodes (nevermind 24), but the romance in the story progresses at a good pace, and sidelines itself the remainder of the plot.Not to mention that there are 6 people trying.\\n\\n\r\nPlus side +:\\n\\n\r\nThe characters develop drastically throughout the show.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are relateable, and their struggles touching.\\n\\n\r\nGood voice acting, and animation which communicate the emotions well.\\n\\n\r\nDiverse set of characters, and an appropriate level of humor mixed in.\\n\\n\r\nMinus Side -:\\n\\n\r\nHeavy on development. Requires attachment to the characters.\\n\\n\r\nWhile everyone stays healthy, the story can be rather depressing to watch.",

            "content": "(Warning: long review)\r\nThere is a reason why the \"3 episode rule\" exists. Although, in this case, it's more of an 8 episode rule. What starts as a fairly typical school life romantic comedy (albeit with a somewhat unusual premise) filled to the brim with ecchi situations and fanservice morphs into something very real and meaningful somewhere along the way. Sorata Kanda is the only normal, responsible person in Sakura Hall, the old run down dormitory near his high school that no one actually decides to live in. The residents are all those who have been kicked out of the normal dorms for some reason oranother, and as such are generally seen as unfit to take care of the dorm's newest resident: Mashiro Shiina, a (noncanonically) autistic mangaka-to-be who is an amazing artist but cannot consistently clothe, feed, or bathe herself properly. To summarize: normal guy surrounded by crazy peers, including a pretty girl who is almost always partially naked. If this sounds generic and awful to you, I can't blame you but seriously hold on a sec. It gets good.\\n\\n\\n\r\nStory - 9/10\\n\\n\r\nWhile I definitely could have gone without the somewhat sketchy tendencies of the introductory episodes, what follows such displays stands as a testament to the power of character-driven narrative. Complex characters with meaningfully complex personalities make organic decisions based on who they are and, possibly more importantly, who they want to be. The story, then, is derived not from a standalone plot that the characters support, but rather exists as a natural extension of the characters themselves and the decisions they make. It all feels very fluid and natural, moving from plot point to plot point at a pace that doesn't appear at all manufactured. The story itself follows the residents of Sakura Hall as they work towards various goals and, in the process, discover who they are and why they feel the way they do. It's a very emotionally engaging story at times, as it drives home what exactly life really can be about: sometimes hard work and motivation can only get you so far. Sometimes you'll give everything you have, only to fail and be left with nothing to hold onto. Life is unpredictable and the world is ambivalent to your suffering, but there is still beauty in life and love, and finding a place where you truly belong can make moving forward that much more rewarding. It doesn't create complexity for the purpose of having complexity, nor does it make itself more dramatic than it needs to be. It only presents a cross-section of the very real, genuine lives of a group of people who, for however short a time, happen to be connected by this old, worn down building. The moving, unadorned honesty and simplicity of it all makes the story something unforgettable. It resonates with you because, through it, you can recognize your own flaws and needs and desires and triumphs and those of people you love and care about. You feel what they feel because you know them, and are them, and in some way you believe that everyone you love deserves the kind of happiness that they so desperately seek.\\n\\n\\n\r\nAnimation - 8.5/10\\n\\n\r\nLet's get this out of the way right now: Sakurasou is a rather pretty show. Crisp lines and meaningful palette choices combine with an unbelievable attention to detail to create a pleasant viewing experience. The lighting and shadow is near perfect. The use of framing and visual metaphor is undeniably good. Everything down to the last individual button on a minor character's jacket is accounted for and drawn beautifully. The results are as striking as they are technically impressive; context and depth is given to the characters and the situations they find themselves in purely through how they are artistically portrayed. There's no mistaking that the animation team knew exactly what they were doing when it comes to making something look good. Unfortunately, no matter how well the individual frames are designed, it's hard to get away from lackluster fluidity. The animation itself wasn't sluggish or poor, but it lacks the sense of motion and urgency that I would have preferred to see out of an otherwise beautiful show. The contents of the show don't necessarily require the same type of animation as a more action-oriented flick, but regardless of what is and isn't necessary, I still felt as though the animation didn't flow nearly as well as I had hoped. Overall, the visuals were incredibly consistent, though; I don't feel as though there was ever a single moment where I felt as though something failed to meet my expectations in terms of static design.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound - 8/10\\n\\n\r\nEasily the weakest link, but by no means bad. The openings and endings fit the show fairly well and do a decent job of setting the tone. Voice acting was good all around, with most characters' respective voices fitting their image fairly well. Performance was solid in that regard, as well. The sound assets and ambient music is where Sakurasou shines, in my opinion. Soft piano or sweeping melodies set the mood of a scene perfectly without being intrusive or obnoxious, and silence is often used to proper effect. It really does bother me that some shows can't seem to figure out that purposeful silence can often set the mood better than music, and that music doesn't have to be a loud, clamorous affair. Nothing really stands out to me as being wonderful or worthy of special mention, but in the end, much like with the visuals, what speaks to me about Sakurasou's sound is how consistent it is. The music does its job well and there aren't really any slip-ups to speak of. The voice acting is solid all around and I can't recall off the top of my head any single instance of even one line that had shoddy delivery.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters - 9.5/10\\n\\n\r\nSakurasou includes not characters, but people. Real, genuine human beings with passions and desires and fears and insecurities that come together to create complex personal and interpersonal relationships. They make decisions based on what they feel and then grow as people when they come face-to-face with the repercussions of those decisions. They act and react in ways that follow naturally from who they are and what they want out of life. They mature not in reaction to the plot requiring that they learn a lesson, but in reaction to challenges that they may or may not overcome and to the needs of themselves and others. It's honestly the kind of meaningfully deep characters that you don't really see anywhere else. They aren't tropes. They aren't archetypes. Their layers have layers and the personality that comes out of all this complexity doesn't feel needlessly convoluted. It feels human. It feels like the a group of people who are trying to figure out the world and its workings without first truly understanding themselves.\\n\\n\r\n*Reviewer's note: this is probably the only anime I have watched where I genuinely and earnestly loved, empathized with, and identified with every major character. There is usually at least one that I'm just not a fan of or have reservations about, but for some reason this group really got to me. Maybe I\u2019m biased.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 9/10\\n\\n\r\nWhen I finished this anime, the only thing I could really do for a while was try to compose myself and say \u201cWhere the hell did that come from?\u201d What starts as an 'already seen it a million times' rom-com becomes, at some point, a lot more poignant than I was expecting. I almost feel weird giving it this high of praise, to be completely honest; even now that I've had time to properly digest it, it still feels like it should be something forgettable. Something uninteresting and meaningless. But it's not. It's managed to strike me with a set of emotions I haven't gotten from an anime in a good while. And I think it's going to stick with me for some time. From matters of love to questions of the future, Sakurasou no Pet na Kanojo resonated with me. It hit something that made me stop and see things in different light, a different hue. It struck a chord somewhere inside me that made me turn inward and ask myself, \u201cWhat color do I want to be?\u201d",

            "content": "Having only recently finished watching the 24 episode series, the show\u2019s characters still continue to reverberate in my mind; for both the better and for the worse. I cannot honestly tell anyone that this was by any stretch of the imagination, a good anime. Given that however, good only suggests a mediocre push in the positive direction. The word good itself, has too many implications that this anime just simply fails to accomplish.\r\nHowever, do not get me wrong, whilst the anime could only scratch the behind of what we can deem as good, it does have its own strong points that pushed me to finishthe program.\\n\\n\r\n/spoiler alert!\\n\\n\r\ncharacters 8/10\\n\r\nI thought it might be appropriate to start off with the most fascinating aspect of this anime, the characters. When it comes to discussing character progression, development and growth over the plot of 24 episodes, it comes down to being approaching nil. The anime does not want to focus on their growth, but rather their almost unique, comedic personalities that all intertwine to give off the atmosphere of a real family. This is an aspect that is essentially core for the characters of Sakurasou, as you will inevitably work out from the progression of the plot.\\n\\n\r\nWhere to begin, ah yes, the protagonist himself.\\n\\n\r\nKanda Sorata, (and yes I will be using the proper Japanese order(/asian) of writing names) is the centre of attention. He goes about the entirety of the storyline without major progression in his personality, characteristic features or emotional maturity; but he does progress with his outlook on his future. He is consistently surrounded by the two main female characters who, whilst juxtaposed, are obviously significantly different. Aoyama Nanami and Shiina Mashiro both have their quirks, but both play a major role, given they are involved in the love triangle with Kanda.\\n\\n\r\nAoyama is the hardworking type, the almost-tsundere, always ecchi-sensitive girl who chases her dream of becoming a seiyuu without regarding approval from her parents. Shiina too, is the hardworking type, master artist and eventually professional mangaka, who is so consumed within her works that she has no sense of shame in revealing her naked body. Then we have the other major characters who reside within Sakurasou; the childhood friends Kamiigusa Misaki and Mitaka Jin and the programming genius Akasaka  Ryuunosuke. Furthermore, the two other minor characters that are worth the mention include the teacher who \u201cmanages\u201d the students at Sakurasou, Sengoku Chihiro and Shiina\u2019s art compatriot Rita Ainsworth.\\n\\n\r\nTo preface my dislike for Kanda, he is the standard male protagonist, who himself proclaims is of average, well, everything. He has a weakness in adopting abandoned cats; which is the titular concern when he brings in Shiina and is seen as her caregiver. Their relationship develops such that a love triangle becomes formed between Kanda, Aoyama and Shiina. However, long story short, such a romance never really ventures to see the light of day, and should really be attributed to the air of ignorance that Kanda projects, as is common of most male anime characters in a romcom. He achieves the mindset to become hardworking like that of Aoyama in working towards their own goals; his being game design. Like Aoyama, both are drawn to failure and increased resistance to it; as juxtaposed to the prospering success that is met by Shiina as she pursues her goal of manga artistry. In essence, he is the anime\u2019s form of emotional backing, even though he himself has many fallouts. It is his very nature of being a failure, and then following it up with more of that that completely fuels my repulsion of his character; and from that infuriation; he remains a memorable character from the cast.\\n\\n\r\nThe osananajimi couple Kamiigusa and Mitaka, unlike Kanda, are my favourite characters who essentially in my opinion form the backbone for any basis for good in this anime.  Kamiigusa is an eccentric up-beat third-year senior who is  highly skilled in the art of animation. It is the use of her eccentric personality in the many situations in Sakurasou that ultimately livens the mood, creates the opportunities and gels the residents together in essence. Her significant other, the calm and collected Mitaka, is portrayed as a playboy who tugs on the heartstrings of Kamiigusa throughout the series, but is often seen to be highly mature and a realist. He puts forward his love for Kamiigusa by concealing it, badly of course, so that he believes he never has the chance to hurt her in person, and it is this relationship that is the case for the main arc of growing for all the characters. He serves to mentor Kanda as an older brother figure, and helps to push Kanda on the \u201cright\u201d patch.\\n\\n\r\nFinally, we have Dragon, or Akasaka, the second-year profession programming genius who resides as a shut-in in the dormitories. Whilst physically being absent throughout the earlier episodes, he plays a significant role in the evolution of Kanda\u2019s character through his logical resolve and understand even without real social contact. He is often able to objectively analyse all social scenarios due to his highly logical mindset, whilst his emotional conscience is personified by his AI, Maid-chan; who represents both a girlfriend/maid-caricature that places her boyfriend/master in the highest regard.\\n\\n\r\nstory 6/10\\n\r\nHonestly, there is not much to say about the story or plotline of Sakurasou no Pet na Kanojo. It is quite simply, a dull, slow-paced miniature harem without any real romantic progression for the protagonist, whereas the romcom is shoved into every scene possible surrounding him and his harem. The majority of the roadblocks that the main cast encounter throughout the series feel all very minor; and whilst the series is limited to only 24 episodes, it seriously lacks in any real depth of each situation; say, when Rita comes from London to claim Shiina needs to return. The plot is essentially predictable and relies heavily on the romcom to progress successfully without too much actual romance. The most major of these blocks only really shows up nearing the end of the series; as the roadblock consists of many minute issues that all occur simultaneously; which shoves our main cast into a real pickle. But in the end the way the issues were solved were predictable, and simply forced it\u2019s hand on a ploy to force an emotional response from the audience (both within and outside of the anime).\\n\\n\r\nThe reason the series somewhat stuck in my head was how much it was akin to the first manga series that I read; Love Hina. The setting was almost very similar; a dormitory stuck with girls; however how each play out obviously. But it does give me a breath of nostalgia to see such a setting again after such a long time.\\n\\n\r\n/endspoiler!\\n\\n\r\nart 7/10\\n\r\nSo, for the art, the animation is quite standard, with almost a very polished look, but is all in all quite straightforward. It does complement the story or characters at all; the characters are all drawn to look ordinary and as a union in their uniforms. However, the art style is bland in the sense that it does not choose to really stand out from other animes. It can really shake up the atmosphere at very specific scenes with the use of colour highlights to emphasise and important scene as opposed to general passerby scenes. The background is drawn lovely, as quite standard of most animes.\\n\\n\r\nsound 8/10\\n\r\nJust to begin, the series is split into two; so there are two sets of OPs and EDs. In general, I enjoyed both sets of OPs and EDs. Below I\u2019ll just give a score for them;\\n\\n\r\n[OP1] Kimi ga Yume o Tsuretekita by Pet no Kanajotachi 8/10\\n\r\n[OP2] Yume no Tsuzuki by Konomi Suzuki  7/10\\n\r\n[OP3] I Call Your Name Again by Mariko Nakatsu (Credited as Aoyama Nanami) 7/10 (Episode 14)\\n\\n\r\n[ED1] Dash of Days by Konomi Suzuki 8/10\\n\\n\r\n[ED2] Prime Numbers (Kimi to Deaeru Hi) by Asuka Okura 9/10\\n\\n\r\nAnimation is extremely cute; and tries to highlight the relationship within Sakurasou during the events of the actual episodes (13-24)\\n\\n\r\nThe OST does not stand to highlight itself very well; but does play throughout as a good accompaniment to the scenarios and highlighting the severity.\\n\\n\r\nenjoyment 8/10\\n\r\nSo, whilst the anime lacks severely, in my opinion, in a deep progressive plot; it does however still capture me in its relatively interesting characters. It has progressed well enough to keep itself in my mind to the day that I am writing this, so I believe it is honestly well deserving of it\u2019s overall mark.

The soundtrack is also quiet sweet and memorable. The strength of this anime lies in it's character development as it shows not only the characters growing and improving, it shows how they deal with jealousy, disappointment and ambition. When I saw how the some of characters felt and reacted, I could relate to them as I've felt those things before. If you enjoy cute, sweet moments in life, feels and like observing how people interact with each other, this couldbe the anime for you :)",

            "content": "A quick spoiler free review.\r\nI'll be honest when I first read the synopsis my first thought was a loud \"Nope.\" I have read/watched many stories with those key words and most of them were terrible. Having said that I am soooo glad I heard reviews that convinced me to give this a try. One of the themes is a very hard issue to tackle realistically, What it means to follow your dreams. If anyone says they could see that theme from the synopsis then you know at least one liar. \r\nStory: Despite the fact that it is a slice of life anime the plot isn'tvery sporadic. It actually has a lot of tension which is rare for a slice of life. Much of this is based on the love aspect, which I must admit is fairly obvious who the author wishes to pair. One of the key points of the story is what it means to follow your dreams and what the consequences of said action can be.\\n\r\nArt: I'm not a big art critic so I'll keep this simple. Everything transitions well even with detailed animation. Not the best art I've ever seen but it is better than your average anime.\\n\r\nSound: One of the best soundtracks of recent anime. The voice actors are what really make the sound work. Everything was believable if at times slightly hammy.\\n\r\nCharacters: I didn't like all of the characters but I cannot in good conscious say that it was anything but a strength. The type of development the mains receive is what every show should strive for. Sorata in particular grows the most throughout the story and shows the most depth, even if I don't like how much of a pansy he can be for a high school boy (a problem I have with most anime. Seriously guys aren't that afraid to make a move on a girl, especially with as many signs as some of these guys receive). If you're wondering which of the characters I didn't like it was Mashiro for a variety of reasons, but mainly because despite this story being about success and failure she doesn't experience much of the latter.\\n\\n\r\nOverall I am glad I gave this anime a shot. It echoes the nature of life in many ways and tugs at the heartstrings. An easy 92 out of a hundred and a must watch if you enjoy anything other than buff guys beating the crap out of each other.",

            "content": "Sakurasou no Pet na Kanojo\u2019s 24-episode run stretched from the end of 2012 to the beginning of 2013 and is produced by J.C. Staff. Half of the Animes I have dropped are from J.C. Staff. Though, to their credit, they have produced good works such as Railgun, Kaichou wa Maid-sama and ToraDora.\r\nI guess you could say J.C. Staff, to me, is like a make-it-or-break-it studio.\r\nSo how good of a job did they do for Sakurasou? Have they learnt from their mistakes and built on their strong points or did they let the series implode on their hollow plot and spastic story focus?\r\nSakurasou\u2019s pretense is nothingtoo original: Sorata, who is living in a high school dorm, suddenly finds Shiina Mashiro dropping into his life. The first thing they do is outline Sorata\u2019s character in the first two episodes or so by emphasizing his actions like his adoption of and refusal to part with his cats. I liked how they decided to try and define his character so Sorata didn\u2019t seem as flat as a cardboard cutout.\\n\\n\r\nSoon, you realize Sorata is blander than uncooked pasta. A 10-year old could formulate more complex thoughts. Though this changes in the later episodes, his thought process doesn\u2019t stray far from the stereotypical and predictable Nice Guy\u2019s way of thinking.\\n\\n\r\nThe moment Sorata meets Shiina, the wind picks up, the leaves from the Sakura trees fall and the camera slowly zooms out then transitions into a close-up of both of them staring at each other. Romance? Your hopes are quickly shattered when they reveal that Shiina is emotionally incapacitated. It\u2019s like she doesn\u2019t think of anything aside from when she works on her manga.\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe first few episodes feel incredibly chaotic and rushed. It\u2019s like they forgot they had 24 episodes and made me worry that the show was going to be destructively fast paced. After it slows down, you realize that the style works very well to share those introductory experiences with the viewer.\\n\\n\r\nThe voicing cast is great for Sakurasou. Kirito is Sorata. Inori (Guilty Crown) is Shiina. Even Ogura Yui voices a minor character. On the topic of Characters, all of them are distinct, very lovable and easily relatable to in some way. Nanami, Misaki and even Jin have fleshed out feel to them that I struggle to find in most other shows. Characters are certainly a strong point of Sakuraso\\n\\n\r\nMost of the jokes in the show are delivered through fast banter between Sorata and another character, mostly Shiina and Misaki. For that reason, humor in the show becomes quite slapstick and corny over time. The show\u2019s run length work against it here. These exchanges between Sorata and whoever he happens to be harassed by become staler and staler as the series goes on, despite their decent attempts at keeping it interesting.\\n\\n\r\nThe show tackles the issue of Sorata\u2019s inferiority and pride repeatedly, a little too repeatedly. The show regularly brings the focus back to Sorata\u2019s struggle and failure. I guess they really want us to see Sorata\u2019s perspective because the main meat of the series is his thoughts and feelings. The series feels stiff and rigid because of this, especially when there are characters with more interesting and focused struggles.\\n\\n\r\nLater, Nanami gets more of the limelight, which was very refreshing and added another dimension to the theme. Sadly though, Jin\u2019s story is never told.\\n\\n\r\nRomantic relationships are taken lightly with fleeting emotional moments that seem to be forgotten after the scene changes. The style is nothing new and, as always, really makes you wish for some progress, especially with Jin and Misaki.\\n\\n\r\nSomething different about Sakurasou is that a clear favourite girl didn\u2019t emerge at all. The overall setting points to Shiina, yet the amount of screen time Nanami gets is way too much for her to be eliminated easily. Personally, I\u2019d like to say: Nanami best girl!\\n\\n\r\nAll this sounds great, but some portions of the show really take their time. A number of times, I wanted to skip forward in the episode to get past a pointless scene. On top of that, some scenarios, namely the one in the middle, were incredibly corny and had rather plain, linear storytelling. Dragging myself through those scenes honestly drained me. To be fair, such scenes are infrequent but they exist nonetheless.\\n\\n\r\nAnd then, the Second Arc kicks in.\\n\\n\r\nFrom Episode 14 onwards, it\u2019s almost a different show altogether. The romantic tension that was built up in the shadows explodes into the light and there\u2019s lasting change in the relationships. The stoic Shiina suddenly has a voice full of heartbreaking emotion. Even the animation seems to convey the mood. Misaki and Jin\u2019s relationship takes a turn for the deep and there are some drastic changes in Misaki\u2019s character. Yet, focus on all the themes and relationships is remarkably well-balanced.\\n\\n\r\nThe episodes curved towards Misaki and Jin while still paying sufficient attention to the main trio. No detail is lost in the switch in focus and it gives a great sense of continuity. Though there were some corny moments here and there, the story and focus still felt very seamless and engaging overall.\\n\\n\r\nBy the time the last 4 episodes come around, all flaws and annoyances that were held in the first arc are long forgotten. You\u2019re absorbed into Sakurasou and J.C. Staff knows it. Immensely enjoyable and set at a great pace, the last 4 episodes concretely sealed everything Sakurasou tried and succeeded at being. Without disappointing nor overstaying its welcome, you\u2019re left with sweet memories of Sakurasou, wishing for more.\\n\\n\r\nSakurasou took me on a journey. One where I watched the characters change and develop, battling their doubts and working hard for their own reasons. The process of each character trying their best is very easy to relate to and as the series drew to a close, I realize that every one of the main cast faced a serious struggle to which there was no easy solution. Sorata, Jin and Nanami work hard to succeed in their chosen line of work, trying to match up to Shiina and Misaki. On the other hand, Shiina and Misaki fight to draw the people they care about closer to them as they are driven away by their level of talent.\\n\\n\r\nAt its heart, under all the relationships and jokes and events and corniness, Sakurasou is a fantastic, riveting tale of change and maturity. You can feel the show grow and change. From the lighthearted start of the series, where the whole show was about Sorata taking care of Shiina, it expands to  into the feelings and individual perceptions of the main cast to form a sincere tale of chasing dreams and disappointment, deeper than I could have ever imagined. Have faith and be patient with Sakurasou and you\u2019ll be rewarded in the end.\\n\\n\r\nPros:\\n\\n\r\n- Humor mixes well with Romance\\n\\n\r\n- Strong Characters with good Seiyuus\\n\\n\r\n- Development feels Substantial\\n\\n\r\n- Genuine, Relatable themes\\n\\n\r\nCons:\\n\\n\r\n- Sorata is Boring\\n\\n\r\n- Parts of the middle are Slow and Unfocused\\n\\n\r\n- Super Corny/Cliched moments\\n\\n\r\nThe Verdict: 9/10",

            "content": "...what color do you want to be?\r\nAUTHOR'S NOTE:\r\nI've just finished Sakurasou no Pet na Kanojo (SNPNK) and would like to review it while it's still fresh in my mind. I did not know this anime even existed until I've read some reviews on MAL, and even though it received fairly high points, I was skeptical. The title just irked me. I feel like the synopsis needs to change because I was definitely not ready for SNPNK. So, I will attempt to write in detail on why SNPNK deserved such high ranking.\r\nSTORY (8/10):\r\nSince SNPNK is a slice of life anime which connects comedy and romance together,there isn't much storyline to follow. If anything, the story follows six residents that live in a run-down dorm called Sakurasou as they deal and cope with the unfair choices and conclusions that life throws at them. However, it does invoke real life situations and experiences, such as dealing with failure, hard work vs. prodigy, normal vs. unique, and even authoritative discrimination. Although you may think the anime is told in the first-person narrative, we are actually given multiple perspectives which is why it makes SNPNK such an ingenious anime. I've finally realized that this anime is not a complete romance-comedy. Although those genres are sugarcoated between the characters, SNPNK reveals a slice of life that is both refreshing and realistic. Despite the lack of a storyline, I've given it a fairly-high point, due to being true to its genre. SNPNK is the epitome of \"slice of life\".\\n\\n\r\nART (7/10):\\n\r\nAt first, we are given pleasing animation but this doesn't last long as the anime progresses. Yes, SNPNK is easy on the eyes but the background is nothing grand, more mediocre. The characters are drawn very well which means the producers wanted to concentrate more on the characters, not the anime as a whole. Despite the anime introducing artistically gifted characters to the viewers, we only get high quality scenes only when necessary to the plot. I do have to give where the credit is due, as the anime shamelessly discloses parodies of video games which was reminiscent for me.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND (8/10):\\n\r\nSNPNK allows the artists to really shine, which is a plus, as the anime do deal with the artistic world. I've identified at least 4 different OPs and 3 different EPs, plus other soundtracks during specific moments in the episodes. I will only concentrate on the OPs and EPs and you may judge the other musical treats the anime offers, if you end up watching it. \\n\\n\r\nThe first OP, \"Kimi ga Yume o Tsuretekita\" is poppy and filled with estrogen. Even now, I can imagine the fanboys and girls singing along in unison as their noses flare with excitement. It's a fairly good OP and the animation only strengthens it. The second OP \"Yume no Tsuzuki\" by Konomi Suzuki takes a dramatic, lite rock turn, though it wasn't anything special. The animation and sound synch well together. Personally, both OPs have not moved me too much, as their fast-tempo positive vibes did not mix well with the darker turns of this anime.\\n\\n\r\nThe first EP \"Days of Dash\" by Konomi Suzuki is picture-perfect. Sustained by the excellent use of animation, the first EP never fails to invoke emotions at the end of each episode. It has a hopeful, yet powerful melody to the song and the lyrics are compatible with the themes that are shown in the anime. The second OP \"Prime Number (Kimi to Deaeru Hi)\" Asuka Ookura has a catchy, yet childish-like vibe with cute animations to boot. Like the first EP, Asuka's voice and melody really integrates with the listeners/viewers' emotions.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS (10/10):\\n\r\nGoddamn. Where do I start? I would say that the character development and personalities in SNPNK is the heart and the reactor that assimilates all themes that are discussed in the anime. I have yet to figure out my favorite character because all of them are so well-versed. The good and bad qualities are in perfect balance for each character and it's difficult to say which is the main hero or heroine, as even the roles of supporting characters are just as important. Here, I will only introduce four characters that have consistently kept the anime together into a flawless mosaic.\\n\\n\r\nOur main hero, Sorata Kanada is the straight man and the comedy relief, but is also the strangely observant and incredibly kind character, when necessary. Sorata can be represented as the \"normal\" teenager struggling to deal with the harsh world outside of high school life. His battles focuses on his own identity and fear of being left behind, although he tries to assimilate into the social norm. Nanami Aoyama can be also viewed the same way as Sorata and also the perfect model of a \"hard-working civilian\". All I could feel for Nanami was great pity as she dealt with overwhelming problems such as commitment to part-time jobs while in school, taking voice-acting classes, running away from home to pursue her dreams, and even the dilemma of giving up on her first love. Nanami is an amazing character that many viewers may empathize with, as her shy, kind, cute, pseudo-tsundere personality does not always help her cope with the conflicts she faces.\\n\\n\r\nMashiro Shiina, the unique character from start to finish, and the only character that I have yet to figure out how to dissect. She has an awkward but attractive personality that is not only responsible for comedy relief and memorable quotes (I believe in panties), but also personal and interpersonal growth for the characters around her. She is deliciously cute, naive, yet a genius prodigy as a painter. Observing her character closely, she may have suffered from autism as a child or have some sort of hyperfocus disability, as her artistic abilities are extremely high-class yet she utterly fails at basic life skills. Misaki Kamiigusa is the ultra-hyperactive upperclassman of the three students mentioned above. As a fellow prodigy, she may or may not have suffered as a bipolar child, if not still suffering, as a high school student. Her grandiosity and endless energetic personality easily allows her to be the perfect comedy relief and the cause of personal growth for those around her.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL (9/10):\\n\r\nI demand a second season! I really want to see if it can surpass the first season. SNPNK was phenomenal and an incredible roller-coaster ride through the game we call life. There are many realistic scenarios that viewers may have experienced and I applaud the producers for actually thinking about the audience, as that what a \"slice of life\" should be. With so much drama going on in the anime, I even wonder if SNPNK has the potential to make it into the live-action scene. The creators of this anime has definitely outdone themselves by bringing all the characters to life through the lite novel, and Hajime Kamoshida (the writer), is a genius for coming up with such intricate characters. SNPNK belongs in the top-shelf. I highly challenge anyone to watch SNPNK, if you want see how a \"slice to life\" anime should be made.",

            "content": "I just finished rewatching this series and there are a lot of stuff that I want to say about this series, particularly the characters but let's talk about the story first so we can get this out of the way\r\nThis review is going to contain a little bit of spoilers\r\nStory:\r\nSakurasou's story begins with Kanda Sorata moving from regular dorms  to Sakura-sou. Sakura-sou is a place filled with problem children who are mostly talented in one or more more fields and have quite a number of quirks. Given that Kanda is just your average guy, he of course has a lot of complaints about thatplace.\\n\\n\r\nI have no complaints about the story and I like how the ones who are average stay average. They don't automatically get a power-up or maybe even a new form when they get motivated, they have their limits\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\\n\r\n[b]This part is going to contain a bit more spoilers than the other parts[/b]\\n\\n\r\nI have mixed feelings about the characters. On one hand, they did a good job with developing a lot of characters and they were able to make us relate for them and feel for them for the most part... That is if we're ignoring the main character which we of course cannot do since he has the majority of the screen time. The main character's actions don't make sense and he doesn't fulfill his role.\\n\\n\r\nKanda Sorata is the problem. He starts out well enough, he even learned a lot of stuff in the first 4 episodes, he made a mistake and he was able to correct himself\\n\\n\r\nSo far so good right?\\n\\n\r\nAfter a few more episodes, he made a similar mistake, it was still relatable and believable. You shouldn't make the same mistake twice but in the end you still do and he was able to learn from that experience\\n\\n\r\nThen he made a similar mistake again, except it's much much worse than the last 2\\n\\n\r\nKanda is meant to be relatable, at least that's how I took it because he is a normal person trying to achieve his dreams. he'll crash burn yet still rise back up again as a better person who learned from his past mistakes but this arc failed to deliver. Not only did he not learn from his mistakes, he thinks that he was in the right and forced his own ideals unto others. Not once did he apologize even though he was clearly in the wrong. He doesn't own other people's lives, he has no right to push his own stupid ideals to others. People change but he wasn't able to adapt to those changes and so he decided to tell them to revert back to their old self because that's what's convenivent for him. He thought he was in the right and he still thinkns that he was in the right.\\n\\n\r\nAfter that, I just couldn't feel for anything that he did, I just straight up hated him. When he fails, I just go \"Oh he failed, ok\". I didn't care anymore, I couldn't feel for him that much\\n\\n\r\nOh and I also think that he is too much of a child and that he should grow a pair already\\n\\n\r\nThankfully the other characters have no problems and there is one more average person who we can relate to because she's not as retarded as a character. I was able to feel for those characters as well, in fact I [b]almost[/b] cried [s]not[/s]\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\\n\r\nThe art was good. I didn't notice any mistakes and it fits the tone of the series.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\\n\r\nThe sound was ok. I liked the openings and closing credits and they played the right music at the right time\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\\n\r\nI really enjoyed this series. I enjoyed every moment aside from Kanda's cringey moments where I just went wtf.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\\n\r\nEverything affects enjoyment and being enjoyable is the main goal of anime which is an [b]entertainment[/b] medium hence I rate anime based purely on enjoyment, also, I don't really believe in numbers. They can't really express your love for a series. Don't pay that much attention to my score\\n\\n\r\nI give this series a 9/10, this would've received a 10 should it not have been for that one arc. I'm not saying this because of the flaws I found in it, I'm saying this because those flaws affected my enjoyment of the series negatively",

            "content": "Sakurasou no pet na kanojo review\r\nI laughed, I cried, I saw a great anime.\r\nHave you ever wanted to do something and regret not doing it? Well this show clearly tries to take that in account for the two main characters Sorata and Mashiro along their character development road. You can fail, you can have success, you cry, you laugh but in the end there is always someone for you to comfort you when you are sad and laugh with you when you are happy.Be it family ,friends or lover this show clearly has a strong point in delivering that message to the viewer.\r\nStory 7/10 \r\nThestory is very lighthearted and it focuses around Sorata who got kicked out of his school dorm after picking up a stray cat and Mashiro a beautifull blond girl who lacks the common sense of daily life.The story also tells the lives and circumstances of the others residents from the Sakurasou dorm.\\n\r\nOn the surface the story may seem just a romantic comedy with generic characters but on deeper level it focuses on elements of slice of life and tries to explore the mind and hearth of each resident from Sakurasou.\\n\r\nThe relation between Mashiro and Sorata is kinda unique I mean it\u2019s not the clich\u00e9 tsundere \u2013boyfriend stuff other romantic-comedy anime deliver to it\u2019s fans. Like the title suggest it\u2019s a master- pet relation where Sorata takes care of Mashiro and helps her with the common sense of daily life which clearly she lacks.The story adds a comedy tone to that relation and a mix of drama after the characters have some development and for my pleasant surprise it manages to execute and accomplish it\u2019s purpose.\\n\\n\r\nThe pace of the anime is slow in the beginning , we are introduced to the residents of Sakurasou , we get to know their habits , their crazy and funny personalities , what they like what they hate and after the oven is heated the main dish is ready to cook. After this slow pace everything becomes a enjoyable roler coaster where we get into business and the characters start to shine on the stage called Sakurasou dorm.\\n\\n\r\nThe show also explores maturity as a theme and talks about responsibilities , sacrifices and how love hurts both in a physical level and emotional one too. The anime explores the illogical side of love and how we fall in love most of the time with a person who has the opposite personality to you. To make it more simple and not turn the show into a psychological one elements of comedy are added mixed with some drama and a lot of feels for the characters background story.The comedy , the gag design for some characters helps the show to maintain its status as a whole (romantic-comedy) and not turn into a melodrama where at every scene the viewer cringes.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters 9/10\\n\r\nThe characters from Sakurasou are the main dish who make this anime a enjoyable feast for the viewer and their unique traits and personalities add a tasty flavor to the dish.At first glance they make look like any generic characters from a romantic comedy anime but after we know them better we can relate to them a lot. Their character development is good they work well together with each other as a whole and maintain the tone of comedy and maturity this show abords.\\n\\n\r\nSorata is the main character from Sakurasou and the one which the story focuses on him. At first glance he may seem just a harem mc but as the story progresses we know more about him . He likes to help other characters despite his own circumstances and the interaction and influence he has on other characters helps him to improve and face the long road called life.\\n\\n\r\nMashiro is a beautifull silent girl who lacks the common sense of daily life. She is a very talented manga artist and her personality may seem bland on the surface but again her development is impressive. She cares and tries to help the people she cares for in her own way. Sometimes this adds a tone of comedy to the show and makes her personality more vivid and sometimes she is serious like a grown up but sometimes she fails. We all know if you don\u2019t try you will never experience success and failure you will only spectate from the side lines and regret later.She symbolizes the word \u201cHardworking\u201d and I love her for that.\\n\\n\r\nAoyama another unique character from this show. She is the one who helps the main character when he has a problem and advices him in which path he may take in life. Her interactions with other characters and dialogue scenes with Sorata about life brings a tone of maturity for this show. Despite her problems and own circumstances she is also the hardworking type and very carefull with the people around her .Again this character is so close to real life that the viewer can relate to her.Why best girls never win? Because sometimes love is illogical or the main character is too dense to notice the feelings but here this not applies at all.\\n\\n\r\nRyuunosuke is your typical genius character, his lines and personality contribute to the tone of comedy sometimes his lines are cynical and cold because he is a brain dead kid programmer but in some cases he has his aura of maturity that this show needs.\\n\\n\r\nMisaki is the dumb character with big boobs who is the gag character in this show at first glance.What this show manages to do with her character and what impressed me is her development. From a gag character she manages to become a reliable person who everybody can ask for her help.\\n\\n\r\nJin is your typical handsome guy which every girl falls for him with no brain just looks. Wrong this show manages to explore his character so good that he becomes another person and starts to care and see the real people who care for him and love him.This resemble a real life situation and the viewer can relate to him. Also his actions influences among characters all across the show add a tone of maturity for the story.\\n\\n\r\nThe minor characters have a good influence too in this show and help with the development and decisions the main characters are supposed to face along their growth in this anime.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation 8/10\\n\r\nThe rich and beautifull colors are a perfect fit for the unique characters this show uses.\\n\\n\r\nSound 8/10\\n\r\nThe opening song is rich and full of feels and I found myself murmuring the lyrics.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 9/10\\n\r\nI laughed, I cried, I was happy , I was sad, I saw a great slice of life anime mixed with comedy and drama all that stuff executed from a mature perspective for the viewer.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 9/10\\n\r\nThe message that this show delivered to the viewer in the form of a light comedy about life, sacrifices , family,friends and love was astonishing and had a impactfull blow to me as a viewer.\\n\r\nWell done JC.Staff another good anime about slice of life in which I found myself crying, laughing and shouting at the last episode:\u201d This was a great experience and I enjoyed every minute of it\u201d.",

            "content": "\"We found ourselves in conflict with each other many times. There were hard times when we wanted to run away or give up. But it was only because that rain fell, that the seeds of our emotions could sprout. And the flowers of deeper friendship could bloom.\"\r\nFrom start to finish I felt at home while watching this, I could feel the connection that the characters made overtime, and their hardships that they endured together. If there was one word to describe this anime, it would be \"warm.\"\r\nSakurasou, a place where the trouble kids go. At least that's what they have you thinking at first. Butreally, Sakurasou is a home of very talented individuals, and perverts. Talented perverts? Yeah that's a thing at Sakurasou. Anyways, Sakurasou no Pet na Kanojo is a great anime about a bunch of \"trouble\" kids that go on many mis-adventures and explore new facets of their lives. \\n\\n\r\nSorata being one of the first people to enter Sakurasou for his year only has one mission: leave Sakurasou. And at first this is his only objective; until he meets Mashiro, a world renowned artist who has skills beyond her peers, and also is a savant when it comes to art itself, as she has a very hard time doing things herself. Sorata is taken back by her ambition and stubbornness toward her art and starts changing his goals from there on. From there Sakurasou introduces new faces that will bring on many great laughs; it's a trip that I would take again.\\n\\n\r\nAnd I honestly loved this anime for it's art-style, it really had great emotional moments that brought me closer wanting more. The OP's were both great and the voice acting work was well done.\\n\\n\r\nOverall I had a great time watching this. From start to finish I was enveloped with different emotions. I would laugh hysterically one moment, then the next would be filled with melancholy, but it's blended so good that it just works.. I highly recommend this anime to anyone who enjoys a great Rom-Com!",

            "content": "The plot of \"Pet Girl\" revolves around a group of outsiders that got themselves banished from living in regular student dorms. Instead they live together in \"Sakurasou\", which is where the school's problem childern reside. The story starts, when a new student: Shiina Mashiro a world-class professional painter joins the group as she followed her newly found calling to be a manga artist to japan. Similarly to Mashiro all the main characters have a background in a somewhat artistic field, be it writing, drawing, acting, animating or programming. Together they all visit an Art school, so the protagonists are essentially a bunch of artists. Asthe story unfolds we follow these misfits around their lives, get acquinted to their wishes, problems, ambitions and last but not least insecurities.\\n\\n\r\nAs it's typical for a slice-of-life the story relies heavily on the charm of its main cast. Especially the main protagonist \u2013 Sorata Kanda \u2013 is obviously designed to be relatable. He is unsure of himself, his abilities and his place in the world and personality-wise rather mild-mannered and considerate. Over the course of the story he struggles with his calling and a reoccuring theme is the unfairness in the distribution of talent. Hardworking and diligent but ultimately untalented characters see themselves next to much more naturally gifted people, which causes a lot of friction among the main cast. This is in fact THE theme of the show, which is the driving force behind most of the main conflicts. (Good news: They don't take the easy way out.)\\n\r\nOverall the cast is amiable and their friendship comes across as genuine as the characters harmonize well with each other. Clich\u00e9s are mostly avoided and implemented well if used.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are sometimes very emotional and consequently the drama might seem constructed if not forced at times but this can be understood in the context that sakurasou is the home of a group of artists, which maybe tend to be more emotionally oriented and sensitive. Often I could not really relate to their problems or why the characters form an opinion or make a certain decision, but this happens very often.\\n\\n\r\nAnother very big point in the show is romance (duh..). Personally I found the romance parts to be well-written to the point of being genuinly endearing at times. However I can see, why some would claim it was cheesy; sometimes they really lay of thick. If typical shy-cutesy anime romance is not for you, then you will probably not like it.\\n\\n\r\nThe comedy part of rom-com is well done as well. The humor is light and family-friendly and the snarky comments of the protagonist made me laugh a couple of times. Still one should keep in mind that the story goes more in the direction of drama rather than comedy. The humorous moments might be sweet but they are few.\\n\\n\r\nFrom a technical point of view there is little to say. The animation is good but not oustanding and the music is pretty forgettable as well.",

            "content": "Home, is a subjective term. It holds different meaning and evoke different emotions to different people.\r\nTo cut to the chase, Sakurasou is a lifeless word that has been given the definition of 'home'. Sakurasou no Pet na Kanojo is a story of a student dorm consisting of peculiar and problematic high school students. A place where they belongs and can say \" I'm home \" and to be greeted by \" Welcome home \". The whole anime has interesting characters with weird quirks that lures people in, but most chose to stay to behold their unseen weaker side and its effect on their friendship, forthe worse or for the better as the story progresses.\\n\\n\r\nOne thing that stands in the spotlight is the amazing characters development, to learn a feeling that is completely new, to concede to the feelings that they afraid of, and to create memories, a lot of them. To live in the moment doing stupid things that they didn't know would be fun and to learn more about themselves, and others, slowly giving Sakurasou the shape of home, a true home that can accept any grievance and happiness, the wonderland of awkward and fun memories.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, that is not all. The story also depicts the bitter and sweetness of achieving and losing something but it's a mere cover that brings out the true feelings and kindness from those who stayed by your side. It hurts to have failed even when you have given all the efforts and hardwork more than anyone else but it's also important to know that hard work will pay off, one way or another. There will always be someone who can relate to you but still doing their hardest to keep it going. This is one of the art of friendship, real friends are there when you don't want them to leave and stood by you even if you don't want them to.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, despite the slight fanservice at the beginning, it's also composed of cringe comedy and shy romance at its finest. But, the story managed to level up a bit and portray an emotional side of it, which might leave you crying in the end. That's just how good it is.\\n\\n\r\nExtra remarks, this anime has been one hell of an emotional roller coaster for me. And, you should see it for yourself, the charm of it.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

This anime was filled with a roller coaster ride of emotions and it isn't the typical cliche anime (which i don't mind watching) and this stands out above the most. Honestly it deserves another season and for a person who doesn't read manga's, this actually might make me consider reading the light novels. If you're thinking about watching this.. WATCH IT, you will not regret it!\r\nStory, 10: Honestly i don't know what to say about this but wow.\r\nArt, 9: The art in theanime is great and as you're watching it through the episodes, it will get better and better!\\n\\n\r\nSound 9: Usually when i watch animes, the opening and ending is the part i usually skip but in this, i would actually listen through it and especially the soundtracks used in the episodes, it makes it a more emotional moment to cherish.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter, 10: character progress leaves a mark when you're finished with the anime because it shows the importance of friendships and how strong a bond can be.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment, 10: I thoroughly enjoyed this anime so much that i had binged it in less than 3 days! I don't regret this and i never will!\\n\\n\r\nOverall this was just an amazing experience and a tear jerker. I would 100% recommend this and I understand that not everyone will enjoy it but let me just say that if you choose to watch this.. be prepared for the ninjas hiding with onions around your room! \\n",

            "content": "This was a fantastic anime in the sense that it shows the struggles of high school life in Japan as well as the difficulties in regular life through trying to chase their dreams. While it starts out very comedic, there are plenty of dramatic slice-of-life portions for an even balance as the show plays out. While the male characters acted really scummy at times, they are depicting high school kids that do not have a complete understanding of their emotions. As for Mashiro and Misaki being exceptional in their respective fields and out of reach of the other members of Sakurasou, it shows the strengthof the regular members working as hard as they can to make your dreams come true. The raw emotion during failure and the positive vibe during success are captured extremely well. The bonds that the residents of Sakurasou have versus the standard dorm students is powerful and the traditional graduation song really encapsulates that idea. It was a beautiful story.",

            "content": "**This review only covers the characters and story, and is spoiler free minus some thematic elements**\r\nSakurasou might have actually been good if the light novel tropes were gone and it was a romance drama more than just a drama. Most of the characters hangups make for a good setup but for one, there is a conceptual flaw in the drama; and two, the main character is badly written. \r\nThe conceptual flaw is that the story strongly pushes the idea that is Sorata's indecisiveness is the main cause of conflict, when in reality it is his pride and feelings toward Mashiro. The author obviously wanted self-agencyto be one of the main themes of the show, but that aspect is the least interesting part of the entire situation. If it instead focused on the quandary of being in love of a severely autistic person, or the REAL issue at hand, Sorata's pride, the show could have been a great drama. You might be thinking, \"What if they address these issues later on in the story?\" If this was my first time watching it I would probably give it the benefit of the doubt as well, but they never dip into that territory. Instead, the show seemingly insists that the only way you can be in a relationship with someone is if you are just as talented as they are, which is a totally selfish and narcissistic way of looking at things. And all that shit about struggles of being in love with a mentally ill person? Completely swept under the rug. In fact, the show fetishizes it, the very title likening it to having a girl as a pet.\\n\\n\r\nThe other problem with the show is that Sorata is not treated as a character, but as a light novel protagonist. This means he has to always be a retarded beta-male cuck who is the straight man to everyone's 'kooky hijinks'. He is nearly incapable of normal conversations, instead switching from unfunny straightman, to Gary Stu, or angsty teen, whichever the plot needs at the moment. While he does manage to read in between the lines occasionally, it is only when its convenient to the plot and otherwise he is as dumb as a brick. \\n\\n\r\nThe fact that this show even has a straight man is another one of its biggest flaws. The show is always trying to make jokes based around the odd behavior of the eccentric cast, but the problem is: it's not funny, and it has never been funny. It usually goes: Mashiro repeats herself or says something misleading, and Sorata, at the top of his lungs, scolds her. The jokes are so formulaic and on-the-nose that I find myself sighing more than laughing. What's more, scenes like these also negatively impact the sense of romantic chemistry between the two. I understand the idea of using comedy to keep the tone from getting too heavy, but when there's writing of this level, humor is best left on the cutting room floor. \\n\\n\r\nI could go into more depth about it's use of tired light novel tropes, but if you recognize that phrase you probably already know what I'm talking about. Overall the scenario has promise, but the show fails to be anything more than angsty self-insert light novel trash.",

The themes are what we experience on a day to day basis, and I related to that through the anime. Character development was through the maturity of each person, with a touch of comedy. I absolutely loved how they incorporated that aspect.\r\nSecondly, enjoyment. I have enjoyed viewing every second of this anime, I don't even skip the opening and endings. This animeis very engaging in the respect of comedic value and what constitutes a \"slice of life\"  and RomCom anime. Every episode was filled with emotions which honestly felt like a rollercoaster ride.\\n\r\nLastly, imma just say how good this is by saying I ranked this my second favourite anime while I was HALFWAY through the series.\\n\r\nAight that was my short and sweet review, if you haven't watched this I recommend that you do without hesitation.",

            "content": "This is my first Review and I will do my best to NOT write any spoilers.\r\nSakurasou no Pet na Kanojo is an OUTSTANDING Anime! I really enjoyed every single minute of it even though it is a romcom (that i usually don't really like).\r\nIn the following lines i will go through every aspect of the show:\r\n*****Story*****\r\nThe story has its own unique ups and downs. Sometimes it feels a little bit boring but most of the time you can really enjoy it. The comedy part was done really well! I had so many moments where i just had to pause the episode because i was laughingso much. The \"school\" genre wasn't in the main focus but even without it you knew really well that everything existed only because of the school they went to. Sometimes you could predict the next moments or scenes but it was limited. In my opinion the Ending was really satisfying and no plot holes where left open. It also wasn't an abrupt or forced Ending that no one likes.\\n\\n\r\nRating: 8/10\\n\\n\\n\r\n*****Art*****\\n\\n\r\nThe beauty of this Anime is indescribeable. Every single frame was drawn with pure love, at least it looks like it. The backgrounds where astonishingly beautiful and everything felt like it's real. Nothing looked like it doesn't belong into this Anime and everything fit well together. The animations where fluid and even the 3D Animations that are shown at one point looked really good and well done. The creators made many scenes very funny using simple techniques like using an dot or just a white circle for eyes if the person is shocked and because of that it made every comedy scene even funnier.\\n\\n\r\nRating: 9/10\\n\\n\\n\r\n*****Sound*****\\n\\n\r\nFirst of all the OP and ED songs:\\n\\n\r\nAt first i thought they are really annoying and skipped both the first couple episodes. But after i have watched it again and again i suddenly started to like it. They are really catchy songs and even if you don't sing the lyrics you will follow the music with your feet or head. The OP and also the ED song changed three times but because they sound very smiliar there is no problem at all. \\n\\n\r\nThe rest of the Anime:\\n\\n\r\nSometimes the music was really fitting and even enhancing the tension or current mood. The chosen voice actors were really fitting with the characters and personality they resemble. When there was someone speaking in the background you could always tell them apart and knew exactly which character that was.\\n\r\nThe overall sound effects where chosen very well and have always enhanced the situation.\\n\\n\r\nRating: 10/10\\n\\n\\n\r\n*****Character*****\\n\\n\r\nThe chosen characters are INCREDIBLE! So many different personalities which matched together so god damn good. For example: If you liked Inori from Gulity Crown, then you will LOVE one of the MC in this Anime. No one had it's flaws and every character was explained really well. They've reacted very realistic and sometimes made me laugh really hard haha. They cannot be compared with one another because everyone is just a special individual that no one could replace.  I even added one of the MC to my favourite characters because i loved them so much. You will definitely remember at least some of them in the future. At first some characters seemed really random but after you've come to know them even more you will understand how they feel and why they are like this. \\n\\n\r\nRating: 10/10\\n\\n\\n\r\n*****Enjoyment*****\\n\\n\r\nI have absolutely no reason to give this series something else than a solid 10/10. It made me laugh and even cry many times and that's exactly what a perfect anime offers! It really made my day and i just could'nt stop watching sometimes because i really wanted to see more character development and more funny moments! It's definitely worth it to AT LEAST give it a try. If there is a chance that it will ever licensed in my country i will buy every copy they have and watch it for the rest of my life! (Sorry, i just had to say that) Im sure that there is no problem in rewatching it either. After you've seen it you WILL remember it for a very long time. \\n\\n\r\nRating: 10/10\\n\\n\\n\r\nSakurasou no pet na Kanojo was quite the ride and I\u2019ll sincerely miss this series. Even though it won\u2019t happen, I\u2019d love to see a second season. This show is as funny as it is sad, as it is heartwarming as it is beautiful. If you love a strong bond between friends and a little bit of romance you should definitely give it a try!\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL RATING: 10/10\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Literally all my friends wanted to drop it after watching the first episode, yet at last found the whole anime as a great work. Well, I agree with them. \r\nDiligence is a good thing, but it in many situations leads to jealousy. Somehow like Madoka, benevolence sometimes just doesn't work out. \r\nFor an anime in this genre, I think the expression of emotion is the most important part, and this anime really does well. It's a very subjective thing, but personally I can feel with the characters mostly. Not infrequently that what I want to say is perfectly said by the characters in the show.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are done really well and deep. Each character has his or her own story, struggle and progress. Yes, everyone, even including many subsidiary characters like the teacher. The interaction between characters (except the triangle relation) really interests me. \\n\\n\r\nOne of its strong points is the 23 episode: graduation scene. This pinnacle is handled very well, which is indeed a hard work. The emotion is expressed genuinely and sincerely, instead of being artificial. \\n\\n\r\nI'm not a good judge of art. Despite this, I can feel that the paintings in the show (painted by Shiina, the talented drawer) are really good. The music and CV performance are decent as well, especially Ryuunosuke and his maid-chan (as they are both from Horie Yui, who also performed in Kanon, LB!, Bake and many other series). \\n\\n\r\nTotally I enjoyed this show very much. I give it a 9 because I only give 10 to shows that have really strong impact on me. This is influenced by many factors. (e.g. Clannad is my first anime and it really shapes my view on all other anime) As a show, Sakurasou is really a great anime to watch, except the ecchi scenes in the first episode.",

I felt as if I could already begin to predict what the characters would be like and felt as if I had the gist from watching the first episode but man was I wrong. As I continued to watch each episode I felt myself being drawn in. The art was wonderful and the writing was very impressive, I was instantly hooked. Sakurasou is a verygood romance anime which is based heavily on comedy but actually has some heavy moments which comes as a relief. There's a really great balance of comedy and drama and just plenty of emotions being played on which I found myself to be completely immersed in. I could genuinely understand everything a character felt and it was as if I shared their feelings, they felt real. Not only is Sakurasou's plot brilliant but I also found it to be very relate-able. The problems encountered by the character's weren't overly complicated issues but problems that anyone could experience which made it all the more easier to really connect. Overall the anime was pretty much perfect and I couldn't find a single thing to dislike about it. The character's are simply lovable and very understandable and the series has enough fuzzy feelings floating around to carbonate the worlds ocean 10x over, truly a must-watch.",

It\u2019s unrelentingly happy at times, and crushing otherwise \u2013 a show with such a huge amount of energy as this has very little need for a middle ground.

For our protagonist Sorata, what is initially a struggle to fit into a school dorm reserved for his school\u2019s most eccentric of odd-balls soon becomes a struggle to manage the disappointments of failure, when oftentimes he is surrounded by success. His main love interest Shiina is, by contrast, a girl who despite her intense social awkwardness is an undisputed maestro in the world of art. \\n\\n\r\nSorata and Shiina are the true heart of the story, as Shiina comes to realise her true feelings for the Sorata, as he shows her the world outside of art which she has never truly known. But the surrounding cast however are incredibly strong, on par or even more compelling than the actual main characters. That\u2019s a good thing too, as the story of Sakurasou is devoted to its characters more than any external events. Aoyama\u2019s pursuit of a career as voice actress is given a lot of attention because it truly is a tale of dogged determination and persistence in the face of adversity. Her own character is so fleshed out that I you can easily see how she, not Shiina, could have been the focus of Sorata\u2019s affection. Shiina\u2019s character is unique and intriguing, and let\u2019s not forget utterly adorable, yet rather as was the case for OreImo with the Kuroneko/Kirino dilemma, the manner in which Aoyama is inevitably discarded is bound to frustrate some of the fans. Let that not put you off though, for there is an equally well realised side-story to accompany, or even supersede, the main relationship: that of further Sakurasou inhabitants Jin and Misaki. They are both besotted with each other, yet struggle to establish a meaningful relationship between Misaki\u2019s success as an anime creator and Jin\u2019s unwillingness to, as he sees it, \u2018taint Misaki\u2019. Their relationship is just as well-developed and emotional as that of the main\u2019s - tumultuous to say the least, but emotionally far more raw. \\n\\n\r\nThe production values of Sakurasou are certainly one of this anime\u2019s further selling points. Exquisite art backgrounds and a vibrant use of warm colours are Sakurasou\u2019s norm, fitting given the Sakura (cherry blossom tree) is such a bright and colourful motif. The focus on pinks and purples tinges the anime with romantic and sombre tones that fully complement the emotional affairs of the plot. These colours that provide the warmth to accentuate the uplifting moments are equally at home in the anime\u2019s gut-wrenchingly sad moments.\\n\\n\r\nSound wise, both OPs and EDs are great additions, the second ED being my favourite with catchiness and synth-tracks galore. I would not go so far as to say the backing music was extravagant, but it was certainly atmospheric. The music and sound design does a fitting job of enhancing the range of the emotions as they develop throughout the show. Overall there is also much to admire in the talent of the staff, the music producers, the artists, but especially the voice actors. Shiina\u2019s voice actor, Kayano Ai, in her subdued and deadpan delivery of her character accentuates the extent to which Shiina feels estranged from the community that surrounds her. She is reserved and yet, if you will pardon the pun, she shines when on select occasion she brings to Shiina\u2019s voice a raw tenderness, so utterly contrasting her standard delivery I find myself earnestly bewitched. I\u2019m focusing on the sound aspect more so than I usually would because honestly the strength of the voice actors and their delivery brings so much to the appeal of the characters and the anime as a whole. \\n\\n\r\nSakurasou no Pet is a bright and colourful anime populated with a variety of quirky characters bounding with enthusiasm. Yet at the same time it does not let itself succumb to a rosy view of the world that would distil the drama. For its colourful innocence and the occasional, inevitable fanservice, Sakurasou takes a firmly mature approach in its portrayal of Sorata and his friends as they enter the beginnings of adulthood. It\u2019s what I could only describe as an \u2018emotional rollercoaster\u2019: I laughed and laughed at its unrelenting joie de vivre, and cried and cried as the characters are forced to fight to achieve their dreams. \\n",

            "content": "One of my favourite animes of all time, simply because of how simple the anime is. It's the kind of anime you'd love if you had a speck of romance left in you, or if you are somebody who enjoys slice of life. The story isn't too elaborate with no clear moving plot at times, but that's to say for most of the genre. It's definitely part drama, as some parts will have you held up in suspense simply because of how well executed the scenes are. The art is amazing, making sense because one of the main themes the anime revolves around is art.\\n\\n\r\nWith classy openings and endings, and developed characters, this is simply an anime you don't want to miss. However, if you despise the romance/comedy genre and slice of life genre, you may want to stay away from this anime, but you never know, it's an amazing anime altogether.\\n\\n\r\nmashiro shiina is the best waifu ftw huehuehue :)",

            "content": "Romantic comedies have generally been a genre that annoy or confuse me, especially when drama is introduced in its formula. The result is more often than not an amalgamation of mixed emotions ranging from blind love to complete angst. In one second, characters seem to be resolving issues with one another, and in the very next, they act as if all previous resolutions were never even brought up. With so many mental 180\u2019s going on, I tend to call romantic comedies the \u201cidentity crisis\u201d genre. Sakurasou no Pet na Kanojo unfortunately, does not deviate much from this formula.\r\nStory (7.5/10):\r\nKanda Sorata is a second-year student atthe well-known Suimei University of the Arts\u2019 high school branch. Sorata is a typical kid; he\u2019s a nice guy and all, but nothing about him scream \u201cspecial.\u201d One day, he gets kicked out of the school\u2019s normal dorms for housing stray kittens, and in order to keep on living in campus range, he must transfer over to the notorious Sakurasou dorms, an apartment house-like complex that is known for housing the more\u2026flamboyant personalities of the high school. The story throws us right into the situation he\u2019s in, with necessary backstory put off, but not forgotten. This is done in order to introduce us to one of the heroines of the show, Shiina Mashiro, a silent, seemingly emotionless girl whom Sorata is tasked to take care of due to her inability of performing any basic domestic task. \\n\\n\r\nAnd now we\u2019ve got all the tropes set up, and so the train takes off.\\n\\n\r\nIn its entirety, the story of Sakurasou isn\u2019t all that bad. With 24 episodes, there was room to get a lot done, and to its credit, Sakurasou delivered just what the genre is so good at potraying: raw teenage emotion. Although the story may diverge from its main \u201cplotline\u201d here and there, the core of the story involves Sorata finding what he\u2019s going to do with his future. Parts of the series play out like a coming of age/ slice of life tale, but the focus on Sorata\u2019s growth is often clouded by conflict or romantic issues. Granted, as a romantic comedy, these elements need to be included. However, one can\u2019t help but to desire execution that might come off as more\u2026mature. Contrary to how many people laud it, the show\u2019s story really does not stand out from the genre. Just about every plot point or conflict that arises has been done before and done better in a certain way. The comedy is present, but most of the humor was too dry, cutesy or forgettable. When the show took a turn for the dramatic, the only way any conversation would progress would be through incoherent yelling, crying or physical altercations. Additionally, some key plot points that I will not bring up for the sake of spoilers were either dealt with or resolved in a less than favorable manner. Pacing was painfully slow at times, mostly because the creators wanted to nail in some themes and messages to its viewers. Unfortunately, they tried a bit too hard in that department. \\n\\n\r\nHowever, it\u2019s not all doom and gloom for Sakurasou\u2019s story. Since the show takes the viewpoint of your average John Doe, the experience is much more relatable than a standard romantic comedy. The show doesn\u2019t sell out to become a harem, and at the same time, it explores some very relatable and understandable themes such as dealing with those who are far more skillful than you and coping with failure, while having a few memorable romantic moments scattered here or there. To put it in perspective, it at least tries to be different, and it sure did its best do differentiate itself from being doomed to obscurity.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, the story of Sakurasou aspired to be different, and was minutely successful at doing so. The show presents enough conflict and messages to be considered reflective, but most of its substance hardly scratches the surface.\\n\\n\r\nArt (8/10):\\n\\n\r\nWhen I first glanced at the Fall 2012 anime chart, I was baffled to see JC Staff tackle three 2-cour series at the same time. Along with Little Busters and Bakuman 3, I was going in expecting messy animation and lazy artwork. Instead, I was pleasantly surprised at the result. Since the setting of the anime is at an arts school and several of the characters are genius artists, the crew at JC Staff tried their best to make some pieces of \u201cart\u201d look as mesmerizing and atmospheric as possible. For the most part, kudos to the animation crew for doing so very well throughout much of the series. Animation throughout the series is decent, but there\u2019s nothing really spectacular about it. Character designs were done well, but could\u2019ve been a less generic.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, there\u2019s only so much an animation crew can do when probably burdened with a time limit, pressure and budget. To say the least, most of the setting seems rather dead or generic. Despite being the branch to an arts university, seldom does the series show off that their school is in fact an arts school. Sure we see an art room here and there, but for the most part, the school setting feels and looks rather generic, and the Sakurasou dorm, although having its own charm and sentimental value, is also nothing too special for the most part. \\n\\n\r\nSound (9/10):\\n\\n\r\nEither I\u2019ve been getting soft with the sound section or the shows that I have watched recently all have very good sound sets. The OST of Sakurasou isn\u2019t as memorable as other excellent soundtracks, but it has its fair share of fitting tracks. With over 50 tracks spanning 24 episodes, the diversity of the OST range from the cutesy, yet memorable \u201cChange Clothes\u201d to a piano arrangement of the show\u2019s first ending, Days of Dash. Speaking of opening and ending sequences, the series has got quite a few of them. From the poppy and catchy first opening, \"Kimi ga Yume wo Tsuretekita,\u201d to the ballad of its second ending, \u201cPrime number ~Kimi to Deaeru Hi\u201d, the series has its fair share of great songs and OST tracks.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, what really made the show\u2019s sound stand out was its magnificent voice acting. While important roles such as Matsuoka Yoshitsugu\u2019s Sorata to Kayano Ai\u2019s Mashiro among others gave very strong performances, Nakatsu Mariko\u2019s performance of Aoyama Nanami was absolutely fantastic. Standing in par with the other great voice acting performance in 2012, Sawashiro Miyuki\u2019s Inaba Himeko (Kokoro Connect), Nakatsu\u2019s rendition of a shy, yet strong girl with a charming accent won my vote as one of the best I\u2019ve heard in a while. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters (6/10):\\n\\n\r\nIn any romantic comedy, the characters more often than not make the story. In a rather plotless storyline format, series have to rely on strong characterization to drive the viewers to continue watching rather than falling back on story direction. Sakurasou\u2019s cast is one that is reminiscent of a juvenilely executed Honey and Clover. \\n\\n\r\nStarting off with our protagonist, Sorata, who is just about as plain as you can get, the progression of his character is a model that unfortunately, many of the characters in this series follow after. Sorata is built up with your \u201caverage Joe\u201d type of archetype; he struggles with finding his identity and in doing so, he faces many difficulties that are easily relatable to. That\u2019s great and all; however, the problem with his character isn\u2019t much his personality as it is how the writers decided how he makes decisions or faces obstacles. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I admire the attempts to portray Sorata as an adolescent who will never give up, no matter how much adversity he\u2019s faced; however, his development and consistency as a character is mediocre at best. Like how many shounen or shoujo romcoms end up playing out, his character takes one step forward only to take two steps back. Constantly throughout the series, he finds a resolve to one of his internal worries and fears only to completely disregard it within a few episodes for the sake of extra drama. The rest of the cast isn\u2019t much better, since not only do they follow this \u201cone step forward two steps back\u201d development, but most of them are even more archetypal than Sorata. Mashiro is one of the heroines of the series, and the writers decided to try their darnedest to make this artistic \u201cgenius\u201d feel so inhuman that by the time that they expect the viewer to see her as a person rather than a distant entity, there\u2019s no quality or trait to her character that defines her as a person rather than as a simple archetype. Other main characters like Jin, the typical cool guy, or Misaki, the hyperactive senior, are all characters that have been done many times and better in several different series. It\u2019s not a favorable situation when so many of the show\u2019s main characters can be characterized in less than a sentence.\\n\\n\r\nThankfully, the show has two bright spots: Ryuunosuke and Nanami. Ryuunosuke, albeit with his generic buildup, is essentially a better-done version of Mashiro. As a computer genius, you\u2019d expect a snobby, anti-social nature to begin with, and that\u2019s what we get. However, unlike with Mashiro, we get to see his character grow thanks to another character introduced later in the series. He grows as a person, but at the same time, he doesn\u2019t fundamentally change who he is. It was a welcome breath of fresh air from all of the nonsensical melodrama and identity crises the rest of the cast suffered from. Saving the best character for last, Aoyama Nanami is to Sorata as Ryuunosuke is to Mashiro. The development of her character also follows that of a normal, struggling individual who works very hard in order to make her dreams a reality; however, that\u2019s the extent of similarity the two characters share. Nanami only steps forward throughout most of the series. Her resolve is clear, and she takes into account her self-reflection rather than tossing it aside. It\u2019s a shame that the series didn\u2019t focus more on her as the series neared its close, but what\u2019s done is done. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, looking at the cast of Sakurasou is like trying to find a diamond in a coal mine. Within it there are a few characters that are pretty well done, but you have to bear through the search before being rewarded. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (7/10):\\n\\n\r\nI can\u2019t really say I completely enjoyed watching the show, but at the same time, it wasn\u2019t unbearable. Several episodes dragged out boringly, while others flew by pretty fast. It was a rather inconsistent series overall, but it had its moments. \\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\\n\r\nI have to admit, it is very difficult to pull off a romantic comedy because you have to mix so many elements together in order to be successful. It has to be lighthearted, entertaining and serious at the same time. Very few anime are able to pull this off, and those that do are shows that are often aimed towards an older demographic. With that said, Sakurasou no Pet na Kanojo comes off as a bundle of good ideas and concepts that doesn\u2019t do much with what it potentially has. At times it attempts to explore multiple viewpoints of love, but at other times, it completely ditches said concept for another such as the struggles of adolescence. Instead of having these themes build on each other, they end up working against each other because of execution that demands melodrama over self-reflection. Nonetheless, the series has great production values and will definitely be entertaining for those that love the genre. Not really a series that fell under my preferences, but still an interesting ride. \\n\\n\r\nAverage score: 7.6/10 \\n\r\nWeighted score: 5/10 (Average, give it a go if you\u2019re into this genre. Otherwise, I\u2019d pass on it)\\n\\n\r\n(if the rating confuses you, take a glimpse at my rating system on my profile for clarifications)\\n",

            "content": "This is my first review, so don't expect anything special with my review, I'm just voicing my opinion.\r\nAt first, I thought it was one of those typical high school animes, where everything goes the way the MC and the supporting characters wants, where nothing really bad happens, just enjoying their happy little school life. But surprisingly, this anime focused on the concept of belonging, our main character first didn't feel like he belonged, since he wanted to get out of Sakurasou, an old dorm full of weird people, he wanted to escape from the crazy stuff happening within and going back to a normal schoollife, but as the anime progresses, he feels more attached to the people and Sakurasou, it made a great effort at portraying the sense of belonging to place, in the remaining half of the anime the building was about to get demolished, but they didn't want that, so they tried their best to prevent it from happening, and I liked the end result of it.\\n\\n\r\nIMO, this anime threw a bit of Clannad AfterStory into the storyline, where our MC and supporting characters go through real life issues through hardwork, error and trial, though they fail at some point, they still have their dedication to reach that goal. Although it doesn't pass the barrier to the adult society, it portrays some aspects of real life issues outside of highschool. I like how not everything went as planned, which is a good thing because it shows how cruel reality is outside their happy little highschool life.\\n\\n\r\nOverall this anime was enjoyable, I gave it a 7/10 on the score thing, but my real overall score is 7.5/10. I guess this is a must watch anime, a great anime, but not amaaaaaaaaaaazing.",

            "content": "Story: At the start of the anime it had Peaceful days, Character introductions, Calmness before the storm. At the first part of the middle it had a parody like feeling and some hint of conflicts(drama). At the second part of the middle the conflicts started and the anime started getting serious. At the ending most conflicts got solved only because the anime was probably hinting for a second season. You can say it has a clitche feeling to it at the start but that was only to build up impact for the serious part of the anime. Even I was expecting a harem when Istarted watching but at the end of the middle part I was feeling like one of the characters. I also felt like the ending(last episode not the whole ending) kinda missed something but if you think there is gonna be a second season it doesn't really matter. All in all its normal at first then seriously interesting at the end especially if you can relate to the characters and their conflicts(hardships).\\n\r\n10 for its originality(rarely see anime go from normal to seriously interesting because usually anime stays the same start to end)\\n\\n\r\nArt: It was great for an anime but what was shockingly awesome was Mashiro's art(all of her creations including the ones with Misaki)\\n\r\nAlso 10 for its originality(2D plus a little 3D and art that can be understood)\\n\\n\r\nSound: It fitted the situation and was nicely put together. Sorry but even now i have no idea what the OP is for but still it was nice to hear. The ED was good, if you listen to it a couple of times you'll see yourself bobbing your head.\\n\r\n10 because it didn't lack anything\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: Even if you are not like any of the characters doesn't mean that you won't be able to relate to them. What makes them better is because they are in sync with the plot meaning they have their own hardships in life and they don't have an easy solution to solve it. Also they don't accept reality easily or give up because they can't get the results they want. They get their problems solved because there isn't just one of them. They help each other through their genius ways and make the best results out of it. If one of them fails in life the others come to cheer them up or try to help fix the problem. Also even if you say the characters are kinda clitche for a strange group well it is because they are the common characters in real life that isn't accepted by society today even if you deny it, it is true. Lastly you don't go find original characters in a slice of life anime! Go watch fantasy, or historical if you want original characters!\\n\r\n10 because it gives what it suppose to give!\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Well because I could relate I actually cried in the end. And even Clannad - After Story (also a Great anime) only could get a tear out of me. Full enjoyment and very realistic reaction for the MC. No Complaints!\\n\r\n10 because I cried after 5 years!\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 10 because it was actually kinda realistic",

            "content": "This series began with the tipically story a boy who has a great heart , a girl who in the start of the series she don`t like the boy and the most important character (for me) a foreigner girl who appeared with a beatiful scene and the final its obvious that the spectator know it in the first moment of the series began. The facts that  happen to the boy and the other people of the series is irrelevant the important of the series is that it can break your hearth in a moment, in a scene, this scene its indescribable. If you haveread all, i expect yes , now are you thinking i have to see all the serie only for one scene? and I say absolutely YES no only for this scene but its the more important and beatiful  scene. And the final of the series its soo moody that you can cry.",
