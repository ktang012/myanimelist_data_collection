            "content": "\u201cI have no choice but to pretend I am a warrior who knows no fear.\u201d\r\nTruer OP lyrics have rarely been attributed so well to an anime series.\r\nFifteen children are tricked into participating in a battle for Earth itself. However, don\u2019t be fooled by video clips of huge mecha fighting each other \u2013 this is not a classic mecha series with epic space battles and the like. Instead, each child who comes to pilot the mecha known as Zearth faces not only the struggle to save the world but also a struggle of their own. What do they fight for? Some fight for their loved ones.Others fight for themselves. A few see it as their duty. Some don\u2019t know why and struggle to find a reason to look death in the face for the sake of complete strangers.\\n\\n\r\nEach story arc deals with the next pilot set to fight on Earth\u2019s behalf. Each child has a story to tell, a conflict of some sort to work out before they fight. One wants to prove himself to his workaholic father. Another deals with bullying because of her mother\u2019s reputation. Another grapples with his disappeared dad while supporting his three younger siblings. And so on and so forth. At first, getting to know all the kids all at once is overwhelming, but as each one is explored and developed, they become unique and well fleshed out. Each arc then becomes a \u201ccoming of age\u201d story for each of the kids, culminating in their final battles as they reflect on their lives and the world they fight for. In the meantime, the group of children draw unwanted attention to themselves from the government and military and they must deal with the implications of their actions.\\n\\n\r\nAs you can imagine, it\u2019s heavy on drama and it gets amped up even further as the story progresses and the children learn more about this twisted \u201cgame\u201d (but to discuss them here would be very spoilery). Bring tissues.\\n\\n\r\nFor the more technical merits of Bokurano, it fares pretty well. Animation and art aren\u2019t overly detailed and there aren\u2019t any bright, glaring colours. Realism is what the animators seemed to be aiming for. Still, it slips up here and there, and sometimes obviously so. I also caught some re-used animation a few times, too. The mecha are done in CG and while it\u2019s noticeable, it doesn\u2019t stick out too much in a bad way, and Zearth and some of the other mecha designs are well rendered.\\n\\n\r\nThe OP and the two EDs are all sung by Chiaki Ishikawa. The OP, \u201cUninstall\u201d, carries a rather haunting melody and is well-suited to the anime. The EDs are, unfortunately, more forgettable. Still, it\u2019s notable that the lyrics of each song fit the anime to a T, so the translated lyrics are well worth paying attention to. The background music is, for the most part, unremarkable \u2013 not noteworthy but not bad, either. I have no complaints about the seiyuu as they all did a great job.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Bokurano was a surprisingly strong series that gives viewers plenty to think about. No magic tricks here, no fairy tale endings. Nevertheless, despite all the hardships the characters face, I can\u2019t help but feel a bit hopeful, like I should appreciate life a little more and all the good things in this world. After all, we never know when it\u2019ll all be over.",

            "content": "I posted this review on a forum as a recommendation to someone who was looking for a depressing and slice of life anime, and I was told by two people that my review was able to get them to watch the series and I believe they enjoyed it, so I decided to share my review here in hopes of intriguing more people into watching it. \r\nThoughts: This anime cannot be completely enjoyed unless you have the patience to watch it all the way through. Even if you do not have much patience, I still think the first episode ends in a way that compels thewatchers to continue watching because it really does leave you at a cliffhanger. I would go more into detail, but I really rather not spoil it for anyone. Even though Slice of Life is not one of the genres for this anime, I still think it has its moments where this genre is applied. The children have to go through a lot, and there are many times throughout the anime where you feel sorry for them, since they lose, let's say, something very close to them after each battle. Again, I do not think the first episode will be as exciting if I go into more detail, so that is as far as I will go.\\n\\n\r\nStory: While watching the scenes from the opening song, you figure that the anime will be a typical mecha with the typical battles, and since you are told that there are 15 children and 15 alien battles, it is hard to be persuaded the battles are going to be very unique. That is partly correct. The battles do seem overused a lot, but the actual plot for the anime is rather unique. As you continue watching, you learn that there is more to the actual battles with the \"aliens\" each time. There is a deeper meaning in the anime, but it is the watcher's duty to figure it out, which is a good and bad thing. If you are just watching an anime for enjoyment, then I really do not suggest this. However, if you wish to analyze the anime and find the deeper meaning, then this will probably interest you.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: The art is rather simple, and I did not have any problems with it, but I think it could have been better. Sometimes simple art works well for certain kinds of anime, but I think it was not completely fitting for this one. There have been plenty other anime out there that have successfully been able to pull off the simple style of animation before, but unfortunately this one could not. The 3D for the mecha battles were actually pretty good, any way.\\n\\n\r\nSound: The opening song, Uninstall by Chiaki Ishikawa, was impressive, I thought. She has a pretty powerful voice, and it really worked for the opening. I think the music could even make up for some of the disappointing animation, but that is just my opinion. The ending songs work too, but Uninstall was mainly the only song that captured my attention.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: I really could not favor one character over another in this anime (partly because almost all of them \"disappears\" by the end), but I liked how one of the characters in the beginning acted like a total jerk, and eventually lightened up in the end. There is actually a side story that explains why his attitude is like that, but I cannot be bothered to explain everything in that area. You will learn that some of the characters live depressing lives, pretty much like any other anime, but I do not think there is any one perfect character in this show, which makes it more enjoyable.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: I just really liked how this anime played out overall. I think I said this before, but it is a rather unique story. I do not recall there being much comedy or any at all, but I think that works for some people. I believe most watchers will definitely cry during some episodes. I have to admit that I did.",

            "content": "Title: Bokurano\r\nManga, Light Novel, Anime: Bokurano was originally a manga done by Mohiro Kitoh.  It began running in Shogakukan's Ikki magazine in 2004, and is still running at present, at a total of eight collected volumes.  It has yet to be licensed Stateside.\r\nA light novel entitled Bokurano ~alternative~ written by Renji Ohki and with character designs done by Mohiro Kitoh began running in May of 2007, and is still running at this point in time, with three volumes released this far.  It also has yet to be licensed Stateside.\r\nThe anime series clocked in at a total of 24 episodes, and was doneby Studio Gonzo (famous for Gankutsou: The Count of Monte Cristo and Saikano) and directed by Hiroyuki Morita (famous for his work on The Cat Returns).  It ran from April 8th to September 25th, 2007 on Japanese TV, and has been licensed Stateside by Funimation, though they have yet to say when they're actually going to release it.  EDIT: As of this time, Funimation has only ordered cease and desists to fansubbers on behalf of Gonzo, but a NA liscensor has yet to be announced for this series.\\n\\n\r\nStory: So, there are these fifteen kids, all in middle school except for one girl in fourth grade, and they're at this summer camp.  They end up finding a grotto with a random guy in it, and he enlists them in a &quot;game&quot; involving robots.  What he fails to mention is that the game is real, and that they actually do have to pilot a robot.  There are fifteen robot enemies, one for each kid.  They have to beat them, or the Earth goes bye-bye.  The robot they pilot runs on their life forces, though, so even if they win, they die, too.  \\n\\n\r\nThe story focuses on the backgrounds of each of the kids as they're called up to pilot initially, but there are subplots involving the government and the overall game added in after the halfway point, along with some AMAZING plot twists.\\n\\n\r\nThe story isn't quite as good as Gankutsuou was, but this is up there with Gonzo's better works.  Yeah, the story's just a bit depressing, but there are little rays of brightness that peak in every once in a while, and it's enough to keep you going through.  Each kid gets development enough that you care as they go to face their deaths, and you'll at least be able to remember either their first or their last name, as do other people who become involved in their situation.  \\n\\n\r\nIt's a good story and all, but it didn't quite have the impact on me that I thought it would.  I mean, just looking at the show's description, I thought it would be Saikano-esque levels of depression, but it never quite reaches those.\\n\\n\r\nThe show's also very self-aware at times, and pokes fun at the mecha genre (the kids naming the robot, shouting out their attacks, getting &quot;uniforms&quot; to wear as they ride in it, etc).  \\n\\n\r\nIf you're going into this as a mecha fan, though, be aware that the robot fights aren't central to the story; there's at least one every episode, but the story's more centered around the children than it is around the robot. \\n\\n\r\nAlso, let's cover a big controversy that came up while this was being released, and contains slight spoilers, so read ahead at your own risk.  The creator of the manga, Mohiro Kitoh, made a blog entry while the show was being released that claimed that the author hated the source material (he did dislike it, admittedly, which begs the question of why he was even chosen to do this), and has asked if there was a way that he could save the children.  Kitoh supposedly gave the go ahead, but asked for fans of the manga to stop watching the anime, because it wouldn't be anything like the manga.  Well, I went and compared what I could find for information about how the manga unfolded and how the anime turned out, and the only real difference that I could find was in how some characters were handled and the order in which they were called to be pilots. Again, yes, different from the original, but the children were not freed from the contract and the fifteen who are contracted do end up dying, and the changes that did happen were nothing that would call for Kitoh to ask fans to boycott the series.  I think this is a case of overreaction from the original author.  It's all the more ironic and hypocritical since he's involved in a complete retooling of the story (the Bokurano ~alternative~ light novel).\\n\\n\r\nArt: The style that Gonzo chose to use for this is a bit simpler than I've seen with other productions that they've done.  It just doesn't look very good, honestly -- I've seen other series that have done simple well, like Kino no Tabi, but it just doesn't work as the series goes on.\\n\\n\r\n3D is obviously used for the mechas, and it looks pretty good.  Yeah, it stands out quite a bit, but then again, it's highly doubtful that one could do a robot entirely in 2D, and the thing's SUPPOSED to stand out.\\n\\n\r\nMusic: The background music for this series is, like Toward the Terra and Elfen Lied, one of the few scores I've actively listened to and noticed since Gankutsuou.  Excellent recurring themes.\\n\\n\r\nThe OP, &quot;Uninstall&quot;, is done by Chiaki Ishikawa, and is an absolutely beautiful piece that fits the series perfectly.  Both of the EDs are also done by her, and are more of the typical female JPop ballads, but I like the second one (&quot;Vermillion&quot;), more than the first one (&quot;Little Bird&quot;).\\n\\n\r\nSeiyuu: Kenji Nojima, who replaced Takemoto's seiyuu in the last episode of Honey and Clover, plays one of the children,  Tomokazu Sugita (Soldier Blue in Toward the Terra and Mayama in Honey and Clover) also appears as one of the children, and another child's seiyuu also appeared in Paranoia Agent as Shounen Bat.  The rest of the cast gives excellent performances, as always.\\n\\n\r\nLength: This feels about right, though there were some character's arcs who took more than one episode and probably could've been shortened a bit.  Any longer and it just wouldn't have worked. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: A good, solid mecha story centered around the children who pilot it, with decent art and length, beautiful music, and pretty good seiyuu.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 9/10\\n\r\nArt: 8/10\\n\r\nMusic: 9/10\\n\r\nLength: 8/10\\n\r\nSeiyuu: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 43/50; 86% (B )",

            "content": "Bokurano is a show that sets itself apart from most conventional standards and clich\u00e9s. It doesn't have the high-tempo, flashy battles of most mecha anime, nor does it have characters which fit into any standard role, or any of the type.\r\nThe first episode of the show can be quite overwhelming to some; you will rather suddenly be introduced to the entire cast of fourteen seventh-graders and one fourth-grader. They are gathered from various places on a summer camp, enjoying a seemingly peaceful summer. That is, until they decide to explore a hidden cave. here they encounter a peculiar man with an even more peculiar name,who invites them to play a certain game...\\n\\n\r\nTo put it simply, they are tricekd into a contract binding them as pilots for a giant robot, and what's worse, they have to fight other giant robots, unless they want Earth to face acopalypse. And so they decide to fight. But there are a lot of secrets revolving around the impeding fights, the robots and why they have to fight. And some of them are more horrible than others...\\n\\n\r\nOf course, the outside world isn't going to stand still as rampaging robots duke it out across cities, killing thousands and ruining property for billions. This results in some intricate side-plots with some, well, some standard mecha parties/groups. Namely, the military, and some separate group of scientists. And these side-plots, which plays out quite well and interestingly, are pretty much what you get of a real, continuous plot; because aside that and the fighting it's much more about each of the characters struggling with problems in their life.\\n\\n\r\nAnd the characters, sure, they get their screen time and it is done very well. Extremely well. Though I must admit that for seventh graders they act a little on the mature side. Maybe they shoulda been a few years older and it owuld have been completely believeable. Anyway, they are normal children, thrown into an unescapable battle with everything at the stakes if they lose and nothing but despair to the victor. Since they each know what cruel fate awaits them when they get chosen as the pilot for the robot, they end up living out their last days doing what they feel compelled to do before parting with this world. And yes, you get to see inside the lives of each of the teenagers; some getting more screentime than others, and it would seem that each of them have their troubles in life. Love, forbidden or not, revenge, family problems, there's a ton of stuff these adolescents have in their life.\\n\\n\r\nOh, it plays out quite beautifully, except for the aforementioned fact that they seem to young to actually react to these problems, at least in the way they do; they seem overly mature for their age. \\n\\n\r\nAnd along with the main cast, there's quite the few interesting side characters. who have their important say in the plot and the lives and struggles of the main characters, while shining wonderfully on their own. \\n\\n\r\nThere was one thing which struck me when I watched Bokurano. It was that it seemed very dispassionate, almost cold in its emotions. When there's a battle, it's not like one would feel the adrenaline. When characters face problems, it's not like they seem overly emotional about it; at least the viewer will not go as far as to become emoional with them. The voice actors, they were all quite quiet and calm, and so was the mood set forth by the animation and the soundtrack. This was, to this reviewer, a good thing for the show. It is great to see that the show is never rushed; yet, at the same time, it doesn't get bogged down with unecessary scenes or anything. It just is placid.\\n\\n\r\nTogether with this, the animation is quite marvelous to look at. It's not breathtaking or meticulous, but it's good to look at. There's no sharp, glaring or bright colours. There's no rough edges or anything. The light and shadow efffects are lovely to look at, too. It's all very temperate. Even the massive mecha, which are all made in CGI, aren't too glaring or disturbing to look at in the environments it is put into. Movements in eneral are qutie smooth; they certainly didn't skip ahead on frames when making this anime, and that is really nice.\\n\\n\r\nGoing along, the opening and ending themes are quite melliflous tunes. Chiaki Ishikawa has a serene voice and sings three stunning songs thereafter, all of which are themes I would want to listen to over and over. \"Uninstall\" is very mysterious, almost a bit adventurous; yet very inviting and makes you feel that the show has something for you to experience. The ending themes, \"Little Bird\" and \"Vermillion\" both are interesting themes to listen to. The first is something I could gladly listen to after going to bed at night, to fall asleep to, or simply and plainly relax to. \"Vermillion\" leans towards the J-pop side of things, but has its interesting tone, like you're just drifting off somewhere, in a world of dreams, illusions.\\n\\n\r\nThe background music is composed mainly of calming string tunes and mysterious, inexplicable piano songs. It sets up the mood quite well, albeit keeping mainly to a single one or two; making sure that your emotions keep within the doldrums; reposed and quiet.\\n\\n\r\nIf I were to sum it up, I would have to say that Bokurano isn't a show that stands out very well. It doesn't leave a lasting impression, but while you watch this, you will most certainly be affected by an aura of melancholy; of placidity and stoicism. It drags you into the lives of a group of unsuspecting adolescents and shows you what would happen if someone suddenly had the choice between not doing anything and watch the Earth go asunder; dying along with it, or try and save it, with a risk of failing, and still dying. It shows you what a variety of people would do with their final days, if they knew they were about to die. To me, Bokurano was quite good, but not entirely up there.",

I still enjoyed it but its quite different from the story summaries, previews, etc.\r\nAt start the story seems lame and rushed, just a little excuse to put some kids fighting for earth in some big robots, the fights are quite dull as well and the animation is quite average with some bad parts even but thats mostly at the start.\r\nI'm glad I kept watching it because it gets much better, the storytwists, or better, it unveils a completely different plot from the first appearances becoming rather interesting. The fights improve allot compared to the first ones but this is not a mecha style anime with lots of cool fights and moves, its a story driven drama where each episode u get to known one of the characters better, usually before their respective battle portraying their will and reasons to fight or give up. The mystery behind the robots and the battles is also unveiled slowly and I'm afraid I can't say much more to avoid spoiling the development, one of the good aspects of the show.\\n\r\nThe music isn't bad, the opening becomes quite enjoyable after a couple episodes and theres the usual backtracks accompanying the crucial moments.\\n\r\nOverall its a good show, with a decent story about a couple kids who are put into a non desirable situation without even being asked, and are now carrying the burden to save earth, their own problems and doubts are explored while they find a meaning to fight for earth, themselves, protecting someone or simply giving up. Don't expect much action, its a show for people who like good stories with a slow but decent development and some epic moments filled with sadness, anger, and self sacrifice.",

            "content": "Overview:\r\nTime for a totally random review! Today, I'll be covering the always polarizing Bokurano. One of my offline buddies loves this series, so he let me borrow it. I really wanted to like it but...yeah.\r\nStory:\r\nThe story is that God is an utter asshole. He arbitrarily decides that there are too many universes and now a fighting tournament is needed to see which universe survives. This series has the same plot as Dragon Ball Super Tournament of Power, but plays it DEAD FUCKING SERIOUS! You are setting yourself up to fail if you create a plot that Akira \"poop on a stick is funny\" Toriyama wouldcome up with and take it this seriously. Each parallel Earth chooses a bunch of random children and forces them to pilot a giant robot in a best of 12 contest. However, the robot is powered by the souls of children, so the kid dies even if he or she wins. The kids of our Earth decide to name their robot \"Zearth\" because I guess Dio copyrighted ZA WARUDO! Zearth is OP as fuck and easily wins each and every battle...then the kid dies. That's basically every episode. Our universe survives, the others die and...that's really it.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\\n\r\nBokurano has a lot of characters...but they all die shortly after introduction and leave zero emotional impact. You're left going \"oh no...so and so's dead...what a shock!\" Let's introduce kid #1. He's an athlete who was sad that his dad never came to his games, so he quit sports. Then he pilots a giant robot and says goodbye to this cruel world. I don't even remember his name. I can't remember what he looked like. Is that the point? That we are all disposable cogs in the machine of this horrible existence? Is this anime just a sophomoric foray into nihilism? Maybe there is some deeper meaning the author intended, but I sure didn't see it. I was probably a tad distracted by how fucking stupid the plot is.\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\\n\r\nDid you think the CGI in Full Metal Panic aged poorly? You ain't seen nothing yet! I think this anime at least looked sort of acceptable upon release, but now it's a visual abortion. \\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\\n\r\nI at least liked the opening theme and its chorus of DELETE! DELETE! It sadly just reminded me that I could be re-watching Matt Hardy's The Final Deletion again, which is far better than this anime. Yes, watching 2 redneck wrestlers launch fireworks at each other and spew total nonsense is a million times better than this anime.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\\n\r\nI obviously didn't care for this anime, but maybe some other people found enjoyment or profundity where I didn't. That's cool. At least this anime started some fun conversations. \\n\\n\r\nMe: \"I'm sorry man...but this anime is just abject trash.\"\\n\\n\r\nMy friend: \"Oh really? Coming from the guy who loves Elfen Lied? At least my anime doesn't involve a plethora of naked children!\"\\n\\n\r\nMy other friend: \"Guys! Guys! BOTH of your anime are trash! Instead you should watch a REAL anime...the first season of Slayers from 1995.\\n\\n\r\neveryone: \"Yeah...Slayers is pretty good\"",

            "content": "Bokurano was one of those shows that you can't really like unless you really look at the deeper meaning. If you're looking for a series that you can watch without thinking about, then you might as well stop reading right now.\r\nSTORY:\r\nBokurano's story is very unique and interesting. You may think of it as just mindless killing, but similar to Gantz, it is a psychological anime that shows what happens when normal people are put into hopeless situations and are forced to put their lives on the line.\r\nART:\r\nThe art was not as good as it could have been, but I had no problems with it. Itwas a bit annoying having to switch from 2d to 3d a few times in every episode, but it wasn't something intolerable.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND:\\n\r\nI thought the sound was pretty good, and was able to partially cover up for the slightly disappointing art. There was nothing wrong with the sound in Bokurano, but I wasn't blown away by it in the least.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER:\\n\r\nThis is where Bokurano really stands out. There were 15 main characters in the series, and depending on how you look at it, there could even be a few more. At first, I was a bit skeptical, seeing as though there are only 24 episodes in the show. But amazingly, I learned about the back story of every single character and realized that each one was very much different from the others. And even though there was so much character development, it did not take away from the story.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT:\\n\r\nI really enjoyed seeing how each character reacted. There may not be enough action for some people in Bokurano, but there was plenty of drama to keep you interested throughout each episode.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL:\\n\r\nWith all that said, I'll give this series an 83/100, a solid score.",

            "content": "At the end of the day, what makes \"Bokurano\" work is its interesting subject matter and the fact that it has all of the foundations of an amazing story. Unfortunately, it sets the bar higher than it can actually reach and ultimately fails to live up to its potential.\r\n(This review contains major spoilers for both the manga and anime).\r\nMy first impression of this show was really good. It seemed like it was setting itself up for an intelligent story that would leave you thinking about it long after it was over. The kind of story that deconstructs popular concepts within fiction (in this case the\"giant mecha genre\"), in order to drive them to their dark and desolate conclusions. One that ultimately brings you a new reflection of reality, that can only be seen through the lens of fiction. That is the kind of story it was setting itself up to be.\\n\\n\r\nAt first, I had thought I had hit the jackpot seeing as how the content was pretty much the darkest thing I could never imagine. Kids, having to sacrifice their lives in order to save the crapsack world that doesn't care for them; the revelation that they are in the process, destroying other worlds that have people setting out to do the same; having what may very well be the highest death count in any story of all time. In fact, it was more than just dark, it was pitch black.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, as I continued to watch it, I realized that the show being dark was pretty much all there was to it. Even though it clearly presents itself with the ambitions of being profound and thought provoking, and with the presence of a show that has lots to say, it ends up saying not much at all, almost as if believing that the subject matter itself is enough to get your interest, leaving you instead with emptiness. The worst part is the ending which is so bizarrely out of place, nonsensical, and naive, that it becomes downright insulting that the writers would expect you to swallow it.\\n\\n\r\nBefore I get into details, let's talk about the \"Bokurano\" manga series. I began reading the manga immediately after finishing the anime. Not because I liked the anime so much but because I had heard that the manga was a lot different. I learned that the anime had been produced while the manga was still going and so I reasoned that the story must have suffered solely due to the anime making it up on its own when it no longer had the manga to go by. I was convinced that the manga was where the story would reach the hights it was setting itself up for, and so I gave it a try.\\n\\n\r\nAlthough the manga did in fact redeem it to some degree, it wasn't by a whole lot. The biggest difference with the manga and the anime is the level of cynicism. The manga may be the most cynical one I have ever read, which fits the tone of the dark story and subject matter. It still feels empty in what it wants to convey, but at the very least it feels like it is supposed to. The anime on the other hand tones down most of the cynicism of the manga and tries to portray this pitch black story with an air of optimism, which makes it absolutely ridiculous. Especially when contrasting it with the manga does this flaw become apparent.\\n\\n\r\nThe best example that I can think of comes from a chapter in the manga that didn't make it into the anime. Kirie has been selected as the next pilot and talks about how he doesn't want to go through with it with Tanaka. In this scene, he talks about how he sees no reason to protect a world that has done nothing for him, just because it is the world he himself belongs to. The surviving world consists of people just like this one, and it would be hypocritical to justify sacrificing one world to save another, just because one of those worlds is your own. Especially when the world in question is one that you do not care for. At the end, Kirie ends up fighting after all because he realizes by watching the pilot of the other world that both of their worlds are just as bad, and there is no reason for saving or sacrificing either one of them over the other. So he fights, because that is the role he was given and it ends up being the only role he is able to live up to.\\n\\n\r\nIn the anime it's a tad bit different. First off, the entire scene with Kirie and Tanaka doesn't take place whatsoever, and although Kirie's position to piloting the ship is retained, it is incredibly dumbed down. However, the most striking difference is in how this arc is concluded. Kirie sort of just changes his mind and gains confidence that his world is awesome and worth protecting after all. Then he proceeds to fight as if it was the most obvious thing there ever was. As if his previous attitude was just some temporary mood swing. Oh, and when he starts fighting, he does a bunch of elegant fighting moves and stuff, because that's cool right?\\n\\n\r\nHowever, this is nothing in comparison to what I am about to write next. If you have only been skimming through this review until this point then at least read the following couple of paragraphs carefully because it is pretty much the most spot-on illustration of my problems with the anime that I can think of.\\n\\n\r\nIn the same conversation as above, Kirie and Tanaka also talk for a while about movies. Kirie explains how he never sees happy endings in movies as actual happy endings because of the means that are used to get to them. \\n\\n\r\n(Paraphrasing)\\n\r\n\"A hero that kills a 100 faceless bad guys, rescues the girl, and saves the world, is always depicted at the end of the movie with a smiling face even though there were a lot of sacrifices made for him to get there. Why doesn't anyone in the audience feel sad for any of the 100 faceless mooks whom may have had families of their own, whom loved and cared for them? What if they weren't actually that bad? What if they just happened to take a wrong turn that eventually led to them getting in the way of the protagonist? Why does the audience only get upset when something happens to the main characters anyway? Does the protagonist even have to be a sympathetic character to gain the audiences respect? Or does his presence as the centre of the story dignify every action he makes? It seems that as long as the story ends with the hero being alive and happy, everything is alright and we can end it on a happy note, ignoring all of the bad stuff that actually happened before it.\"\\n\\n\r\nThis here is one of the few parts of the story that actually made me think a little. If only there was a central direction for the story to take that would head deeper into this kind of content, it would have made for a much more rewarding experience. One thing I love about this conversation is how meta it is. If you think about it, everything Kirie says in this scene can be applied to the readers of this very manga. In a way, it is as if the author is making fun of you.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, the reason I brought it up is to discuss the message that the author is giving us. What this conversation basically is telling us about \"Bokurano\" as a whole is this: The ending of this story will be just as harsh as everything that has preceeded it. It will not contrive itself to bring you a false happy ending that defies logic and insults your intelligence.\\n\\n\r\nThis exactly is why the anime fails, because the thing is, well... it perfectly describes the exact kind of ending the anime got, doesn't it?\\n\\n\r\nI mean think about it. That has got to be the defining quality of a failed adaptation. Sure, this might not have been the easiest story to write a fitting ending for but if the adaptation becomes the very kind of work that the original is criticizing and using as a source of social commentary, then you have created the antithesis to the story you were supposed to make. The people who made the anime, simply had no idea what they were making an anime out of or they didn't have the ambition or the guts to actually make it, and that is all there is to it.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of endings, the one in the manga was expectedly in a much harsher tone, consistent with the rest of the story, it ends simply by going full circle, ending up where it started with everything starting over again but with new people. It's not a happy ending nor a sad one. It comes off with the empty sense of insignificance you have been feeling throughout the entire read, and plays it off as if it was the most natural thing in the world, which by that point it is.\\n\\n\r\nAlthough the cynicism of the manga makes the story work well enough as it is, the premise is too good to be wasted on a story that could have been so much more than just a nihilistic presentation of \"a million is a statistic\". The manga aimed to be amazing yet it managed only to be pretty good, while the anime aimed to be pretty good and ended up being nothing more than decent. The manga wanted to go somewhere but didn't, while the anime wanted to go somewhere until it changed its mind and went back. This story had so much potential but it led absolutely nowhere. It told me to think but gave me nothing to think about. Somewhere in here there might be a masterpiece, but it is shrouded in a story that amounts to nothing. Though for the premise and subject matter alone, it still holds up to being an entertaining enough watch to sit through.",

            "content": "\"Where in my frail body am I supposed to find the strength to stand?\"\r\n--Ishikawa Chiaki - Uninstall\r\nThis review is written with the intention of being spoiler free, but I will attempt to analyze various aspects of the show which may result in me giving hints to events of the show to some viewers. I apologize in advance if I do this and I hope to avoid spilling the beans on a very good anime. I'll admit my review is also kind of long. For a tl;dr, go the second to last paragraph.\r\nBokurano has always seemed to me to be a very contentious and controversial anime.Viewers and commenters appear to either love it to death or hate its very existence. Enjoying Bokurano is highly dependent upon bonding with the characters, feeling their pain, weeping with them, and leaving each episode like you have just left a funeral. In anime such as this, viewers tend to either develop this connection with the protagonists in which they love the series or the viewers do not and so they find themselves hating it. I can't promise that you will like Bokurano, but I can promise that I will tell you why I like it in the hopes that you will find out if you will enjoy it like I did.\\n\\n\\n\r\nBokurano is about 15 teenagers who are tricked into piloting a massive mecha to defend Earth against other massive mecha who are attacking for an unknown purpose. Each of these kids has their own reason for fighting, these reasons are very personal and most are not caught up in the idea of protecting humanity. The series is structured around arcs of one or two episodes focused on each of the pilots. In each case, we see the life of the character in question, their families and people around them, why they seem beaten down and driven into a corner, and finally, why they choose to fight the attacking mecha. \\n\\n\r\nI see Bokurano as the ultimate \"feel-bad\" anime. There are very few happy or funny moments. Each heartwarming moment turns to sorrow within 10 minutes and many of these moments are intertwined with suffering. Gutwrenching events occur almost every episode and I often found myself wanted to go sit in a corner after watching. I would not recommend seeing Bokurano as an anime similar to CLANNAD or Steins;Gate. These anime begin with humor, happiness, and charm to introduce you to the characters and then put them through hell in the pattern of what TVTropes has called Cereberus Syndrome. Bokurano does not take any time trying to win you over with hints of a happy series. By the end of the second episode, it is clear that things will not go well for our heroes and heroines. The fights are never shown as something cool or fun and aren't even that interesting to watch. A minor amount of strategy in these fights is discussed, but it's not a big focus of the series. The battles bring the kids together and connect them to each other, but are primarily used as a plot device to keep things moving.\\n\\n\r\nYou may have already noticed that Bokurano seems very similar to a much more famous anime, Neon Genesis Evangelion (abbreviated NGE). NGE seems to have been a major inspiration for Bokurano and both anime have significant similarities. Indeed, I find it pretty hard to discuss Bokurano without comparing and contrasting it with NGE so I'll get that done here. Both NGE and Bokurano go heavily into the implications of using emotionally unstable teenagers as the first and only line of defense against mysterious, eldrich beings who attack and fight for apparently no reason. Neither anime is particularly happy or uplifting and the protagonists in both can seem distant and hard to get along with throughout the series. The mission control and support for the children piloting the mecha is very limited and the pilots commonly feel like no one in the world is there for them. The most obvious antagonist in both series is the one driving the protagonists to keep fighting (Gendo Ikari and Dung Beetle for NGE and Bokurano, respectively). Be aware, however, that there are major differences as well. NGE is not solely about the suffering of its protagonists. It heavily uses Judeo-Christian naming and symbolism and the battles against the Angels can be interesting and cool at times. NGE also heavily goes into Freudian psychology and often has a highbrow, even pretentious feel to it at times. Bokurano has none of these things. Bokurano's sole focus is to rip into the Humongous Mecha genre and show why it is not fun, cool, interesting, or a good idea to enlist young, emotionally unstable children as the soldiers against enemies who threaten our species. I personally feel that if you like one of these anime, you will like the other, but I know many NGE lovers who did not enjoy Bokurano as all, so please be aware of the differences between these series if you came from NGE looking for something similar. \\n\\n\r\nBokurano uses much less symbolism than NGE, but there is one major symbol I would like to comment on: chairs. Each of the chosen pilots has a chair they are transported into the robot with. The significance of these chairs differs for each of the pilots, but each one relates to their dissatisfaction and unhappiness with their life. A sadistic, socially Darwinistic boy is associated with his father's office chair. His father is a nasty caricature of a heartless businessman who seeks to profit off the destruction of the battles occuring throughout Japan. Another boy has a floor cushion, used as a symbol of his family's poverty and the troubles he goes through in order to support his siblings who were all abandoned by their parents. A girl brings a piano bench; her parents love to hear her play, but she doesn't particularly enjoy it. All of these chairs provide insight into the protagonists and their lives and each helps the viewer understand them better and to emotionally connect with these characters. I think the use of chairs was done extremely well by the series and is used to great effect to demonstrate how each of the protagonists is both and different from all the others.\\n\\n\r\nNow that I have finished my initial discussion and analysis of Bokurano, I am going to discuss each of the official ratings MAL gives its reviewers to rate anime. If you have read this far, you likely still have some interest in Bokurano and I will attempt to use this section to help you make a final decision of whether to watch it or not:\\n\\n\r\nStory: Bokurano has the saddest story of any anime I have seen at the time of writing this. The characters all go through hell and get very little for their troubles. There are so few happy moments that the most common criticism I see of Bokurano is that the viewer can become apathetic to the trauma suffered by the characters due to the mostly uninterrupted melancholy of the series. I personally did not have this happen to me, but I can easily understand why others say this. Note that Bokurano is also very dependant on surprising plot twists and does not hesitate to make its cast miserable for the sake of the plot. If anime are to be classified as plot-driven or character-driven, Bokurano is definitely plot-driven. Overall, I give the story 8/10 for its capacity to be touching, but it probably could have used some contrast.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: The animation in Bokurano is not particularly eye-catching or attention-grabbing, but I feel that a bright, colorful animation style would be out of place. The characters are all animated realistically except for Dung Beetle whose slightly cute appearance is contrasted with his sadistic behavior. I really like that Bokurano avoids the animation caricatures that anime often slips into such as huge eyes, brightly colored hair, and flamboyant outfits. The overall gray tint to the show adds to the gray mood of the story. Because the animation fits the theme, but isn't particulary remarkable, I give it 9/10.\\n\\n\r\nSound: Bokurano opens with one my favorite anime OPs of all time, Uninstall by Ishikawa Chiaki. I absolutely love this song and still play it regularly while driving or working. In fact, the tagline for this review is a line from the OP. Be sure to look at the lyrics as they describe a lot of the general feeling of the series. Both endings to Bokurano, Little Bird and Vermillion (by the same artist), are much less interesting, but still are good to listen to and capture the feel of the series well. The voice acting and background music didn't particularly get my attention as it is neither very good nor very bad. I personally think that this works out well overall when the sound doesn't distract from the atmosphere and Bokurano isn't a series where much would be gained from music and voices grabbing one's attention. Mostly due to Uninstall, I give the sound 10/10. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Bokurano has a very large character list. 15 children pilot the robot. In addition to them, Dung Beetle and various government officials make regular appearances. Add all these up and we get a series with at least 18 main characters (and arguments can be made for others). As a result of this huge cast in a 24 episode series, characterization is somewhat limited. While each character changes throughout his or her arc, there really is only time to designate one major change. Series with so many important characters also run the risk of not showing much of their cast besides the designated protagonists, but Bokurano averts this nicely and makes each of them essential to the progression of the story. Everyone changes and develops and I found myself sympathizing with each of the protagonists, something that is quite rare with such a large number! This rating might get me some hate, but I give the characters 10/10.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: It's always hard for me to describe enjoyment for a series that really isn't fun. I would be lying if I said that Bokurano was a blast. It made me cry repeatedly and I felt rather like a dung beetle after every episode. Moments of happiness and hope get squashed very quickly and moments of sadness permeate throughout. You will see horrible things and gutwrenching moments on a regular basis while watching Bokurano. I doubt that many viewers will \"enjoy\" Bokurano in the way that the word is generally used. However, it was very emotionally cathartic so I'm going to give an enjoyment rating of 8/10.\\n\\n\r\nBased on these numbers and how I liked the series, I give it 9/10 as one of the more powerful anime I have seen, but not quite good or consistent enough to warrant a perfect rating.\\n\\n\r\nI will end this review by making a few comments to help if you are still undecided on whether to watch Bokurano or not. If you are looking for a dark action series, go elsewhere. I recommend Wolf's Rain or Ergo Proxy. If you want a dark series with black humor while keeping a lot of pain and suffering, I would try Mawaru Penguindrum or Kaiba. If you want a more positive story with a large amount of feels, I'm not the best person to ask since that's not really my thing, but I would try The Place Promised in Our Early Days or Millennium Actress. However, if you want to watch an anime completely and entirely about how much saving the world sucks with a story which does not hesitate to make its characters miserable, watch Bokurano. If you like Neon Genesis Evangelion, Mahou Shoujo Madoka Magica, or Texhnolyze, I highly recommend Bokurano.   \\n\\n\r\nNote: This is the first anime review I have written and is a repost of the review I made for Bokurano on hummingbird found here: https://hummingbird.me/anime/bokurano/reviews/10222. If anyone has suggestions for making this review better, please let me know in a message! Thanks for reading!\\n\\n\r\nAcknowledgment: I took the idea for opening my review with a quote from Uninstall from Aeterna's review of Bokurano. Thanks!",

            "content": "Bokurano was recommended to me by another MAL member on the IRC channel, because I said I liked Clannad. According to him \"Bokurano is an instant feels trip from start\". Now, that I watched the series, I do understand where he is coming from, but I have to disagree with that. Here is why...\r\nIf I had to summarize what Bokurano is, it's a mix between Neon Genesis: Evangelion and Gantz, sans blood. The story follows 15 high-school students, who are tricked into piloting a giant mecha, fighting off periodically arriving enemies to save the world from certain doom. Now, as far as basic premise goes,this is as simple and clich\u00e9'd as it gets. But what sets Bokurano apart from all the tons upon tons of mecha anime is the tone and the underlying story behind the mask, full of symbolism and metaphors.\\n\\n\r\nSee, Bokurano is built entirely upon the \"Reluctant Hero\" trope. The 15 kids never asked to be the saviors of humanity, they never wanted to fight or bear the enormous responsibility, having the destiny of the entire world resting upon their shoulders. (This is why I mentioned NGE up there.) They were all tricked/forced into this situation, and from then on it's \"do or die\", there is no going back. But unlike many other similar anime, this is NOT a heartwarming coming-of-age story, not in the slightest. The 15 kids didn't know each other beforehand, they kind of only just met. And now each of them faces the same predicament of having to fight to save the world with a bunch of (almost) complete strangers. (Hence the mention of Gantz.) Unlike other mecha anime, and the case of Shinji from NGE, these kids are NOT a team. They are but a bunch of confused and terrified children, who want nothing to do with the whole thing. They fight, but not because of some lofty goals of justice, valor, heroism, or because \"it's the right thing to do\". No, they fight because...what's the alternative? Let it all just end? They don't even try to be heroes, Bokurano tears down the pretentious, overblown morals of other such anime, and replaces it all with true grit, the feelings of how a real human must feel when thrown in that situation. These kids never really come to terms with what is demanded of them, they each have to muster some kind of reason to fight. Some personal reason to fight for a world they barely even had the chance to experience.\\n\\n\r\nThere is a resaon I haven't mentioned the \"big mecha battles\" yet, because those are but a tiny piece of the whole story. Bokurano is NOT about mecha battles, but the people involved. So, if you came for that, you'll be sorely disappointed. It's almost entirely a character driven piece, where the mecha fights are nothing but backdrop, without any flashy \"attacks\" or \"moves\", only a means to an end. Don't get me wrong, Zearth and the other mechas look fantastic and full of symbolism, but they are only there for show, this tale is not about them. The story itself is very slow-paced and structured like a Lego house. Each episode follows a single kid's story. As we progress through the series, we get to know the 15 kids, their backstories and their personal battles in their lives. Broken and dysfunctional families, child neglect, bullying, tarnished friendships, hard life choices and a LOT of anger, fear, angst, regret and \"could've/should've/would've\". The drama is real, and mostly well written, but it's really nothing to cry on or get a feels trip about, unless some of the kids' stories hit a little bit close to home. It is very diverse and has many thing going on at any given time, but sometimes the scenes just drag on too long with unnecessary exposition and side-arcs that ultimately lead to nowhere, and it sometimes makes the whole thing confusing. I guess the creators bit off just a bit more than they could chew. I feel having so many central characters in a regular length (24 episode) anime is just a bit too much. There are too many to really flesh them out individually and because of that I couldn't really get invested in any of them.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation quality is okay, and I particularly liked the character designs and the art direction. The visuals are well suited for the subject matter, there are no bright colors, flashy special effects or comical cuts and trasitions. This is a very down-to-Earth anime in this respect, discounting the futuristic setting and the obvious giant mechas. There is also an absolute abundance of symbolism and visual metaphors for the keen-eyed, a really good addition that complements the story in various ways. Well done!\\n\\n\r\nA special mention goes to the music, especially the opening song, \"Uninstall\" from Chiaki Ishikawa. The very second I heard the song I fell in love with it. Such a beautiful song, beautiful voice, and the whole tone and the lyrics suit the anime so well, it's simply perfect.\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion, Bokurano is a pretty unique piece of anime. It's a little tamer in tone than NGE or Gantz, but exactly that's why it's so powerful. It doesn't need the shock value, graphic and psychological brutality and gallons of blood and tears to get it's message across. The devil is in the details. Make no mistake, Bokurano is a pretty dreary anime with lots of emotion, and if the belt catches you, you will go on a feels trip. It really all depends if you can connect with the characters and the source material or not. There is also a lot of symbolism, both in the narrative and in the visuals (and the title itself), so the literately and visually inclined will have a field day with this anime for sure.",

            "content": "I like to start off by saying that, yes, I have rated this a perfect ten score but I have a reason for doing so other than the fact that I do have special favor for this anime. I did try to be as fair as I can on the rating, but I do want to note the reason for a perfect score, which I think everyone deserves to know why. I really think that this anime accomplished exactly what it's purpose was. Many people that I have heard talk about Bokurano in the past in a negative way feel it is trying to belike Evangelion or some other mecha animes with kid pilots in giant robots. So I'm going to elaborate on exactly what I think this did well and what made it unique.\\n\\n\r\n\tFirst off, this story, to me, was very well executed. The first episode builds interest while at the same time giving you a little bit of insight on the characters, and actually, if you pay enough attention, are a foreshadowing into the future of this anime. They really give very good hints of what the characters are like, these small hints really help you understand why the characters react certain ways later on in the story. As for the characters themselves they are very different, very unique, in a matter of fact their personalities are almost polarized. Several times when watching this anime I have seen the characters act in smalls way, doing small things, small nuances about their personality reminding me about how I would react to certain situations. They are all deep, 3-dimensional characters, but their action reflect what's on the inside AMAZINGLY well. Expounding on the characters in the aspect of how they are drawn, Mohiro Kitoh has a very simplistic, a very normal, average way of portraying the characters. No one has any strangely colored hair, no one's body shape is over exaggerated, no one is too cool, too strong, or too smart, they're all drawn and written in a way you can relate to. You don't look down on them as being less than you, but rather as equals. Mohiro Kitoh is also very good at expressions. In his original manga every character on the screen has a very unique expression that is true to the person who is expressing it and I feel that this was translated very well into the anime. There is one particular scene where all the characters are together during a very emotional time. The camera pans across the screen showing every characters expression. Just looking at each of their faces you can almost read their minds in that very moment by the way that they are expressing themselves. Even with more than one person on the screen, every character has a very unique expression which is drawn very in a very detailed way. \\n\\n\r\n\tAnother thing that many people have complained about in the past about Bokurano is the art being \u201csub par\u201d. I, for my part, believe the art accomplished exactly what it was supposed to. You also have to realize that this anime was made in 2007, as well as the fact the art isn't meant to be so beautiful, so attractive, that the art distracts from the characters and story. To me the art style was drawn exactly the way it was on purpose. Everything is just normal, when it comes down to it, through the eyes of the characters the world isn't a very beautiful place anyway, at least not most of the time, so why should the background be drawn any differently? The way art was drawn really reflected the story in a very realistic way in my opinion.\\n\\n\r\n\tJust like the arts the music sets the mood very well. The music was soft, warm and reminiscent, almost like a dream or a memory. It's warm, yet gloomy, and it's sole purpose was to set the mood. NOT to stand out. How can I say the Music deserved a ten? One of the ways I find best to see how effective a soundtrack is, is to watch the anime, download the OST and then listen to it from track one to the last track. How quick does it set the mood? How quick does images of the anime flood your mind? With Bokurano, the soundtrack is absolutely inspirational to me. With anime OSTs that are  cool, epic, or just good from a musical standpoint, not all of them recall memories from that anime as vividly as the Bokurano OST did for me. Each track is distinct and simple enough to tell you without words, what each song represents in the anime. Images, places, characters are instantly brought back to mind when listening to this.\\n\\n\r\n\tNow I have saved my thoughts for the story and enjoyment last, because these are the most controversial. If you have seen Bokurano, you know that the story is not a happy, frolicy, joyful one. Bokurano really addresses several problematic issues about individuals and society in general. I can't begin to name all of them. Some of the most poignant issues to me are child abuse, relationships between step family members and the effects of death, suffering and burdening responsibility on children. All of these topics are discussed in an honest non-graphic way, which I love. There are 14 different children as well as several other main characters and support characters. The cast is quite large and yet no one gets lost in the background.  This anime is just so honest, so real... and one thing I want to get out of the way. This is not another Eva. I really don't think a child would react the way Shinji did, and the story of Eva, to me, wasn't really about Shinji but the Eva's. In Bokurano The robots are used as tools to teach you about people, real people, with realistic lives. These kids are not orphans or estranged kids clammering for the attention of their parents that are never there, trying to make a life with their giant mutant robots. They have families, GOALS, and things they are torn away from to serve a greater need. It's very easy to put yourself in the shoes of a Bokurano character, any angst developed in the story is so down  to earth you can really feel their pain. Bokurano is TECHNICALLY a slice-of-life but so was \"Star Driver\". Bokurano really is a drama, a character study even, and it may take several times watching it to  get everything out of it. Also, some people felt it was slow at  times and yes, I do believe that that is true, but if you find the characters interesting enough I believe you'd want it to go even slower. When watching this I  was deeply intrigued with the characters and I read every word in the subtitles, sometimes even pausing and rewinding, contemplating how this adds to what the character is now. At times I wish it would have gone slower because there is so much to be learned. Even if the plot was slow at times it wasn't enough for me to even drop the story rating from a 10 to a 9.\\n\\n\r\n\tAnd finally, on the subject of enjoyment... I'd rather use the term appreciation. Due to the dark, gloomy and doleful nature of this anime I can say en-JOY-ment, root word \"joy\" or happiness isn't appropriate. But after watching  this you will appreciate it and very likely come to appreciate many things. (To understand what I am talking about... watch it.)\\n\\n\r\n\tIn conclusion, if you are not a fan of dark and gloomy, you will not like this, but if you appreciate good story telling, with wonderful character development, and characters who you can relate to, you'll like this if you have the patients. Despite the Mecha this is far more.",

            "content": "I\u2018d like to start this review with this first thought. \r\nGonzo fucks up everything. \r\nNow that this is out of the way let me explain why and how I mean it. \r\nBokurano isn\u2018t a bad anime don\u2018t get my wrong. I just feel it could have been a better one, when done by a different studio and different budget. \r\nBut I will cover this whole issue in the single segments of this review. \r\nAlso note, this review will most likely contain minor spoilers, so please don\u2018t read it if you don\u2018t wanna get spoiled anything, even if it's just slightones. \\n\r\nThis is due to my comparison with the manga (but only superficial I don't mention any characters and what happens to them, just themes and some emotions that might come across) \\n\\n\r\nAll I can say to you is, watch this show it\u2018s good, but bad presented. \\n\\n\r\nAnd now let\u2018s review this show: \\n\\n\r\nStarting with the worst first and then we gradually go to the better things about this show. \\n\\n\\n\r\nAnimation \\n\\n\r\nLets establish what animation even means. It\u2018s not just moving pictures, it\u2018s also art and quality how it is presented. \\n\r\nSome of you who know about Gonzo might have heard about it, but Gonzo likes to mix some bad CGI into their drawn shows, and Bokurano is a good example for this bad habit. I even go so far and say that the animation is almost non existent for the most important parts of a semi-mecha show but was replaced by boring CGI robo-fights. \\n\r\nIt looks so awkward to see 2 giant CGI robots fight slowly against each other, and is by far the most boring shit in the entire show. \\n\\n\r\nBut when there is no CGI it doesn\u2018t shine either. Crooked faces, movements, quality loss. You name it. It\u2018s all there. Basically the show looks like it was made in the early 2000s or even late 90s. \\n\r\nAnd it is especially sad when a show like Neon Genesis Evangellion from 1996 looks better than this show made in 2007! 10 years later and a show manages to do not even a half as good job in animating it as something else. \\n\r\nWhy are the Evas animated in NGE but ZEarth is not in Bokurano, and was replaced by some shitty CGI model? \\n\\n\r\nDespite that it doesn\u2018t offer anything else in return, no memorable, or especially well done moments, no great artstyle or amazing quality. The backgrounds look generic and forgettable, and the character designs (though very close to their original Manga version) are bland and forgettable. \\n\\n\r\nMy verdict: 1,5/10 (I give it a 2/10 out of mercy) \\n\\n\\n\r\nSound \\n\\n\r\nMoving on from the bad animation, the sound-department did a quite well job. \\n\\n\r\nStarting off with the OP \u201eUninstall\u201c by Chiaki Ishikawa is by far the best piece of music this show has to offer. It\u2018s gloomy, melancholic and has a bit of a childish touch to it. It fits the show very well, the lyrics as well. I loved to listen to the song before very episode and never got bored of it. \\n\r\nThe EDs were good as well but couldn\u2018t hook me like the OP did. \\n\\n\r\nThe rest of the OST fit well but wasn\u2018t outstanding. Decent tough but not worth mentionable or a good reason to get your hands on the OST. \\n\\n\r\nThe voiceacting ranged from average to awkward at moments. The most outstanding job in my opinion did Akira Ishida, who voice Koemushi. Who did an infinite amount of rolls already, but to be honest I\u2018m not too familiar with his works. \\n\\n\r\nMy verdict: 5,5/10 (rounded up to 6/10 because of it\u2018s overall fitting nature to the show) \\n\\n\r\nOverall the presentation of this show is lacking and could have done (and should have been!) better. A different studio (like Madhouse, Sunrise or even Gainax) could have made a better job (maybe) with some other people in the staff. \\n\\n\r\nMoving on to the content... \\n\\n\r\nStory \\n\\n\r\nMohiro Kitoh, the original creator of the Manga Bokurano (ours) has some sort of weird fetish for shows with dark themes and children. \\n\r\nHe seems to be obsessed with themes like, death, suicide, rape, depression and apocalypse. \\n\r\nThose are the themes presented in Bokurano. And not by adults, no by children. To be exact 13 year old middleschoolers. \\n\r\nAt first the concept might sound overused. A cast of teenagers/children ride a gigantic Robot to save the world against invaders. But after finishing the show, it wasn\u2018t really about that but more about the implications of death and sacrifice. \\n\r\nWould you give your life for the world? Do you even think it is worth protecting? These concepts are in the spotlight and each of the 15 children reacts differently with these implications. \\n\r\nIt all start out as a game but becomes all serious right in EP2. And this is where this show shines. Tension, cliffhangers, and bit of pieces of information that are feed to you. \\n\r\nThere is every time something new that gets revealed and that is what gets you hooked. \\n\r\nSo many questions so little answers, but it all (?) makes sense in the end. \\n\r\nIt never feels boring (unless there is a shitty CGI fight but those never really drag on too long) and gets you truly involved with everything. \\n\r\nHiroyuki Morita (who didn\u2018t really direct anything besides The Cat Returns by Ghibli) did a great job here. \\n\\n\r\nSomething else that is noticeable is the difference to the Manga. I have only read parts of it but the chronological order is very different in the anime, as well as some events and the behavior of characters are different. And I feel the anime might even be superior (even though the manga looks pretty good!). I will certainly read the manga and find out what is really different. \\n\\n\r\nIt\u2018s a thrilling experience and goes to all sorts of emotions. Laughter (though little), Anger (a lot of hate towards some characters),  Sadness (some tears poured out) and also a sort of emptiness at some point. \\n\\n\r\nMy Conclusion: 8,5/10 (rounding up to 9/10 for being a great show in regards to story) \\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters \\n\\n\r\nThe other strong points of this show were the characters. \\n\r\nThough most of them not really relatable or likable in the beginning, become later much more interesting and even relatable. \\n\r\nThe show follows the LOST formula. \\n\r\nWhat does that mean? \\n\r\nWell if you\u2018ve seen Lost you might now what I mean, if now let me explain. \\n\r\nTake a bunch of different people and throw them into a mysterious dangerous situation. And then show everyone backstory as they progress to the story, while building up a desired emotion for each given character. \\n\r\nAll of them have some sort of a dramatic or interesting background story. Some more dramatic than others but all are kinda dramatic. \\n\r\nBut in the end everyone is kinda interesting and different. \\n\r\nSome characters change from unlikable to likable, while others make you wanna hate them even more, and then there are those you feel very sorry for. It tries to be realistic and not just makes you wanna love each one of them, or only hate the villain. \\n\r\nAnd as I said, some stories brought me to tears while other let me scream at the screen \u201eDIE DIE YOU PIECE OF SHIT!\u201c. \\n\\n\r\nMy Conclusion:  8/10 \\n\\n\r\nThe last segments talks about the Values and my overall enjoyment of the show, as well as my final Verdict. \\n\\n\r\nValue \\n\\n\r\nThe show sure got me thinking, and now I even want to read a Manga. Me who doesn\u2018t read manga at all! (almost non) \\n\r\nIt\u2018s a remarkable anime and one of those shows that will leave a mark in my mind that will let me remember it. \\n\r\nThough it didn\u2018t do anything groundbreaking, it sure is one of those shows that are talked about when you look for something mature, dark and sad. \\n\\n\r\n6/10 \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment \\n\\n\r\nAs Mentioned, my enjoyment almost only came from the Content of the show and not its presentation. \\n\r\nA good show doesn\u2018t need good presentation, while a bad show with good presentation will still be a bad show, is the saying. \\n\r\nBut I disagree. \\n\r\nAnime is anime because it\u2018s animated. If the animation sucks I feel as if it\u2018s a wasted medium and would have been better only as a manga or something else. \\n\r\nIt offered some visual pleasing moments but it overall was crap from a presentation side of view and that lowered my overall enjoyment quite a bit. \\n\r\nThat said the story, characters and overall experience was very much enjoyable and that\u2018s why I recommend everyone to watch it and bare with the shitty CGI and sometimes sloppy animation quality. The Manga is different and will not offer you the same experience as the Anime does. \\n\\n\r\n6/10 \\n\\n\r\nMy final verdict: \\n\\n\r\nBokurano was a show that ended up being better than expected, had me gripped for 24 episodes and was a themepark of many emotions, though all mostly on the sad spectrum. \\n\r\nIt\u2018s something that makes you question motivation for your actions and your reason why you live. \\n\r\nIt\u2018s not an outstanding anime, but a very good story, so watch it with that in mind. \\n\\n\r\n6/10 Fair",

Without spoiling anything, this anime is NOT ABOUT mechas.\r\nThe CGI is badly implemented and stands out in a terrible way. The characters are poorly drawn too and the animation... Oh my...\r\nThe one thing you should know is every episode more or less, ends with a mecha fight. But there's NO SATISFACTION. 90% of an episode is about the character's life and drama and it literally cuts / jumbs into the mecha fight which lasts 1min.\r\nThe whole show is depressing from beginning to end.

            "content": "So, what would you do if tasked with saving the world?  That\u2019s the question each one of the fifteen middle school children are forced to answer after having been bound to a contract.  At first, they just believe it to be some computer game created by a man named Kokopelli that they encounter.  But, by the time the first episode ends, we, along with the fifteen children, realize that something far more sinister is at play.\r\nBokurano starts out incredibly well.  The pacing is excellent, the hints and foreshadowing are all expertly woven to induce a sense of dread to the audienceand the children.  This is not a happy show.  It explores the psyche of each one of the children, their pasts, and how they deal with adversity, all before they are required to fight the next alien invader.\\n\\n\r\nNow, some of the issues I have, or issue, is that the stories of the first half or so of the children are more interesting than the rest.  They delve into some complex moral and psychological issues that many mediums tend to ignore or gleam over.  I won\u2019t go into too much detail on exactly what the situations are, but they are definitely horrifying.  This leads to the first half or 2/3 of Bokurano being more interesting than the last third, which is a shame, but doesn\u2019t discount the incredibly addictive nature of this show.  \\n\\n\r\nI tend to put a lot of emphasis on shows with what I consider great endings.  I want the last episode to be one of the best in the entire series.  Sadly, that leaves me weighing a little too much on the ending and not giving enough credit to what came before it.  Not always, but it\u2019s something I\u2019ve realized. Bokurano is a strong show that explores a vast amount of psychological topics, I only wish that the final stretch was where the stronger episodes lied.  Still, the show offers an interesting look at how each one of the children react to their past, their present, and what they want for the future without being over-dramatic or apathetic.  A great show that was slightly let down by it\u2019s final stretch.  Still, I\u2019d easily recommend this anime to anyone looking for a melancholic, yet entertaining and addictive ride through the ups and downs of these tragically flawed adolescents on a grand scale.\\n\r\nVerdict:\\n\r\n8.5/10",

            "content": "Spoiler free.\r\nI found this show by browsing through related anime of my favorite shows, and I'm so glad that I did.  \r\nBokurano follows the events of a group of children who have inadvertently been thrown into a large scale event, thinking it was just a small game.  From there, they have to fight to secure the safety of everything they know.  About now, I imagine some of you are yawning.  Something like this is seen in so many different shows, and the concern I had was it was going to be another show just like that.  I was surprised tofind that wasn't the case.\\n\\n\r\nBokurano had no problems with kicking off immediately.  I thought there were going to be a few primer episodes, but if I recall correctly, you're being introduced to the main plot point in the first episode.  This can either succeed or fail, in Bokurano's case, it didn't really do either, it's just how it was.  Another interesting thing Bokurano did well was not introducing the children alltogether.  For reasons I won't get into, their back story is introduced individually throughout the show, and I thought this was fantastic.  Everyone had their time in the light, and it's hard to pin down just who the main character really is.  After finishing it, you could argue who it was, but the point is I don't feel like it matters so much.  With that said, I really enjoyed how the characters were developed, if not for just a short while.\\n\\n\r\nAnother interesting thing was the fight scenes were slow paced, and ended abruptly.  Half the episode wasn't spent sequencing robots hitting each other.  A couple of them were fast paced based on the pilot's ability, but generally, you could feel the weight of each machine.  This is another thing that could have bothered me if the show hadn't been able to pull it off so well.  I was actually more interested in the story than I was watching a couple hunks of metal hit each other.  That isn't to say it didn't have its great moments, in fact, it kind of presented a nice build up to the last fight, which was really good.\\n\\n\r\nThis show is relatively older, so it doesn't look as 'clean' as some of the newer shows.  I guess people care about that, but even with that aside, the overall design of the show was really great.  Some of the mechs had awesome designs, and I really enjoyed each of the environments presented.  I couldn't say this show was visually lacking at all.\\n\\n\r\nThe only complaint I might have is I would have liked there to be a couple more episodes that really emphasized on the gravity of the overall situation.  As with any show, there's a point where you realize things aren't so black and white, and something larger is presented to you.  Bokurano had a nice set up, but unfortunately didn't have a lot of time to go deeper into what was going on behind the scenes.  I wouldn't say it's a huge downside, considering it was mostly just focusing on the story of the characters, but even so, I was really interested in the large picture.  But I suppose that's what the manga is for, right?\\n\\n\r\nLastly, the music.  The music playing throughout the show was really good, but the main theme is amazing.  Few anime out there have a really good opening song, and I'm overjoyed whenever I find a good one.  \\n\\n\r\nIn the end, this show is still kind of \"just another robot show\" in a small way.  I feel like some things could have been explored, but overall I'm happy with how it played out.  It wasn't really a leader in terms of doing things differently, but even so, I really enjoyed every moment of it.  If you haven't tuned in, you need to.  It's a humble reminder that sometimes things don't need to be revolutionary, and sometimes something so simple can turn out really great.",

            "content": "WARNING: This review contains spoilers. Please read further at your own risk.\r\nJudging by the anime cover, Bokurano may look like every mecha anime ever, with giant robots in action against monsters. But do not be deceived. In reality, it\u2019s a whole different story.\r\nStory: 9/10\r\nDuring summer camp, a group of 15 kids search a mysterious cave and discover that there\u2019s a working computer and accessories inside. They meet a guy who claims that he is a game developer and just finished making a game in which a giant robot has to fight huge monsters to save the earth. He persuades them to make a contract firstin order to play the game. After they finish up with the contract, they\u2019re teleported inside the giant robot. One of them gets chosen as the captain who gets to control the robot, while others sit beside him/her and watch. After each win, the captain\u2019s life energy is taken by the robot, so the captain dies. The story has very little focus on the mecha fights. The thing to shed light on was the backstories of each character. It was very well written and never got boring. Each character had his/her own unique story.\\n\r\nIn my opinion, the episode directing was 'meh' during 2 or 3 episodes. When they won the first fight and Takashi Waku (Pilot 1) died, his friends didn\u2019t even react to it. I mean like literally, not a single shit was given. They just stood there and watched him fall off a dam.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: 7/10\\n\r\nSound: 7/10\\n\r\nNot gonna emphasize on the animation and sound, as they were neither bad nor too good. They were just right.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter, judging by character likability: 7/10\\n\r\nLet me put the spotlight on the two extreme sides of the cast.\\n\\n\r\nHated Characters.\\n\r\nIsao Kako (Captain #3): Rapist piece of shit. My second-most hated character of the series. He can go to hell. He was your typical \u201cWhy is all this happening to me only?\u201d guy. Before piloting, he tried to rape Chizuru. He died before even getting a chance to pilot Zearth.\\n\r\nChizuru Honda (Captain #4): Too naive for her own good. She got banged by her teacher and he leaked the pictures on the internet. Kinda feel bad for her but at the same time I hate her a lot. It\u2019s her own fault for trying to get too comfy with a teacher.\\n\r\nHiroyuki Hatagai (Chizuru\u2019s Teacher): Where do I even start with this guy? I hate his guts, down to the very core. I wish Chizuru had killed him when she had the chance.\\n\\n\r\nLiked Characters.\\n\r\nMako Nakarai (Captain #6): She was an average girl. She fell short of money and tried to resort to prostitution. Lucky for her, she unknowingly met one of her mom\u2019s friends as her first customer. It felt good he guided her to the right path. After that, he drove her to the bar where she met her mom and her friends. All of them were really kind to her and she learned her lesson. She ended up fighting hard to protect what needed to be protected: her mom and friends.\\n\r\nKunihiko Moji (Captain #7): His dying wish was for his heart to be donated to his friend, who had a heart disease. Good guy Moji.\\n\r\nYoko Machi (Captain #13): She was at her brother\u2019s side in the beginning, but thank god she shot that bastard, +1 for her.\\n\r\nJun Ushiro (Captain #14): I hated him at first. He treated Kana very badly. But in the end, he does care for her and becomes the pilot instead of Kana.\\n\r\nKana Ushiro (Jun\u2019s sister): Liked her for being able to put up with her brother\u2019s shit.\\n\\n\r\nExtras.\\n\r\nThe remaining cast was also good, especially the backstory of Misumi.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 7/10\\n\r\nOverall: 7/10\\n\r\nIt was interesting peeking into the backstories and lives of so many characters in a 24-episode anime. To wrap it up, it\u2019s a great psychological and unique mecha anime.",

Dont get me wrong, Im not mad because it doesnt make sense, Im mad at the constructed nonsense of this anime. Given the fact there are several parallel universes - How does them competing make any sense? It doesn't, like at all. Why can the creators of this system only leech \"energy\" from a world that wins 15 robot fights? No reason. In a world where there ARE parallel universes, wouldntthere only arise even more universes? I.e. the ones that died in the first fight, the ones that died in the fourth fight etc.\\n\r\nThe dramaturgy doesnt work for me, we see a portrait of every kid for 20 minutes, then it dies. Too many times. What remains are shallow characters, boring predictable repetitions.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime will bore people who arent easily influenced by tragic music and pretentious depth weaved through far fetching words.

However, don\u2019t be fooled by video clips of huge mecha fighting each other \u2013 this is not a classic mecha series with epic space battles and the like. Instead, each child who comes to pilot the mecha known as Zearth faces not only the struggle to save the world but also a struggle of their own. What do they fight for? Some fight for their loved ones.Others fight for themselves. A few see it as their duty. Some don\u2019t know why and struggle to find a reason to look death in the face for the sake of complete strangers.\\n\\n\r\nEach story arc deals with the next pilot set to fight on Earth\u2019s behalf. Each child has a story to tell, a conflict of some sort to work out before they fight. One wants to prove himself to his workaholic father. Another deals with bullying because of her mother\u2019s reputation. Another grapples with his disappeared dad while supporting his three younger siblings. And so on and so forth. At first, getting to know all the kids all at once is overwhelming, but as each one is explored and developed, they become unique and well fleshed out. Each arc then becomes a \u201ccoming of age\u201d story for each of the kids, culminating in their final battles as they reflect on their lives and the world they fight for. In the meantime, the group of children draw unwanted attention to themselves from the government and military and they must deal with the implications of their actions.\\n\\n\r\nAs you can imagine, it\u2019s heavy on drama and it gets amped up even further as the story progresses and the children learn more about this twisted \u201cgame\u201d (but to discuss them here would be very spoilery). Bring tissues.\\n\\n\r\nFor the more technical merits of Bokurano, it fares pretty well. Animation and art aren\u2019t overly detailed and there aren\u2019t any bright, glaring colours. Realism is what the animators seemed to be aiming for. Still, it slips up here and there, and sometimes obviously so. I also caught some re-used animation a few times, too. The mecha are done in CG and while it\u2019s noticeable, it doesn\u2019t stick out too much in a bad way, and Zearth and some of the other mecha designs are well rendered.\\n\\n\r\nThe OP and the two EDs are all sung by Chiaki Ishikawa. The OP, \u201cUninstall\u201d, carries a rather haunting melody and is well-suited to the anime. The EDs are, unfortunately, more forgettable. Still, it\u2019s notable that the lyrics of each song fit the anime to a T, so the translated lyrics are well worth paying attention to. The background music is, for the most part, unremarkable \u2013 not noteworthy but not bad, either. I have no complaints about the seiyuu as they all did a great job.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Bokurano was a surprisingly strong series that gives viewers plenty to think about. No magic tricks here, no fairy tale endings. Nevertheless, despite all the hardships the characters face, I can\u2019t help but feel a bit hopeful, like I should appreciate life a little more and all the good things in this world. After all, we never know when it\u2019ll all be over.",

            "content": "I posted this review on a forum as a recommendation to someone who was looking for a depressing and slice of life anime, and I was told by two people that my review was able to get them to watch the series and I believe they enjoyed it, so I decided to share my review here in hopes of intriguing more people into watching it. \r\nThoughts: This anime cannot be completely enjoyed unless you have the patience to watch it all the way through. Even if you do not have much patience, I still think the first episode ends in a way that compels thewatchers to continue watching because it really does leave you at a cliffhanger. I would go more into detail, but I really rather not spoil it for anyone. Even though Slice of Life is not one of the genres for this anime, I still think it has its moments where this genre is applied. The children have to go through a lot, and there are many times throughout the anime where you feel sorry for them, since they lose, let's say, something very close to them after each battle. Again, I do not think the first episode will be as exciting if I go into more detail, so that is as far as I will go.\\n\\n\r\nStory: While watching the scenes from the opening song, you figure that the anime will be a typical mecha with the typical battles, and since you are told that there are 15 children and 15 alien battles, it is hard to be persuaded the battles are going to be very unique. That is partly correct. The battles do seem overused a lot, but the actual plot for the anime is rather unique. As you continue watching, you learn that there is more to the actual battles with the \"aliens\" each time. There is a deeper meaning in the anime, but it is the watcher's duty to figure it out, which is a good and bad thing. If you are just watching an anime for enjoyment, then I really do not suggest this. However, if you wish to analyze the anime and find the deeper meaning, then this will probably interest you.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: The art is rather simple, and I did not have any problems with it, but I think it could have been better. Sometimes simple art works well for certain kinds of anime, but I think it was not completely fitting for this one. There have been plenty other anime out there that have successfully been able to pull off the simple style of animation before, but unfortunately this one could not. The 3D for the mecha battles were actually pretty good, any way.\\n\\n\r\nSound: The opening song, Uninstall by Chiaki Ishikawa, was impressive, I thought. She has a pretty powerful voice, and it really worked for the opening. I think the music could even make up for some of the disappointing animation, but that is just my opinion. The ending songs work too, but Uninstall was mainly the only song that captured my attention.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: I really could not favor one character over another in this anime (partly because almost all of them \"disappears\" by the end), but I liked how one of the characters in the beginning acted like a total jerk, and eventually lightened up in the end. There is actually a side story that explains why his attitude is like that, but I cannot be bothered to explain everything in that area. You will learn that some of the characters live depressing lives, pretty much like any other anime, but I do not think there is any one perfect character in this show, which makes it more enjoyable.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: I just really liked how this anime played out overall. I think I said this before, but it is a rather unique story. I do not recall there being much comedy or any at all, but I think that works for some people. I believe most watchers will definitely cry during some episodes. I have to admit that I did.",

            "content": "Title: Bokurano\r\nManga, Light Novel, Anime: Bokurano was originally a manga done by Mohiro Kitoh.  It began running in Shogakukan's Ikki magazine in 2004, and is still running at present, at a total of eight collected volumes.  It has yet to be licensed Stateside.\r\nA light novel entitled Bokurano ~alternative~ written by Renji Ohki and with character designs done by Mohiro Kitoh began running in May of 2007, and is still running at this point in time, with three volumes released this far.  It also has yet to be licensed Stateside.\r\nThe anime series clocked in at a total of 24 episodes, and was doneby Studio Gonzo (famous for Gankutsou: The Count of Monte Cristo and Saikano) and directed by Hiroyuki Morita (famous for his work on The Cat Returns).  It ran from April 8th to September 25th, 2007 on Japanese TV, and has been licensed Stateside by Funimation, though they have yet to say when they're actually going to release it.  EDIT: As of this time, Funimation has only ordered cease and desists to fansubbers on behalf of Gonzo, but a NA liscensor has yet to be announced for this series.\\n\\n\r\nStory: So, there are these fifteen kids, all in middle school except for one girl in fourth grade, and they're at this summer camp.  They end up finding a grotto with a random guy in it, and he enlists them in a &quot;game&quot; involving robots.  What he fails to mention is that the game is real, and that they actually do have to pilot a robot.  There are fifteen robot enemies, one for each kid.  They have to beat them, or the Earth goes bye-bye.  The robot they pilot runs on their life forces, though, so even if they win, they die, too.  \\n\\n\r\nThe story focuses on the backgrounds of each of the kids as they're called up to pilot initially, but there are subplots involving the government and the overall game added in after the halfway point, along with some AMAZING plot twists.\\n\\n\r\nThe story isn't quite as good as Gankutsuou was, but this is up there with Gonzo's better works.  Yeah, the story's just a bit depressing, but there are little rays of brightness that peak in every once in a while, and it's enough to keep you going through.  Each kid gets development enough that you care as they go to face their deaths, and you'll at least be able to remember either their first or their last name, as do other people who become involved in their situation.  \\n\\n\r\nIt's a good story and all, but it didn't quite have the impact on me that I thought it would.  I mean, just looking at the show's description, I thought it would be Saikano-esque levels of depression, but it never quite reaches those.\\n\\n\r\nThe show's also very self-aware at times, and pokes fun at the mecha genre (the kids naming the robot, shouting out their attacks, getting &quot;uniforms&quot; to wear as they ride in it, etc).  \\n\\n\r\nIf you're going into this as a mecha fan, though, be aware that the robot fights aren't central to the story; there's at least one every episode, but the story's more centered around the children than it is around the robot. \\n\\n\r\nAlso, let's cover a big controversy that came up while this was being released, and contains slight spoilers, so read ahead at your own risk.  The creator of the manga, Mohiro Kitoh, made a blog entry while the show was being released that claimed that the author hated the source material (he did dislike it, admittedly, which begs the question of why he was even chosen to do this), and has asked if there was a way that he could save the children.  Kitoh supposedly gave the go ahead, but asked for fans of the manga to stop watching the anime, because it wouldn't be anything like the manga.  Well, I went and compared what I could find for information about how the manga unfolded and how the anime turned out, and the only real difference that I could find was in how some characters were handled and the order in which they were called to be pilots. Again, yes, different from the original, but the children were not freed from the contract and the fifteen who are contracted do end up dying, and the changes that did happen were nothing that would call for Kitoh to ask fans to boycott the series.  I think this is a case of overreaction from the original author.  It's all the more ironic and hypocritical since he's involved in a complete retooling of the story (the Bokurano ~alternative~ light novel).\\n\\n\r\nArt: The style that Gonzo chose to use for this is a bit simpler than I've seen with other productions that they've done.  It just doesn't look very good, honestly -- I've seen other series that have done simple well, like Kino no Tabi, but it just doesn't work as the series goes on.\\n\\n\r\n3D is obviously used for the mechas, and it looks pretty good.  Yeah, it stands out quite a bit, but then again, it's highly doubtful that one could do a robot entirely in 2D, and the thing's SUPPOSED to stand out.\\n\\n\r\nMusic: The background music for this series is, like Toward the Terra and Elfen Lied, one of the few scores I've actively listened to and noticed since Gankutsuou.  Excellent recurring themes.\\n\\n\r\nThe OP, &quot;Uninstall&quot;, is done by Chiaki Ishikawa, and is an absolutely beautiful piece that fits the series perfectly.  Both of the EDs are also done by her, and are more of the typical female JPop ballads, but I like the second one (&quot;Vermillion&quot;), more than the first one (&quot;Little Bird&quot;).\\n\\n\r\nSeiyuu: Kenji Nojima, who replaced Takemoto's seiyuu in the last episode of Honey and Clover, plays one of the children,  Tomokazu Sugita (Soldier Blue in Toward the Terra and Mayama in Honey and Clover) also appears as one of the children, and another child's seiyuu also appeared in Paranoia Agent as Shounen Bat.  The rest of the cast gives excellent performances, as always.\\n\\n\r\nLength: This feels about right, though there were some character's arcs who took more than one episode and probably could've been shortened a bit.  Any longer and it just wouldn't have worked. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: A good, solid mecha story centered around the children who pilot it, with decent art and length, beautiful music, and pretty good seiyuu.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 9/10\\n\r\nArt: 8/10\\n\r\nMusic: 9/10\\n\r\nLength: 8/10\\n\r\nSeiyuu: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 43/50; 86% (B )",

            "content": "Bokurano is a show that sets itself apart from most conventional standards and clich\u00e9s. It doesn't have the high-tempo, flashy battles of most mecha anime, nor does it have characters which fit into any standard role, or any of the type.\r\nThe first episode of the show can be quite overwhelming to some; you will rather suddenly be introduced to the entire cast of fourteen seventh-graders and one fourth-grader. They are gathered from various places on a summer camp, enjoying a seemingly peaceful summer. That is, until they decide to explore a hidden cave. here they encounter a peculiar man with an even more peculiar name,who invites them to play a certain game...\\n\\n\r\nTo put it simply, they are tricekd into a contract binding them as pilots for a giant robot, and what's worse, they have to fight other giant robots, unless they want Earth to face acopalypse. And so they decide to fight. But there are a lot of secrets revolving around the impeding fights, the robots and why they have to fight. And some of them are more horrible than others...\\n\\n\r\nOf course, the outside world isn't going to stand still as rampaging robots duke it out across cities, killing thousands and ruining property for billions. This results in some intricate side-plots with some, well, some standard mecha parties/groups. Namely, the military, and some separate group of scientists. And these side-plots, which plays out quite well and interestingly, are pretty much what you get of a real, continuous plot; because aside that and the fighting it's much more about each of the characters struggling with problems in their life.\\n\\n\r\nAnd the characters, sure, they get their screen time and it is done very well. Extremely well. Though I must admit that for seventh graders they act a little on the mature side. Maybe they shoulda been a few years older and it owuld have been completely believeable. Anyway, they are normal children, thrown into an unescapable battle with everything at the stakes if they lose and nothing but despair to the victor. Since they each know what cruel fate awaits them when they get chosen as the pilot for the robot, they end up living out their last days doing what they feel compelled to do before parting with this world. And yes, you get to see inside the lives of each of the teenagers; some getting more screentime than others, and it would seem that each of them have their troubles in life. Love, forbidden or not, revenge, family problems, there's a ton of stuff these adolescents have in their life.\\n\\n\r\nOh, it plays out quite beautifully, except for the aforementioned fact that they seem to young to actually react to these problems, at least in the way they do; they seem overly mature for their age. \\n\\n\r\nAnd along with the main cast, there's quite the few interesting side characters. who have their important say in the plot and the lives and struggles of the main characters, while shining wonderfully on their own. \\n\\n\r\nThere was one thing which struck me when I watched Bokurano. It was that it seemed very dispassionate, almost cold in its emotions. When there's a battle, it's not like one would feel the adrenaline. When characters face problems, it's not like they seem overly emotional about it; at least the viewer will not go as far as to become emoional with them. The voice actors, they were all quite quiet and calm, and so was the mood set forth by the animation and the soundtrack. This was, to this reviewer, a good thing for the show. It is great to see that the show is never rushed; yet, at the same time, it doesn't get bogged down with unecessary scenes or anything. It just is placid.\\n\\n\r\nTogether with this, the animation is quite marvelous to look at. It's not breathtaking or meticulous, but it's good to look at. There's no sharp, glaring or bright colours. There's no rough edges or anything. The light and shadow efffects are lovely to look at, too. It's all very temperate. Even the massive mecha, which are all made in CGI, aren't too glaring or disturbing to look at in the environments it is put into. Movements in eneral are qutie smooth; they certainly didn't skip ahead on frames when making this anime, and that is really nice.\\n\\n\r\nGoing along, the opening and ending themes are quite melliflous tunes. Chiaki Ishikawa has a serene voice and sings three stunning songs thereafter, all of which are themes I would want to listen to over and over. \"Uninstall\" is very mysterious, almost a bit adventurous; yet very inviting and makes you feel that the show has something for you to experience. The ending themes, \"Little Bird\" and \"Vermillion\" both are interesting themes to listen to. The first is something I could gladly listen to after going to bed at night, to fall asleep to, or simply and plainly relax to. \"Vermillion\" leans towards the J-pop side of things, but has its interesting tone, like you're just drifting off somewhere, in a world of dreams, illusions.\\n\\n\r\nThe background music is composed mainly of calming string tunes and mysterious, inexplicable piano songs. It sets up the mood quite well, albeit keeping mainly to a single one or two; making sure that your emotions keep within the doldrums; reposed and quiet.\\n\\n\r\nIf I were to sum it up, I would have to say that Bokurano isn't a show that stands out very well. It doesn't leave a lasting impression, but while you watch this, you will most certainly be affected by an aura of melancholy; of placidity and stoicism. It drags you into the lives of a group of unsuspecting adolescents and shows you what would happen if someone suddenly had the choice between not doing anything and watch the Earth go asunder; dying along with it, or try and save it, with a risk of failing, and still dying. It shows you what a variety of people would do with their final days, if they knew they were about to die. To me, Bokurano was quite good, but not entirely up there.",

            "content": "I started watching bokurano thinking it would have a good story and some cool fights but that proved to be partially wrong, it has a good story but the fights, not really good. I still enjoyed it but its quite different from the story summaries, previews, etc.\r\nAt start the story seems lame and rushed, just a little excuse to put some kids fighting for earth in some big robots, the fights are quite dull as well and the animation is quite average with some bad parts even but thats mostly at the start.\r\nI'm glad I kept watching it because it gets much better, the storytwists, or better, it unveils a completely different plot from the first appearances becoming rather interesting. The fights improve allot compared to the first ones but this is not a mecha style anime with lots of cool fights and moves, its a story driven drama where each episode u get to known one of the characters better, usually before their respective battle portraying their will and reasons to fight or give up. The mystery behind the robots and the battles is also unveiled slowly and I'm afraid I can't say much more to avoid spoiling the development, one of the good aspects of the show.\\n\r\nThe music isn't bad, the opening becomes quite enjoyable after a couple episodes and theres the usual backtracks accompanying the crucial moments.\\n\r\nOverall its a good show, with a decent story about a couple kids who are put into a non desirable situation without even being asked, and are now carrying the burden to save earth, their own problems and doubts are explored while they find a meaning to fight for earth, themselves, protecting someone or simply giving up. Don't expect much action, its a show for people who like good stories with a slow but decent development and some epic moments filled with sadness, anger, and self sacrifice.",

            "content": "Overview:\r\nTime for a totally random review! Today, I'll be covering the always polarizing Bokurano. One of my offline buddies loves this series, so he let me borrow it. I really wanted to like it but...yeah.\r\nStory:\r\nThe story is that God is an utter asshole. He arbitrarily decides that there are too many universes and now a fighting tournament is needed to see which universe survives. This series has the same plot as Dragon Ball Super Tournament of Power, but plays it DEAD FUCKING SERIOUS! You are setting yourself up to fail if you create a plot that Akira \"poop on a stick is funny\" Toriyama wouldcome up with and take it this seriously. Each parallel Earth chooses a bunch of random children and forces them to pilot a giant robot in a best of 12 contest. However, the robot is powered by the souls of children, so the kid dies even if he or she wins. The kids of our Earth decide to name their robot \"Zearth\" because I guess Dio copyrighted ZA WARUDO! Zearth is OP as fuck and easily wins each and every battle...then the kid dies. That's basically every episode. Our universe survives, the others die and...that's really it.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\\n\r\nBokurano has a lot of characters...but they all die shortly after introduction and leave zero emotional impact. You're left going \"oh no...so and so's dead...what a shock!\" Let's introduce kid #1. He's an athlete who was sad that his dad never came to his games, so he quit sports. Then he pilots a giant robot and says goodbye to this cruel world. I don't even remember his name. I can't remember what he looked like. Is that the point? That we are all disposable cogs in the machine of this horrible existence? Is this anime just a sophomoric foray into nihilism? Maybe there is some deeper meaning the author intended, but I sure didn't see it. I was probably a tad distracted by how fucking stupid the plot is.\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\\n\r\nDid you think the CGI in Full Metal Panic aged poorly? You ain't seen nothing yet! I think this anime at least looked sort of acceptable upon release, but now it's a visual abortion. \\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\\n\r\nI at least liked the opening theme and its chorus of DELETE! DELETE! It sadly just reminded me that I could be re-watching Matt Hardy's The Final Deletion again, which is far better than this anime. Yes, watching 2 redneck wrestlers launch fireworks at each other and spew total nonsense is a million times better than this anime.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\\n\r\nI obviously didn't care for this anime, but maybe some other people found enjoyment or profundity where I didn't. That's cool. At least this anime started some fun conversations. \\n\\n\r\nMe: \"I'm sorry man...but this anime is just abject trash.\"\\n\\n\r\nMy friend: \"Oh really? Coming from the guy who loves Elfen Lied? At least my anime doesn't involve a plethora of naked children!\"\\n\\n\r\nMy other friend: \"Guys! Guys! BOTH of your anime are trash! Instead you should watch a REAL anime...the first season of Slayers from 1995.\\n\\n\r\neveryone: \"Yeah...Slayers is pretty good\"",

            "content": "Bokurano was one of those shows that you can't really like unless you really look at the deeper meaning. If you're looking for a series that you can watch without thinking about, then you might as well stop reading right now.\r\nSTORY:\r\nBokurano's story is very unique and interesting. You may think of it as just mindless killing, but similar to Gantz, it is a psychological anime that shows what happens when normal people are put into hopeless situations and are forced to put their lives on the line.\r\nART:\r\nThe art was not as good as it could have been, but I had no problems with it. Itwas a bit annoying having to switch from 2d to 3d a few times in every episode, but it wasn't something intolerable.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND:\\n\r\nI thought the sound was pretty good, and was able to partially cover up for the slightly disappointing art. There was nothing wrong with the sound in Bokurano, but I wasn't blown away by it in the least.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER:\\n\r\nThis is where Bokurano really stands out. There were 15 main characters in the series, and depending on how you look at it, there could even be a few more. At first, I was a bit skeptical, seeing as though there are only 24 episodes in the show. But amazingly, I learned about the back story of every single character and realized that each one was very much different from the others. And even though there was so much character development, it did not take away from the story.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT:\\n\r\nI really enjoyed seeing how each character reacted. There may not be enough action for some people in Bokurano, but there was plenty of drama to keep you interested throughout each episode.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL:\\n\r\nWith all that said, I'll give this series an 83/100, a solid score.",

            "content": "At the end of the day, what makes \"Bokurano\" work is its interesting subject matter and the fact that it has all of the foundations of an amazing story. Unfortunately, it sets the bar higher than it can actually reach and ultimately fails to live up to its potential.\r\n(This review contains major spoilers for both the manga and anime).\r\nMy first impression of this show was really good. It seemed like it was setting itself up for an intelligent story that would leave you thinking about it long after it was over. The kind of story that deconstructs popular concepts within fiction (in this case the\"giant mecha genre\"), in order to drive them to their dark and desolate conclusions. One that ultimately brings you a new reflection of reality, that can only be seen through the lens of fiction. That is the kind of story it was setting itself up to be.\\n\\n\r\nAt first, I had thought I had hit the jackpot seeing as how the content was pretty much the darkest thing I could never imagine. Kids, having to sacrifice their lives in order to save the crapsack world that doesn't care for them; the revelation that they are in the process, destroying other worlds that have people setting out to do the same; having what may very well be the highest death count in any story of all time. In fact, it was more than just dark, it was pitch black.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, as I continued to watch it, I realized that the show being dark was pretty much all there was to it. Even though it clearly presents itself with the ambitions of being profound and thought provoking, and with the presence of a show that has lots to say, it ends up saying not much at all, almost as if believing that the subject matter itself is enough to get your interest, leaving you instead with emptiness. The worst part is the ending which is so bizarrely out of place, nonsensical, and naive, that it becomes downright insulting that the writers would expect you to swallow it.\\n\\n\r\nBefore I get into details, let's talk about the \"Bokurano\" manga series. I began reading the manga immediately after finishing the anime. Not because I liked the anime so much but because I had heard that the manga was a lot different. I learned that the anime had been produced while the manga was still going and so I reasoned that the story must have suffered solely due to the anime making it up on its own when it no longer had the manga to go by. I was convinced that the manga was where the story would reach the hights it was setting itself up for, and so I gave it a try.\\n\\n\r\nAlthough the manga did in fact redeem it to some degree, it wasn't by a whole lot. The biggest difference with the manga and the anime is the level of cynicism. The manga may be the most cynical one I have ever read, which fits the tone of the dark story and subject matter. It still feels empty in what it wants to convey, but at the very least it feels like it is supposed to. The anime on the other hand tones down most of the cynicism of the manga and tries to portray this pitch black story with an air of optimism, which makes it absolutely ridiculous. Especially when contrasting it with the manga does this flaw become apparent.\\n\\n\r\nThe best example that I can think of comes from a chapter in the manga that didn't make it into the anime. Kirie has been selected as the next pilot and talks about how he doesn't want to go through with it with Tanaka. In this scene, he talks about how he sees no reason to protect a world that has done nothing for him, just because it is the world he himself belongs to. The surviving world consists of people just like this one, and it would be hypocritical to justify sacrificing one world to save another, just because one of those worlds is your own. Especially when the world in question is one that you do not care for. At the end, Kirie ends up fighting after all because he realizes by watching the pilot of the other world that both of their worlds are just as bad, and there is no reason for saving or sacrificing either one of them over the other. So he fights, because that is the role he was given and it ends up being the only role he is able to live up to.\\n\\n\r\nIn the anime it's a tad bit different. First off, the entire scene with Kirie and Tanaka doesn't take place whatsoever, and although Kirie's position to piloting the ship is retained, it is incredibly dumbed down. However, the most striking difference is in how this arc is concluded. Kirie sort of just changes his mind and gains confidence that his world is awesome and worth protecting after all. Then he proceeds to fight as if it was the most obvious thing there ever was. As if his previous attitude was just some temporary mood swing. Oh, and when he starts fighting, he does a bunch of elegant fighting moves and stuff, because that's cool right?\\n\\n\r\nHowever, this is nothing in comparison to what I am about to write next. If you have only been skimming through this review until this point then at least read the following couple of paragraphs carefully because it is pretty much the most spot-on illustration of my problems with the anime that I can think of.\\n\\n\r\nIn the same conversation as above, Kirie and Tanaka also talk for a while about movies. Kirie explains how he never sees happy endings in movies as actual happy endings because of the means that are used to get to them. \\n\\n\r\n(Paraphrasing)\\n\r\n\"A hero that kills a 100 faceless bad guys, rescues the girl, and saves the world, is always depicted at the end of the movie with a smiling face even though there were a lot of sacrifices made for him to get there. Why doesn't anyone in the audience feel sad for any of the 100 faceless mooks whom may have had families of their own, whom loved and cared for them? What if they weren't actually that bad? What if they just happened to take a wrong turn that eventually led to them getting in the way of the protagonist? Why does the audience only get upset when something happens to the main characters anyway? Does the protagonist even have to be a sympathetic character to gain the audiences respect? Or does his presence as the centre of the story dignify every action he makes? It seems that as long as the story ends with the hero being alive and happy, everything is alright and we can end it on a happy note, ignoring all of the bad stuff that actually happened before it.\"\\n\\n\r\nThis here is one of the few parts of the story that actually made me think a little. If only there was a central direction for the story to take that would head deeper into this kind of content, it would have made for a much more rewarding experience. One thing I love about this conversation is how meta it is. If you think about it, everything Kirie says in this scene can be applied to the readers of this very manga. In a way, it is as if the author is making fun of you.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, the reason I brought it up is to discuss the message that the author is giving us. What this conversation basically is telling us about \"Bokurano\" as a whole is this: The ending of this story will be just as harsh as everything that has preceeded it. It will not contrive itself to bring you a false happy ending that defies logic and insults your intelligence.\\n\\n\r\nThis exactly is why the anime fails, because the thing is, well... it perfectly describes the exact kind of ending the anime got, doesn't it?\\n\\n\r\nI mean think about it. That has got to be the defining quality of a failed adaptation. Sure, this might not have been the easiest story to write a fitting ending for but if the adaptation becomes the very kind of work that the original is criticizing and using as a source of social commentary, then you have created the antithesis to the story you were supposed to make. The people who made the anime, simply had no idea what they were making an anime out of or they didn't have the ambition or the guts to actually make it, and that is all there is to it.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of endings, the one in the manga was expectedly in a much harsher tone, consistent with the rest of the story, it ends simply by going full circle, ending up where it started with everything starting over again but with new people. It's not a happy ending nor a sad one. It comes off with the empty sense of insignificance you have been feeling throughout the entire read, and plays it off as if it was the most natural thing in the world, which by that point it is.\\n\\n\r\nAlthough the cynicism of the manga makes the story work well enough as it is, the premise is too good to be wasted on a story that could have been so much more than just a nihilistic presentation of \"a million is a statistic\". The manga aimed to be amazing yet it managed only to be pretty good, while the anime aimed to be pretty good and ended up being nothing more than decent. The manga wanted to go somewhere but didn't, while the anime wanted to go somewhere until it changed its mind and went back. This story had so much potential but it led absolutely nowhere. It told me to think but gave me nothing to think about. Somewhere in here there might be a masterpiece, but it is shrouded in a story that amounts to nothing. Though for the premise and subject matter alone, it still holds up to being an entertaining enough watch to sit through.",

            "content": "\"Where in my frail body am I supposed to find the strength to stand?\"\r\n--Ishikawa Chiaki - Uninstall\r\nThis review is written with the intention of being spoiler free, but I will attempt to analyze various aspects of the show which may result in me giving hints to events of the show to some viewers. I apologize in advance if I do this and I hope to avoid spilling the beans on a very good anime. I'll admit my review is also kind of long. For a tl;dr, go the second to last paragraph.\r\nBokurano has always seemed to me to be a very contentious and controversial anime.Viewers and commenters appear to either love it to death or hate its very existence. Enjoying Bokurano is highly dependent upon bonding with the characters, feeling their pain, weeping with them, and leaving each episode like you have just left a funeral. In anime such as this, viewers tend to either develop this connection with the protagonists in which they love the series or the viewers do not and so they find themselves hating it. I can't promise that you will like Bokurano, but I can promise that I will tell you why I like it in the hopes that you will find out if you will enjoy it like I did.\\n\\n\\n\r\nBokurano is about 15 teenagers who are tricked into piloting a massive mecha to defend Earth against other massive mecha who are attacking for an unknown purpose. Each of these kids has their own reason for fighting, these reasons are very personal and most are not caught up in the idea of protecting humanity. The series is structured around arcs of one or two episodes focused on each of the pilots. In each case, we see the life of the character in question, their families and people around them, why they seem beaten down and driven into a corner, and finally, why they choose to fight the attacking mecha. \\n\\n\r\nI see Bokurano as the ultimate \"feel-bad\" anime. There are very few happy or funny moments. Each heartwarming moment turns to sorrow within 10 minutes and many of these moments are intertwined with suffering. Gutwrenching events occur almost every episode and I often found myself wanted to go sit in a corner after watching. I would not recommend seeing Bokurano as an anime similar to CLANNAD or Steins;Gate. These anime begin with humor, happiness, and charm to introduce you to the characters and then put them through hell in the pattern of what TVTropes has called Cereberus Syndrome. Bokurano does not take any time trying to win you over with hints of a happy series. By the end of the second episode, it is clear that things will not go well for our heroes and heroines. The fights are never shown as something cool or fun and aren't even that interesting to watch. A minor amount of strategy in these fights is discussed, but it's not a big focus of the series. The battles bring the kids together and connect them to each other, but are primarily used as a plot device to keep things moving.\\n\\n\r\nYou may have already noticed that Bokurano seems very similar to a much more famous anime, Neon Genesis Evangelion (abbreviated NGE). NGE seems to have been a major inspiration for Bokurano and both anime have significant similarities. Indeed, I find it pretty hard to discuss Bokurano without comparing and contrasting it with NGE so I'll get that done here. Both NGE and Bokurano go heavily into the implications of using emotionally unstable teenagers as the first and only line of defense against mysterious, eldrich beings who attack and fight for apparently no reason. Neither anime is particularly happy or uplifting and the protagonists in both can seem distant and hard to get along with throughout the series. The mission control and support for the children piloting the mecha is very limited and the pilots commonly feel like no one in the world is there for them. The most obvious antagonist in both series is the one driving the protagonists to keep fighting (Gendo Ikari and Dung Beetle for NGE and Bokurano, respectively). Be aware, however, that there are major differences as well. NGE is not solely about the suffering of its protagonists. It heavily uses Judeo-Christian naming and symbolism and the battles against the Angels can be interesting and cool at times. NGE also heavily goes into Freudian psychology and often has a highbrow, even pretentious feel to it at times. Bokurano has none of these things. Bokurano's sole focus is to rip into the Humongous Mecha genre and show why it is not fun, cool, interesting, or a good idea to enlist young, emotionally unstable children as the soldiers against enemies who threaten our species. I personally feel that if you like one of these anime, you will like the other, but I know many NGE lovers who did not enjoy Bokurano as all, so please be aware of the differences between these series if you came from NGE looking for something similar. \\n\\n\r\nBokurano uses much less symbolism than NGE, but there is one major symbol I would like to comment on: chairs. Each of the chosen pilots has a chair they are transported into the robot with. The significance of these chairs differs for each of the pilots, but each one relates to their dissatisfaction and unhappiness with their life. A sadistic, socially Darwinistic boy is associated with his father's office chair. His father is a nasty caricature of a heartless businessman who seeks to profit off the destruction of the battles occuring throughout Japan. Another boy has a floor cushion, used as a symbol of his family's poverty and the troubles he goes through in order to support his siblings who were all abandoned by their parents. A girl brings a piano bench; her parents love to hear her play, but she doesn't particularly enjoy it. All of these chairs provide insight into the protagonists and their lives and each helps the viewer understand them better and to emotionally connect with these characters. I think the use of chairs was done extremely well by the series and is used to great effect to demonstrate how each of the protagonists is both and different from all the others.\\n\\n\r\nNow that I have finished my initial discussion and analysis of Bokurano, I am going to discuss each of the official ratings MAL gives its reviewers to rate anime. If you have read this far, you likely still have some interest in Bokurano and I will attempt to use this section to help you make a final decision of whether to watch it or not:\\n\\n\r\nStory: Bokurano has the saddest story of any anime I have seen at the time of writing this. The characters all go through hell and get very little for their troubles. There are so few happy moments that the most common criticism I see of Bokurano is that the viewer can become apathetic to the trauma suffered by the characters due to the mostly uninterrupted melancholy of the series. I personally did not have this happen to me, but I can easily understand why others say this. Note that Bokurano is also very dependant on surprising plot twists and does not hesitate to make its cast miserable for the sake of the plot. If anime are to be classified as plot-driven or character-driven, Bokurano is definitely plot-driven. Overall, I give the story 8/10 for its capacity to be touching, but it probably could have used some contrast.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: The animation in Bokurano is not particularly eye-catching or attention-grabbing, but I feel that a bright, colorful animation style would be out of place. The characters are all animated realistically except for Dung Beetle whose slightly cute appearance is contrasted with his sadistic behavior. I really like that Bokurano avoids the animation caricatures that anime often slips into such as huge eyes, brightly colored hair, and flamboyant outfits. The overall gray tint to the show adds to the gray mood of the story. Because the animation fits the theme, but isn't particulary remarkable, I give it 9/10.\\n\\n\r\nSound: Bokurano opens with one my favorite anime OPs of all time, Uninstall by Ishikawa Chiaki. I absolutely love this song and still play it regularly while driving or working. In fact, the tagline for this review is a line from the OP. Be sure to look at the lyrics as they describe a lot of the general feeling of the series. Both endings to Bokurano, Little Bird and Vermillion (by the same artist), are much less interesting, but still are good to listen to and capture the feel of the series well. The voice acting and background music didn't particularly get my attention as it is neither very good nor very bad. I personally think that this works out well overall when the sound doesn't distract from the atmosphere and Bokurano isn't a series where much would be gained from music and voices grabbing one's attention. Mostly due to Uninstall, I give the sound 10/10. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Bokurano has a very large character list. 15 children pilot the robot. In addition to them, Dung Beetle and various government officials make regular appearances. Add all these up and we get a series with at least 18 main characters (and arguments can be made for others). As a result of this huge cast in a 24 episode series, characterization is somewhat limited. While each character changes throughout his or her arc, there really is only time to designate one major change. Series with so many important characters also run the risk of not showing much of their cast besides the designated protagonists, but Bokurano averts this nicely and makes each of them essential to the progression of the story. Everyone changes and develops and I found myself sympathizing with each of the protagonists, something that is quite rare with such a large number! This rating might get me some hate, but I give the characters 10/10.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: It's always hard for me to describe enjoyment for a series that really isn't fun. I would be lying if I said that Bokurano was a blast. It made me cry repeatedly and I felt rather like a dung beetle after every episode. Moments of happiness and hope get squashed very quickly and moments of sadness permeate throughout. You will see horrible things and gutwrenching moments on a regular basis while watching Bokurano. I doubt that many viewers will \"enjoy\" Bokurano in the way that the word is generally used. However, it was very emotionally cathartic so I'm going to give an enjoyment rating of 8/10.\\n\\n\r\nBased on these numbers and how I liked the series, I give it 9/10 as one of the more powerful anime I have seen, but not quite good or consistent enough to warrant a perfect rating.\\n\\n\r\nI will end this review by making a few comments to help if you are still undecided on whether to watch Bokurano or not. If you are looking for a dark action series, go elsewhere. I recommend Wolf's Rain or Ergo Proxy. If you want a dark series with black humor while keeping a lot of pain and suffering, I would try Mawaru Penguindrum or Kaiba. If you want a more positive story with a large amount of feels, I'm not the best person to ask since that's not really my thing, but I would try The Place Promised in Our Early Days or Millennium Actress. However, if you want to watch an anime completely and entirely about how much saving the world sucks with a story which does not hesitate to make its characters miserable, watch Bokurano. If you like Neon Genesis Evangelion, Mahou Shoujo Madoka Magica, or Texhnolyze, I highly recommend Bokurano.   \\n\\n\r\nNote: This is the first anime review I have written and is a repost of the review I made for Bokurano on hummingbird found here: https://hummingbird.me/anime/bokurano/reviews/10222.

            "content": "Bokurano was recommended to me by another MAL member on the IRC channel, because I said I liked Clannad. According to him \"Bokurano is an instant feels trip from start\". Now, that I watched the series, I do understand where he is coming from, but I have to disagree with that. Here is why...\r\nIf I had to summarize what Bokurano is, it's a mix between Neon Genesis: Evangelion and Gantz, sans blood. The story follows 15 high-school students, who are tricked into piloting a giant mecha, fighting off periodically arriving enemies to save the world from certain doom. Now, as far as basic premise goes,this is as simple and clich\u00e9'd as it gets. But what sets Bokurano apart from all the tons upon tons of mecha anime is the tone and the underlying story behind the mask, full of symbolism and metaphors.\\n\\n\r\nSee, Bokurano is built entirely upon the \"Reluctant Hero\" trope. The 15 kids never asked to be the saviors of humanity, they never wanted to fight or bear the enormous responsibility, having the destiny of the entire world resting upon their shoulders. (This is why I mentioned NGE up there.) They were all tricked/forced into this situation, and from then on it's \"do or die\", there is no going back. But unlike many other similar anime, this is NOT a heartwarming coming-of-age story, not in the slightest. The 15 kids didn't know each other beforehand, they kind of only just met. And now each of them faces the same predicament of having to fight to save the world with a bunch of (almost) complete strangers. (Hence the mention of Gantz.) Unlike other mecha anime, and the case of Shinji from NGE, these kids are NOT a team. They are but a bunch of confused and terrified children, who want nothing to do with the whole thing. They fight, but not because of some lofty goals of justice, valor, heroism, or because \"it's the right thing to do\". No, they fight because...what's the alternative? Let it all just end? They don't even try to be heroes, Bokurano tears down the pretentious, overblown morals of other such anime, and replaces it all with true grit, the feelings of how a real human must feel when thrown in that situation. These kids never really come to terms with what is demanded of them, they each have to muster some kind of reason to fight. Some personal reason to fight for a world they barely even had the chance to experience.\\n\\n\r\nThere is a resaon I haven't mentioned the \"big mecha battles\" yet, because those are but a tiny piece of the whole story. Bokurano is NOT about mecha battles, but the people involved. So, if you came for that, you'll be sorely disappointed. It's almost entirely a character driven piece, where the mecha fights are nothing but backdrop, without any flashy \"attacks\" or \"moves\", only a means to an end. Don't get me wrong, Zearth and the other mechas look fantastic and full of symbolism, but they are only there for show, this tale is not about them. The story itself is very slow-paced and structured like a Lego house. Each episode follows a single kid's story. As we progress through the series, we get to know the 15 kids, their backstories and their personal battles in their lives. Broken and dysfunctional families, child neglect, bullying, tarnished friendships, hard life choices and a LOT of anger, fear, angst, regret and \"could've/should've/would've\". The drama is real, and mostly well written, but it's really nothing to cry on or get a feels trip about, unless some of the kids' stories hit a little bit close to home. It is very diverse and has many thing going on at any given time, but sometimes the scenes just drag on too long with unnecessary exposition and side-arcs that ultimately lead to nowhere, and it sometimes makes the whole thing confusing. I guess the creators bit off just a bit more than they could chew. I feel having so many central characters in a regular length (24 episode) anime is just a bit too much. There are too many to really flesh them out individually and because of that I couldn't really get invested in any of them.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation quality is okay, and I particularly liked the character designs and the art direction. The visuals are well suited for the subject matter, there are no bright colors, flashy special effects or comical cuts and trasitions. This is a very down-to-Earth anime in this respect, discounting the futuristic setting and the obvious giant mechas. There is also an absolute abundance of symbolism and visual metaphors for the keen-eyed, a really good addition that complements the story in various ways. Well done!\\n\\n\r\nA special mention goes to the music, especially the opening song, \"Uninstall\" from Chiaki Ishikawa. The very second I heard the song I fell in love with it. Such a beautiful song, beautiful voice, and the whole tone and the lyrics suit the anime so well, it's simply perfect.\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion, Bokurano is a pretty unique piece of anime. It's a little tamer in tone than NGE or Gantz, but exactly that's why it's so powerful. It doesn't need the shock value, graphic and psychological brutality and gallons of blood and tears to get it's message across. The devil is in the details. Make no mistake, Bokurano is a pretty dreary anime with lots of emotion, and if the belt catches you, you will go on a feels trip. It really all depends if you can connect with the characters and the source material or not. There is also a lot of symbolism, both in the narrative and in the visuals (and the title itself), so the literately and visually inclined will have a field day with this anime for sure.",

            "content": "I like to start off by saying that, yes, I have rated this a perfect ten score but I have a reason for doing so other than the fact that I do have special favor for this anime. I did try to be as fair as I can on the rating, but I do want to note the reason for a perfect score, which I think everyone deserves to know why. I really think that this anime accomplished exactly what it's purpose was. Many people that I have heard talk about Bokurano in the past in a negative way feel it is trying to belike Evangelion or some other mecha animes with kid pilots in giant robots. So I'm going to elaborate on exactly what I think this did well and what made it unique.\\n\\n\r\n\tFirst off, this story, to me, was very well executed. The first episode builds interest while at the same time giving you a little bit of insight on the characters, and actually, if you pay enough attention, are a foreshadowing into the future of this anime. They really give very good hints of what the characters are like, these small hints really help you understand why the characters react certain ways later on in the story. As for the characters themselves they are very different, very unique, in a matter of fact their personalities are almost polarized. Several times when watching this anime I have seen the characters act in smalls way, doing small things, small nuances about their personality reminding me about how I would react to certain situations. They are all deep, 3-dimensional characters, but their action reflect what's on the inside AMAZINGLY well. Expounding on the characters in the aspect of how they are drawn, Mohiro Kitoh has a very simplistic, a very normal, average way of portraying the characters. No one has any strangely colored hair, no one's body shape is over exaggerated, no one is too cool, too strong, or too smart, they're all drawn and written in a way you can relate to. You don't look down on them as being less than you, but rather as equals. Mohiro Kitoh is also very good at expressions. In his original manga every character on the screen has a very unique expression that is true to the person who is expressing it and I feel that this was translated very well into the anime. There is one particular scene where all the characters are together during a very emotional time. The camera pans across the screen showing every characters expression. Just looking at each of their faces you can almost read their minds in that very moment by the way that they are expressing themselves. Even with more than one person on the screen, every character has a very unique expression which is drawn very in a very detailed way. \\n\\n\r\n\tAnother thing that many people have complained about in the past about Bokurano is the art being \u201csub par\u201d. I, for my part, believe the art accomplished exactly what it was supposed to. You also have to realize that this anime was made in 2007, as well as the fact the art isn't meant to be so beautiful, so attractive, that the art distracts from the characters and story. To me the art style was drawn exactly the way it was on purpose. Everything is just normal, when it comes down to it, through the eyes of the characters the world isn't a very beautiful place anyway, at least not most of the time, so why should the background be drawn any differently? The way art was drawn really reflected the story in a very realistic way in my opinion.\\n\\n\r\n\tJust like the arts the music sets the mood very well. The music was soft, warm and reminiscent, almost like a dream or a memory. It's warm, yet gloomy, and it's sole purpose was to set the mood. NOT to stand out. How can I say the Music deserved a ten? One of the ways I find best to see how effective a soundtrack is, is to watch the anime, download the OST and then listen to it from track one to the last track. How quick does it set the mood? How quick does images of the anime flood your mind? With Bokurano, the soundtrack is absolutely inspirational to me. With anime OSTs that are  cool, epic, or just good from a musical standpoint, not all of them recall memories from that anime as vividly as the Bokurano OST did for me. Each track is distinct and simple enough to tell you without words, what each song represents in the anime. Images, places, characters are instantly brought back to mind when listening to this.\\n\\n\r\n\tNow I have saved my thoughts for the story and enjoyment last, because these are the most controversial. If you have seen Bokurano, you know that the story is not a happy, frolicy, joyful one. Bokurano really addresses several problematic issues about individuals and society in general. I can't begin to name all of them. Some of the most poignant issues to me are child abuse, relationships between step family members and the effects of death, suffering and burdening responsibility on children. All of these topics are discussed in an honest non-graphic way, which I love. There are 14 different children as well as several other main characters and support characters. The cast is quite large and yet no one gets lost in the background.  This anime is just so honest, so real... and one thing I want to get out of the way. This is not another Eva. I really don't think a child would react the way Shinji did, and the story of Eva, to me, wasn't really about Shinji but the Eva's. In Bokurano The robots are used as tools to teach you about people, real people, with realistic lives. These kids are not orphans or estranged kids clammering for the attention of their parents that are never there, trying to make a life with their giant mutant robots. They have families, GOALS, and things they are torn away from to serve a greater need. It's very easy to put yourself in the shoes of a Bokurano character, any angst developed in the story is so down  to earth you can really feel their pain. Bokurano is TECHNICALLY a slice-of-life but so was \"Star Driver\". Bokurano really is a drama, a character study even, and it may take several times watching it to  get everything out of it. Also, some people felt it was slow at  times and yes, I do believe that that is true, but if you find the characters interesting enough I believe you'd want it to go even slower. When watching this I  was deeply intrigued with the characters and I read every word in the subtitles, sometimes even pausing and rewinding, contemplating how this adds to what the character is now. At times I wish it would have gone slower because there is so much to be learned. Even if the plot was slow at times it wasn't enough for me to even drop the story rating from a 10 to a 9.\\n\\n\r\n\tAnd finally, on the subject of enjoyment... I'd rather use the term appreciation. Due to the dark, gloomy and doleful nature of this anime I can say en-JOY-ment, root word \"joy\" or happiness isn't appropriate. But after watching  this you will appreciate it and very likely come to appreciate many things. (To understand what I am talking about... watch it.)\\n\\n\r\n\tIn conclusion, if you are not a fan of dark and gloomy, you will not like this, but if you appreciate good story telling, with wonderful character development, and characters who you can relate to, you'll like this if you have the patients. Despite the Mecha this is far more.",

            "content": "I\u2018d like to start this review with this first thought. \r\nGonzo fucks up everything. \r\nNow that this is out of the way let me explain why and how I mean it. \r\nBokurano isn\u2018t a bad anime don\u2018t get my wrong. I just feel it could have been a better one, when done by a different studio and different budget. \r\nBut I will cover this whole issue in the single segments of this review. \r\nAlso note, this review will most likely contain minor spoilers, so please don\u2018t read it if you don\u2018t wanna get spoiled anything, even if it's just slightones. \\n\r\nThis is due to my comparison with the manga (but only superficial I don't mention any characters and what happens to them, just themes and some emotions that might come across) \\n\\n\r\nAll I can say to you is, watch this show it\u2018s good, but bad presented. \\n\\n\r\nAnd now let\u2018s review this show: \\n\\n\r\nStarting with the worst first and then we gradually go to the better things about this show. \\n\\n\\n\r\nAnimation \\n\\n\r\nLets establish what animation even means. It\u2018s not just moving pictures, it\u2018s also art and quality how it is presented. \\n\r\nSome of you who know about Gonzo might have heard about it, but Gonzo likes to mix some bad CGI into their drawn shows, and Bokurano is a good example for this bad habit. I even go so far and say that the animation is almost non existent for the most important parts of a semi-mecha show but was replaced by boring CGI robo-fights. \\n\r\nIt looks so awkward to see 2 giant CGI robots fight slowly against each other, and is by far the most boring shit in the entire show. \\n\\n\r\nBut when there is no CGI it doesn\u2018t shine either. Crooked faces, movements, quality loss. You name it. It\u2018s all there. Basically the show looks like it was made in the early 2000s or even late 90s. \\n\r\nAnd it is especially sad when a show like Neon Genesis Evangellion from 1996 looks better than this show made in 2007! 10 years later and a show manages to do not even a half as good job in animating it as something else. \\n\r\nWhy are the Evas animated in NGE but ZEarth is not in Bokurano, and was replaced by some shitty CGI model? \\n\\n\r\nDespite that it doesn\u2018t offer anything else in return, no memorable, or especially well done moments, no great artstyle or amazing quality. The backgrounds look generic and forgettable, and the character designs (though very close to their original Manga version) are bland and forgettable. \\n\\n\r\nMy verdict: 1,5/10 (I give it a 2/10 out of mercy) \\n\\n\\n\r\nSound \\n\\n\r\nMoving on from the bad animation, the sound-department did a quite well job. \\n\\n\r\nStarting off with the OP \u201eUninstall\u201c by Chiaki Ishikawa is by far the best piece of music this show has to offer. It\u2018s gloomy, melancholic and has a bit of a childish touch to it. It fits the show very well, the lyrics as well. I loved to listen to the song before very episode and never got bored of it. \\n\r\nThe EDs were good as well but couldn\u2018t hook me like the OP did. \\n\\n\r\nThe rest of the OST fit well but wasn\u2018t outstanding. Decent tough but not worth mentionable or a good reason to get your hands on the OST. \\n\\n\r\nThe voiceacting ranged from average to awkward at moments. The most outstanding job in my opinion did Akira Ishida, who voice Koemushi. Who did an infinite amount of rolls already, but to be honest I\u2018m not too familiar with his works. \\n\\n\r\nMy verdict: 5,5/10 (rounded up to 6/10 because of it\u2018s overall fitting nature to the show) \\n\\n\r\nOverall the presentation of this show is lacking and could have done (and should have been!) better. A different studio (like Madhouse, Sunrise or even Gainax) could have made a better job (maybe) with some other people in the staff. \\n\\n\r\nMoving on to the content... \\n\\n\r\nStory \\n\\n\r\nMohiro Kitoh, the original creator of the Manga Bokurano (ours) has some sort of weird fetish for shows with dark themes and children. \\n\r\nHe seems to be obsessed with themes like, death, suicide, rape, depression and apocalypse. \\n\r\nThose are the themes presented in Bokurano. And not by adults, no by children. To be exact 13 year old middleschoolers. \\n\r\nAt first the concept might sound overused. A cast of teenagers/children ride a gigantic Robot to save the world against invaders. But after finishing the show, it wasn\u2018t really about that but more about the implications of death and sacrifice. \\n\r\nWould you give your life for the world? Do you even think it is worth protecting? These concepts are in the spotlight and each of the 15 children reacts differently with these implications. \\n\r\nIt all start out as a game but becomes all serious right in EP2. And this is where this show shines. Tension, cliffhangers, and bit of pieces of information that are feed to you. \\n\r\nThere is every time something new that gets revealed and that is what gets you hooked. \\n\r\nSo many questions so little answers, but it all (?) makes sense in the end. \\n\r\nIt never feels boring (unless there is a shitty CGI fight but those never really drag on too long) and gets you truly involved with everything. \\n\r\nHiroyuki Morita (who didn\u2018t really direct anything besides The Cat Returns by Ghibli) did a great job here. \\n\\n\r\nSomething else that is noticeable is the difference to the Manga. I have only read parts of it but the chronological order is very different in the anime, as well as some events and the behavior of characters are different. And I feel the anime might even be superior (even though the manga looks pretty good!). I will certainly read the manga and find out what is really different. \\n\\n\r\nIt\u2018s a thrilling experience and goes to all sorts of emotions. Laughter (though little), Anger (a lot of hate towards some characters),  Sadness (some tears poured out) and also a sort of emptiness at some point. \\n\\n\r\nMy Conclusion: 8,5/10 (rounding up to 9/10 for being a great show in regards to story) \\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters \\n\\n\r\nThe other strong points of this show were the characters. \\n\r\nThough most of them not really relatable or likable in the beginning, become later much more interesting and even relatable. \\n\r\nThe show follows the LOST formula. \\n\r\nWhat does that mean? \\n\r\nWell if you\u2018ve seen Lost you might now what I mean, if now let me explain. \\n\r\nTake a bunch of different people and throw them into a mysterious dangerous situation. And then show everyone backstory as they progress to the story, while building up a desired emotion for each given character. \\n\r\nAll of them have some sort of a dramatic or interesting background story. Some more dramatic than others but all are kinda dramatic. \\n\r\nBut in the end everyone is kinda interesting and different. \\n\r\nSome characters change from unlikable to likable, while others make you wanna hate them even more, and then there are those you feel very sorry for. It tries to be realistic and not just makes you wanna love each one of them, or only hate the villain. \\n\r\nAnd as I said, some stories brought me to tears while other let me scream at the screen \u201eDIE DIE YOU PIECE OF SHIT!\u201c. \\n\\n\r\nMy Conclusion:  8/10 \\n\\n\r\nThe last segments talks about the Values and my overall enjoyment of the show, as well as my final Verdict. \\n\\n\r\nValue \\n\\n\r\nThe show sure got me thinking, and now I even want to read a Manga. Me who doesn\u2018t read manga at all! (almost non) \\n\r\nIt\u2018s a remarkable anime and one of those shows that will leave a mark in my mind that will let me remember it. \\n\r\nThough it didn\u2018t do anything groundbreaking, it sure is one of those shows that are talked about when you look for something mature, dark and sad. \\n\\n\r\n6/10 \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment \\n\\n\r\nAs Mentioned, my enjoyment almost only came from the Content of the show and not its presentation. \\n\r\nA good show doesn\u2018t need good presentation, while a bad show with good presentation will still be a bad show, is the saying. \\n\r\nBut I disagree. \\n\r\nAnime is anime because it\u2018s animated. If the animation sucks I feel as if it\u2018s a wasted medium and would have been better only as a manga or something else. \\n\r\nIt offered some visual pleasing moments but it overall was crap from a presentation side of view and that lowered my overall enjoyment quite a bit. \\n\r\nThat said the story, characters and overall experience was very much enjoyable and that\u2018s why I recommend everyone to watch it and bare with the shitty CGI and sometimes sloppy animation quality. The Manga is different and will not offer you the same experience as the Anime does. \\n\\n\r\n6/10 \\n\\n\r\nMy final verdict: \\n\\n\r\nBokurano was a show that ended up being better than expected, had me gripped for 24 episodes and was a themepark of many emotions, though all mostly on the sad spectrum. \\n\r\nIt\u2018s something that makes you question motivation for your actions and your reason why you live. \\n\r\nIt\u2018s not an outstanding anime, but a very good story, so watch it with that in mind. \\n\\n\r\n6/10 Fair",

Without spoiling anything, this anime is NOT ABOUT mechas.\r\nThe CGI is badly implemented and stands out in a terrible way. The characters are poorly drawn too and the animation... Oh my...\r\nThe one thing you should know is every episode more or less, ends with a mecha fight. But there's NO SATISFACTION. 90% of an episode is about the character's life and drama and it literally cuts / jumbs into the mecha fight which lasts 1min.\r\nThe whole show is depressing from beginning to end. Would not recommend at all.",

            "content": "So, what would you do if tasked with saving the world?  That\u2019s the question each one of the fifteen middle school children are forced to answer after having been bound to a contract.  At first, they just believe it to be some computer game created by a man named Kokopelli that they encounter.  But, by the time the first episode ends, we, along with the fifteen children, realize that something far more sinister is at play.\r\nBokurano starts out incredibly well.  The pacing is excellent, the hints and foreshadowing are all expertly woven to induce a sense of dread to the audienceand the children.  This is not a happy show.  It explores the psyche of each one of the children, their pasts, and how they deal with adversity, all before they are required to fight the next alien invader.\\n\\n\r\nNow, some of the issues I have, or issue, is that the stories of the first half or so of the children are more interesting than the rest.  They delve into some complex moral and psychological issues that many mediums tend to ignore or gleam over.  I won\u2019t go into too much detail on exactly what the situations are, but they are definitely horrifying.  This leads to the first half or 2/3 of Bokurano being more interesting than the last third, which is a shame, but doesn\u2019t discount the incredibly addictive nature of this show.  \\n\\n\r\nI tend to put a lot of emphasis on shows with what I consider great endings.  I want the last episode to be one of the best in the entire series.  Sadly, that leaves me weighing a little too much on the ending and not giving enough credit to what came before it.  Not always, but it\u2019s something I\u2019ve realized. Bokurano is a strong show that explores a vast amount of psychological topics, I only wish that the final stretch was where the stronger episodes lied.  Still, the show offers an interesting look at how each one of the children react to their past, their present, and what they want for the future without being over-dramatic or apathetic.  A great show that was slightly let down by it\u2019s final stretch.  Still, I\u2019d easily recommend this anime to anyone looking for a melancholic, yet entertaining and addictive ride through the ups and downs of these tragically flawed adolescents on a grand scale.\\n\r\nVerdict:\\n\r\n8.5/10",

He managed to take an old time dream of many children and twist it into a dark sinister thing.

            "content": "Spoiler free.\r\nI found this show by browsing through related anime of my favorite shows, and I'm so glad that I did.  \r\nBokurano follows the events of a group of children who have inadvertently been thrown into a large scale event, thinking it was just a small game.  From there, they have to fight to secure the safety of everything they know.  About now, I imagine some of you are yawning.  Something like this is seen in so many different shows, and the concern I had was it was going to be another show just like that.  I was surprised tofind that wasn't the case.\\n\\n\r\nBokurano had no problems with kicking off immediately.  I thought there were going to be a few primer episodes, but if I recall correctly, you're being introduced to the main plot point in the first episode.  This can either succeed or fail, in Bokurano's case, it didn't really do either, it's just how it was.  Another interesting thing Bokurano did well was not introducing the children alltogether.  For reasons I won't get into, their back story is introduced individually throughout the show, and I thought this was fantastic.  Everyone had their time in the light, and it's hard to pin down just who the main character really is.  After finishing it, you could argue who it was, but the point is I don't feel like it matters so much.  With that said, I really enjoyed how the characters were developed, if not for just a short while.\\n\\n\r\nAnother interesting thing was the fight scenes were slow paced, and ended abruptly.  Half the episode wasn't spent sequencing robots hitting each other.  A couple of them were fast paced based on the pilot's ability, but generally, you could feel the weight of each machine.  This is another thing that could have bothered me if the show hadn't been able to pull it off so well.  I was actually more interested in the story than I was watching a couple hunks of metal hit each other.  That isn't to say it didn't have its great moments, in fact, it kind of presented a nice build up to the last fight, which was really good.\\n\\n\r\nThis show is relatively older, so it doesn't look as 'clean' as some of the newer shows.  I guess people care about that, but even with that aside, the overall design of the show was really great.  Some of the mechs had awesome designs, and I really enjoyed each of the environments presented.  I couldn't say this show was visually lacking at all.\\n\\n\r\nThe only complaint I might have is I would have liked there to be a couple more episodes that really emphasized on the gravity of the overall situation.  As with any show, there's a point where you realize things aren't so black and white, and something larger is presented to you.  Bokurano had a nice set up, but unfortunately didn't have a lot of time to go deeper into what was going on behind the scenes.  I wouldn't say it's a huge downside, considering it was mostly just focusing on the story of the characters, but even so, I was really interested in the large picture.  But I suppose that's what the manga is for, right?\\n\\n\r\nLastly, the music.  The music playing throughout the show was really good, but the main theme is amazing.  Few anime out there have a really good opening song, and I'm overjoyed whenever I find a good one.  \\n\\n\r\nIn the end, this show is still kind of \"just another robot show\" in a small way.  I feel like some things could have been explored, but overall I'm happy with how it played out.  It wasn't really a leader in terms of doing things differently, but even so, I really enjoyed every moment of it.  If you haven't tuned in, you need to.  It's a humble reminder that sometimes things don't need to be revolutionary, and sometimes something so simple can turn out really great.",

            "content": "WARNING: This review contains spoilers. Please read further at your own risk.\r\nJudging by the anime cover, Bokurano may look like every mecha anime ever, with giant robots in action against monsters. But do not be deceived. In reality, it\u2019s a whole different story.\r\nStory: 9/10\r\nDuring summer camp, a group of 15 kids search a mysterious cave and discover that there\u2019s a working computer and accessories inside. They meet a guy who claims that he is a game developer and just finished making a game in which a giant robot has to fight huge monsters to save the earth. He persuades them to make a contract firstin order to play the game. After they finish up with the contract, they\u2019re teleported inside the giant robot. One of them gets chosen as the captain who gets to control the robot, while others sit beside him/her and watch. After each win, the captain\u2019s life energy is taken by the robot, so the captain dies. The story has very little focus on the mecha fights. The thing to shed light on was the backstories of each character. It was very well written and never got boring. Each character had his/her own unique story.\\n\r\nIn my opinion, the episode directing was 'meh' during 2 or 3 episodes. When they won the first fight and Takashi Waku (Pilot 1) died, his friends didn\u2019t even react to it. I mean like literally, not a single shit was given. They just stood there and watched him fall off a dam.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: 7/10\\n\r\nSound: 7/10\\n\r\nNot gonna emphasize on the animation and sound, as they were neither bad nor too good. They were just right.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter, judging by character likability: 7/10\\n\r\nLet me put the spotlight on the two extreme sides of the cast.\\n\\n\r\nHated Characters.\\n\r\nIsao Kako (Captain #3): Rapist piece of shit. My second-most hated character of the series. He can go to hell. He was your typical \u201cWhy is all this happening to me only?\u201d guy. Before piloting, he tried to rape Chizuru. He died before even getting a chance to pilot Zearth.\\n\r\nChizuru Honda (Captain #4): Too naive for her own good. She got banged by her teacher and he leaked the pictures on the internet. Kinda feel bad for her but at the same time I hate her a lot. It\u2019s her own fault for trying to get too comfy with a teacher.\\n\r\nHiroyuki Hatagai (Chizuru\u2019s Teacher): Where do I even start with this guy? I hate his guts, down to the very core. I wish Chizuru had killed him when she had the chance.\\n\\n\r\nLiked Characters.\\n\r\nMako Nakarai (Captain #6): She was an average girl. She fell short of money and tried to resort to prostitution. Lucky for her, she unknowingly met one of her mom\u2019s friends as her first customer. It felt good he guided her to the right path. After that, he drove her to the bar where she met her mom and her friends. All of them were really kind to her and she learned her lesson. She ended up fighting hard to protect what needed to be protected: her mom and friends.\\n\r\nKunihiko Moji (Captain #7): His dying wish was for his heart to be donated to his friend, who had a heart disease. Good guy Moji.\\n\r\nYoko Machi (Captain #13): She was at her brother\u2019s side in the beginning, but thank god she shot that bastard, +1 for her.\\n\r\nJun Ushiro (Captain #14): I hated him at first. He treated Kana very badly. But in the end, he does care for her and becomes the pilot instead of Kana.\\n\r\nKana Ushiro (Jun\u2019s sister): Liked her for being able to put up with her brother\u2019s shit.\\n\\n\r\nExtras.\\n\r\nThe remaining cast was also good, especially the backstory of Misumi.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 7/10\\n\r\nOverall: 7/10\\n\r\nIt was interesting peeking into the backstories and lives of so many characters in a 24-episode anime. To wrap it up, it\u2019s a great psychological and unique mecha anime.",

Given the fact there are several parallel universes - How does them competing make any sense? It doesn't, like at all. Why can the creators of this system only leech \"energy\" from a world that wins 15 robot fights? No reason. In a world where there ARE parallel universes, wouldntthere only arise even more universes? I.e. the ones that died in the first fight, the ones that died in the fourth fight etc.\\n\r\nThe dramaturgy doesnt work for me, we see a portrait of every kid for 20 minutes, then it dies. Too many times. What remains are shallow characters, boring predictable repetitions.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime will bore people who arent easily influenced by tragic music and pretentious depth weaved through far fetching words.

            "content": "Bokurano: Ever heard of it? Neither did I. Bokurano was an anime that was never licensed by an American company, so we don\u2019t have a dub, nor do we even have an official sub. This really saddens me, as Bokurano is a gem that unfortunately went under everybody\u2019s radar.\r\nWant to know why Bokurano is so great? Continue reading to find out.\r\n-Story & Characters-\r\nThe plot of Bokurano revolves around a group of 15 middle schoolers hanging out at a beach together. One of the children notices a hidden cavern and suggests that they go in. Bored with nothing else to do, the rest of the childrenenter the cavern, but find a bunch of computers and machinery inside, and they meet an old man named Kokopelli, who tells them that he is designing a game, and he asks them to be the testers of it. The goal of the game is to ride a giant mech, destroy other mechs, and save the world. Thinking that this sounds like a cool idea, the children enter a \u201ccontract.\u201d To the children\u2019s surprise, they learn that this \u201cgame\u201d is actually very real after witnessing a giant mech appear out of nowhere, later named \u201cZearth.\u201d The children then board Zearth as they see yet another mech appear out of nowhere. Kokopelli is piloting Zearth and tells the children the rules of the game: Each of the 15 participants take turns piloting Zearth as each new enemy mech appears. However, things are never that simple in an anime: They later meet a mysterious floating creature called \u201cDung Beetle\u201d, who acts as their guide throughout each battle, and they soon learn that Zearth operates by sucking up the life out of each pilot, resulting in their immediate death after each victory. \\n\\n\r\nWhen one of the children is dubbed the next pilot, we are shown a brief arc, learning about their backstories.  I really enjoyed these, as they were incredibly well-written. While this setup may sound formulaic (New pilot, backstory, battle, rinse and repeat), the show starts to throw in many unexpected plot twists and shockers, breaking the predictability of it all. Seriously, Bokurano has more plot twists than there are stars in the sky. What is Zearth? Who is Kokopelli? What is Dung Beetle? You\u2019ll get your answers, and be stunned learning them. Bokurano\u2019s story is excellent and interesting from start to finish, and once you get into it, you won\u2019t be able to stop. \\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately, I can\u2019t lavish the characters with the same praise. The main problem with the cast is that there are WAY too many of them. As previously stated, there are 15 children, and that\u2019s only the main cast. We have tons of supporting characters, such as the relatives of the children, as well as Dung Beetle. None of the characters are bad in any way, as their backstories provide some much needed depth, and help us care about them, but the fact that there are so many of them makes it hard to remember a lot of them. But then we have Dung Beetle, one of the most evil bastards to have ever appeared in any anime. He insults the children, lies to them, keeps vital information from them, and I hated him with every fiber of my being, but I suppose that was the intent. It\u2019s pretty clear that the show was more about the story itself and not the characters. \\n\\n\r\nAs a whole, Bokurano\u2019s story is intriguing throughout, and while the cast is not the best, they\u2019re not bad, either. The story more than makes up for the cast, anyway. \\n\\n\r\n-Animation & Sound-\\n\r\nThe second I started this show, it was obvious that this had Gonzo written all over it. I have only ever seen three Gonzo animes: This, Solty Rei, and Welcome to the NHK. While Solty Rei looks fine, both Bokurano and NHK have very inconsistent visuals. Sometimes the animation is great, while other times, it plummets into the \u201cKill it with fire!\u201d territory. The scenes where the animation dips in quality make it hard to take those particular scenes seriously. \\n\\n\r\nAs for the character designs, they look good, but they\u2019re rather simple in design. This can be both good and bad, depending on how you look at it. It\u2019s good because it makes the characters look like real people, but some may consider it to be a bad thing, because no one really unique. Personally, I fall into the former camp, as I prefer them to look just like normal people. Gonzo also decided to direct the mech battles in CG, which look decent enough. \\n\\n\r\nAs previously stated, there is no dub, so I can\u2019t critique the voice work, simply because I don\u2019t speak Japanese. \\n\\n\r\nMusically, Bokurano sports a solid soundtrack. While only a few songs stood out in my mind, every song matched the situations that they accompanied quite well. Again, comparing it to the other Gonzo animes that I\u2019ve seen, I would say that the soundtrack is better than Solty Rei, but not as good as NHK. It\u2019s a good soundtrack, but nothing to write home to mom about. \\n\\n\r\n-Conclusion-\\n\r\nBokurano is an anime that I wasn\u2019t expecting much from. Needless to say, not only was I pleasantly surprised, I was blown away by how excellent this anime was, and it\u2019s very depressing to know that a lot of people have never even heard of this anime. I would say that Bokurano is better than Solty Rei (Which I did like quite a bit), but tied with NHK as my favorite Gonzo anime. \\n\\n\r\nIf you\u2019re looking for a mech anime with a great story, then you\u2019re doing yourself a disservice by not watching wonderful anime. Bokurano is a hidden gem that everyone needs to watch. \\n\\n\r\n+Outstanding story\\n\r\n+Well-written individual character arcs\\n\r\n+Many plot twists\\n\r\n+Epic mech battles\\n\r\n+Decent soundtrack\\n\r\n-Inconsistent visuals\\n\r\n-Too many characters\\n\\n\r\nFinal score:\\n\r\n9/10\\n",

            "content": "I don't think I've enjoyed anything this much for a long time. \r\nWriting a spoiler-free review is hard as the entire thing consists of tragedy. At first everything seems to be going fine but by the end of episode 2 it's fallen into the depths of heartbreak and it only gets worse from there.\r\nOne of the reasons I adore Bokurano with a passion is the characters.\r\nI can say for certain that I enjoyed every one of them. You really learned about all of their lives and that only served to make it all the more painful as the show went on. Many of them havea reason for fighting that makes it even harder to bear the pain of what's happening to these kids. And there's a huge amount of character development for a particular character that left me in tears by the end of the show.\\n\r\nNote that characters do die- no one is safe. At all. If you're looking for something positive then this is not a good pick, but I would venture to say it's inspiring.\\n\\n\r\nAnother reason I love Bokurano is because it's exactly the kind of anime I'm into. Call me an emotional masochist but I love feeling pain as I watch characters I've come to love go through hardships and death. If that's the kind of thing you're into as well, then let me tell you this anime is absolutely perfect for you. It's so easy to get drawn into and the pain never ends, even at the very last few seconds of the show.\\n\\n\r\nI won't go into detail about the resolution, but it was excellent in my book. I didn't expect it in the least and it did leave me in tears. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, this has been one of the best shows I've seen. I strongly recommend it to anyone and I'm very happy to have stumbled across it. It's one of those things that you're not going to forget and that haunts you when you're trying to fall asleep at night. 10/10, amazing anime.",

It's just a shame that this anime isn't very popular, because it very certainly deserves it. Also, i'm more of the shounen/beat the crap out of your opponent animes, and i absolutely HATE mecha/robot animes. I totally forgot about my hate for mecha animes as i was watching this.\r\nThe anime is about 15 middle schoolers who are put into a disgustingly terrible situation. Before i saw this anime i was thinking \"What, 15 main characters? That's retarded.\" Wow. I want tostab my leg off just for thinking that.\\n\\n\r\nSTORY: 10\\n\r\nMy god. Dude. The plot of this anime is just golden. You just love seeing how these guys react to being put into such an unimaginable position. And as soon as your feeling it's getting kind of repetitive, they put in some random twist that just has you going \"Woooooowww.\" \\n\\n\r\nArt : 8\\n\r\nI didn't know what to think about the art. Sometimes it looks unique and sometimes it looks really weird. I have to say most of the characters are pretty ugly.\\n\\n\r\nSound : 9\\n\r\nThe sound is awesome. It really adds to the mood and makes whatever's going on seem a lot more sad/messed up.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter : 10\\n\r\nWow, dude. There are 15 main characters and 24 episodes. I was thinking \"Wow the characters must not be though out very well or something.\" But despite this, all the character's personalities and even their true selves are perfectly thought out.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment : 10\\n\r\nI loved this anime. I literally could not stop watching it. Honestly I have not been asleep for like 2 days now because i've been up watching it. And i could not help but write this review.\\n\\n\r\nOverall : 10\\n\r\nI would honestly like to meet the guy who would think this anime sucked. It is just so awesome. I totally recommend it. For me it is top anime of 09.",

            "content": "I didn't watch this anime because it was recommended to me, or because it was hyped and I had to see what all the opinions were about. Bokurano was a relatively unknown anime to me, not that I watch anime all that much. Oddly, the reason I watched it was because it was one of several that had been left on my hard drive.\r\nI have to admit -- it was the intro that hooked me first about this series. Sometimes, I'd keep watching the show just so that I could see the intro at the beginning. The intro itself is oddly inspiring, if not verycharacteristic of the show's nihilistic viewpoints. More than that though, it's catchy.\\n\r\nIt's difficult to not spoil Bokurano, but the main reason to watch it is to figure out exactly what it is that you're watching. The plot starts out simple enough. I heard from a friend that it's very similar to Evangelion -- 15 children pilot a robot and try to stop new, enemy robots who appear and challenge them, blah blah. \\n\r\nBut Bokurano is not Evangelion. It isn't even remotely close to Evangelion, despite the similarities in the exposition.\\n\r\nThe mecha wasn't the reason for my watching this. I've never been a big fan of giant robots, or at least that's never been the main reason for me to watch an anime.\\n\r\nBokurano is psychological. At times, it can be depressing, and if you have a simple frame of mind, I wouldn't suggest watching it. In many ways, the show questions the meaning of life itself, though I can't spoil how exactly. It takes a bit of patience to watch, but the show rewards you for your resolve.\\n\r\nIn short, Bokurano is inspiring and depressing at the same time. Watching it was an experience, to say the least. It's a good show. I recommended it to a friend, and he's glad I did -- he's on episode eight, and thanks me quite a bit for the recommendation.",

            "content": "Story:  If you've seen Madoka Magica or Neon Genesis Evangelion then you are familiar with deconstructions. Well, Bokurano is a deconstruction of the mecha genre like Evangelion, however it takes to a completely different ride. Boys and girls from age 12-13 sign a contract to play a game where each pilot a mecha and have to defeat 15 enemies, each enemy for each child contracted. The story dwelves into plot twists that made my heart wrench, wich at a point I was scared to know what would happen next.\r\nCharacters: Don't be afraid by the ratio of main characters and episodes, even tough there are15 children and some other important cast who will appear later, the characters feel solid and they all have some sort of backstory that exemplifies their view on the situation they get. \\n\\n\r\nSound: The sound has an amazing athmosphere, I would have it no other way. None is really iconic, but if I had to chose one OST that stood out, I would tell you to search \"Shizukesa no Naka de\". The OP and EDs are really good.\\n\\n\r\nArt: I can't judge 2007 animation because I mostly watch post-2010 anime, but I would say it's just alright, not bad but not outstanding. I did print some scenes with lazy eyes. It took me a while to understand which girl was who because Komoda, Chizuru and Mako seemed pretty alike at first. The way I understood it was that Chizuru has a mole, Mako has a ponytail and Komoda's face is long\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: I do have a soft spot for dramas, and this was a pretty emotional one, I'm the type to get emotional and this was incredibly depressing. Bokurano is in the list for one of my favourite anime and it's pretty underrated. Best girls are maki and machi, best boy is kanji. Also I now fear tattos that look like weird symbols even more. :_)",

The only reason I'm not giving the series a 10 is because I feel that the finale was really lacking, enough for me to dock the overall score.\r\nWthout revealing anything, all I can say about the story is that it is original, captivating, and at times downright tear-jerking.  My only beef is, like I said, that the finale did not provide the right kind of closure that I needed as a viewer.   I give the story a 9, at GREAT\r\nI really like the drawing and art style in general throughout theentire series.  A lot of the characters have similar coloring, whch is sort of confusng at times because of how many main characters there are- but I think that the drawing was supposed to be very realistic so naturally many of the characters, being Japanese, had dark hair. I give art a 9 at GREAT\\n\\n\r\nThe sound is overall pretty great.  No lies, I was not a fan of the opening theme song.  Of course by episode five I was getting it stuck in my head.  There are also two ending songs, the first of which I find extrmely corny lyric wise and the second is so-so.  The music played within the show itself is fine, I love love love the violin and all the heavy vibrato during the really emotional parts. I give sound a 9 at GREAT\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:  Great. One of my criteria for me to not drop a series is that the characters HAVE to be well developed.  Considering that there are so many characters,it's especially impressive how realistic they are.  I love the story arcs for each eisode that allow you to really get to know them. It's really great. Characters: 10 at OUTSTANDING\\n\\n\r\nI thoroughly enjoyed the psycological aspects of the series, and the undertone of mecha and action is refreshing but not boring.  Enjoyment 10 at OUSTANDING\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9, GREAT, this is one of my favorite series and I was ale to actually finish it in like two weeks whereas I usually drop by the fouth episode. I love Bokurano and highly reccomend it to those who have been stufaced with shitty harem and magic girl themes constantly in every single anime you come across. -.-",

            "content": "\"The year we started junior high, we considered ourselves all grown up. We thought we could do anything. We laughed, we cried, we got angry... We thought we knew all there was to life. But in reality, we were just kids, sheltered by our parents and by society. We'd never experienced true sadness, joy, or anger. We found that out when the 15 of us got together... And when... We met IT.\"\r\nBokurano is as much your typical mecha anime as Mahou Shoujo Madoka Magica is your typical magic girl anime. It\u2019s dark and pretty depressing, but none the less extremely interesting.\r\nStory \u2013 9\r\nThe one majorquestion asked throughout this series is directed towards the 15 children, basically asking them what they would do in the face of a certain and imminent death. The basic setting is that 15 children during summer camp find a cave by the sea (I know summer camp it sounds awful already). Inside this cave they find a strange man who asks them the simple question \u201cdo you want to play a game?\u201d, now having seen the saw movies I would immediately flee at this point but instead these children take on the challenge. Then they find out that this game requires them to control a 500 meter robot and fight other robots, the shocking twist to this is that it isn\u2019t actually a game (wasn\u2019t actually shocking though). The actually shocking twist is that since it isn\u2019t a game if they lose, earth will be destroyed and the human race will be annihilated. During these battles there are lots of casualties and these children are left to reflect on the havoc their wreaking while their lives literally fall apart. Every one of the fifteen kids is given an immense back story which is a major plot point because some episodes are solely focused on giving each character their own exposition. Most mecha anime are similar to the multitude of Gundam series in the way that the storyline is more happy go lucky and bright and this takes that common idea in the majority of mecha series and rips it apart saying \u201cfuck you and fuck your dreams\u201d. Not only is this extremely refreshing getting something I like to call original, but the plot is built upon with a variety of twists which grabbed my attention more and more bringing my interesting factor to exponential heights.\\n\\n\r\nSound \u2013 8\\n\r\nThe OP for Bokurano \u201cUninstall\u201d constantly chants for the viewer to uninstall and this reminds me of my days playing video games like League of Legends where other players constantly told me to uninstall the client because I was \u201ctrash\u201d so this OP gave me a laugh the first couple of times I heard it. Eventually you\u2019ll probably understand the symbolism between the very fitting Bokurano OP. The voice acting is well done on the Japanese Dub and I have nothing to complain about it. Also the very fitting sad violin music was great.\\n\\n\r\nArt \u2013 6\\n\r\nUgh, the art and animation really fucking sucks. The art is so bad that it practically makes some parts boring and hard. This is the time when Code Geass was coming out, so I can\u2019t make any excuses for the art, other than when I usually rate an anime it doesn\u2019t tend to affect the overall rating I give it very much. Character designs are actually pretty refreshing because all the main characters look pretty normal and don\u2019t have any unusual purple colored hair, you would feel like they could be side characters in another anime. After watching the anime I decided to check out the manga which has absolutely fantastic art in comparison.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters \u2013 8\\n\r\nSome characters are really good and some are bad, you\u2019ve got 15 characters who are the main character and for the most part get an equal amount of screen time, all have very interesting diverse backgrounds and diverse personalities, which brings up the interesting factor a whole new notch as you watch patiently how each character separately deals with the situation they\u2019ve put in. You can\u2019t really go into depth when talking about these characters because spoilers would ruin this show, because it\u2019s much more story based than action based.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment \u2013 8\\n\r\nFight scenes are meh, I\u2019m sure the anime didn\u2019t do them justice but the major factor that brings those down is simply the animation which I felt was choppy at best. I was looking forward to the fight scenes but I was so entertained by all the backgrounds of the characters that I was able to watch Bokurano in two days, and I was in the Florida Keys, this managed to keep me inside connected to the hotel WiFi until I finished the show.\\n\\n\r\nOverall \u2013 8.4\\n\r\nIt definitely isn\u2019t perfect, but it is underrated. There isn\u2019t too much gore so if you can handle the extremely depressing psychological part of this anime I recommend it for anyone above the age of \\n\r\ntwelve.\\n\\n\r\nBrb, while I read the whole manga for Bokurano to relive in the excitement.\\n\\n\r\nWatch anime and keep it chill my friends.\\n",

            "content": "For a long time, Bokurano had been on my list waiting to be watched. Only recently have I finally gotten around to it and it was well worth the wait. Each character went through some sort of ordeal in order to overcome the fate they were tricked into. Each and every story was interesting, displaying all kinds of human traits ad desires. While the ordeals were psychologically wonderful, this anime is far from what I would call epic. Instead, Bokurano chooses to present its story in a different  light which I personally think makes Bokurano just that much better.\r\nBokurano is very character based with1-3 episodes depicting the struggles for each character. It almost felt episodic with the way the episodes changed from theme to theme but I believe it rounded up very well in the end. The themes presented in this anime are a bit touchy so I would advise not to watch Bokurano after touchy issues or if you're particularly sensitive. The strongest theme in this anime is the well known quote 'one is all, all is one'. Take this quote how you wish and see if it changes your perspective on Bokurano. For me it definitely did and the theme well and truly rung out.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter development is major. It is a bit dfficult though as there are 15 characters that are needed to be tracked of. Unfortunately for some people, remembering the face and name of a character you met two episodes ago is quite difficult. This leads to the development of early characters feelingl a bit weak which is a shame really. Once you get a grip on the layout, then it becomes easier to remember who is who and who did what. For the later characters, they developed quite well along with a kind-of main storyline. This storyline is overshadowed by the characters. I don't find this particularly bad as it is an anime based on, well, characters.\\n\\n\r\nWhere the character development was great, things fell through a bit with the art and sound. Did you know Bokurano was made the same year as 'The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya' and 'Ouran high School Host Club'? You know, those really pretty and flashy anime? I had believed for years that Bokurano was made in 1995 or something like that. If you would like to analyse it, it could represent the reality of everything, where not everything is beautiful and flashy. I did enjoy the battle scenes where it was slow and sluggish. It really helped describe the heaviness and difficulty of moving Zearth (the big machine thing). While the art wasn't appealing, it did well to set the atosphere of the show. The sound of the show (BGM, seiyu, OP/ED) didn't really capture me. It was alright. Nothing great, nothing horrible.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I really enjoyed watching Bokurano. I loved the ordeals the characters went through (yes I am slightly sadistic). I loved the atmosphere where things felt hopeless. I loved how Bokurano ended with a quiet realisation on what it was trying to say. It was cruel and heartbreaking but in the end, it didn't really matter. The characters were fantastic and so were the battle scenes but this lead to a not-so-important storyline. Again, this doesn't effect Bokurano that much; it's just obvious they want you to focus on the characters. And that's exactly what you get.",

            "content": "The premise can\u2019t be very detailed since there are a lot of gradual revelations along the way, but suffice it to say, fifteen children find a strange guy who invites them to \u201cplay a game\u201d in which they\u2019ll pilot a robot to save the Earth from invaders. A lot of heavy stuff happens, so be warned. It is here that I find important to realize what is the primary focus of the series.\r\nWhile it is a mecha anime, it should be noted that, like many good mecha, it focuses a lot more on characters and their development while in difficult situations outside of combat. Thoughsome of the battles have nice moments and some enemies have creative designs (more IRL robot combats than Evangelion, mind you), they\u2019re brief and not too flashy since they\u2019re not the main point.\\n\\n\r\nEach character invites us to their backstory, revealing who they are and what reasons they find to fight. Every kid has something running for them, even the unlikable ones. Their story can be inspiring, tragic, fulfilling and touching. However, one or two may come as forgettable due to having little time and not as striking personalities and points of view as their fellow pilots. Ymmv.\\n\\n\r\nAs the story progresses, we see a secondary plot emerge, focused mainly on the military and the japanese governement. Now, it is a topic most important to discuss, and I don\u2019t think it came out in a shallow way. It introduces new characters and we still see the development of the pilots. But the kids do begin to take the back seat a little, especially those whose stories intertwine deeply with the political events, and that subtle change was a little off.\\n\\n\r\nFinally, the technical aspects. The art direction is nice, having more natural designs to people and a softer, less bright color palette, but the simple aesthetics do seem a bit lacking in this instance. Animation is okay almost all the time, but some (heavy) slips will happen here and there. The mechas are full CGI, and it have aged (obviously), but it is by no means the disaster that many would presume. The sound never draws the attention away from the scenes and leaves a nice atmosphere all around, and the OP is god-tier.\\n\\n\r\nI haven't read the light novel, but can attest that the manga is pretty good too, so there is more quality Bokurano out there. In the end, it is a sad yet joyful ride. Even if the final explanations are kind of dense and unrelatable, the resolution of each story brings out the overall bittersweetness. We were here for the kids anyway, the emotions and experiences they\u2019ve shown us, and the lessons we take for life.",

These instances are not used haphazardly and advance characterization\r\n+ The mechs are a plot device, not the focus.  This is a pro if you prefer character driven narratives\r\n+ Bokurano acknowledges the gray area of morality and does not shy away from painting their protagonists as far from perfect\r\nCons:\r\n- The anime suffers from deviating from the manga.  This leadsto plot holes, unresolved answers, and changes in character motivations that greatly alter the series\\n\r\n- The background music can sometimes be distractingly bad and melodramatic; especially in the earlier episodes\\n\r\n- The ending felt totally disconnected from the series.  I do not know if this is because they opted for an anime specific ending, if it is the Gonzo effect, or a combination of both\\n\r\n- Almost all adult characters involved in the military or government, except for those that become part of the main cast, act foolishly or as a caricature of a villain.  For a series that thrives on a character driven narrative this cookie-cutter behavior felt out of place\\n\\n\r\nReview Summary:  Bokurano attempts to demonstrate what would actually happen if children were tasked with saving the world with a giant robot at the cost of their lives and the lives of others.  While the ending doesn't match the weight of the series the show is still worth watching for its realistic approach to character interactions and how difficult it is for humans to acknowledge their own mortality.  Don't expect a lot of mecha action or definitive explanations.\\n\\n\r\nYou may life this if: You enjoyed Madoka Magica, Danganrompa, Neon Genesis Evangelion, or Magical Girl Raising Project.\\n\\n\r\nRecommended",

            "content": "it wasnt sad enough honestly. Originally when i read the plot of this anime, i was expecting tears. When i started watching it, it amplified the thought. It was heartwarming and tear inducing. (not literally but im not an easy crier- so for anyone else it would make them teary eyed). Unfortunetly, the only thing that truely threatened tears, was the plot. The beginning helped formulate the storyline and exposed how depressing and traumatic the experience would be for those kids. As you go through the episodes, there are some sad moments, but after you go through half the series, it's not as touching. Theindividual stories are definitely heart breaking, but it never felt like the deaths of the children prior had any permanent or lasting effect to the kids that were left. The anime never emphasized how each one of them was TRUELY gone. As the anime progressed, i expected them to show how one more chair was empty, but when a character was gone, i didnt really miss them. It felt like once the characters died, it was like they never existed. \\n\\n\r\nI have conflicting feelings about how they progressed the story. Like i said above, they never emphasized how hopeless the situation is. After each episode, a kid would disappear. It personally didnt seem like the characters remembered them anymore. I would rather see how the kids were tormented about their hopelessness, but the story seemed to focus on acceptance and each individual kids problems and resolving them before they died. The anime focused more on individuals instead of friendship. \\n\\n\r\nI gave this anime a solid 8 because it was a great anime indeed, but it didnt focus on what i personally wanted to see. Like i said, i wanted to see a little more of how they reacted to the characters before them gone. The individual stories were amazing in itself, and maybe they didnt create character ties because they didnt have enough episodes. (24 is a set i think- ...) Maybe if they had more episodes they would have been able to emphasize how death amongst friends impacted the characters. \\n\\n\r\nEDIT:\\n\r\nmy gradebook is slightly different then most- but even if i gave it an 8, for most others it probably would have been a 9.\\n\\n\r\nim bad at explaining myself but to wrap it up and repeat myself for those that STILL dont understand what im saying:\\n\r\nwhat i expected to watch was a little more trauma between the deaths of their friends- but the plot only expressed the trauma on their own deaths. The characters were heartwarming, but the ties between the characters were almost non-existant.",

            "content": "DISCLAIMER OF EPICNESS AND IMPORTANCE:\r\nDo not  read this review until you have completely finished Bokurano, or have at least seen the first 5 episodes. I will be spoiling an extremely major plot point that is explained during these episodes, and it is near impossible to discuss this show without mentioning these points. I will try to be as vague as possible, but you have been warned.\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\r\nStory:\r\nIf you go into this anime expecting an epic mech series, you're looking at the wrong show. Yes, Bokurano has some pretty epic mech battles, but that isn't the real meat of the show.  What you get isa myriad of short stories, if you will, about 15 children, their backstories, and the time they have left before their inevitable demise. \\n\\n\r\nThe thing that Bokurano does that is very much unique is that there is no main character. I haven't seen all too many anime so far, but I can safely say there are probably very few if any at all that have done this. The thing I find so refreshing about this fact is how many possibilities open up for the story. Excluding many romance and slice of life animes, you follow a main protagonist. Most of the time he/she either lives and saves the world, dies and saves the world, or dies/ lives and fails miserably. With Bokurano, its much more difficult to figure out how the story will unfold because of this fact, and it's one of the major pros of this series.\\n\\n\r\nKeeping positive for a while, we have the stories of the individual characters. Each character has a backstory, most of the time with some kind of negative aspect attached to them. The stories all tackle what a lot of kids their age may sometimes have to deal with, ranging from teenage pregnancy, abuse, neglegence, and the list goes on. This anime touches on them in such a way that doesn't feel forced or offensive. The story never changes from its deep and dark tone, and is very serious when dealing with these kinds of subjects, which is something to always keep in mind.\\n\\n\r\nOf course, the story is not perfect. The actual \"overarching\" story is lackluster to say the least. There are some things the writers never bothered to explain ( I won't go into any detail because spoilers). And when you're trying to deal with a \"theres multiple universes\" plot point, it's very hard not to fall into plotholes large enough to sink the Earth into. There aren't too many of these plotholes, and they can be easily brushed away after due time, but they are there,and do hurt the show. I also didn't really care much for anything happening that didn't have anything to do with the pilots of Zearth; The whole government debacle just didn't grab me, and did nothing to really have a stance on whether what the government was doing right or wrong. \\n\\n\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nThe characters are what make this show so unique. Each pilot has their own way of dealing with their fate, and what they decide to do with the little time they have left, which is, at least in my opinion, the best part of the entire show. There is no way in hell I would go explaining each character individually because there are so many. \\n\\n\r\nEach character, personality wise, have very realistic personalities, almost as if I could meet someone who was exactly like that character. Yes, many of the backstories are sad, but none of them feel to the point that they are borderline psychopathic. One comparison I will make is to that of Mirai Nikki (Future Diary). Mirai Nikki has characters with backstories that are so unrealistic that you could actually say with absolute certainty that they were even human. All they tried to do is randomly throw seemingly sad shit in you're face expecting you to succumb to the absurdity of their backstories. The backstories in Bokurano are backstories that many middle school students could actually have in real life, and that genuine feeling of reality is truly powerful.\\n\\n\r\nEach character gets one or two episodes to focus on their life. I find it amazing how the writers managed to use their time so well to develop each character enough in such a small timespace. However, because of the small size of each character arc, you are unable to really grow to like that character and relate to that character, as they are never to be seen again after their arc. One more criticism I have are with the first three pilots of Zearth. They really did feel like no care of effort were put into their backstories, and were just put there just to fill in time. I mean, you have a guy who's \"compelling and heartbreaking story\" is that he used to play soccer but doesn't is kind of strange to say the least. \\n\\n\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nOther than the Opening and first Ending, their isn't really anything that great soundwise in Bokurano. The soundtrack never intensified any of the dramatic or action-packed mech scenes this anime had to offer. To be fair, it never dragged those scenes down, but it does leave you with a wish that it could've been so much better. I'm nitpicking at this point, but I felt the sound effects were a little bit janky and strange. A really minor point, but something I felt needed to be said.\\n\\n\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\\n\r\nAnimation:\\n\r\nAh, Gonzo. It's been a while my dear old pal o' mine. \\n\\n\r\nIf anyone has watched more than one Gonzo show, you know what I am gonna say. For whatever reason, Gonzo has this habit of not keeping a steady quality of animation. You can point out scenes in many a Gonzo show where the animation looks like it came straight out of a 5 year old colouring book. On the other hand, you have scenes that look like they could be from the future because they look so damn amazing. Thankfully, Bokurano doesn't have godawful animation, but it does have patches, mainly during the in-between scenes, that are fairly poor. However, the CGI used during the mech scenes were executed with brilliance. Many anime seem to fail when using CGI, but this does well in implementing it to good use. \\n\\n\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\\n\r\nFor something I probably would never had batted an eye at, I am glad to have experienced Bokurano. In a way, Bokurano reminds me very much so of a Gen Urobuchi work, as it will readily make you sad and depressed to get it's point across. It knows how to tell aspects that some people have to deal with in their everyday lives with finesse. Although flawed in many ways, Bokurano is truly a gem in the rough, and should be regarded highly. It might  be a bit too tear-jerky for some, so be warned, it's not a Nichijou. \\n\\n",

A little-known sci-fi anime, yet undoubtedly one of the best and saddest I have yet come across.\r\nFifteen children are tasked to protect the planet by piloting in turn, a giant mecha and battling a series of mechas from parallel worlds in a inter-dimensional 'natural selection' process. Even one loss means the annihilation of their entire universe, while each victory still requires the life of the pilot sacrificed to fuel the mecha.\r\nThis fantastic premise merely serves as a backdrop however, against which each character is brought to life in wonderfully realistic complexity. The assigned pilot in each episode must come to terms with theinevitability of their imminent deaths, finding the strength to sacrifice themselves for the sake of family and friends.\\n\\n\r\nWhile the animation and cgi effects may not be impressive to all viewers, Bokurano's strength lies in its characters as well as its story-telling. The intricate sci-fi plot is presented through the 24 episodes in bits and pieces, ultimately to form a coherent whole leaving behind no plot-holes and hardly any relevant unanswered questions.\\n\\n\r\nThis show is definitely not palatable for all viewers, particularly sensitive ones. The antagonists who organised the death-matches remain unpunished till the end of the show, which is an otherwise emotionally satisfying ending. Moreover viewers are warned that by the end of the show, nearly every single major character will be dead.\\n\\n\r\nScore:8.5/10\\n\\n\r\nHighly recommended.",

All in all the character development of all 15 characters was amazing, each with their own unique personalities, fears, problems, reasons for fighting - some selfish, some not so much. Certain characters pull through to the end while others end up dying for nothing. This is the strength of this anime. The weak point are the actual mediocre CG robot fights itself,sound design that makes the robot's moving sound like braking 18-wheelers, and a jagged, jumpy, almost glitchy art style that just doesn't seem right. This is the first anime in awhile to make me feel dread for these characters. Watch it for the characters, not for the art. 8/10",

The basic plot consists of 14 7th graders, and 1 4th grader, that are tricked into piloting a mocha to save the world from aliens! Now, this may seem normal for a show, but Bokurano is far from that. The kids are told that it\u2019s just a simple game and they act with that mentality for a while until they realizethat they did not sign up for a \u201csimple game\u201d. There\u2019s a big twist with piloting this mecha, and that twist is the mocha runs on your life force. So, when you win your battle, you die (To put it simply). This leads to interesting psychological problems with the kids. Do they pilot the mecha to save the world? Or do they run the risk of keeping themselves alive in case their world is not destroyed? From the very beginning, the kids are set up with a dark future, and they deal with it in different ways. In the end, how many of them will have to die for the Earth to be saved?\\n\\n\r\nArt/Animation: 6/10\\n\r\nSo I\u2019m very strict with the whole 1-10 grading scheme. 10 being it cannot get any better and 1 being it cannot get any worse and 5 being just average. Bokurano\u2019s art and animation can only be described as that, average. Why it gets a 6 and not a 5 is because it\u2019s lackluster character design actually works for them. Bokurano seems to pride itself on the realistic aspect of the show, despite it being giant robots fighting to the death. The cast, though different personalities, look realistic and act in a realistic way. Besides that though, there are times where the animation is great and others where the animation is horrible. So\u2026 Average!\\n\\n\r\nMusic: 7/10\\n\r\nThe music suffers from the same fate as the art and animation sadly. The differences between the two are that the opening and ending themes to Bokurano are outstanding. \u201cUninstall\u201d is a perfect opening theme for a show so dark and twisted, while the ending shows the more human side of the characters and calms you down. There\u2019s nothing special about the insert songs. Actually, I don\u2019t remember any of them\u2026\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 9/10\\n\r\nThis is where the show needs to shine since like other survival anime, it has a huge cast. 15 characters (plus a couple more that show up later) that need time to develop and grow. The show does a surprisingly good job at developing its characters too. Not all of them had enough time to develop fully, but for the time they\u2019re given, it was pretty impressive. As said above, the kids find out that to save their Earth, they need to die, basically become a martyr. A lot of the time in anime, you don\u2019t receive realistic reaction towards situations like this. Maybe some disbelief and light shock at most. These characters cry, kick, scream because they are kids. It\u2019s a good choice that the main cast is kids to because their views on morality and the situation they are in are mostly unfiltered. Overall, a great cast of characters (Especially Ushiro).\\n\\n\r\nOverall Score: 7.9/10",

            "content": "Wow! I really loved this anime. \r\nPlease note that if you're here for action... Sorry this isn't the right anime for you. \r\nShort Main Idea: 15 Kids (ages 10-13) are forced to fight for Earth by destroying other mechs. After each battle, the pilot dies and a new one is chosen. There are a few other complicated rules, but it's simple enough to understand when you're watching. Much of the anime is focused on the past and present actions of these 15 kids. Their actions will impact their futures and their destiny. It's a very sad story, but in my opinion, very well written.\r\nStory -10. The story is very unique in my opinion. This is definitely a masterpiece story. I honestly felt like crying after like every episode. I'm pretty apathetic and run through mangas and anime without too much emotions, but this one really choked me up. Beautiful story and very entertaining.\\n\\n\r\nArt - 9. The art is nice and fits the story's mood. It's pretty cookie cut and straight-forward.\\n\\n\r\nSound - 8. Decent sound effects. Nothing super special, but nothing terrible.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters - 10. The backbone of this anime. Honestly, you learn about the characters and the families, you really want to connect with them. Me personally I enjoyed the characters more than any other from a tragedy anime.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 10. I won't lie, the beginning few episodes are a bit slow and confusing. But around episode 5, the story really comes alive. It becomes a lot more clear what's at stake. After that, all the way till the end, I find it really enjoyable. I've watched episodes multiple times just because I think it's that good!\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 10. Easily a 10. I really think everyone should watch the anime, whether you enjoy it or not. There are some big life lessons and morals to learn in this anime. I was once told that \"crisis is needed for change to occur.\" This is a great example of this. I can't say anything else. Definitely worth watching!!\\n\\n\r\nPros: Excellent storyline, Lovable characters, Good Soundtrack, Short but meaningful lessons on life, death, and sacrifice.\\n\\n\r\nCons: Slow start, Mech fights are very slow-paced, the storyline is different than the manga.\\n\\n\r\nJust an extra bonus, The opening theme was featured in one of Nico Nico Douga's medleys. It's become one of my favorite songs and I think that's just a huge bonus.",

            "content": "In a few words, Bokurano is about finding the value of life through the value of death. \r\nThe children in Bokurano are unlike soldiers on a battle field or cancer patients in hospital beds, but rather a combination of both. Life is no longer a matter of choice, but neither is death meaningless. \r\nThat's the setting of Bokurano. \r\nEach character had his or her own past and future, but the setting stripped them of that luxury and allowed each to have only the present under control. The setting becomes an ideal breeding ground for all kinds of weaknesses and strengths. \r\nBokurano therefore is an animewith fast yet strong character development. That for me is the show's greatest merit. \\n\r\nI wouldn't call Bokurano depressing even though I did cry in a lot of episodes. It's rather enlightening, not in a philosophical way of course. \\n\r\nFor me who thinks emotions lead to greater wisdom than knowledge itself can, I think bokurano depicts this truth (or folly) really well. \\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "An excellent original concept and very thought provoking if quite depressing.\r\nPLOT: I can\u2019t really say much about the plot without spoiling things completely. Much of the shock value of the early episodes would be lost if I broke down the formula here \u2013 but what I can say is that this series displayed excellent, very well balanced storytelling. So many issues are dealt with over the course of this show as each and every one of the 15 children that the plot revolves around are completely different to each other, but somehow they manage not to be stereotypes. All of them are perfectly normal kidswith their own problems, family circumstances and ways of thinking \u2013 the fact that they are so normal really adds to the emotional impact that Bokurano has.\\n\\n\r\nAs the story comes from the same manga-ka as Narutaru there are a lot of quite dark themes and issues highlighted over the course of the show, but unlike Narutaru it isn\u2019t all depressing doom and gloom \u2013 there are also genuine heart-warming moments and touches of comedy. But the one thing that shines through is the realism \u2013 we see the political and military response to the fact a giant robot is destroying massive portions of the city and we also see the destruction this causes in terms of houses, businesses and of course, lives. The anime also has a very satisfying conclusion and for a change I\u2019m not looking for more, nothing more needed to be said really, even though we never discover the complete truth about everything that happened. I was really impressed with this show as just when you felt it was getting a bit formulaic it throws a load of well-timed plot twists at you and reached a natural feeling conclusion.\\n\\n\r\nANIMATION: This is an example of \u2018Good GONZO\u2019 and even the CG for the giant robots isn\u2019t terrible \u2013 the fact that it doesn\u2019t really mesh completely with the 2-D backgrounds adds to the otherworldly feel of the mecha. The mecha designs aren\u2019t wonderful, but the fact that they\u2019re so ungainly and oddly proportioned made for interesting fights. Character designs are very simple but this adds to the realistic quality of the children\u2019s characters and they are animated consistently well over the course of the show. In fact the quality was quite consistent over the course of the 24 episodes, I particularly liked the backgrounds as there are a lot different locations covered and each manages to look unique even though its usually the middle of a city.\\n\\n\r\nMUSIC & VOICE ACTING: I loved the OP & EDs, but particularly the OP, however the BGM was fairly unremarkable for the most part. Excellent voice cast for this show, it\u2019s hard to pick out particular characters as the show was quite an ensemble piece, but I can say that not a single character was poorly cast.\\n\\n\r\nOverall Bokurano was an excellent anime, I was surprised by how much I liked it. It is a bit on the heavy side though \u2013 I really would not recommend watching it in large batches as its really doesn\u2019t pull any punches with the drama. But if you can get past all that Bokurano is a very satisfying watch.",

            "content": "Bokurano is an anime I first heard of quite some time ago and I remember how intrigued I was when I read the synopsis. A mecha deconstruction with horror/psychological elements? Count me in. \r\nBut does the show hold up to its premise or is it one of these cases where the premise is great but the execution falls flat? \r\nLet's start with the one aspect that started my interest in the series: the story.\r\nWhile at first it seems rather clich\u00e9d, the story soon turned out to be one of my favourite aspects of the show. Every two or three episode the focus changes from oneprotagonist to another, which I think was very well done. The show keeps your interest by doing this and at the same time provides us with an continued storyline. \\n\r\nWhile I found the first half of the series to be marginally better than the second one because it contains most of the surprises and turning points it was overall very well done and wraps up nicely. One advise I can give is that you should try to not get spoiled, simply because that would take away the tension.\\n\r\nStory - 9/10\\n\\n\r\nLet's be fair - Bokuranos animation is not great. The mecha fights are well choreographed, the mecha design is creative and this is one of the very few instances where the CGI does not stick out but apart from the fight scenes the animation is fairly average. The character designs are nice but nothing special and can get confusing at times and unfortunately are off-model very often. The backgrounds are rather beautiful and there are some instances where the animation shines like the scenes inside the robot which have a nice choice of color but these are few and far between. Overall the animation and art do the job but nothing more.\\n\r\nAnimation/Art - 6\\n\\n\r\nThe music is equally uninteresting. It never works against the mood and usually compliments the anime rather nicely but it is nothing to write home about. The OP is great and fits the mood of the anime perfectly. The EDs are nice to listen to but not nearly as spectacular as the opening.\\n\r\nMusic - 6 for the BGM, 9 for OPs and EDs\\n\\n\r\nBy far my most favourite aspect of Bokurano are the characters. Each of them gets there own little arc which usually do a better job then I expected. Not all characters are equally interesting and a few are pretty dull but overall I was immensely impressed how much I cared about characters I only got to know for two or three episodes. One thing I'd like to mention at this point is that while Bokurano is not very violent and sexual it contains some disturbing content that might put some viewers off. \\n\r\nCharacters - 9\\n\\n\r\nThe most important aspect about anime is in my opinion the direction, and sadly this is one aspect I did not like so much about Bokurano especially at the beginning. My knowledge of cinematography is rather limited and I did not expect a work a la Miyazaki when I started this anime but it ended up bothering me more than I expected. In the first few episode everything seems to be shot in the same unexciting way that did not allow me to get a firm grasp of the surroundings. Maybe this was done intentionally - it creates a somewhat uneasy feeling after all - but I found it distracting. \\n\r\nLuckily the direction improves in episodes 6 and 24 which share the same director but in my opinion it could have been better.\\n\r\nAlso this anime is heavily influences by Evangelion in case you could not already tell from the fact that it is classified as a psychological mecha deconstruction. This does not distract from the experience but I thought it was a bit much at times.\\n\\n\r\nSo is this a must-watch anime you should not miss or is it just another anime rip-off of a certain 90s mecha anime?\\n\r\nThe answer to both these questions is 'no'.\\n\r\nBut if you are a fan of psychological, more serious anime and like deconstructions as much as I do I recommend to check this one out. At the end of the day I found Bokurano to be a very enjoyable experience.\\n\r\nOverall - 8",

It should be something I like. And I guess it's worth a watch, if you have time to waste.\r\nThe art is rather nice, but annoyingly standard. No exciting stylistic choices, nothing high-brow. The sound is rather nice, despite the fact that I disliked the opening theme, the editing and feel are great. The characters are not boring, but tend to be very cliche. If you've watched enough anime, you already know all the themesto all of them. The plot is sub-par. It's standard, throw-away, recycled mecha stuff; Kids get giant robot, fight aliens to save the world! Evil government, military involvement, etc. My gripe is not that this is bad. My gripe is that it feels the producers chickened out. This could have been so much more.\\n\\n\r\nAs it is, this is a mix of Evangelion and Gantz, each of which was more daring because it went deeper into it's own thing, while Bokurano remains annoyingly neutral. It's shocking but doesn't dare to be disturbing. There is no fast paced fun, nor eery and deliberate atmospheres developing slowly. It just feels neutral. It focuses on a character each chapter, and excluding a few, none of them get enough focus for us to feel for them. This should have been an amazing show, I cannot stress this enough. And I'm sure than in the manga form, this is a brilliant work.\\n\\n\r\nYet at the end of the day, I have to sum it up as \"meh, wasn't bad\".",

            "content": "When I first heard of Bokurano, I was moderately intrigued, but I put it aside because it was a mecha and there other things I wanted to watch. Looking back, that was a poor decision. Now, Bokurano is one of my favorite mecha anime of all time. Because instead of focusing on the robot and the battles, they chose to focus on the development of each pilot and the Earth as a whole. \r\nStory: 9\r\nThe anime starts out rather slow, introducing the characters, and of course, the giant mech. From the second episode onward, however, the tone of the series changes. While these children haveto fight off external enemies, they begin to realize that the battles themselves are the least of their worries. To give any more away would be a massive spoiler, but think along the lines of a sad slice-of-life moment in each episode of Bokurano. Not to mention the plot twists, which go to show how complicated the world really is.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 7\\n\r\nBecause it came out in 2007, I knew the art wouldn't be able to compare to anime now. That being said, a few episodes really should have been cleaned up more. Overall, I didn't really have a problem with the art. It was simple and got to the point.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10\\n\r\nOddly enough, the music was another reason I enjoyed Bokurano so much. From the opening, Uninstall, to the ending, I never felt like the music was out of place. Not to mention the meaning behind the opening and ending lyrics being so appropriate to the series. As I've said, Bokurano is more of a slice-of-life tragedy than anything else, so my favorite parts were always when the violin music started playing.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9\\n\r\nThis is undoubtedly the strength of the series, though I will explain why I gave it a 9 later. Each of the pilots are troubled youths, who have their own stories to tell and problems to overcome. The coming-of-age backdrop of the series is well-executed with mech battles being more of a symbol of the characters growing up than defeating enemies. They all have to find within themselves a reason to fight for the world, whether it be for family or friends. And while certain episodes were very tragic and heartwarming (at the same time, though you'd find out why after watching the series), certain characters were not as memorable as the others, so I can only give this a 9. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9\\n\r\nA majority of the episodes had me on the edge of my seat, either because I wasn't expecting a plot twist there or because the backstory of one of the pilots was that good. Again, certain episodes were less powerful than others. Also, Bokurano is a surprisingly simple story about growing up. It doesn't bombard you with complex philosophical questions; it is much more subtle, describing the world of a child and letting the audience interpret for themselves the meaning behind their lives.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9\\n\r\nWhether you end up enjoying Bokurano or not, I suggest you at least watch a few episodes. This is one of the hidden gems that I found, not even expecting to. This is basically the Madoka Magica of mecha anime.\\n",

            "content": "Bokurano is an anime series that follows a group of children as they pilot a robot named Zearth, fending of 15 alien invaders. The catch is though, is after they defeat the alien enemy, they child in control of Zearth dies. And if they lose thier fight, the Earth dies. There\u2019s a lot more to it than that, but anything else I could say would be a spoiler.\r\nI will say this though, it\u2019s hard to pin down how I feel about this show. \r\nInitially I saw similarities to Evangelion, but I quickly let those leave my mind. The plot held my interest the entire show.Bokurano has a nice and steady pace, the plot  moves forward each episode and leaves you wanting to no more and more. Most everything gets answered and explained. The ending fits well with the rest of the series, there\u2019s no sudden mood change or last second curve ball, it ends quite nicely. There was also this social commentary vibe I was getting about the \u201call for one\u201d mind set Japan has. Bokurano spends a lot of time exploring the idea that individualism is just as important as a group mentality mind set. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters are the stars of the show, specifically the 15 kids that pilot Zearth. Each of the kids gets fleshed out nicely, but at sometimes the impacts of their deaths seemed cheap. The structure of show is easy to catch onto pretty fast, so it becomes obvious real fast when someone is going to die. The character development the kids get right before they pilot Zearth is great, but to me it seemed almost to convenient. The writers do a great job with everyone\u2019s back stories however. They all are believable and unique. I didn\u2019t get tired of hearing about the characters or think that the backstories were to repetitive. The characters come to life and get a reaction out of you. There wasn\u2019t one main character I felt indifferent about.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation was nothing to out of the ordinary, very standard Gonzo anime production animation quality wise. Nothing that stopped me from enjoying the show though. The music was very plain which sometimes worked for the show, I was surprised by this because Bokurano is a very emotional show. There seemed to be very few pieces of music.\\n\\n\r\nBokurano does a great job at showing how even through adversity or even in the face of death, there is a reason to going forward and to keep fighting. Bokurano is an anime I see myself looking back on to think about and discuss with people. It is an anime I think will grow on me more with time, something I can definitively see myself re watching someday.",

            "content": "Bokurano is a mecha series with a unique premise. As with Evangelion before it, it is the strength of the story and the interesting, broken characters that make this show worthwhile. Unlike Evangelion, however, the writers for this show don't write themselves into a corner and then abandon the plot entirely, although important plot points are left hanging by the end.\r\nGOOD\r\n- A variety of interesting, complex characters make for a lot of drama\r\n- Intriguing plot which combines fantasy, science-fiction, and government conspiracy into one satisfying whole\r\n- Due to a certain plot element in this series, which I won't reveal, the series could very easily havedescended into nihilism. It somehow manages to avoid this trap\\n\r\n- Great opening and closing themes, and some good background music\\n\\n\r\nCONS\\n\\n\r\n- There are some elements of the plot that are not fully explored by the end of the series. This keeps the plot from being a true 10/10.\\n\r\n- The robot battles are mostly unremarkable, although a mecha series with slow robots was a bit interesting to see.\\n\r\n- There are so many characters in the show's first half that the viewer has trouble relating to any of them. This is resolved in the series second half, when a good number of the main cast are no longer in the show.\\n\r\n- Early episodes can sometimes become formulaic.\\n\r\n- Some individual episodes with VERY rough animation quality (episode 7, I'm looking at you)\\n\r\n- In general, expect a variable level of episode quality.\\n\\n\r\nThere is no other mecha show really like this one.

            "content": "Studio Gonzo is an animation studio often trashed on in the anime community. Infamous for their cg skills and lack of consistency. So bad they managed to bankrupt themselves. They certainly had their fair share of flops but I feel like their good side is far too often overlooked. Back before their collapse Gonzo was an interesting studio willing to take risks and actually had a good number of great anime to their name. One look at the likes of Gankutsuo shows just how experimental they were willing to get. Bokurano is one of their golden age titles that I\u2019d been putting off for ages.Now finally having gotten around to watching it how does it stack up? I had pretty high expectations going in and for the most part wasn\u2019t disappointed. The story is about a bunch of kids piloting a giant robot to save the world, stop me if you\u2019ve heard this one before. Although this is indeed a mecha series the focus is firmly on the characters. I promise you Bokurano is no standard fare.\\n\\n\r\nWe start with a bunch of kids at the beach for a summer camp, 14 middleschoolers and one elementary student to be exact. One of the kids suggests they go explore some nearby seaside caves. Within they come across an out of place cavern full of computers and electronic equipment. The mysterious owner of said equipment shows up and claims to be developing a video game that he wants the kids to help him play-test. They just have to place their hand on a shady looking pedestal to accept the contract to play a mech battle game. In which they must save the world from 15 alien foes. What could possibly go wrong?\\n\\n\r\nOne of the first things you\u2019ll notice is the character designs. Fairly plain, but more on the realistic side compared to the standard flashy anime designs. Which works well with the very human portrayal of the characters. They behave like middleschoolers should, for the most part. When it comes to fighting deadly mech battles they did come off as a bit too accepting and cool headed though. No this is not a happy show. It is full of death, destruction, despair and even some sexual themes. But it isn\u2019t played up for melodrama. In fact the show is somewhat emotionally subdued overall. With an atmosphere of bleak hopelessness reminiscent of something like Tehxnolyze. Whereas the monster of the week style mech battles coupled with introspective exploration of middle school characters channels Evangelion. But in a much more straightforward way and without the religious symbolism. Besides the children, one other character worth mentioning is an adorable little mascot thing by the name Dung Beetle\u2026 Kyuubei is that you? Quick kill it with fire! The cast is unique and varied and while you might not remember all of their names straight away the show does a great job establishing their distinct personalities right from the first scene. This fantastic characterization continues through the whole show as we get to know each of them in turn. Perhaps the best part of Bokurano is how it explores each individual character. How they react and develop or devolve through the events of the show and when psychologically cornered. They are just kids forced into an unfair and cruel situation with a heavy responsibility they should never have been burdened with. Seeing their struggle and the different ways in which they deal with their predicament is fascinating. As well as imagining how this all will affect the people around them, which unfortunately we don\u2019t get to see much of. Each one of them must come to terms with themselves and their fate in a sort of coming of age, then put the world on a scale. Is it even worth saving? What really matters to them? If even one of them can't find their own reason to fight, the world might just be doomed.\\n\\n\r\nBut this is where the show also stumbles a bit. Not in the characters, but in the structure. We get to know a character for 1 or maybe 2 episodes before a battle occurs then rinse and repeat for each character for the majority of the series. This structure gets predictable and repetitive after a while. Another point that left me wanting was how each character arc would just cut off and we would never get any kind of epilogue, with the exception of Daiichi\u2019s family in the very end. And as I mentioned, actually being shown the effects of the story's events on the people close to each character would have made for even greater impact. The true masterminds behind the whole plot are briefly brought up and even shown but never expanded upon which makes it feel like a loose end. I would have preferred it to be speculated on by the characters or not even touched upon rather than what we got. The way it was done made it seem like we would get further expansion on it, but then was completely ignored in the end.\\n\\n\r\nWhile the first episode looks very good, with expressive character animation helping to quickly define each character in the beginning, animation quality drops off slightly afterwards. Characters sometimes go off model but it\u2019s good when it needs to be. The robot battles despite being cg have weight to them, like a 500m hunk of metal should (is it even metal?!). Entire buildings and city blocks are crushed and destroyed with every move. The battles are somewhat lacking in tension as the kids don\u2019t usually struggle too much to win, but the weight of the inevitable consequences help keep you invested. And when there\u2019s a giant alien mech trashing the city you can bet your ass the military and the government wouldn\u2019t stay out of it. So it\u2019s funny how authority figures are conveniently left out of the picture quite a lot in anime. But not here. They get involved pretty early on and attempt to take control of the situation and keep the kids in check. Although some important questions are ignored until later, it\u2019s nice to see this aspect acknowledged for once.\\n\\n\r\nThe music mostly blends into the background and unfortunately not much stands out here. That is if you don\u2019t count the opening by Chiaki Ishikawa of See Saw fame. One of Yuki Kajiura\u2019s earlier projects well known for their Gundam SEED endings. And you can't go wrong with Yuki Kajiura as far as I'm concerned. But Ishikawa's solo work here certainly lives up to her See Saw days. Uninstall is one of those op\u2019s that will have you watching it through before every episode unable to skip it.\\n\\n\r\nWhen the fate of the world is in the hands of a bunch of middleschoolers and there\u2019s not damn thing anyone can do about it. Except maybe a certain little mascot character, who is a total asshole by the way, so he ain't doin shit. I was compelled to finish all 26 episodes in just 2 days so it must be doing something right. I\u2019ve heard that the manga is superior (big surprise\u2026) and various things were changed or omitted from the original, including the ending. However I have yet to get around to reading it, and therefore can\u2019t judge based on comparison to the source. So as it turns out this is another one of Studio Gonzo\u2019s underappreciated gems. Sadly Gonzo is now a mere shadow of its former self and it is unlikely that we will see this kind of quality from them again. I give Bokurano an 8/10 and my personal recommendation, as little as that means.",

            "content": "It's not very often you come across an anime that is willing to do what this anime does, and because of that I really think this is one of the best anime ever made. This anime has a vast array of characters, all of them unique as a whole person, they have feelings and goals, and one of the best things about this series, they have to find a reason in themselves to keep moving forward. \r\nThis anime is extremely emotionally heavy, If that's not your type of anime then you better turn away right now. \r\nThe basic story of this anime is about agroup of kids that are tricked into signing into a 15 level death battle with giant mechs in order to ensure the safety of their universe. There is a lot of plot twists, and I really enjoyed that they never really let characters dissappear, their memories live on in the characters.\\n\r\nThe anime also deals with a LOT of issues of the modern world, and those issues are reflected perfectly on the characters they affect. From suicide to families destroyed by gang wars, this anime really does have it all, and it will expect you to figure out what has happened every once in a while.\\n\r\nIt's pretty obvious from the beginning of the show that Jun is going to be the main character, and the plot ends up focusing on him and cousin a lot,and I believe it is important to realize this is not a mech anime, it might have a giant robot but in the end the real focus is the one driving the robot.\\n\r\nThe lowest point would probably be the art style, but I feel like it didn't need to be a super fancy anime in order to get it's point across. The people are designed simply, like real people are, in order for you to be able to focus more on who they are rather then what they look like.\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is great, and Uninstall is an amazing intro that really captures the feelings the anime is trying to show, and while most of the time  anime that take scenes from their show and crop them together into an intro are not as good, but i feel like their ability to capture the moments of which each character is under the most pressure.\\n\r\nThe only thing about this anime that had me disappointed was the ending. While it was perfectly good and closed off an open character plot, it still makes you wonder if there is more problems yet to arise.\\n\r\nOverall though, this anime is by far one of the best anime I have ever seen.",

I'd just like to give a quick shout out to GlassReflection, for introducing me to this show. 99.9% of the time, he introduces shows to me that become some of my favorite viewing experiences of all time, and BOY, DID HE NOT DISAPPOINT, THIS TIME! If I had to describe Bokurano, it would be if Madoka Magica, Attack on Titan, and Danganronpa all had a baby. Though, Bokurano actually came before ALL of those shows. So I guess it'd be more suitable to say thatyou can thank Bokurano for all those other shows and games. Madonna Magica actually even has a reference to Bokurano, in one of the episodes. So if Madoka herself recommends this show to you, then you NEED to see it. But here's the one thing that made me like this show FAR more than Madoka Magica and Attack on Titan. Unlike those two shows, Bokurano wasn't spoiled for me. I had both Madoka and AoT spoiled to high heaven, before I even went and watched them. And because of that, my experience with Madoka became a lot more underwhelming and unenjoyable than everyone else's experience, and I didn't even bother finishing AoT, because I was able to describe every single scene, before it even happened.\\n\\n\r\nSo ya. Don't spoil things, people! It ruins shows! And don't use the \"They should've watched it, already\" excuse. Not everyone was born at the same time as you and not everyone got into something at the same time as you. Nobody is obligated to experience something as soon as it's created, just for the sake of not having it get ruined by other people. If you know that someone doesn't want something spoiled, DON'T SPOIL IT. Now that that's settled, let's write up a spoiler heavy review of Bokurano! But before I do, I'm gonna give you all a fair warning. Bokurano is a show that is most enjoyable when you know literally NOTHING about it, going into it. In fact, it's one of those shows where simply mentioning anything about it can be considered a huge spoiler. So I'm gonna warn you all right now that this review will have to contain spoilers, in order to be written. I try my best to keep all my reviews spoiler free, but for this show, it's almost impossible to do so. If you don't wish to be spoiled on anything, I'll just tell you right now that Bokurano gets my absolute highest recommendation. So go watch it. Like. Right now.\\n\\n\r\nOk, then. Where do I even begin? So something that made me a bit hesitant to watch this show at first was that I eventually found out that it's a mecha anime. Personally, mecha is my least favorite anime genre that I've watched. I don't think the mechs themselves are to blame, per se. But it's just sort of a fact that if a show has a giant robot in it, I don't like it. The only exception to this is iDOLM@STER: Xenoglossia, though I'll be completely honest and say that I probably only like it, because it's iDOLM@STER. So as soon as that opening started playing and that giant robot appeared, I was immediately worried. But now that it's all said and done, I am thrilled to say that Bokurano did not disappoint. Not only is this the best mecha show I've seen, but it's also one of my absolute favorite anime series, or all time. The show does not follow any sort of rules or tropes that others mecha shows do. It's very unique and different. Like I said, it has a LOT of similarities to shows like Madoka Magica, AoT, and Danganronpa. Stuff like a bunch of teenagers being tricked into a life or death game that puts the entire world at risk of destruction, a demonic chibi creature thing who is the most despicable character in anime history, tons of plot twists that involve your jaw dropping 20 meters downward and your heart getting ripped out of your chest, literally every single thing you could possibly imagine going wrong happening, and MILLIONS OF PEOPLE DYING. Sounds fun!\\n\\n\r\nNow this show has a VERY big cast of main characters. 15, to be exact. And with only 24 episodes, giving each of them enough screen time to know about them is quite the challenge. Well if iDOLM@STER can do it, so can this show! And it most certainly did! One episode is all each character needs, in order for you to know what they're all about. These characters have two types. They can either be incredibly relatable and super likable, which leads you to being absolutely miserable when they end up getting put on the chopping block. Or they can be the lowest of the low, absolute despicable scums of the earth, where you're just waiting in anticipation for them to get put on the chopping block, and worried sick about how much damage they'll do, before then. You WILL know each and every single one of these characters, by the end of it. You may not remember their names, and possibly not even their faces, but you'll remember every single detail of their stories. The only thing a bit disappointing is that you won't really be attached to them as people, for long periods of time. Since each of their stories are only an episode long. They're fantastic stories, but the characters attached to them simply don't last long enough for you to fall in love with them, as much as you did with their stories.\\n\\n\r\nThe reason I say you probably won't remember their faces is due to the animation. This show was made in 2007, by a company called Gonzo, which is made up of former members of Studio Gainax. When looking at all the other shows that came out in 2007, as well as 2006, Bokurano honestly doesn't stand out much, when standing next to its peers from that era. It's certainly not terrible, but if I told you that this show was made in the late 90's, you'd probably believe me. The character look very plain, which isn't necessarily a bad thing. But for a show with 15 protagonists, it'd be helpful if you were able to differentiate them from one another. Even the opening theme song doesn't have any stellar animation. In fact, the entire opening is made up of several clips from the show, itself! Usually the openings of a show are the most beautifully animated portion of the series. But not for this one. Though, I will give it credit for being one of those shows that has the opening become more meaningful, as time goes on. \\n\\n\r\nAnother thing a bit lackluster in this show is its music. While its opening theme is very enjoyable, the show's soundtrack ranges from forgettable to nonexistent. Mecha shows at least have the accompaniment of big, epic orchestras, to enhance their fight scenes. But this show doesn't really have that. Though, considering the type of the show it is and what the characters are going through when piloting it, I could pose the argument that those scenes sorta benefit from a lack of music. And finally, the sub vs dub debate. Or rather, the lack of one. Because Bokurano actually doesn't have a dub, which is kinda shocking, honestly. The Japanese performances are all good, but I'd definitely like to see this show get a dub one day, simply so that the show has another opportunity to be put in the spotlight. \\n\\n\r\nNow this show is incredibly dark. But not necessarily violent. Like I said earlier, MILLIONS OF PEOPLE DIE!!! But it's not nearly as graphic as other shows are, such as Elfen Lied and Attack on Titan. A lot of the gruesome details are off screen or just done in an instant. In fact, I'm pretty sure there's only one scene in the entire show where you see blood. And it's a very minimal amount, despite the events of the scene. So for the more squeamish people who are a bit nervous to go into such a gruesome show, I can assure you that you won't have to look at anything gory. Though, there's a LOT of despicable events and acts that take place in this show that can very easily make people uncomfortable, despite the visuals not being incredibly detailed on the matters. I'll just say that the show is rated R for a reason, and leave it at that.\\n\\n\r\nThe fact that Bokurano is a hidden gem is an absolute crime, to me. Those who've seen it love the heck out of it, but it NEEDS to be seen by more people. The show is all about things getting twisted in every possible direction, at first. Literally anything and everything can and will go wrong. Throughout the first three quarters, it's all about unveiling every piece of the puzzle. And once you finally do, it becomes kinda easy to see how it'll all end. But by that point, you're so hooked not eh story, that you absolutely NEED to finish it. The worst thing I can say about this show is that it probably won't have the best rewatch value. Since the most excitement is derived from being in suspense, waiting to see how long each character survives, as well as what happens to them right before they die. If you ever do rewatch this show, it'd be best to do it with a friend who hasn't seen it. But for those of you who haven't seen it at all, and are ok with viewing a very gruesome series of events, this show will not disappoint. If you love Madoka, AoT, and Danganronpa, thank this show. Because its the reason that these shows came into being, and it definitely deserves some long overdue praise.\\n\\n\r\nBokurano gets a 9.5/10",

            "content": "Due to the nature of this show, it's more or less impossible to talk about anything without spoilers, so I'll just have to put my cards on the table right now and say that I urge everyone reading this to go out and watch this show, because it's easily worth the time investment. As for my review, I'll have to be more vague than I would like, but such is the nature of the beast.\r\nBokurano has a story virtually unrivaled in the entire genre. Being a thorough deconstruction of the mech genre, the immediate comparison is Evangelion, perhaps the most beloved anime of all time.However, Bokurano goes a step further in ripping the audience into emotional pieces. After the initial shock to the nervous system that one gets with the first one or two battles and the associated facts about the ramifications of piloting the robot, the series decides that the audience haven't been in nearly enough pain, and so proceeds to hit said audience over the head with every metaphorical chair it can find. By the latter half of the series, you'll likely find it a challenge to continue from how hard the series hits you over and over again. And it doesn't get any easier from there. The second half of Bokurano is one of the most painful portions of anime to ever be created. The emotional beatings of the first half are completely crushed under the new onslaught of painful revelations, and by episode 20 I threw in the towel the first time. I came back 6 months later with more genre experience under my belt and pressed on, and thankfully the series does lighten up before the end. By the end of the series, Bokurano has finally unveiled a message, and a positive one at that. Going from the bleakest anime ever seen to a series that suggests a brighter future is a mighty accomplishment, and Bokurano pulls it off. \\n\\n\r\nDespite the excellent story, Bokurano is the posterchild for why animation is important. Because the animation is really bad. Particularly noticeable is the fight animation, it's nothing short of dreadful. All the robots are done in really terrible 3D animation, their movements are unbearably slow and surprisingly choppy, and overall the fight animation, which is the place where animation quality is most important, ultimately falls flat. \\n\\n\r\nThe sound is good, though it doesn't stand out particularly well. The background music is hard to notice most of the time and is mostly unmemorable. However, the OP and second ED are fantastic, and shouldn't be skipped at any point. The voice acting is very good, with notably great performances where it counts the most.\\n\\n\r\nI can't really talk about any of the pilots without spoiling the major elements of their backstories, though I can say the best characters in the roster are Daiichi, Anko, Kanji, and Jun. Overall, being vague enough to avoid spoilers, the roster of pilots is excellent, boasting memorable backstories and great personalities. Aside from them, the only character I can talk about is Koemushi,  better known as Dung Beetle. He's perhaps the most unlikable and rage-inducing character in any form of media. Throughout the entire story, the viewer grows to despise this thing more and more, and his backstory doesn't help the viewer like him any more. Clearly the audience is supposed to hate him, and the show does an excellent job making him the most horribly unlikable character ever.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Bokurano is excellent. The great story and characterization make up for the poor animation, and earn the series a spot as one of the all time greats, and a must-watch for anyone with any experience in the mech genre.",

I had my mind open for ANYTHING, i didn't want to read anything about it , didn't want to form any predication to the plot , no expectation so i don't get disappointed   ( ive been suffering from watching good anime recently ) And ... I was overjoyed by my decision!\\n\\n\r\nThe show got all those plot that you don't expect, at every other point in the story you think you've got it figured out , and that \"Oh, i bet this that this is gonna happen next \" and then you might be wrong you might be right , but most likely there is gonna be that \"one little thing\" you didn't take into consideration even though it was more or else there from the very beginning. \\n\r\nIt's nothing so \"OMG where the heck did THAT come from ?????? did they just make it up ?\"\\n\r\nbut more \"Oh ... Oh , Ooooooooh , makes sense!!! :) .... but wait ... Nooooooo does that mean ...?\"  and it continues like that , until the very last episode. \\n\\n\r\nHonestly as other has said about it, its true worth in watching it ALL the way to the VERY END (something i tend to say about Shinsekai Yori, its true masterpiece by watching it till the very last 5 min of the show, only then do you say you watched those two and seen their true meat)\\n\\n\r\n-\"THE STORY\" :\\n\r\nGoing blind is your best option\\n\r\nsaying anything about the very first episode will be spoilers of its own \\n\r\nthough please do give the boring-ish first 15 min a chance , it's worth it \\n\\n\r\nThis is one Thought provoking anime, nothing too complicated ( ie Serial Lain ) by the end of  the show  you'll understand what they want you to , and you'll still have space to think for your own of other things too.\\n\\n\r\nIt may be labeled under the Mecha genre, but .. its not Gundam or Code Geass in that sense\\n\r\nthere is barely any form of action. so don't go in expecting that. \\n\\n\r\n-\"CHARACTERS\"\\n\r\n15 may be alot of characters, but trust me, you wont feel the burden. It's well written in that you can get to know (almost) All of them and feel like any of them are cardboard cut stereotypical chara, even  though the first episode may fool you into thinking that.\\n\\n\r\n-\"ART\":\\n\r\nis on the realistic spectrum of anime. is it bad? no i think it did the atmosphere and story justice\\n\r\nthe mecha where as realistic as any mecha could look in the real world, their movement too \\n\r\nweird but good weird.. or at least the \" you get used to it\" weird\\n\\n\r\n-\"Sound\"\\n\r\nSurprisingly i watched the Opening of EVERY episode, and the second Ending as well.  I'm the type of person that skips that and some to get straight to the episode.. so that ought to say something right ?\\n\r\nThe lyrics are all TRUE to the story though , so at least read the lyrics, just as the others here in the review section mentioned. OST though ,... nothing really struck out in my mind, and i just got off the last episode..  so i don't know what to say about that.\\n\\n\r\n-\"Enjoyment\"\\n\r\ni think the fact I'm rating it so high is proof enough of how much i loved it \\n\\n\r\nWARNING:\\n\r\nPrepare tissues\\n\r\nIts a tad bit too heavy to watch ALL in one setting, but at the same time you can't give too much spacing between the eps, so Pace it well. You might want to watch a comedy episode of some other anime in between  ^_^\\n\\n\r\n-\"OverALL\"\\n\\n\r\nTHIS NEEDS TO BE WATCHED!!!!! especially for those out there like me who are running out of anime to watch and take seriously.\\n\\n\\n\r\nPS:\\n\\n\r\nThis is my VERY first review , i hope it was well written. Thank you",

            "content": "Would you kill an entire family just to save your own? How about a group of kids fighting for the planets survival? Trapped like a rat in something far greater than a simple kill or be killed world.\r\nBokurano has a story that doesn't really make much sense with its \"rules of play\" until about half a dozen episodes into the anime. From there it finally opened more of the purpose behind the giant robots and why the battles in them must be won at all costs. The first three quarters of the anime are full on action intense. However as the government and researchers becomemore aware of the situation, it slows with the action, takes longer to get through the explanations and reasoning behind a persons motives.\\n\\n\r\nArt styles are fairly disappointing for something made in 2007. Whether this is because of a low art budget or not, is unknown. Characters and non scenery items are very basically drawn and mouth movements could not have been done a lazier way. A few scenes depicting horror or large amounts of gore, are drawn extraordinarily well. However the 3D CG used in the robots is fairly well done and very smooth with its animation. It almost makes you question if this is where their entire art budget went.\\n\\n\r\nMajor battle sequences, emotional character scenes and introductions to the current scene. They all seem to have their own music piece that is used throughout the anime. It's most times very soft compared to the voices and can sometimes no unnoticed. A few new music pieces pop up in the final couple of episodes but nothing too interesting. many generic stock sounds are used throughout and the few that sound unique, especially during the robot battle scenes, are recycled more times than you can count.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters were sometimes bland and didn't get hype at all which can be disappointing but the character development for most is short and doesn't drag down on the mass amounts of action. Others drag on for far too long and can waste an entire episode filling in what can be explained in five minutes. This can occasionally kill the mood as it gets to starting action scenes, making you hype then drags on about a characters back story for over an episode.\\n\\n\r\nDespite these slow points dotted throughout the anime, it really is quite enjoyable for the first 18 episodes and the finale. The 5 episode gap between them makes you want to curl up and sleep through it, it waffles on that long. It does have a fitting ending battle, but it just doesn't quite make up for the mass stalling in the few episodes prior. A few times in the first half of the anime you question just how messed up they made this anime as well as a couple scenes that make you question how they got away with just the \"Violence and Profanity\" tags.",

            "content": "It wouldn't be too outlandish to say that Gonzo has a reputation of having its earliest works (pre-2007) being its best. But being as unique as it is, Bokurano doesn't have enough to call itself the best of Gonzo's early works, but its certainly good enough to be considered great in its own regards, and something that the studio can be proud of. With a brilliantly cruel and tiring plot, but an all-too-known moral standing, Bokurano can keep its viewers on the edge, while giving them something meaningful to think about.\r\nWhen it comes to animation and design, Gonzo has never been a great achiever, albeitthey've gotten better over the years. But being released in 2007, Bokurano doesn't have much to stand out amongst other shows when it comes to how well animated characters are. The characters through most of the show are a bit half and half when it comes to how unique they are, apart from other shows. But there is a distinct art style in the show, and all things considered, there are many scenes where most of everything on screen blends well together, and background characters are drawn out fairly well, and there are a good handful of moments of quality above the rest of its sub-par to par animation. But the most glaring problem is that Gonzo had to resort to CGI for the giant robots. However, the mecha fights aren't the highlight of the show, so it's not as much of a crime as it would have been had that been the case.\\n\\n\r\nBokurano's backbone is its psychological perspective on its cast, but that proves to be its strongest, and its weakest point. When the main plot device is introduced at the end of its first episode, the entire course of the show changes from a heroic and brave battle anime to a horrific and cruel, and extremely drawn out psychological torture. But what happens is that the show turns to shock value, which is obviously lost the very first time it happens. What follows is the deteriorating psyche of the characters, who slowly begin to understand the circumstances they're forced to act under. Unfortunately, because of this, Bokurano's myriad of characters become a struggle to deal with. Knowing their fates that come episode after episode, it's hard to squeeze in development for them which can be literally considered as 'last-minute.' From this, at least half of the cast become fodder for the other half. It was almost tedious to have to sit through the third quarter of the show because of the fact that the viewers know what will happen, but it's only a matter of time before it actually happens. But given the length, and the use of flashbacks and numerous sub-plots and backstories, Gonzo is able to make the most of what they have. Some characters that never really stood out from the beginning end up having their moment in the spotlight, that can both give inspiration to the viewer, and a reason to have sympathy. Interestingly enough, the most hated, or rather the most 'evilly' portrayed character ends up becoming the most noble and developed character in the show. \\n\\n\r\nNothing stood out in particular when it came to voice acting performances, but the casting itself wasn't too bad. The voices fit the characters, some fitting a more childish role, some heroic, and some that pretty much matched the personality. Dung Beetle's voice actor hit the mark on the voice that really sticks a thorn in one's side with a bad attitude. \\n\\n\r\nAmong other things, there are numerous parts about the show that can't be explained very well. Most of it is straightforward, and easy to understand, but there are a few things near the end that seem to be glanced over, or vaguely explained. The show itself can be considered somewhat open-ended, and that there is no actual conclusion when looking at the big picture. \\n\\n\r\nBokurano can be seen as something of a gem in the industry, as it seems to have some roots of inspiration for future shows such as Madoka Magica, while itself gaining its own inspiration from Evangelion. It's far from perfect, but it's a good look at the cruelty of survival of the fittest, with a bit of political criticism towards warmongering or trigger happy military. Most of all, it offers a real sense of the human psyche in all different aspects.",

            "content": "Bokurano consistently surpassed my expectations. When I first read about it, a few of my concerns were that the story line would be emotionally toned-down due to the fact that the main characters are children, that the characters would be annoying and/or difficult to relate to, and that the central theme of the story would not be enough to hold the characters and plot together well. Well, I was wrong on all accounts.\r\nOn the surface, the anime may seem like a redundant theme: depressing circumstances and endings for characters who didn't seem to deserve it (Evangelion, most notably, I'm sure) that melds science fiction witha present reality. However, it was handled very well, with enough explanations to satisfy present and necessary questions (like the process of choosing successors and how he/she came to be there, why the end of each battle has the result that it does, etc) without attempting to answer every question and explain every aspect. The plot itself was engaging and unique with moments of happiness sprinkled among the numerous moments of sadness.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is not overly detailed or flashy, but I gave the artwork high marks for doing what the average anime doesn't: making all of the main characters look different from each other. This is one of the first ones I've seen in which the main characters have unique facial features, clothes, and hairstyles that don't automatically remind me of another anime character. Every character is distinct. Another reason for the high marks was that the characters changed their clothes sometimes. It may seem a little strange as a reason, but in many animes, the characters never change their clothes even once (unless for a one-time event or some such). The final reason is that the mecha actually looked good in its setting. Each robot was different and every part of the robot had a purpose, no parts (other than the face plate) were just for show.\\n\\n\r\nAs for sound, the OP is absolutely perfect in accordance with the series. It has a haunting melody that maybe didn't seem to fit with the first few episodes, but by the end it will become disturbingly fitting. The ending themes were also good, but definitely nowhere near as poignant as the opening one. I also appreciated the variance in voices between voice actors. None of the characters had annoying or unfitting voices.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are probably one of the best reasons to watch this anime. There are initially 15 main characters (all of which are children), but others are introduced in time. Each character has different secrets and problems to deal with and overcome (or in some cases, crumble beneath) before they can face their challenge. Many of the problems are ones that are common in today's society such as bullying, depression, familial tension, and the bonds of friendship. Most if not all of the characters' stories deal with at least one other main character, too. Seeing the characters struggle against their problems is heartbreaking and usually changes your opinion of the character while making you re-evaluate yourself and your situation. Such a variety of characters and the depth that the viewer will see of them makes it nearly impossible for anyone not to connect with at least one character throughout the series.\\n\\n\r\nIf you are a person who cries easily, you will need to keep some tissues nearby, but I can guarantee that you'll be moved by it even if you aren't crying by the end. I loved this anime, and I recommend it to anyone.",

            "content": "This will be a spoiler free review. But will say that this anime reinforced a couple childhood lessons for me- \"don't talk to strangers\", \"don't fall to peer pressure\" and \"be grateful for what you have because someone ALWAYS has it worse than you\" \r\nBokurano is about 15 kids at a summer camp. They are playing on the beach and end up exploring a nearby cave. They find a cavern within the cave set up with computers and meet a man who refers to himself as Kokopelli. He claims this is a set up for his game, where multiple players fight using a giant robot.To play, you must sign a contract. He convinces all but one to sign the contract. Then they find themselves back on the shoreline of the beach, thinking it may have been something they all dreamed but soon realizing they have signed up for much more than a game. \\n\\n\r\nBokurano is a deconstruction of the mecha genre... in laymen terms, it takes the robot genre of anime and does something different with it. Other mecha anime include ones like Neon Genesis: Evangelion, Power Rangers and even arguably, Attack on Titan (with a \"living robot). So if you like those or other robot anime, you will probably like this one. But like previously mentioned it does use the tropes of the genre differently- also being classified as psychological, drama and horror on MAL. \\n\\n\r\nStory: 9.5/10\\n\r\nI cannot say much without spoiling the anime but it is definitely exciting, captivating, fascinating and tragic. The unpredictable nature of the anime is what really set it apart from others I have seen. Even if you do predict something, it may seem too extreme or sadistic to go that far...but sometimes they do take it THAT FAR. Also, if you're in the mood just to watch something, this may not be the anime for you as it will take some paying attention to follow along with the symbolic nature of some of the events. But the story will definitely draw you in and keep you through the 24 episodes and have you eagerly waiting to see how it all ends. I think you can also tell this is NOT a happy-go-lucky, funny anime and so maybe not for those in a sad or depressed mood...a lot of sadness and loss in this one. The themes they portray I cannot say, again in an attempt to keep tis a spoiler free review. But I can say they touch on mature themes and really show the psychological effects and mindsets of children, and man it was at times reply messed up. My only real complaint besides the characters (which i'll mention in a second) is the ending which I did like, but I felt left some loose ends untied. \\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9/10\\n\r\nArt: 6/10\\n\r\nThere are A LOT of main characters, 15 to be exact. Plus when you add some of the important supporting characters that are later introduced, its a lot to follow. The children definitely have some defining characteristics that set them apart from each other but it is really their backstories that will set them apart. They are heart-wrenching and at times very difficult to watch. There was not enough time for a lot of development for each one but the time they spent was, at most times, just enough to get you either sad, resentful and/or angry. Children are not always as innocent as they seem, and this anime depicted that VERY WELL. My biggest problems were that there WERE TOO MANY characters and the art/animation did not do a good job of making their faces memorable. You will definitely remember all their stories, but may have a hard time pinning a name and face to the story. They look like very average and normal children in extraordinary circumstances. Oh and I would be neglectful if I didn't mention that this anime has one of THE MOST despicable, sadistic and hateful characters I have ever seen, going by the name of Dung Beetle (Koemushi in Japanese). You'll see what I mean when you watch it. You'll either love his messed up attitude or like me, you'll despise him and hope his actions come back to bite him in the ass. \\n\\n\r\nThe art like I said, not great. But the fighting sequences with the robots were pretty good. I think though, what the story lacks in art and animation, it almost fully makes up for with the story. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 7/10\\n\r\nThe opening and closing themes are sort of catchy, and the music throughout the anime does a good job at setting the scenes. They really give you emotion trying to be conveyed. The musical pieces aren't all impressive but they definitely get the job done. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9/10\\n\r\nOverall: 9/10\\n\r\nOnly a select few animes impact me to the point where I'm thinking about them all day and getting swept up in the world they've portrayed. Bokurano was an anime I couldn't get out of my mind. While I was at work I couldn't stop thinking about it and when I was falling asleep its all I thought about. The story drew me in and intrigued me that much....I think most of it just came from the genuine sadness and pity I felt for the characters. Although I did have some complaints, I would still recommend it to anyone willing to watch it and must say, in terms of story, it was so close to being a masterpiece, I really struggled giving it only a 9.5/10. It is a gem of an anime and one I think will be one you will never forget.  \\n",

            "content": "My first thought on \u201cBokurano\u201d is that it bears a strange resemblance to \u201cGantz\u201d, a survival game series featuring bizarre, dark themes, like \"Bokurano.\" I also thought it\u2019s interesting for an anime to not have a central protagonist; rather, all fourteen of the kids are the protagonists. Then I thought \u201cOh, I get it: this the male version of \u2018Madoka Magica\u2019!\u201d What do I mean? Well, both stories are about being tricked into a cruel destiny and then discovering the system is completely corrupt\u2014 \u201cBokurano\u201d simply inserts robot fights instead of magical girls and witches. \r\nAll that to say, Bokurano fits into several genres suchas mecha, survival game, mystery, psychological, and sci-fi. It contains themes such as the difficulties of growing up, the reality of death, the loss of innocence, the sacrifices that come with battle, and the evil of corrupt systems. If you\u2019re looking for a happy anime or something with uplifting messages, don\u2019t watch Bokurano. However, if you love dark anime like I do, then by all means give it a try! Some of the best elements of the series are noted below.\\n\\n\r\nConsidering how much of the animation budget was probably allocated to robot fights, the rest of the art is fairly good, especially if you like slightly more realistic and less cutesy animation. Instead of being over-the-top like most fight scenes in anime, the impressive robot battles were refreshingly realistic. The music scores were fair, and the opening and ending songs are beautiful. Although the central plot felt somewhat unoriginal to me at times, it\u2019s the variety of characters and their own stories that saved the series for me. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, \u201cBokurano\u201d proved quite enjoyable, and I would give it three and a half stars out of five. Personally, my favorite thing about \u201cBokurano\u201d is the discussion of parallel universes. I cannot elaborate, however, without giving spoilers. I will point out that many sci-fi and mecha series contain discussion of other planets, but relatively few deal with parallel or alternate universes. In that sense, \u201cBokurano\u201d is like a rare gem. In short, if you like giant robots, survival games, and dark themes, this series is an excellent watch.",

            "content": "So I was notified of this series by the cacophony of others saying how sad and depressing the series was.  \"A twisted take on the mecha genre\", \"Nobody is safe from death\", et cetera et cetera.\r\nMore importantly than being sad, Bokurano is an inspirational and level headed endorsement of any sort of hope or peace in the face of death. Call it existentialism, stoicism or zen buddhism, the message of this series is clear: do not mourn your own death, make peace with it. The deaths of our group of protagonists are established as inevitable from episode 2 onward, and later it is discoveredthat if they don't participate, not only will they die but so will their entire world.\\n\\n\r\nWith that established, yes it is sad that these adolescents must die. However, the only time one of their deaths is presented as horrible is when closure is not reached. Many of the teen pilots make a jump up in maturity when faced with a tangible demise, and decide to make the best of their time. Many of them buy time for civilian evacuations to occur, minimizing additional loss of life (albeit not property damage). The majority of the teens go through the traumas they've experienced in their heads, and decide not to dwell on the past or let it weigh them down (even when much of this trauma would socially or emotionally cripple an adult under normal circumstances). The teenagers that fail to make peace with their inevitable demise die in some sort of pain, leaving things unsaid and conflicts unresolved.\\n\\n\r\nEverything about Bokurano is of a high quality. The story is simple but effective and lays out a very clear version of a historically complicated and hard to swallow message. I highly recommend you check this series out.",

Yeah there will be tears .This is the anime I will say that I felt the most attached to the characters cuz their fates are inevitable .It is really good and bases most on how children(or rather how humans ) handle being faced with an inevitable death so......

I just want to have it mentioned that they're there.\r\nThis review contains minor spoilers (mainly things you will find out pretty early on).\r\nThe plot was quite promising as it would deal with people reacting on their certain death while sacrificing themselves for their family, friends and, well, the entire earth but it always felt empty, especiallywhen it becomes apparent that everyone is behaving in the most primitive ways - if their loved ones don't have a reason to live might as well let the entire world be destroyed. If they're happy, wellp, then there's a reason to fight for it. It's a matter of interdimensional wars and they all act on the smallest levels of morality. I mean sure, they're kids, but this isn't anything new and there is close to no development happening over the course of a dragging 24 episodes.\\n\r\nLater in the show it will be revealed that the robots you are fighting are manned just as yours are - however with pilots from another world and you are actually in an indermensional process of elimination; a type of superdimension is sending out this system to weed out the weakest dimensions.\\n\r\nAnd here is where we are facing the biggest problems which I want to spoil right away before I speak of the little fish: over the course of 24 episodes the existance of this superdimension will be scratched; even the faces of the directors will be shown - but nothing else will be explained. They never get any closer to the discussion of WHY this brutal game has started. I mean weed out weaker dimensions? What ever for? Why do they have so much more power anyways?\\n\r\nThe moral question of killing other dimensions while maintaining your own is scratched but they decide not to think about it and just kill away anyhow. Sometimes in even more brutal ways than necessary. Even after revealing the interdimensionality and a slight uprise for a change of behaviour they will fall back into their old patterns simply mostly fighting or giving up because of personal issues.\\n\\n\r\nAs to the systematic review:\\n\r\n95% of the battles were decided in only one punch.\\n\r\nConsidering the enemy is the same as them, humans, you would think that most of them would have as much force power as them. But for some reason the studio decided to make it a boring one punch battle every single time. And if it isn't one punch it will mostly  look as dramatic as a sequence of 3 year olds punching eatch others heads.\\n\r\nThe music is rather boring most of the time and not very elaborated or memorable.\\n\r\nThere is close to no character development in anyone over the course of the entire show.\\n\\n\r\nThere is so much more I'm furious about but this would spoil too much. \\n\r\nHowever if you think that an extremely low moral system is fine, huge unexplained questions don't bother you and you tolerate toxic relationships  while watching a bunch of poorly animated kids one punch giant robots int he most unespectacular way please go ahead and give Bokurano a shot.\\n",
