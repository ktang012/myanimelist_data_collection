            "content": "Many people are aware of the financial problems faced by the anime industry, and one of the methods that studios have adopted over recent years to try to shore up their crumbling foundations is to adapt popular manga, games, and more recently, Western comics. This approach has become a tried and tested moneymaking endeavour for the majority of studios, but in many cases this is simply due the fact that the source material caters to the lowest common denominator - which usually means fanservice. Unfortunately, the relative success of these shows have allowed them to become the norm rather than the exception, and with thatcomes a number of problems.\\n\\n\r\nThe sad fact is that while it's okay to find inspiration from other sources, the industry has become so used to the adaptation that studios and writers find it difficult to produce work that could be considered \"original\". Instead, what passes for a unique story tends to be nothing more than a collection of concepts and ideas from other tales that are thrown together in the vain hope that people will rush to buy the end product because ... well, because someone tells them to.\\n\\n\r\nBut rather than dwelling on such things, let's take a look at Guilty Crown.\\n\\n\r\nSet in Tokyo in the year 2039, a decade has passed since a mysterious outbreak known as the \"Apocalypse Virus\" killed thousands of people and brought Japan to its knees - a disaster that would later be called \"Lost Christmas\". Since that time Japan has lost its independence, and has become a martial state governed by an international organisation known as GHQ. The story opens with a pink-haired girl and a small robot escaping from a futuristic-looking facility, but security forces injure and corner her until she falls off a bridge. The next morning is just like any other day for highschool student Ouma Shu, an awkward young man who is a fan of the pop-group Egoist, whose lead singer just happens to be a waif-like girl with pink hair.\\n\\n\r\nAnd then everything gets ... weird.\\n\\n\r\nGuilty Crown is a bit of an odd duck as it attempts to blend several disparate themes, but doesn't quite manage to finish the job. The plot has clearly been influenced by several popular franchises - which isn't necessarily a bad thing, but the execution is where the writers have let themselves down. The narrative is often disjointed, and many events in the storyline appear to have no logic behind them other than to put Shu through an emotional wringer. In addition to this, the writers appear to have taken a rather nonchalant approach to reasoning and rationale, one example of which is how GHQ's repeated massacres are never covered by any sort of media outlet. This seemingly lackadaisical attitude is apparent in several areas of the plot - which is littered with \"coincidences\" - and these cause the narrative to have a mechanical feeling. In many ways it's almost as if the story was nothing more than a collection of bits that would apparently appeal to the largest number of people.\\n\\n\r\nAside from the inclusion of numerous well-known aspects that have clearly been transplanted from other popular stories and the \"plot-by-numbers\" approach, Guilty Crown also suffers from the rather obvious idea that most adults are evil and only kids are able to save the world. That said, the series does have some good points, in particular the way it attempts to recreate a situation similar to that found in \"Lord of the Flies\" by putting all of the students in one place and imposing self-rule. There are other, similarly dark influences that add a veneer of maturity to proceedings, but sadly these aren't enough to support the inherent weaknesses in the narrative - the main one being the decision to make yet another school-based anime.\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of production quality, Guilty Crown is arguably up there with some of the better shows of recent years, but the sometimes stunning visuals and effects are tempered by a few issues that may initially appear to minor, but in actuality are representative of the mentality of the show's creators. It's obvious that a great deal of thought has gone into the background artwork and set designs, but the same isn't true of the characters. For the most part they look good, but the decision to feature highschool students places an immediate limitation that becomes obvious when one considers the variety of features and body shapes found amongst the adults.\\n\\n\r\nThe problem lies in the fact that the design of the younger roles includes an element of stereotype in order to impart a degree of familiarity - thereby making the show more accessible to people. It's an old marketing trick that has become a staple of the anime industry over the years, and while Guilty Crown has tried to be a little bit more subtle than most in its usage, one does have to question the logic behind Tsugumi. A cat-eared tsundere loli wearing what is effectively a plug suit (and a maid costume later on), only serves to highlight the thought processes of the show's creators.\\n\\n\r\nThankfully Production I.G. maintain their standards when it comes to the animation, and the series is littered with flowing, well choreographed action scenes. The characters are well-balanced in their movements, and a degree of care has been taken with those that are injured, disabled, or suffer from an affliction.\\n\\n\r\nLike many anime that run for over twenty episodes, Guilty Crown features two opening and ending sequences - each with an original track written by Supercell. The first OP is a rather dizzying blend of effects, character montages and action scenes while the song \"My Dearest\" - a suitably fast paced and dramatic pop song performed by Koeda - sets the tone for the series. \"The Everlasting Guilty Crown\" performed by the fictional band Egoist is the track of choice for the second opening sequence, but while the artwork and design ethic have clearly shifted to promote a bittersweet atmosphere, the actual content is much the same as that of the first OP.  Egoist also perform the melancholy ballad \"Departures ~Anata ni Okuru Ai no Uta~\" for the first ending sequence, which features Ouma Shu and Yuzuriha Inori walking away from each other against a backdrop of character art and effects. The second ED contains a mixture of video footage of landscape speeding by, scenes from the series and a few still images of the school environs that are \"projected\" onto a screen behind Inori and Shu as they decide to run - all while Koeda performs the rather upbeat rock song \"Kokuhaku\"\\n\\n\r\nWhich brings up one small issue.\\n\\n\r\nAlthough it's true that some thought has gone into the composition of the opening sequences and that they are very well choreographed, both also feature overt plot spoilers. Now this does happen in other anime, but in general there are efforts to avoid such things occurring - which doesn't appear to be the case with Guilty Crown.\\n\\n\r\nAside from that minor niggle, the high production standards are also reflected in the quality of the music and audio effects. Sawano Hiroyuki has taken care to ensure that the background pieces are varied and suitably dramatic where necessary. The wide range of sounds and noises are clear and distinct, and the audio/visual choreography shows just how much effort has been made to produce a show that looks and sounds great.\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately the same can't be said of the actual dialogue.\\n\\n\r\nNow while it's true that Guilty Crown features a range of characters and personality types, for some reason the decision was made to revert to old anime stereotypes and then write justifications into the storyline. The script is littered with monologues, diatribes, conversations and arguments that would grace any show where the \"hero\" has to lead his people to salvation whilst fighting against the enemy and his inner demons, forming a pseudo-harem along the way, and showing the world just how much of a tragic-yet-heroic figure he is. Thankfully the actors are more than capable, but no matter how good their skills are, prosaic and formulaic dialogue will always be just that.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the characters themselves, Ouma Shu is the kind of leading man who can be found in a number of other titles - quiet, reserved, doesn't have many friends, and a bit of a loser - and therein lies the problem. The writers have taken great pains to try to show him as a \"human\" more than anything else, but in their efforts to promote Shu as the tragic hero, they've ignored one of the most basic rules of characterisation.\\n\\n\r\nIn other words, Shu has no personality whatsoever - even at the end of the series when all his \"suffering\" is over.\\n\\n\r\nIt's this apparent inability to develop the characters in any meaningful way that makes them appear as nothing more than inane, and the lack of any real growth means that everyone pretty much ends the series having learned very little (aside from maybe Daryl). In addition to this there's an element of ridiculousness to the choice of characters, the prime example being Yuzuriha Inori (although Tsugumi does come a close second). One has to wonder what chemically induced delusion could have persuaded the show's creators that having the lead singer of a hugely popular band stealing from the enemy in the opening scenes while wearing her stage outfit was a good idea.\\n\\n\r\nApparently students can recognise her even though she's wearing a school uniform, but soldiers and officers of the military forces controlling Japan have no idea who she is since pink-haired girls wearing fluttery costumes are a dime a dozen in Japan.\\n\\n\r\nGuilty Crown is one of those anime that can only truly be enjoyed if you have never watched any of the titles that it takes its inspirations from - and that becomes a problem if one has watched, and enjoyed, most of them. The main issue is that there are several character types and plot elements that are better used in their original anime, so their inclusion here makes them stand out in less than flattering ways.\\n\\n\r\nThe real problem with Guilty Crown though, is the element of arrogance that is prevalent throughout the series, and this comes solely from the show's creators. The basic premise of Guilty Crown is perfectly fine, but everyone from the director and series composers to the producers have assumed that the \"anime-by-numbers\" approach that they have so clearly used here is enough to make a hit franchise. There appears to have been a major assumption that the audience will swallow the whole thing without automatically referencing other shows that they may have watched, and that's where everything begins to fall apart.\\n\\n\r\nStorytelling is, after all, an art form, and a good writer can captivate their audience without overtly referencing where there inspiration came from. Unfortunately the folks behind Guilty Crown appear to have forgotten this simple fact, and it leaves one with the sad realisation that this anime had the potential to be so much more than it is.",

            "content": "With the large amount of Guilty Crown reviews going around lately, It wouldn't be too hard to find a 'decent' review, right? well that's not the case at all, It seems that most of the reviews are either written by blind fan-boys/fan-girls or haters, 10's,9's,4's and 3's seem to be the popular choice of overall rating, though looking at Guilty Crown in a balance way, this anime definitely deserves a 7 and I'll explain why in the next couple of paragraphs which will you most likely will flick through.\r\n= Story (3) =\r\nIf you have been watching Guilty Crown or have seen some of the rantingson the forums, you would know that the story is filled with clich\u00e9's and awful execution (for the most part anyway), So I won't go that in-depth to the story, basically just think of it as a mecha-action-supernatural-apocalyptic-drama-comedy-Sci Fi-romance-school-fan service super show.\\n\\n\r\nIn other words, Shu (Shuu), your average 16-year-old guy living in a future version of Tokyo get's himself wrapped up in the activities of terrorist group defying the government called Funeral Parlour, he meets the leader Gai, find's out his favourite singer is a member of the group and that the government is corrupt blah blah blah\\n\\n\r\n= Art (10) = \\n\\n\r\nIf there's one thing that no one can complain about, I'd say it's the art. Every episode looks of cinematic quality and the character designs are well down as you'd expect from Production I.G and Redjuice (supercell). If there is one thing to fault about the art, I believe it's the design of the apocalypse virus, It just doesn't look like some deadly disease that someone would be afraid of, though that doesn't really matter.\\n\\n\r\n= Sound (9) =\\n\\n\r\nSound is also a great part of Guilty Crown, the insert music and the OST is brilliant, the first OP 'Euterpe' was only used in the first episode which was disappointing since the second OP which lasted for 11 episodes wasn't hardly as good. The best OP in my opinion and one of my favourite anime openings  is the third and last one 'The Everlasting Guilty Crown', It seriously made the other two seem like crap in comparison. \\n\\n\r\n= Character (7.5) =\\n\\n\r\n7.5? That's not even an score according to MAL is what you might say though that's really the only score I can give it, The characters and their developments weren't very good though they weren't just good either, sort of in-between. \\n\\n\r\nThe problem with the characters is that they introduced too many too fast, there wasn't really any-time to grow attached to them or even remember some of them at all. You didn't know which ones were supposed to be Minor or Main characters or just background ones in most of the first half.\\n\\n\r\nAnother problem was the likeability of the main characters in most of the FIRST HALF, Shu just sit's around most of the time, being a indecisive, annoying loser. Gai was just emotionless (for the most part) and all Inori could do was use the power of singing(?), provide fan-service and dodge (she might of shot a gun once) but that's it.\\n\\n\r\nThough, (without spoiling anything) In the second half, the main characters had great development.\\n\\n\r\n= Enjoyment (7) =\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment levels really depend on how serious you take Guilty Crown, don't go into the series expecting a masterpiece because you will most definitely be disappointed and hating on it. Though if you are a simple person (no offence) and just like your anime with ton's of great looking action scenes and a little bit of everything rolled in one (even if the result is total mess) then you will obviously enjoy the series a lot more.  \\n\\n\r\n= Overall (7) = \\n\\n\r\nOverall, Guilty Crown is definitely not a masterpiece, though it does NOT deserve the crap reputation it gets, sure the story becomes screwed up beyond repair with the can of clich\u00e9's they sprung at you each episode and the character development doesn't really start until halfway through the series, what really matters at the end of the day is how much the viewer enjoys the anime, people will hate, like or love GC and that's their opinion just as this review gives my opinion, I don't really care about the 'helpful' or 'not helpful' clicks, as long as my review isn't buried so deep that it can't be of at least some help to the many users who are looking for a new anime to enjoy, and that's the whole point of reviews, to help people decide whether a anime would be to their liking or not.",

            "content": "Quite possibly the most soulless show to hit the anime industry in a long, long time, Guilty Crown is a true example of \"don't judge a book by its cover.\" Yes, this show by studio Production I.G. may in fact have some of the most impressive TV anime visuals ever, while also having a modestly good OST (Save that god awful OP by Supercell), but once one peels away these more superficial aspects and dives into the core of this production, there is nothing but a hollow shell.\r\nGuilty Crown is supposed to be about Japan in a semi-futuristic setting after some sort of viral pandemicthat is currently being occupied by foreign powers and how some terrorist organization called the Undertakers is trying to stand up for all the injustices taking place in the country behind the eyes of its citizens. Our main character Shu is some random high school boy who is obsessed with some singer from a band named Inori, who just so happens to be a member of this terrorist organization, and after a chance meeting with her among other things, he obtains something called the King's Power and becomes involved in some chaotic conflict with these terrorists.\\n\\n\r\nIt is quite easy coming into this show to be misled into thinking that there is some sort of plot that one would find thrilling, interesting, and emotionally involving. The longer one watches this show though, it becomes quite apparent that it is none of these things. The plot while seemingly complex on the outside, is actually extremely simple minded. The conflicts of the show range from the absurd to the more absurd. Worst of all, the characters of this  show are either extremely boring or extremely annoying.\\n\\n\r\nThere are a myriad of issues that have gave rise to these failures during the course of this show, and they're easy to name, but most of all I would have to say that they mostly stem from the terrible cast. \\n\\n\r\nThe main character Shu is especially annoying in this cast. His motivations in the story are ill-explained, his internal conflicts are not given nearly enough exposition for the audience to understand him, and several times throughout the story he treads the line of coming off as little better than an ass hole. At times he is angsting to the audience about not going rambo on some military police, and at other times he is complaining when he discovers that the female gender actually does possess the concept of individualism. I'm not a person who hates angst, or characters that are flawed, or what have you, but this show has done everything possible to make sure that the main character is not only incomprehensible, but also someone extremely revolting. I'm not sure if it was intentional by the writers though, because I can't see a reason to portray one's own main protagonist in such a negative way, especially when at times he comes off incredibly chauvinistic. \\n\\n\r\nStill, Shu is not the only offender here. The female lead Inori comes from a long list of poorly conceived dandere archetype characters in anime (Silent girls who emote very little basically). There is no established reason for the audience to care about her, especially considering that there is no reason to believe she even has a pulse. In a way she is just a doll, a mere object that is supposed to stand there and look pretty. It is hard to believe she is even a main character considering that one has to concentrate really hard to even realize she's there.\\n\\n\r\nThe terrorist leader Gai is supposed to be some sort of badass, but everything he does just makes his character look really stupid. He does not seem to care about the future of his terrorist organization at all considering he enjoys engaging in extremely dangerous stunts over and over again without any concern for his or his organization's safety. Perhaps this type of character would fit better in some sort of shonen action show, but considering how seriously this story takes itself, one can't help but feel that everything he does is way too over the top. This person apparently can take down giant mechas by himself, dodge near nuclear scale explosions standing still, and charm any girl he wants just because he can.  It is especially overbearing for the show to really try to make you think he's really cool.\\n\\n\r\nThe worst side of the cast is definitely the villains though. Any subtlety in storytelling that one might expect form this sort of show is tossed out the window as this setting is divided into white, black, and more black. Some of the villains are downright insane. The overall seriousness of the show takes a huge hit as a result. It is hard to take a plot seriously when you have bulging eye crazy villains beating up poor women in the slums. To top it all off there is a very prevalent xenophobic attitude in the show, which can be seen in all these villains, but especially the one named Dan who is some big shot evil American dude apparently. This sort of attitude is definitely not helpful for Japan, and is not very flattering to have your show perceived as being a bit racist in portrayal.\\n\\n\r\nMore or less the rest of the cast is of the same poorly written shtick. They're  extremely cliche and archetypal, which leads most of them to either being boring or annoying because the story does nothing to make the character feel like they have life or feeling. There's nothing relateable about them, nor is there anything about them that the audience can use to see that they are just more than their character archetype. In the end the characters come off as a sign of extremely lazy writing in the show, or a desire of the creators to pander to every audience imaginable in an attempt to grab as much cash possible, or perhaps both. Frankly, it just makes for a very nauseating experience.\\n\\n\r\nMore generally, even beyond the characters, the show just doesn't have anything compelling going for it. The plot has this weird dichotomy where it is wanting to be taken as seriously, but at the same time does everything in the most over the top manner that can't help but make one roll their eyes over each scene. A show that uses the rule of cool effectively isn't bad, there's been plenty of examples of anime in the past that have done this, but because of this weird dichotomy, the attempts to employ it here just fall severely flat. Perhaps again it is the fault of this cast, but it is also this incredible misuse of the setting for this story. I think placing this story in a much more fictionalized world would have helped it tremendously for one thing. Still, every episode seeks to top itself, no matter how ridiculous it is getting, and it is hard to believe that this should be a good thing for a show of this kind.\\n\\n\r\nThe plot also has very distracting elements at play, in particular, very poorly used and unsubtle fanservice. Several times throughout the show, even in the serious action scenes, the audience has to bear witness to blatant fanservice that comes off enormously tasteless. Things from females butt tapping computer screens in body suits, to boobs swaying in a very sexualized manner after physical violence, are just very distracting to a show's enjoyment when the show does not seem to be about this kind of senseless fanservice. It again just feels like a money garb in this show to pander to a certain kind of audience in this show in a very disgusting manner. The worst and most blatant example of it is Inori's outfit that shows so much skin that it ends up just looking hilariously stupid rather than hot and appealing. Honestly everything portraying the females in this show just seems extremely sexist. The female characters feel little better than sex dolls.\\n\\n\r\nWithout making this too long winded, I think I can safely say that Guilty Crown is an amalgamation of all the worst aspects of modern anime industry. This is the type of show that reminds me of why I went away from American TV shows in the first place and it makes me very sad to see the same sort of attitude being placed into anime. For a Production IG show, this is an incredibly disappointing affair.\\n\\n",

            "content": "**SPOILER FREE REVIEW**\r\n...What the hell did I just watch? Th-This can't be right. There is absolutely no way that the stinking pile of garbage I just somehow managed to sit through can be the ultra-hyped, widely beloved anime I've been hearing about. Guilty Crown has single handedly made me lose my faith in the anime community's ability to know what is good and what isn't. To say that this series is overrated would be a massive understatement. The only thing I could do while watching it was scratch my head and wonder why the hell this show is so popular. Sure the animation is fluentand the soundtrack is great, but that is NO excuse for the absolutely, disgracefully, humiliatingly bad writing that takes place in this anime. I've never seen a show with such an uncountable amount of plotholes and such worthless, pathetic, uninteresting characters. If you fed your dog some spoiled Mexican food and waited about an hour, the resulting pile of repulsive excrement would be reminiscent of Guilty Crown's script, and no amount of production value can change that fact.\\n\\n\r\nPlot: 1/10\\n\r\nSynopsis: In the year 2029, a virus known as the apocalypse virus outbreaks on a day that became known as \"Lost Christmas\" (Don't ask me why it's called the \"apocalypse\" virus, because the world clearly did not end. In fact, it seems to have barely effected society at all, but I digress...). The story takes place in the year 2039, ten years later, and stars a self-loathing little crybaby named Shu, but more on him later. Through coincidence, Shu gains the ability to pull \"voids\" out of other people. I won't explain what voids are, but basically its the story of a high school student who gets special powers. Shu then becomes involved with terrorist group called Funeral Parlor who are plotting to bring down the government.\\n\\n\r\nThis might be the worst plot in any TV show I've ever seen. Not just anime, but ANY TV show. That's how terrible it is. It had an intriguing (yet unoriginal) premise, but you know what doomed it? Plotholes. Plotholes plotholes plotholes plotholes plotholes plotholes plotholes. Guilty Crown's plot has more holes then a damn Swiss cheese factory, and it UNBEARABLE to watch! They just throw shit at the wall to see what sticks (Hint: Nothing sticks)! They contradict themselves on numerous occasions, rely on ridiculously and unacceptably over-convenient plot elements, and they never explain key plot events that are essential to grasping the story-line! I can't elaborate without spoilers, but if you are a competent human being with a functioning brain, overlooking these gaping plotholes is unfathomable, and it's all capped off with the absolute WORST written romance I've ever had the misfortune of sitting though. More on that later. \\n\\n\r\nOh, and I haven't mentioned the abysmal pacing yet, have I? The first half of the anime is the same thing every single damn episode; Shu and his terrorist group go on a mission, Shu uses his super-special powers, Shu has romantic troubles, Shu feels sorry for himself, rinse and repeat. Nothing happens. The second half is the opposite: a shit-ton of ridiculousness is all crammed into a few episodes with out ever slowing down or taking to time to explain what the hell is going on. Sure, they explain some of the things that happened in the first half, but nothing about what is currently happening! The pacing is just another aspect of the horrible writing of the show.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8/10\\n\r\nGuilty Crown has great, fluent animation, but doesn't live up to it's full potential. The action scenes are all very generic and refuse to even attempt to do something new or different, which is a disappointment. Still, great animation.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9/10\\n\r\nDefinitely the highlight of the anime; in fact, this is one of my all time favorite soundtracks in anime history. Good thing too, because I might have gone insane otherwise. The first opening kicks ass and I was pissed when they subbed it out for a 2nd opening that wasn't half as good midway through, but the 1st opening is really the only thing that kept me watching the anime through the boring and repetitive first half of the show. The endings and OSTs are also absolutely killer.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 2/10\\n\r\nThere is not a single consistent character to be found in Guilty Crown. Every major character is a jumbled mess of traits and emotions that don't even go together. They are all completely incoherent.\\n\\n\r\nIf you took every stereotype of a main character and tried to combine all of them into one, the disaster that would result would be named Shu; the protagonist of Guilty Crown. Where do I even begin with him? The entire first half of this anime consists of Shu crying like a little bitch about absolutely nothing. Seriously, there is nothing wrong with this guy's life. He gets special powers, an attractive girl starts living with him to protect him, and a group of rebels fighting for a noble cause takes him in and make him one of their own. But WAHHHHHH, wittle baby Shu can't get Inori to suck his dick after the first month that they've known each other, and WAHHHHHH, wittle Shu wishes he had even more friends than he does already! He is a self-loathing little wimp who cries about EVERYTHING for a solid 14 episodes, but then he undergoes a sudden change with no buildup whatsoever at that point. Suddenly, for the most stupid and overly convenient reasons imaginable, Shu is now a completely different character. Now, this is the part that just made me laugh uncontrollably: They try to turn Shu into a badass. They go way over the top and act like Shu is now the scariest, badest mother-fucker in the whole damn world, and it fails more miserably then you can imagine. The show tries to convince you that Shu is a selfless individual who has never cared about himself throughout the entire show; only others..... WHAT??? Remember the first half of the anime?? All he cared about was himself! He was the exact opposite of selfless! And now we have Inori falling in love with him because of how selfless he has been! Absolutely pathetic!\\n\\n\r\nOh, and that brings us to Inori; the love interest. Ohhhh boy. FUCK Inori. Besides the fact that they drop a huge bombshell about her toward the end that makes Shu and Inori's relationship COMPLETELY fucked up, that's not even mentioning how inept and inexcusable the execution of her character is. Inori has about as much personality as a ham sandwich. She is so insufferably boring that to say I never got emotionally invested in her is an understatement; I was rooting for her to die just so she would stop wasting so much damn screen time. But, occasionally, for no reason what so ever, she will take on traits that are convenient for the plot to advance. She's like a Ditto from Pokemon; she can can morph into whatever the hell you want her to. Inori is considered the postergirl of this series and fans of the show absolutely adore her. For the life of me, I can't figure out why! She might as well have been pair of singing, floating boobs, because this is one of the worst characters in anime history. Guilty Crown, I fucking hate you SO much for creating this monstrosity. Burn in anime hell for what you've done.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 3/10\\n\r\nIf ever there was a physical embodiment of everything wrong with the modern anime industry, including the willingness of its fans to eat up lazy and uninspired pieces of dog shit that are objectively terrible, Guilty Crown is that embodiment. Why the HELL do people like this show? Only the most naive children with 1-second long attention spans could possibly consider this to be a good plot with good characters. Everything about this anime that is unrelated to music and animation is a complete joke. I cannot recommend watching Guilty Crown to anyone; it is not worth your time. In fact, take away the music and I would rather watch a 22 episode version of Mars of Destruction. Yes: it really is THAT bad. It's not the worst anime I've ever seen, but it might be my least favorite.",

            "content": "Cliches. What anime nowadays doesn't have cliched moments? In my opinion, using cliches isn't that bad. That is, when it's not overdone and poorly used.\r\nGuilty Crown is the perfect example of an interesting premise going wrong. It is a very formulatic show : following every damn cliches in anime history. It seems Production I.G tried really hard to make something revolutionary. It is revolutionary ; this anime completely changed my opinion of what a poorly written plot is. And not only the plot, the characters are mostly one-dimensional, and some of them bipolar.\r\nFirst of all, the story is just plain uninteresting. It's mostly a mash-upof every cliches the team behind the production could find. I mean, couldn't they come up with something more original than the usual \"boy meets girl who grants him power. (Actually, she carries the power, but it's pretty much the same thing.)\" And then, the main character, Shu, joins some resistance team to go against the government. This sounds fine and all, but we've never got to know the motive of the resistance group. Why did they go against the government? What was the point, exactly? Especially after the first half of the show, it seems like the resistance group thing was dropped because I.G ran out of ideas and tried to take another direction. Now, we're presented with some episode trying to be overly symbolic a la Neon Genesis Evangelion, but it failed epicly. Not only was the whole thing pulled out of nowhere, it transitioned to the worst part of the story. Let me remind you, the beginning of the anime was about a corrupt government abusing their powers; a problem on a national scale. In the second half, it's about a school (with no teachers apparently) in crisis, trying to escape the zone they're isolated in, or they'll die. It's hard to take a show seriously when it takes another direction that is completely different, in a bad way. Overall, the story did not satisfy me, and I really doubt the remaining episodes will do Guilty Crown justice.\\n\\n\r\nI find it very ironic that some episodes are rushed, yet I.G still managed to pull off a BEACH episode in a supposedly \"serious\" plot. Atleast perverts got what they wanted.\\n\\n\r\nNow, let's talk about the so called \"void\" power Shu has. The power itself is very interesting, I mean, extracting weapons and tools out of a person's body, and the tool/weapon representing their personality, who thought of that? The problem is that the power is FILLED with inconsistencies. Let me begin with how the power is convenient, up until the second half of the anime, every tool/weapon Shu would draw in a difficult situation would be JUST THE RIGHT THING to deal with it. Every time Shu would draw out a void, it could be convenient for the situation and would get him out of that difficult situation easily. That is the perfect example of what a deus ex machina is, used in a bad way. Of course, Gai has the power to see people's void. How did he get that power? No one knows. It just sounds like a convenient excuse used as a plot device because the writers have no idea how to make a progress a plot correctly. The second inconsistency is people fainting from void extraction. Basically, when a void is extracted out of a person's body, they faint out of \"shock\". Now for the inconsistency, sometimes people faint, sometimes they don't. There is NO explanation as to why they sometimes do and don't. I heard some people claim that when Shu held someone's hand while having their void extracted, it would prevent them from fainting, but I do remember times where he held their hand and they fainted anyway. It seems like the power wasn't explained because what if the writers run out of ideas again? They'd probably add another unforeshadowed element to voids and we, as watchers, will be forced to accept it.\\n\\n\r\nAlso, why the fuck can Shu only extract voids from people under 17 years old?\\n\\n\r\nTo go back to the one-dimensional characters, I believe Shu and Inori are the WORST PROTAGONISTS to EVER exist. To this day, I still laugh at the interview where I.G claimed that they wanted Shu to be the new Shinji Ikari.\\n\\n\r\nHahahahahahahahahahaha.... Are you fucking kidding me? Shu is just your average pussy character that doesn't want to hurt people, even though they are killing without remorse and hesitation. I.G tried to make a character full of flaws with no real strength. They succeeded, but no way in hell is that close to be a realistic character. It's not that he doesn't want to hurt people, he's just scared. What a lame protagonist, right? Never once does he really change, his personality is and always be that of the average useless main character. And in the second half of the show, his personality takes a sudden 180. I'm sorry, I.G, but people don't instantly change like that, this character is a complete joke.\\n\\n\r\nInori, on the other hand, has no personality. Or too many. She behaves in a different way in every episode, it's really strange. At first, she completely depends on Gai, but suddenly decides to switch to Shu. I don't understand exactly why she's so dependent on people, since we've almost never seen her take a decision herself.\\n\\n\r\nI won't continue talking about characters because honestly... I have no clue about them and their motives or whatever. Especially the \"villains\".\\n\\n\r\nI.G can be praised for two things about Guilty Crown. First the animation and art, done by Redjuice, are excellent. The animation is realistic, with a somewhat dark mood attached to it. In my opinion, it's pretty solid, very fluid, I don't remember seeing many repeated frames, and animation quality was consistent in every episode. Still, the style itself is pretty generic and isn't memorable. Same thing applies to the background animation. The details are amazing, I.G really did put a lot of work into the animation. (I wish they had done the same thing with the story.) Personally, I really liked the metal-like effect when a void is being extracted. It's pretty cool.\\n\\n\r\nMusic is quite good. I personaly really like the second opening by EGOIST, which is essentially supercell. The animation of the opening sequences are well done, although the moments in the anime don't really seem to happen in the story. The background music is also very fitting and helps deliver the mood of the show.\\n\\n\r\nIn the end, do I enjoy Guilty Crown? Yes. Guilty Crown is a very enjoyable anime, there are a lot of action scenes, animation is amazing and so is the music. Story is still terrible though.",

            "content": "I began watching Guilty Crown on a whim. It was a pure coincidence. If I had anything else to do that day, I probably would never have started watching. However, it just so happened that I was bored out of my mind and at the bottom of my current \"to watch\" list. When I saw Guilty Crown peeking out at me from another member's favorite anime list, I couldn't resist the temptation. Reading the synopsis turned me off. It didn't seem very promising. \"Boy has power in his right hand that makes him special.\" Okay... cool? \r\nSo I started reading the reviews. They were horrendouslymixed, ranging from three to nine with very little middle ground. Well, the positive reviews piqued my curiosity. The negative reviews seemed rather confrontational and angry, as if the show had somehow personally wronged the writers. They railed and ragged on clich\u00e9s, flat characters, and brought up similarities to other shows. \\n\\n\r\nBeing immensely bored and slightly curious, I couldn't help but make Guilty Crown a guilty pleasure. I'll admit that the story takes a while to warm up. The first episode was incredibly clich\u00e9, with the generic \"boy meets girl; boy becomes superman; boy is involved with terrorists\" story going on up until the end. But it diverged. The character (of his own volition) refused to acknowledge his power and left me wondering what could possibly happen next.\\n\\n\r\nIndeed, what could this story be about if the main character refused to join up with what I had assumed to be the protagonist group? Well, Inori happened. Now, I've seen people complain endless about her. She's essentially Ein with pink hair, a lovely singing voice, and a sword in her chest--right?\\n\\n\r\nSure, if you watch the first six episodes or so. Once you get past the initial \"OMG SHE'S SO ,\" you'll start seeing how she grows. She's a parasitic character. That is what makes her, well, her. She simply cannot function without a strong character to depend on. I don't see how that makes her unrealistic? There are people like that in this world. The only hiccup is the justification. She's weak because she's a blank slate. Okay, maybe that is a little clich\u00e9. Does it make the character terrible? No... if she didn't grow at all, then yeah, it would be clich\u00e9. Instead, facets of her personality are revealed throughout the show, including the afore mentioned shaky justification. \\n\\n\r\nI'm surprised people don't talk about Gai. He's a sixteen year old who leads a terrorist group, who is a better killer than trained soldiers, a genius tactician, and has the ability to see Voids (which is all too convenient since the main character has the power to extract these Voids). There isn't anything realistic about him for quite some time. He is my least favorite character of the series. He \"grows\" the most, if you can call it that, but his character itself is subjugated to Shu's growth. \\n\\n\r\nWhile I'm addressing things that were detrimental to my enjoyment, I'll mention that there were a few inconsistencies as far as Voids are concerned, and a certain character that is built up as being incredibly important with a pretty serious power who is completely ignored in the second half of the show. Actually, if I recall correctly, he stops making an appearance before the plot changing event even occurs. I'm not particularly put-out with his exclusion, but a little explanation would be nice.\\n\\n\r\nAs for other inconsistencies, the Void regulations are pretty flighty. The whole \"person must be under seventeen\" rule is pretty laudable, and the Voids themselves don't seem to be very relevant to a person's heart except in a select few cases--which, if I might add, is downplayed afterwards. You have a character whose Void seems pretty useful, put to heavy use for support purposes, but then you find out that his power is actually among the weakest of the bunch. \\n\\n\r\nHowever, I can overlook these inconsistencies. I can overlook some questionable plot devices. I can overlook quite a bit as far as this show is concerned. Why? To put it simply, the show is beautiful. The art is magnificent, and the sound wonderful. Everything is so fluid and Inori is just stunning. Couple that amazing art with a clich\u00e9 story that becomes progressively darker, and I simply cannot help but enjoy it. \\n\\n\r\nI'm not going to lie; there are plenty of areas that could have been handled better. The second half of the show, while my favorite in terms of mood, felt rushed at times. The first half annoyed me with its developments. The character's choices were predictable at times. But, even though we could predict them, it was because of the way the story was told. (I'll refer to everything revolving around Hare. Did we see that coming? Yes. Does that make it clich\u00e9? A little. Does that mean it wasn't realistic or handled well? I'd beg to differ. I felt that the changes in mood that resulted were worth giving in to a few minor clich\u00e9s to attain.)\\n\\n\r\nThis is a show you're either going to love or hate. You will either latch on to the little things, or you'll take the bigger picture into mind and just enjoy it as it comes. I personally enjoyed every second of the show and would re-watch if I had the time. Some people may draw parallels to Code Geass, but I don't see them unless I specifically look for similarities. Even then, the ones I see are just general clich\u00e9s rather than pieces drawn from the show. Some people may complain about the fanservice. I guess they'd be referring to Inori, or Ayase in her flight suit. To be honest, I didn't see any of that as fanservice. It's debatable, and heavily reliant on taste.\\n\\n\r\nThis show is not a master piece. It's good, yes, but isn't particularly insightful or groundbreaking. It's eye candy, and interesting enough to spend a few days over. I'll be sad to see it end, but it lacks that certain force other shows have.",

            "content": "The first few episodes had some problems, but nothing unforgivable, and the show actually seemed really awesome at first. There was so much they could do in the world they had set up.\r\nWould the main character become a cunning LeLouche? Perhaps a brave Suzaku? Will we identify with his teen angst like we do with Shinji? Will he seem human?\r\nThe answer to all of these questions ends up being \"no.\" The main character is someone you increasingly dislike as the show goes on.\r\nNot only is he generic, he's a bad execution of the generic shonen protagonist. He doesn't feel very human, and his courage &competency literally manifest only as required by the plot, only to disappear immediately afterwards.\\n\\n\r\nSadly, despite an A-list team and a huge budget they really just made an unbelievably bad series. I can't understand how this could have happened. Even mediocre garbage like Symphogear told a more emotional story, and that show was butchered by a huge budget-cut (and a much worse premise, honestly).\\n\\n\r\nFairly early on you start feeling a sense of disappointment as they layer on extremely generic \"twists\" that the main character literally cuts through with a magic sword.\\n\\n\r\nThe worst part of this show rears its head mid-way through, but it becomes especially prominent in the second half. I am referring to the fact that people change sides without ANY reason to do so, only to change back later without any serious reasons for their actions. The worst example of this by far is the student council president.\\n\\n\r\nIt's my guess that the flailing writers looked for any opportunity to inject some kind of pathos into a story that is honestly much to happy for its apocalyptic setting. \"Why don't we have his mom help the bad guys for a while?\" \"Oh yeah! Awesome! The audience will be shocked!\"\\n\\n\r\nSo many of these twists end up half-baked. Mana's character is a particularly strange creation, honestly. Who came up with the idea to add in all the (barely avoided) creepy incest and rape to a show that is already struggling to tell a convincing story about geopolitics? Not to mention the plague that turns people into crystals. Not to mention the terrorist v.s. government war. Not to mention the other sub-plots that get forgotten until the last episode clumsily ties everything together with a big \"reset\" button after a boring \"final battle\" influenced by strange forces never explained.\\n\\n\r\nNot only does an abundance of cheese-ball dialogue ruin the mood on the few truly dramatic scenes, but the writers lacked the balls to really hit us with anything big. The audience never feels much when people die, because the people that die are almost exclusively fodder.\\n\\n\r\nThere was one exception to this, but it felt really artificial. It was a terrible 3-episode mini-arc where the main character ends up killing the sibling of his friend, but special circumstances removed all the moral questions in this case. Why not make your main character kill a friend who wasn't already about to die? It worked in Evangelion. Twice in-fact.\\n\\n\r\nEven the action - which should be the one area this show simply cannot fail on - is often really simplistic and boring. If you compare the knightmare suits duels from Geass to the mech battles here, it's just pathetic. Not that these battles ever end up mattering, since the entire show is setup to allow the main character to save everyone repeatedly.\\n\\n\r\nIf they had just stopped trying to layer on really shallow twists and developed the core Japan v.s. The World narrative a little more, putting Shu in a moral dilemma regarding Gai's ultimate actions, and dropped the character Mana entirely then this would have been a much better story.\\n\\n\r\nWatch it for yourself. Maybe with low expectations you will enjoy it as a \"pretty mess\" as some have suggested. As for me, I can't see myself ever recommending it to anyone after this post. It's a cautionary tale for writers, perhaps, but beyond that it has little value.\\n\\n\r\nWe all weep for the show that COULD have been. What a waste.\\n",

            "content": "When I saw Guilty Crown on the preview list with the synopsis and the production team, I thought this was it. I thought that this would be an anime that would save the industry. Guess what? I was right. After all if you cannot be a good example, then you will just have to be a terrible warning. \r\n  Lets get to the good points. Art. It is Production I.G we are talking about here. Even the haters have to agree that the art is amazing. The animations were fluid and detailed. The character designs are appealing as well. The only problemis the uninteresting mecha designs though lets be honest, there are only a few ways that you can draw a giant robot. It is obvious that they spent a large part of their budget in this department. The music is beautiful too except for some engrish and the fact that sometimes the music does not really match the mood of a particular scene.\\n\\n\r\n  Oh boy, it is time for the bad stuff; namely the plot. Now I am not going to say that the premises is a copy of Code Geass or anything like that because there is no problem exploring a concept that has been done before. It does become a problem, however, when a previously explored concept is horribly executed. The writers wants you to take the show seriously but it is especially hard to do that when hardly anything follows logic along with the lack of consistency and cohesion of the story. To me it just seemed like the authors all got together and wrote 50 plot progressions and added them into a box. Before every episode they draw one out of the box and say \"this is what today's episode is going to be about\". This sort of progression leaves little to no explanation nor even any information for the viewer to infer what is happening. Surprisingly the producers think they have enough time to produce a beach episode which again makes me unable to take this show seriously. \\n\\n\r\n  The character is another aspect of this anime that made it not enjoyable for me. None of the protagonists' nor the antagonists' motives are explored other than the generic good guys versus the bad guys black and white conflict. The bad guys kill people and the good guys are the heroes of justice oppressed and hunted down by the bad guys. With the inconsistencies of personalities and sudden illogical character \"development\", it is hard to even give a damn about the characters. The special ability of the protagonist is basically a Deus ex machina used for plot convenience. Coupled with several layers of plot armour that protects the protagonists just makes the characters that much more uninteresting. \\n\\n\r\n  With the huge budget, superb production team, and the so called golden time slot given to this show, it pains me physically to see it become the train wreck that is Guilty Crown. Perhaps through a modicum of sadism that exists in every human being, I decided to savor every aspect of its shortcoming by finishing the show; despite all the crap that was thrown at me since episode 3. All in all it seemed to me that 80% of the budget was spent on art and music and a janitor was hired to write the plot. The flashy action scenes and music basically carried this show. At the end of the day I just cannot decide whether or not this is an anime or just a new form of advertisement for promoting Supercell's songs.\\n\\n",

            "content": "Guilty Crown belongs to what could possibly be the most frustrating of shows: ones which are well produced but poorly executed. Sharp visuals and a strong soundtrack are always a plus. However, they don't compensate for haphazard writing and overly hammy direction. Guilty Crown suffers from both of these.\r\nThe story takes place in a post-apocalyptic Japan, that is ridden with a deadly disease after a catastrophe called Lost Christmas. The nation has been taken over by militarists in order to supposedly prevent the spread of the disease. Shu is a normal high school student, going about his life adhering to the status quo. That isuntil gets involved with Inori, the lead singer of the music sensation Egotist, and member of the resistance group Funeral Parlor. Shu then finds himself in the middle of the action, gaining the power to draw items called 'voids' from the hearts of other people. All he wants is to get back to his normal life, but circumstances keep pushing him back into the conflict, which goes deeper than he ever imagined; holding the fate of the human species in the balance.\\n\\n\r\nNow, admittedly the premise sounds pretty intriguing , and could have actually made for something pretty compelling... that is if the writing was any good. Unfortunately, it is not. It is bad. It is really bad. The plot is just overflowing with silly cliches. Whether it be the action-pack conflict or Shu's mundane school life, the plot consists of retreaded and uninspired material; to the point of being laughably obnoxious. When it is not wallowing in cliches, the story takes some ridiculous and downright asinine twists. It is as if the writers didn't know where they wanted the story to go, and were pulling ideas out of their butts as the story went on. Sure, there are somethings that are foreshadowed and some characters whose roles don't become clear until far into the story; but honestly the reasoning behind them is just so flimsy and often make minimal sense, if any at all. This all leads up to an ending which is completely unsatisfying, even for those who enjoyed the show.\\n\\n\r\nThe cast for this show is just as unorganized as the plotting. Shu isn't exactly a terrible lead, he is just exceedingly bland. All that could really be said about him is that he has a kind heart and struggles under pressure, because he spends majority of the show looking like a sad wet puppy following the ideas of everyone but himself. Now, it is clear that the creators meant him to change from this wimpy kid into a mature young man, which would have been perfectly fine if his character development wasn't so forced that it feels hollow and insincere. The rest of the cast is no better, if anything they are far worse. Leading lady Inori has next to no personality at all. Besides her striking look, she is hopelessly dull; nothing more than a glorified plot devise. That the show is intent on forcing viewers to sympathize with her helps nothing. Funeral Parlor leader Gai likewise has inconsistent characterization. This is especially true for the latter half, where his motives are largely unclear at first; then become utterly contrived in an attempt to make his actions sympathetic at the series end. The other characters are barely worth mentioning and all into simple archetypes such as the fiery Ayase, spunky Tsugumi, psychotic Daryl, etc. This over-sized cast eats up eats up the running time, while providing little in way of substance.\\n\\n\r\nDirector Araki Tetsurou previously did good work with the wickedly exhilarating Death Note and stupidly fun Highschool of the Dead, and manages to breathe at least some life into this dreck. If nothing else, the action sequences in Guilty Crown are energetic. There are some moments that will certainly get the adrenaline rushing and are very well animated. If only Tetsurou directed the shows dramatic moments as well as its action; he has always had a penchant for over-the-top drama, and that does not work in favor of this series. Often quite drama is the most effective and the most compelling; Guilty Crown doesn't understand this, its drama is constantly heavy-handed and overwrought. Moments that might have been interesting in theory are completely ruined because of how overblown the show is dramatically. It is as if the show decided to supplement plot and characterization by making this as dramatic as possible, it does not work.\\n\\n\r\nAs previously mentioned, the show is strong as far as visuals go. The landscapes alone look quite something to behold. The futuristic cities look fantastic, but also fittingly oppressive under the military rule. The otherworldly fields of crystals seen throughout the show are a dazzling sight, despite their rather ominous role in the plot. Likewise, character designs are striking and attractive; once again anime has brought us into a world occupied by gorgeous, or at least above average, looking people. Inori is particularly eye catching in her more often than not revealing outfits; as is the inexplicably cat-themed Tsugumi. The animation usually looks great, at times it is rough around the edges, but that is expected for a TV anime; and it comes in full force when it is time to show off. The music is, of course, also well produced and nice to listen to. Whether it actually fits is up in the air, as the soundtrack features a ridiculous number of insert songs. At times it can be very effective in setting the mood of a scene, but other times it sounds silly and feels out of place.\\n\\n\r\nIn the end, Guilty Crown is a big, loud, glossy mess. The show provides plenty of eye-candy and some nice tunes, but falls flat on its face where it really matters. The plot is wildly confused and constantly tripping over itself. The characters are poorly developed and largely irrelevant. Honestly, there isn't very many reasons to watch this. Sure, it is very pretty on the surface, but underneath the decadent facade it is completely empty.\\n",

            "content": "BEST COMEDY OF 2011-2012. 10/10.\r\nOh wait. This isn't a comedy?\r\nWell then. \r\nWhere do I even start with this mess, then?\r\nGuilty Crown seemed to promise to be one of the best series of the season when it first aired. Boy, was I wrong.\r\nThe writing in this show is an absolute mess and tends to try to just throw random plot devices at you in random intervals to try and surprise you. It is not particularly surprising, but it's a bit cute (cute as in, a child seems to be writing the show).\r\nThe characters are really awful. The writing staff seems to be trying their hardest tomake characters of a certain archetype, and to make characters stick to their archetype without fail. I'm not sure if they realize that character complexity is derived from the fact that people aren't simple enough to act only based on a single characteristic, or if they're just trying to create characters that might possibly mature. So far, it seems to be the former. \\n\\n\r\nThe show has many laughable situations. Take episode 6, for example. Fully armed guards, holding guns in their hands, charge at an enemy instead of shooting with their guns, resulting in a teenage girl killing them without returning a single shot. Hilarious, but I don't think that was really the intention.\\n\\n\r\nThat's not to say the show's completely awful. The art, animation, and music are really quite good, even if at times they cut a few corners. But really, a mess with art, animation, and music is still a mess.\\n\\n\r\nSo? The bottom line? Don't take this show seriously. You'll be able to enjoy it a lot more if you don't. Because... well... it's funny to ridicule at least.",

            "content": "*Updated*\r\nI take back what I said. This series  is a complete mess.\r\nRemember the first episode? Guy meets girl; evil government; le resistance; Deus Ex Machina (Gai); guy is thrown into battle; guy gets power from girl to fight giant-robots-from-nowhere - all done before, nothing new. And guess what? It GETS WORSE. Onwards from there, the build-up of episodes is just awfully underdeveloped. Towards the semi-finale, its revelations rushed past the audience like a train, or over the audience if you\u2019re trying to figure out what the whole first half was for. The GHQ? Virus? Terrorism? Shuu manning up? Yeah, alot of those issues arejust not important. Perhaps the proper title for this series is \u201cGuilty Crown: What the heck is this?\u201d I'm gonna directly quote critic M0rg0th here: \\n\\n\r\n           \"And it\u2019s strange because everyone (I\u2019m also guilty as charged) complained about the generic dullness of this show but surprisingly neither the script-writers nor the director realized that this show concerned itself far too much with stuff that isn\u2019t important.\"\\n\\n\r\nNow the characters... oh god, the characters are so bland it makes me want to scream. Perhaps the biggest mistake Guilty Crown has done until now is just one word: Shuu. Shu Ouma - 17 yrs old, and a bit of a wimp... or so I thought. Turns out he's the biggest, whiniest, and retarded douchebag in the entire series. We never get a good explanation on why he's doing what he does (other than some useless split-second flashbacks). Why was he chosen as the main focus of the story? Shuu is a weak character, not just in the way that he\u2019s bland and dull but also because he simply has no charisma; a poorly made plot-device. Not to mention it's his own damn fault that the city's in danger in the first place.\\n\r\nInori Yuzuriha - a completely dull female lead. Inori is a different character in EVERY EPISODE. Plus, her comments on \"love\" are nothing short of face-palm worthy. Nothing more than an stereotypical otaku's wet dream.\\n\r\nAyase Shinomiya - mech rider of the resistance who rides a wheelchair (accident maybe?). She's very modest and kind, and has feelings for Gai. But she also likes Shu?! Seriously?!\\n\r\nTsugumi - Genki-girl and fanservice. Who the heck is she and why is she there in the first place?\\n\r\nGai Tsutsugami - okay, he's a strong-willed, stern, conflicted but inspiring leader of the resistance. Initially cold to Shu, he accepts him in the end (which is a big mistake). AKA the best and most developed character in the series.\\n\\n\r\nOk, undeniably the art direction is this anime's strongest point. From the very beginning the animation is as expected from I.G Production - the transitions and movements of characters are smooth and realistic. Character models are rich with expression and personality, all differentiating in unique ways. The action and fight scenes are free-flowing and cinematic, rivalling that of many animated action movies. The backgrounds and environments are fully developed, blending a mix of futuristic and modern Japanese architecture, filled with vibrant shades and colours. Special effects are very pleasing to the eye.\\n\r\nMusic is of great importance in this series, as the music direction is lead by Ryo of Supercell, with Supercell themselves providing the opening, ending, and insert songs. The soundtrack ranges from bittersweet ballads to fast-paced rock-guitar riffs, and the random insert songs from time-to-time don't hurt either. One problem is that there are too many insert songs in one episode, so it can become somewhat of an annoyance. Voice acting, however, is top-notch work that doesn't really need explaining. Sound effects are what you'd expect from a sci-fi anime.\\n\\n\r\nBut you know what? None of that matters. Michael Bay is pretty much all of this. But how is it that the director of \"Code Geass\" and \"Death Note\" became so much worse? Someone, please tell me.  \\n\\n\r\nThe \"future\" is pretty much dead. The series excel in Art and Music, but fails spectacularly with an awfully undeveloped story. But perhaps I'm being too hard, and that things will pick up in the second half! But by then, it'll be too late to make much of an impact. We can't keep calling incompetence as brilliance.",

            "content": "Note: These are my opinions only. Everyone has different tastes, and thus, what I think is cheesy may not be cheesy to someone else. I try to judge the show based on technical mastery and evidence of being well-thought out, but in the end, a lot of it is still based on personal judgment. That's it.\r\nSo anyways, I first wanted to watch this anime because of its freaking epic art, and animation-wise, I was not disappointed. But almost everything else was, in the purest sense of the word, utter crap.\r\nTo be completely fair, though, GC isn't /that/ bad (a 5 is still a \"mediocre\"), butthe discrepancy between the expectations and the actual thing is so large that you can't help but feel disappointed. That probably accounts for at least 60% of the negative feeling towards the show.\\n\\n\r\nStory 4/10\\n\r\nGeneric plotline and obvious Code Geass rip-off, but that's not the bad part. I've seen plenty an anime that took a generic plotline and kicked ass with it, but Guilty Crown... no. For one thing, the gratuitous use of deus ex machinas and clich\u00e9d plot devices is annoying enough, but the plot also has to be jerky and abrupt. Also, the show shifts between cheesy comedy and fast-paced action with all the subtlety of a bipolar psychopath. Comedy is important for high-strung shows, but it has to be done /well/. And all of the (amazingly animated) kick-ass actions scenes are really mostly there to try to trick you into believing that there is decent plot development.\\n\r\nThere have been objections - and I quite agree - that the /overall/ plot of GC isn't that bad, but sadly, this is lost in the chaos of the individual episodes, which are done rather sloppily.\\n\\n\r\nArt 10/10\\n\r\nABSOLUTELY AMAZING. NO WORDS TO DESCRIBE IT. Every 2 minutes, there is pretty much at least one masterpiece scene. The background is never too detailed to be distracting, but neither is it plain. Overall, every scene is unified and clear, and yet there's still plenty of contrast. And all the angles! There's no such thing as messy rotation that makes a character's face look weird. The colors are beautiful - there are so many hues and values of each color. They're somehow soft and yet still vibrant, and no one's outfit is ever just \"red\" or \"blue.\" \u007fTons of attention and care are put into everything, down to the movement of each individual strand of hair. I mean, someone spent a LOT of money on this show; if only the plot and the characters could make the cut as well. But dang, this show is worth watching for the art all by itself.\\n\\n\r\nSound 9/10\\n\r\nThe music is really nice. The opening and ending as well as the inserts are all very well done, and they match the overall feel of the anime. The background music tends to be very well done as well, though occasionally they drop something a bit cheesy on you. Overall, though, the sound was done very professionally. I'm not really an sound-oriented person, though, so I can't elaborate much on that.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 2/10\\n\r\nTHIS IS THE PART THAT KILLED ME.\\n\r\nI'll admit that I rather like the concept of Shu. He's a normal person with flaws and doubts who wants to believe in his ideals, and that's a very powerful concept. But, like pretty much all of GC, it's a concept that's executed crappily.\\n\r\nFor one thing, someone really needs to tell the script writers that thing that English teachers always like to say: \"Show, not tell.\" This show likes to substitute cheesy narration for actual character development, and to cover it up, they just add in abrupt action scenes. Even without that, though, almost all the characters are flat and predictable. Everyone on the enemy side is appropriately sadistic, twisted, evil, etc. Everyone in Undertaker is appropriately badass/cute/energetic (and mysteriously young). I started watching GC because I saw an epic AMV with Daryl in it, and I was looking forward to him, but in the end he was just psychotic, and not in a good way.\\n\r\nAlso, they were trying to show the main character's growth, I believe, but it was done badly because they just kept trying to force actions and words on him without allowing time for transition. Admittedly, Guilty Crown may be one of the animes to suffer from the recent trend towards short animes, but then again, Madoka Magica handled a similar development ridiculously well, and it only had about half the number of episodes.\\n\r\nI'd say that the only exceptions to the crappy character development of Guilty Crown are Inori and Gai. Gai is probably the pivot around which the entire plot of GC rests (I'm just guessing here), and having the leader of your rebellion be a complete Gary Stu would be too predictable, so that's probably why he seems to have a rather dark side to him. Either way, his character development is still kind of jerky and abrupt, but at least it's a lot better than everyone else's, since it actually exists. Inori is also done well, most likely because she's so \"mysterious\" that there's not much to develop yet. But I rather like her.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 6/10\\n\r\nThe animation was AMAZING, and the sound was great, but sadly those two are really not nearly as important as story and character, and GC screwed up BADLY on both.\\n\r\nGC was also trying to go for the profound and philosophical and introspective type of thing, but it pretty much failed at that, too. Cheesy narrations are not thought-provoking, no matter how much they want them to be. The \"Void\" thing is more of an excuse to come up with cool weapons than a method of introspection, and since character development is crucial to the philosophical value of a story, all of the flat characters in GC really kill it. To be honest, I don't think the script writers of GC even thought about their philosophical theme when they wrote the story - they just threw in some generic themes and thought it would work.\\n\r\nLast but not least, GC has screwy logic. The substitute government is evil, but it's the one that got Japan through the virus. Undertaker is fighting for the people, but no one knows what the heck it's about. There are lots of paradoxes in the story, and if done well, they could have been mind-blowingly amazing, but they're not done well at all. They're just half-assed, and the result is that the show just doesn't make much sense when you think about it.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 5/10\\n\r\nSo, GC on episode 6 needs some SERIOUS improvement. It may or may not get better, but if it doesn't get better... Well, it really should. It's a ridiculously high-budget anime that didn't deliver the way it could have and should have. There was so much that could have been done better if it had been thought out properly, but GC decided to just slap together some clich\u00e9s and random action and call it an anime. It doesn't work that way.\\n\r\nI'd still recommend watching a couple of episodes, though. Just for the amazing art. :DDD I mean, the animators did their job. The script writers and whatnot just didn't.",

            "content": "One day some director decided to make an anime show where a regular teenage boy, who goes to school and gets super powers because of a serious event that happened (usually a girl appears which grants him that power). Soon after this anime was made, more similar shows kept being created. After a couple of years, Guilty Crown was made, and damn, it changed everything! No I'm just joking, it has nothing fking new in the anime industry. BUT, to everyone that thinks this is a copy of Code Geass, the only thing related between these 2 shows is \"Magic girl appears and gives powerto highschool boy @random\" or \"Boy finds girl and they go on a honeymoon together fighting baddies everywhere\" or this, which is practically the same thing \"Highschool boy +random people + magic powers = Bleach\", but who the fk cares, it's not like I'VE NEVER SEEN THIS TYPE OF STORY HURRDURRDURR ITZ PURRRRDDY ORIGINAL (Code Geass, Sacred Seven, C, Dantalian no Shoka, Bleach, Reborn, and MANY MORE SHOWS THAT ~TOTALLY~ DON'T HAVE THE SAME SHIT GOING ON!!)\\n\\n\r\nStory: Pretty much already explained this dumb story, and if you've seen many other anime shows you won't expect anything new. But midway through the show, the whole average shounen thing of \"one's loss of a loved one transforms or changes the main character into a mature leader\" is discarded. It was the ONE episode where I expected Shu to mature like Simon did in Gurren Lagann because it always happens like that in anime right? But I was wrong, oh so very very wrong. Overall I don't even know the point of this story. From the average \"Group of good guys vs bad guys\" it turns into something fucking crazy and far more stupider like this: \"Highschool kids in Japan get infected by some disease shit that turns people into a pink stone and breaks them apart. Main character Shu tries to become the King of the school (lol) because a friend died. He forces dictatorship onto everyone, who soon rebel against him. While that happens some weird government organization who securely closed the area around the infected highschool kids, soon kill them off, and suddenly plan to exterminate Japan. And with an added plus Gai (Shu's friend) is revived and turns against Shu\". As you can see this show starts out as an average pathetic shounen show, until the highschool lockdown begins where it changes dramatically. It's just so stupid. A \"government\" suddenly plans to exterminate Japan without a good reason? Who were the bad guys again? Why did the good guys wanna kill the bad guys? What are they trying to accomplish? \\n\\n\r\nTHEN IT HIT ME! This show is nothing. By that I mean it throws in random plot lines at random times trying to make it seem like it's something that has a unique and interesting story, of course all that would make the fanboys and fangirls go \"OHMAHGAWD! I DIDN'T SEE THAT COMING!\" They only say that because it shouldn't happen, the shitty show doesn't stay on the same FKING PLOT for the whole show. Just like Inori's personalities.\\n\\n\r\nArt: This is where GC goes right. The art is pretty good, though I don't care much since I'm more of the Story type guy. I do dislike Inori, main female character, because of what she wears 24/7. She barely wears anything at all. Like whatthefudge I don't find her to be \"smexy\" or \"cute\" at all in the first place, get her to wear some god damn clothes.\\n\\n\r\nSound: \"So everything that makes me whole\" TROLLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLMAO. i no spek ingles, plez u talk me in English. Other than that opening, sounds = decent.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: No one has their own unique personality. It's like everyone gets a lot of screen time but, nothing about their character traits are shown. \\n\\n\r\nInori: sucks, since she's clearly a robot from the future with a \"daily personality changer\" system programmed into her. Plus she's also Shu's sister.\\n\\n\r\nShu: is your typical failure w/ magic powers who soon becomes epic, in fights, not character, but soon due to death of a loved one he becomes Hitler for some time (aka wannabe Gai). \\n\\n\r\nGai: is the \"badass\" who owns everyone and does it with robotic Inori at night. He's so damn godly that once he dies, he comes back to life. \\n\\n\r\nMany other characters too but they juz backgrounds so who cares =D In total there is almost no character development for anyone, other than Shu of course, since he is the main character.\\n\r\n\"Noob is Evolving! ...dudududududududu!

And they do it little by little. Too bad that people never cared to look into it. \r\nArt \r\n9/10\r\nIt was wonderful in most episodes, but some were sloppy (e.g. ep 21). The character designs are great. By the way, there are very specific reasons why they made Inori wear those outfits other than the fan-service. \r\nSound\r\n9/10\r\nThe OP/ED's are real monster. What's more, they're perfect fits for GC. Departures is singing of the people who died from FP's struggle for freedom(though nominally it seems like a love song). TEGC is singing of hope, one of the bigger themes explored during the latter 11 episodes. EGOIST continues to release songs for other anime. These also often make references to the story of GC.\\n\r\nThe soundtracks are also nice, though now thinking back it doesn't feel so special compared to other recent anime (soundtracks are pretty big these days)\\n\\n\r\nCharacter\\n\r\n8/10\\n\r\nPretty amazing. Inori's personal growth occurs just about on every episode. \\n\r\nAs for Shu.. the story would've been meaningless had he not survived at the end. The whole point was that he would grow into a person who isn't so easily influenced by the thoughts of those around him, and killing him off would've denied that purpose. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment \\n\r\n10/10\\n\r\nYou know, this anime is like a hidden gem that you'd never discover unless you were a diligent miner..\\n\\n\r\nOverall \\n\r\n10/10\\n\r\nI think that people should've hated this show less and actually gave it a chance. And by giving a chance I actually mean to watch carefully for character/plot development rather than nit-picking.",

            "content": "Truly original anime concepts are rather hard to come by these days, for a variety of reasons. For one, simple formulaic concepts are much easier to produce and usually cater to a wider demographic. Reason two being that the anime industry is an incredibly fragile business in terms of profit, meaning that risks that should be taken, or unfortunately shafted in favor of simpler anime. However, there is one reason that stands out above all, a general lack in inspiration. Pouring in countless amounts of influences and concepts from highly acclaimed anime of the past in order to create something unique is common ground. However,anime such as Guilty Crown use these influences and concepts and jumbles them up into an incoherent mess of an anime, complete with extremely high production values to please the audience. \\n\\n\r\nGuilty Crown\u2019s influences seem to plague the anime more than enhance its concepts. Taking place in Tokyo 10 years after the \u201cLost Christmas\u201d incident, Guilty Crown seems to have taken some cues from Neon Genesis Evangelion in terms of its setting, leading to an obvious originality issue. An ordinary (yet obviously troubled) high school student named Shu Ouma eventually finds his way into a rebellion group named \u201cFuneral Parlor\u201d who seek to usurp the totalitarian government now running Japan, the GHQ. This story element was clearly influenced by Code Geass and even approaches copying it during certain scenes in the anime. Guilty Crown\u2019s influences make the anime much harder to take seriously, as the concepts the show adapts are from anime that did a much better job of executing these concepts. \\n\\n\r\nThe plot eschews any sense of realism, instead adding needless drama and more opportunities for dues ex machina, thus making the plot come off as contrived and nonsensical. The plot adapts more and more story elements as it goes along leading to many inconsistencies and plot holes without any coherent explanations for these changes. Sometimes, these changes suit the plot quite well and the anime benefits from a change in pace. However, one change in particular is absolutely jarring as the show takes a darker route in order to keep the suspense factor up, but it only comes off as laughable and unnecessary. Guilty Crown tries so hard to make the audience take it seriously, but the dialogue and scenarios come off as angst-ridden and over the top at times. Guilty Crown\u2019s plot and execution are too far off base for it to be taken as anything more than it is, making it a huge let-down despite occasional moments of clarity.\\n\\n\r\nGuilty Crown\u2019s characters suffer the same issues that the plot does. The leading and supporting characters are full of clich\u00e9s and elements from other anime and thus aren\u2019t compelling individuals. Protagonist Shu Ouma often comes off as angsty and annoying and goes through an erratic spell of character development that will only make the audience sympathize even less with him. \u201cFuneral Parlor\u201d member/idol singer/mysterious waif Inori suffers from an inherent lack of a personality, as well as a lack of character and motivation. \u201cFuneral Parlor\u201d leader Gai is basically an even more twisted Lelouch vi Britannia. The supporting characters are hardly worth mentioning as they are simply anime character archetypes. \\n\\n\r\nFortunately there are a few areas where Guilty Crown excels in, namely in its production. Guilty Crown deserves top honors in the production department, featuring fluid character animation, high-quality art designs, and a really good soundtrack to round out the package. All of these components add up to make a rather entertaining anime, despite its many flaws in the writing and character department. The opening sequences by supercell and Egoist respectively are well-done and were made with a grand production in both music and display. The ending sequences, performed by supercell, are similarly well produced anime ballads. In other words, Guilty Crown\u2019s production is amazing and they took much more time refining this aspect than in regards to storytelling and character development. \\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s actually rather sad that an anime with such good production values and potential falls flat on its face. Guilty Crown is essentially this tragedy personified, as it honestly could have been something so much more than it turned out to be. Lost in a mess of misapplied concepts and influences, Guilty Crown was truly a disappointment.\\n\\n\r\n6/10\\n",

Unfortunately, said people are the Japanese animu industry and they DO NOT care about us Westerners' opinions.\r\nI should've seen it, though: The pretty girl during the first scene, the pansy-ass self-insert nobody (who's good on computers, by the way) created for the mere sake of the nobodieswho watch this show, and the GODLY ANIMUTION.\\n\\n\r\nI'm not gonna talk about how GuiltCrown has the same staff as Code Geass; I didn't watch the latter and I think it's elitist bullcrap anyway.

            "content": "Note that this show isn't finished and I probably won't update this review for ages so my opinions might substantially change.\r\nAnyway, lets begin on a positive note:\r\nArt: Clearly the best part of the series so far. \r\nA lot of detail was put into the art, and it shows clearly with the backgrounds possibly being the most detailed you will ever see, the saturations of colours are amazing, etc. Don't really know how to describe this further so moving on.\r\nMusic: 'Out of place' is probably the correct term to use here. For example, the opening of the FIRST EPISODE had a really soft ballad over ahectic chase scene with giant robots/explosions. In the fight scenes the music is a little more appropriate but it is pushed further down the mix in order to hear more explosions, so it doesn't really create the 'get up, get pumped, fuck shit up' feeling in the viewer (or at least me) that it obviously intended to do. When the music attempts to create tension, the score sounds too orchestral and ends up failing at this.\\n\\n\r\nThe actual quality of the music itself is good, but I don't really like it. However your tastes in music might be way different to mine (listening to dubstep now) so you might end up liking it. Plenty of effort was put here as well, maybe too much in my opinion.\\n\\n\r\nPlot: Basically, a rebel organization named Funeral Parlour is fighting against the government for ?????? reasons while the government (GHQ) are apparently evil and oppressive for ?????? reason. As you can see, plot holes everywhere but I'll give this section the benefit of the doubt and hope it closes the plot holes at the end. \\n\\n\r\nThe 'void' thing was extremely awkwardly handled, but that might be me looking at the synopsis and expecting 'tools' to be undercover spy tools that the MC uses to go all vigilante on the evil plans of 'oppressive gov't', eg stealing weapons, canceling satellite launches, infecting giant robots with viruses, etc. Instead we get this generic action setup where only a few people actually have useful 'voids', so only a few people are important. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Oh boy\\n\r\nThe MC in this show is probably the most unengaging MC that the writers could have possibly put into this show, Which is a shame, because he has moments which have almost entirely convinced me that his entire body is made of a strange kind of plasma substance because this guy is so far completely unharmed after standing near a fire and being only a few metres away from explosions (ears don't even ring!), which probably convinced me that the MC should be a tiny bit more confident than he is (wallows in self pity most of the time when not fighting). \\n\\n\r\nThe other characters have potential, but character development seems extremely forced so far (\"I don't like you even though you saved my life twice! I must obey Gai!) - *facepalm* (\"I don't want to appear weak in from of them! They trust me completely\") - I cannot think of a situation where a leader would want to look weak, so the scene was pretty redundant.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: i was expecting more. Maybe it's my fault that I don't enjoy the series so far, but it isn't engaging my brain in anyway, despite \"cool 148 backup plans\".\\n\\n\r\nSee you guys when this ends!\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "This anime has gone downhill. I was being fooled by the pretty art from episode 1 and the fact that it was a Notamina series [they usually have potential].\r\nOk, so the graphics are nice. The ost...ok, but I hate all the songs Inori sings. They have no heart. And up until now I thought that the artist was bad, but after seeing episode 16 I'm starting to feel that maybe they lack heart on purpose?\r\nAnyway, spoilers might follow so if you haven't seen the anime till episode 16 you might want to skip the rest. Or rather, you can read this and skip the animeinstead, because I'm sure you won't want to watch it after you'll hear what I want to say.\\n\\n\r\nThis can somehow be split into 2 seasons. Season 1 are episode 1-12.\\n\r\nWe see how our main character is described as your typical shounen main protagonist. Starts as a wimp, but he has the \"ultimate power\" to draw out voids. Everything is rater predictable and slow peaced. He develops very slow and remains pretty week till the ending of the first season. This apply to the rest of the characters as well. Maybe except Gai and the president chick.\\n\r\nAnyway: they fight for freedom and in the end they save the world from the evil sister that was the one who crated this town to begin with. Confused? Just wait, it gets better... \\n\r\nIf things would have stopped here everyone would have just rated this show as average. An average shounen with a predictable plot and good art. We can dig it.\\n\r\nThen it comes season 2: episode 13-22.\\n\r\nI have seen only the first 4 episodes from this one [aka till ep. 16] but I can tell that this show is using the antihero in the most horrible way possible. \\n\r\nSo, let's start with the first 2 episodes. Everything seems to be going well, they are trying to get better after the war but they are still in quarantine after what happened in episode 12. Of course things will get shitty and the government decides to annihilate all the infected zone without letting any of the survivors out. And how do they do it? By shrinking the space they can go to from time to time. Now that's like applying torture to a group of people who know that they are going to die in the end. Why not just kill them from the start? That I did not understand, but it helped the anime develop into one hell of a \"full of shit\" anime. [please excuse my words...it's because of the frustration]\\n\r\nSo now they need to find a way to get out and not remain without supplies, but it seems that Shu is too kind and is not able to make the right decisions. So after one of the girls dies in a fight he becomes this super evil king that thinks he can save people by killing other people. [Death Note anyone?]\\n\r\nAnd then his mother,  in some sort of a lab, is resurrecting Gai for god knows what reason + she's working with the antibodies now. Plus Inori goes all berserk on the president girl and on some classmates and kills them with cold blood. I knew she was heartless, but that thing now made her no. 1 evil character in this show.\\n\r\nSo we have it like this: Shu [going all berserk in his own world; Death Note style], Inori [the ultimate expressionless assassin or something like that; God, her face annoys me!], the antibodies [evil from the start], Shu's mother [working for the antibodies], the head of the mafia going away after his granddaughter is killed.\\n\r\nIs it just me or is this show left with no main good characters? If you transform all your remaining heroes into anti-heroes who will it be left to fight the bad guys? At this point I'm not rotting for anyone anymore. I really hope they'll just throw a big atomic bomb over Japan and kill them all. [and I really hope no one misunderstands my post, I just want all of them dead except Ayase and the remaining sane people around there].\\n\r\nThere is a very small chance that this show can be saved, so I'm making my review now. If anything will change by the time I reach ep 22 I'll come and revise it.\\n",

The ability of the main character (which allows him to draw out \"Voids\" from people) is even named the \"king's power\" (I recall the Geass being referred to as \"the power of the kings\") and it even has mechas!. The story, from what I've gathered so far, is about your typical shounen main character who has aspecial ability fighting in a resistance movement (\"Undertaker\") against the government. I'm not going to say that having parallels to Code Geass is a bad thing, however, one can see that this isn't going to be a standout series of this season (unless some convoluted, Madoka-esque twist happens very soon) and is in all senses a generic series of average quality.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are fair - again, we have a somewhat generic cast. Shu, our main character who starts off as a \"wimp\" but in more recent episodes seems to have become more confident, Iniori, your typical quiet female who seems to have some connection with Shu and Gai, your typical anime badass who is the leader of Undertaker. None of them come off as particularly memorable characters, although it might be too early to make such a call.\\n\\n\r\nThe art however is exceptional, and I'd say it ranks among the top of this season. The characters look good and the animated sequences are usually fluid and appealing for the eyes. The sound is also quite good with the soundtrack being performed by supercell and all.\\n\\n\r\nAt the moment it is your average and rather generic anime. Unlike some other anime of this year, it isn't downright horrible or unwatchable in any sense and it is certainly a very visually stunning series, however, I ultimately don't think it's worthy of these 9 or 10 reviews it seems to be getting. If you really liked series like Code Geass then you should probably check this out and see whether or not you enjoy it. Otherwise, I wouldn't personally recommend it.\\n",

            "content": "Many people are aware of the financial problems faced by the anime industry, and one of the methods that studios have adopted over recent years to try to shore up their crumbling foundations is to adapt popular manga, games, and more recently, Western comics. This approach has become a tried and tested moneymaking endeavour for the majority of studios, but in many cases this is simply due the fact that the source material caters to the lowest common denominator - which usually means fanservice. Unfortunately, the relative success of these shows have allowed them to become the norm rather than the exception, and with thatcomes a number of problems.\\n\\n\r\nThe sad fact is that while it's okay to find inspiration from other sources, the industry has become so used to the adaptation that studios and writers find it difficult to produce work that could be considered \"original\". Instead, what passes for a unique story tends to be nothing more than a collection of concepts and ideas from other tales that are thrown together in the vain hope that people will rush to buy the end product because ... well, because someone tells them to.\\n\\n\r\nBut rather than dwelling on such things, let's take a look at Guilty Crown.\\n\\n\r\nSet in Tokyo in the year 2039, a decade has passed since a mysterious outbreak known as the \"Apocalypse Virus\" killed thousands of people and brought Japan to its knees - a disaster that would later be called \"Lost Christmas\". Since that time Japan has lost its independence, and has become a martial state governed by an international organisation known as GHQ. The story opens with a pink-haired girl and a small robot escaping from a futuristic-looking facility, but security forces injure and corner her until she falls off a bridge. The next morning is just like any other day for highschool student Ouma Shu, an awkward young man who is a fan of the pop-group Egoist, whose lead singer just happens to be a waif-like girl with pink hair.\\n\\n\r\nAnd then everything gets ... weird.\\n\\n\r\nGuilty Crown is a bit of an odd duck as it attempts to blend several disparate themes, but doesn't quite manage to finish the job. The plot has clearly been influenced by several popular franchises - which isn't necessarily a bad thing, but the execution is where the writers have let themselves down. The narrative is often disjointed, and many events in the storyline appear to have no logic behind them other than to put Shu through an emotional wringer. In addition to this, the writers appear to have taken a rather nonchalant approach to reasoning and rationale, one example of which is how GHQ's repeated massacres are never covered by any sort of media outlet. This seemingly lackadaisical attitude is apparent in several areas of the plot - which is littered with \"coincidences\" - and these cause the narrative to have a mechanical feeling. In many ways it's almost as if the story was nothing more than a collection of bits that would apparently appeal to the largest number of people.\\n\\n\r\nAside from the inclusion of numerous well-known aspects that have clearly been transplanted from other popular stories and the \"plot-by-numbers\" approach, Guilty Crown also suffers from the rather obvious idea that most adults are evil and only kids are able to save the world. That said, the series does have some good points, in particular the way it attempts to recreate a situation similar to that found in \"Lord of the Flies\" by putting all of the students in one place and imposing self-rule. There are other, similarly dark influences that add a veneer of maturity to proceedings, but sadly these aren't enough to support the inherent weaknesses in the narrative - the main one being the decision to make yet another school-based anime.\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of production quality, Guilty Crown is arguably up there with some of the better shows of recent years, but the sometimes stunning visuals and effects are tempered by a few issues that may initially appear to minor, but in actuality are representative of the mentality of the show's creators. It's obvious that a great deal of thought has gone into the background artwork and set designs, but the same isn't true of the characters. For the most part they look good, but the decision to feature highschool students places an immediate limitation that becomes obvious when one considers the variety of features and body shapes found amongst the adults.\\n\\n\r\nThe problem lies in the fact that the design of the younger roles includes an element of stereotype in order to impart a degree of familiarity - thereby making the show more accessible to people. It's an old marketing trick that has become a staple of the anime industry over the years, and while Guilty Crown has tried to be a little bit more subtle than most in its usage, one does have to question the logic behind Tsugumi. A cat-eared tsundere loli wearing what is effectively a plug suit (and a maid costume later on), only serves to highlight the thought processes of the show's creators.\\n\\n\r\nThankfully Production I.G. maintain their standards when it comes to the animation, and the series is littered with flowing, well choreographed action scenes. The characters are well-balanced in their movements, and a degree of care has been taken with those that are injured, disabled, or suffer from an affliction.\\n\\n\r\nLike many anime that run for over twenty episodes, Guilty Crown features two opening and ending sequences - each with an original track written by Supercell. The first OP is a rather dizzying blend of effects, character montages and action scenes while the song \"My Dearest\" - a suitably fast paced and dramatic pop song performed by Koeda - sets the tone for the series. \"The Everlasting Guilty Crown\" performed by the fictional band Egoist is the track of choice for the second opening sequence, but while the artwork and design ethic have clearly shifted to promote a bittersweet atmosphere, the actual content is much the same as that of the first OP.  Egoist also perform the melancholy ballad \"Departures ~Anata ni Okuru Ai no Uta~\" for the first ending sequence, which features Ouma Shu and Yuzuriha Inori walking away from each other against a backdrop of character art and effects. The second ED contains a mixture of video footage of landscape speeding by, scenes from the series and a few still images of the school environs that are \"projected\" onto a screen behind Inori and Shu as they decide to run - all while Koeda performs the rather upbeat rock song \"Kokuhaku\"\\n\\n\r\nWhich brings up one small issue.\\n\\n\r\nAlthough it's true that some thought has gone into the composition of the opening sequences and that they are very well choreographed, both also feature overt plot spoilers. Now this does happen in other anime, but in general there are efforts to avoid such things occurring - which doesn't appear to be the case with Guilty Crown.\\n\\n\r\nAside from that minor niggle, the high production standards are also reflected in the quality of the music and audio effects. Sawano Hiroyuki has taken care to ensure that the background pieces are varied and suitably dramatic where necessary. The wide range of sounds and noises are clear and distinct, and the audio/visual choreography shows just how much effort has been made to produce a show that looks and sounds great.\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately the same can't be said of the actual dialogue.\\n\\n\r\nNow while it's true that Guilty Crown features a range of characters and personality types, for some reason the decision was made to revert to old anime stereotypes and then write justifications into the storyline. The script is littered with monologues, diatribes, conversations and arguments that would grace any show where the \"hero\" has to lead his people to salvation whilst fighting against the enemy and his inner demons, forming a pseudo-harem along the way, and showing the world just how much of a tragic-yet-heroic figure he is. Thankfully the actors are more than capable, but no matter how good their skills are, prosaic and formulaic dialogue will always be just that.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the characters themselves, Ouma Shu is the kind of leading man who can be found in a number of other titles - quiet, reserved, doesn't have many friends, and a bit of a loser - and therein lies the problem. The writers have taken great pains to try to show him as a \"human\" more than anything else, but in their efforts to promote Shu as the tragic hero, they've ignored one of the most basic rules of characterisation.\\n\\n\r\nIn other words, Shu has no personality whatsoever - even at the end of the series when all his \"suffering\" is over.\\n\\n\r\nIt's this apparent inability to develop the characters in any meaningful way that makes them appear as nothing more than inane, and the lack of any real growth means that everyone pretty much ends the series having learned very little (aside from maybe Daryl). In addition to this there's an element of ridiculousness to the choice of characters, the prime example being Yuzuriha Inori (although Tsugumi does come a close second). One has to wonder what chemically induced delusion could have persuaded the show's creators that having the lead singer of a hugely popular band stealing from the enemy in the opening scenes while wearing her stage outfit was a good idea.\\n\\n\r\nApparently students can recognise her even though she's wearing a school uniform, but soldiers and officers of the military forces controlling Japan have no idea who she is since pink-haired girls wearing fluttery costumes are a dime a dozen in Japan.\\n\\n\r\nGuilty Crown is one of those anime that can only truly be enjoyed if you have never watched any of the titles that it takes its inspirations from - and that becomes a problem if one has watched, and enjoyed, most of them. The main issue is that there are several character types and plot elements that are better used in their original anime, so their inclusion here makes them stand out in less than flattering ways.\\n\\n\r\nThe real problem with Guilty Crown though, is the element of arrogance that is prevalent throughout the series, and this comes solely from the show's creators. The basic premise of Guilty Crown is perfectly fine, but everyone from the director and series composers to the producers have assumed that the \"anime-by-numbers\" approach that they have so clearly used here is enough to make a hit franchise. There appears to have been a major assumption that the audience will swallow the whole thing without automatically referencing other shows that they may have watched, and that's where everything begins to fall apart.\\n\\n\r\nStorytelling is, after all, an art form, and a good writer can captivate their audience without overtly referencing where there inspiration came from. Unfortunately the folks behind Guilty Crown appear to have forgotten this simple fact, and it leaves one with the sad realisation that this anime had the potential to be so much more than it is.",

            "content": "With the large amount of Guilty Crown reviews going around lately, It wouldn't be too hard to find a 'decent' review, right? well that's not the case at all, It seems that most of the reviews are either written by blind fan-boys/fan-girls or haters, 10's,9's,4's and 3's seem to be the popular choice of overall rating, though looking at Guilty Crown in a balance way, this anime definitely deserves a 7 and I'll explain why in the next couple of paragraphs which will you most likely will flick through.\r\n= Story (3) =\r\nIf you have been watching Guilty Crown or have seen some of the rantingson the forums, you would know that the story is filled with clich\u00e9's and awful execution (for the most part anyway), So I won't go that in-depth to the story, basically just think of it as a mecha-action-supernatural-apocalyptic-drama-comedy-Sci Fi-romance-school-fan service super show.\\n\\n\r\nIn other words, Shu (Shuu), your average 16-year-old guy living in a future version of Tokyo get's himself wrapped up in the activities of terrorist group defying the government called Funeral Parlour, he meets the leader Gai, find's out his favourite singer is a member of the group and that the government is corrupt blah blah blah\\n\\n\r\n= Art (10) = \\n\\n\r\nIf there's one thing that no one can complain about, I'd say it's the art. Every episode looks of cinematic quality and the character designs are well down as you'd expect from Production I.G and Redjuice (supercell). If there is one thing to fault about the art, I believe it's the design of the apocalypse virus, It just doesn't look like some deadly disease that someone would be afraid of, though that doesn't really matter.\\n\\n\r\n= Sound (9) =\\n\\n\r\nSound is also a great part of Guilty Crown, the insert music and the OST is brilliant, the first OP 'Euterpe' was only used in the first episode which was disappointing since the second OP which lasted for 11 episodes wasn't hardly as good. The best OP in my opinion and one of my favourite anime openings  is the third and last one 'The Everlasting Guilty Crown', It seriously made the other two seem like crap in comparison. \\n\\n\r\n= Character (7.5) =\\n\\n\r\n7.5? That's not even an score according to MAL is what you might say though that's really the only score I can give it, The characters and their developments weren't very good though they weren't just good either, sort of in-between. \\n\\n\r\nThe problem with the characters is that they introduced too many too fast, there wasn't really any-time to grow attached to them or even remember some of them at all. You didn't know which ones were supposed to be Minor or Main characters or just background ones in most of the first half.\\n\\n\r\nAnother problem was the likeability of the main characters in most of the FIRST HALF, Shu just sit's around most of the time, being a indecisive, annoying loser. Gai was just emotionless (for the most part) and all Inori could do was use the power of singing(?), provide fan-service and dodge (she might of shot a gun once) but that's it.\\n\\n\r\nThough, (without spoiling anything) In the second half, the main characters had great development.\\n\\n\r\n= Enjoyment (7) =\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment levels really depend on how serious you take Guilty Crown, don't go into the series expecting a masterpiece because you will most definitely be disappointed and hating on it. Though if you are a simple person (no offence) and just like your anime with ton's of great looking action scenes and a little bit of everything rolled in one (even if the result is total mess) then you will obviously enjoy the series a lot more.  \\n\\n\r\n= Overall (7) = \\n\\n\r\nOverall, Guilty Crown is definitely not a masterpiece, though it does NOT deserve the crap reputation it gets, sure the story becomes screwed up beyond repair with the can of clich\u00e9's they sprung at you each episode and the character development doesn't really start until halfway through the series, what really matters at the end of the day is how much the viewer enjoys the anime, people will hate, like or love GC and that's their opinion just as this review gives my opinion, I don't really care about the 'helpful' or 'not helpful' clicks, as long as my review isn't buried so deep that it can't be of at least some help to the many users who are looking for a new anime to enjoy, and that's the whole point of reviews, to help people decide whether a anime would be to their liking or not.",

            "content": "Quite possibly the most soulless show to hit the anime industry in a long, long time, Guilty Crown is a true example of \"don't judge a book by its cover.\" Yes, this show by studio Production I.G. may in fact have some of the most impressive TV anime visuals ever, while also having a modestly good OST (Save that god awful OP by Supercell), but once one peels away these more superficial aspects and dives into the core of this production, there is nothing but a hollow shell.\r\nGuilty Crown is supposed to be about Japan in a semi-futuristic setting after some sort of viral pandemicthat is currently being occupied by foreign powers and how some terrorist organization called the Undertakers is trying to stand up for all the injustices taking place in the country behind the eyes of its citizens. Our main character Shu is some random high school boy who is obsessed with some singer from a band named Inori, who just so happens to be a member of this terrorist organization, and after a chance meeting with her among other things, he obtains something called the King's Power and becomes involved in some chaotic conflict with these terrorists.\\n\\n\r\nIt is quite easy coming into this show to be misled into thinking that there is some sort of plot that one would find thrilling, interesting, and emotionally involving. The longer one watches this show though, it becomes quite apparent that it is none of these things. The plot while seemingly complex on the outside, is actually extremely simple minded. The conflicts of the show range from the absurd to the more absurd. Worst of all, the characters of this  show are either extremely boring or extremely annoying.\\n\\n\r\nThere are a myriad of issues that have gave rise to these failures during the course of this show, and they're easy to name, but most of all I would have to say that they mostly stem from the terrible cast. \\n\\n\r\nThe main character Shu is especially annoying in this cast. His motivations in the story are ill-explained, his internal conflicts are not given nearly enough exposition for the audience to understand him, and several times throughout the story he treads the line of coming off as little better than an ass hole. At times he is angsting to the audience about not going rambo on some military police, and at other times he is complaining when he discovers that the female gender actually does possess the concept of individualism. I'm not a person who hates angst, or characters that are flawed, or what have you, but this show has done everything possible to make sure that the main character is not only incomprehensible, but also someone extremely revolting. I'm not sure if it was intentional by the writers though, because I can't see a reason to portray one's own main protagonist in such a negative way, especially when at times he comes off incredibly chauvinistic. \\n\\n\r\nStill, Shu is not the only offender here. The female lead Inori comes from a long list of poorly conceived dandere archetype characters in anime (Silent girls who emote very little basically). There is no established reason for the audience to care about her, especially considering that there is no reason to believe she even has a pulse. In a way she is just a doll, a mere object that is supposed to stand there and look pretty. It is hard to believe she is even a main character considering that one has to concentrate really hard to even realize she's there.\\n\\n\r\nThe terrorist leader Gai is supposed to be some sort of badass, but everything he does just makes his character look really stupid. He does not seem to care about the future of his terrorist organization at all considering he enjoys engaging in extremely dangerous stunts over and over again without any concern for his or his organization's safety. Perhaps this type of character would fit better in some sort of shonen action show, but considering how seriously this story takes itself, one can't help but feel that everything he does is way too over the top. This person apparently can take down giant mechas by himself, dodge near nuclear scale explosions standing still, and charm any girl he wants just because he can.  It is especially overbearing for the show to really try to make you think he's really cool.\\n\\n\r\nThe worst side of the cast is definitely the villains though. Any subtlety in storytelling that one might expect form this sort of show is tossed out the window as this setting is divided into white, black, and more black. Some of the villains are downright insane. The overall seriousness of the show takes a huge hit as a result. It is hard to take a plot seriously when you have bulging eye crazy villains beating up poor women in the slums. To top it all off there is a very prevalent xenophobic attitude in the show, which can be seen in all these villains, but especially the one named Dan who is some big shot evil American dude apparently. This sort of attitude is definitely not helpful for Japan, and is not very flattering to have your show perceived as being a bit racist in portrayal.\\n\\n\r\nMore or less the rest of the cast is of the same poorly written shtick. They're  extremely cliche and archetypal, which leads most of them to either being boring or annoying because the story does nothing to make the character feel like they have life or feeling. There's nothing relateable about them, nor is there anything about them that the audience can use to see that they are just more than their character archetype. In the end the characters come off as a sign of extremely lazy writing in the show, or a desire of the creators to pander to every audience imaginable in an attempt to grab as much cash possible, or perhaps both. Frankly, it just makes for a very nauseating experience.\\n\\n\r\nMore generally, even beyond the characters, the show just doesn't have anything compelling going for it. The plot has this weird dichotomy where it is wanting to be taken as seriously, but at the same time does everything in the most over the top manner that can't help but make one roll their eyes over each scene. A show that uses the rule of cool effectively isn't bad, there's been plenty of examples of anime in the past that have done this, but because of this weird dichotomy, the attempts to employ it here just fall severely flat. Perhaps again it is the fault of this cast, but it is also this incredible misuse of the setting for this story. I think placing this story in a much more fictionalized world would have helped it tremendously for one thing. Still, every episode seeks to top itself, no matter how ridiculous it is getting, and it is hard to believe that this should be a good thing for a show of this kind.\\n\\n\r\nThe plot also has very distracting elements at play, in particular, very poorly used and unsubtle fanservice. Several times throughout the show, even in the serious action scenes, the audience has to bear witness to blatant fanservice that comes off enormously tasteless. Things from females butt tapping computer screens in body suits, to boobs swaying in a very sexualized manner after physical violence, are just very distracting to a show's enjoyment when the show does not seem to be about this kind of senseless fanservice. It again just feels like a money garb in this show to pander to a certain kind of audience in this show in a very disgusting manner. The worst and most blatant example of it is Inori's outfit that shows so much skin that it ends up just looking hilariously stupid rather than hot and appealing. Honestly everything portraying the females in this show just seems extremely sexist. The female characters feel little better than sex dolls.\\n\\n\r\nWithout making this too long winded, I think I can safely say that Guilty Crown is an amalgamation of all the worst aspects of modern anime industry. This is the type of show that reminds me of why I went away from American TV shows in the first place and it makes me very sad to see the same sort of attitude being placed into anime. For a Production IG show, this is an incredibly disappointing affair.\\n\\n",

There is absolutely no way that the stinking pile of garbage I just somehow managed to sit through can be the ultra-hyped, widely beloved anime I've been hearing about. Guilty Crown has single handedly made me lose my faith in the anime community's ability to know what is good and what isn't. To say that this series is overrated would be a massive understatement. The only thing I could do while watching it was scratch my head and wonder why the hell this show is so popular. Sure the animation is fluentand the soundtrack is great, but that is NO excuse for the absolutely, disgracefully, humiliatingly bad writing that takes place in this anime. I've never seen a show with such an uncountable amount of plotholes and such worthless, pathetic, uninteresting characters. If you fed your dog some spoiled Mexican food and waited about an hour, the resulting pile of repulsive excrement would be reminiscent of Guilty Crown's script, and no amount of production value can change that fact.\\n\\n\r\nPlot: 1/10\\n\r\nSynopsis: In the year 2029, a virus known as the apocalypse virus outbreaks on a day that became known as \"Lost Christmas\" (Don't ask me why it's called the \"apocalypse\" virus, because the world clearly did not end. In fact, it seems to have barely effected society at all, but I digress...). The story takes place in the year 2039, ten years later, and stars a self-loathing little crybaby named Shu, but more on him later. Through coincidence, Shu gains the ability to pull \"voids\" out of other people. I won't explain what voids are, but basically its the story of a high school student who gets special powers. Shu then becomes involved with terrorist group called Funeral Parlor who are plotting to bring down the government.\\n\\n\r\nThis might be the worst plot in any TV show I've ever seen. Not just anime, but ANY TV show. That's how terrible it is. It had an intriguing (yet unoriginal) premise, but you know what doomed it? Plotholes. Plotholes plotholes plotholes plotholes plotholes plotholes plotholes. Guilty Crown's plot has more holes then a damn Swiss cheese factory, and it UNBEARABLE to watch! They just throw shit at the wall to see what sticks (Hint: Nothing sticks)! They contradict themselves on numerous occasions, rely on ridiculously and unacceptably over-convenient plot elements, and they never explain key plot events that are essential to grasping the story-line! I can't elaborate without spoilers, but if you are a competent human being with a functioning brain, overlooking these gaping plotholes is unfathomable, and it's all capped off with the absolute WORST written romance I've ever had the misfortune of sitting though. More on that later. \\n\\n\r\nOh, and I haven't mentioned the abysmal pacing yet, have I? The first half of the anime is the same thing every single damn episode; Shu and his terrorist group go on a mission, Shu uses his super-special powers, Shu has romantic troubles, Shu feels sorry for himself, rinse and repeat. Nothing happens. The second half is the opposite: a shit-ton of ridiculousness is all crammed into a few episodes with out ever slowing down or taking to time to explain what the hell is going on. Sure, they explain some of the things that happened in the first half, but nothing about what is currently happening! The pacing is just another aspect of the horrible writing of the show.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8/10\\n\r\nGuilty Crown has great, fluent animation, but doesn't live up to it's full potential. The action scenes are all very generic and refuse to even attempt to do something new or different, which is a disappointment. Still, great animation.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9/10\\n\r\nDefinitely the highlight of the anime; in fact, this is one of my all time favorite soundtracks in anime history. Good thing too, because I might have gone insane otherwise. The first opening kicks ass and I was pissed when they subbed it out for a 2nd opening that wasn't half as good midway through, but the 1st opening is really the only thing that kept me watching the anime through the boring and repetitive first half of the show. The endings and OSTs are also absolutely killer.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 2/10\\n\r\nThere is not a single consistent character to be found in Guilty Crown. Every major character is a jumbled mess of traits and emotions that don't even go together. They are all completely incoherent.\\n\\n\r\nIf you took every stereotype of a main character and tried to combine all of them into one, the disaster that would result would be named Shu; the protagonist of Guilty Crown. Where do I even begin with him? The entire first half of this anime consists of Shu crying like a little bitch about absolutely nothing. Seriously, there is nothing wrong with this guy's life. He gets special powers, an attractive girl starts living with him to protect him, and a group of rebels fighting for a noble cause takes him in and make him one of their own. But WAHHHHHH, wittle baby Shu can't get Inori to suck his dick after the first month that they've known each other, and WAHHHHHH, wittle Shu wishes he had even more friends than he does already! He is a self-loathing little wimp who cries about EVERYTHING for a solid 14 episodes, but then he undergoes a sudden change with no buildup whatsoever at that point. Suddenly, for the most stupid and overly convenient reasons imaginable, Shu is now a completely different character. Now, this is the part that just made me laugh uncontrollably: They try to turn Shu into a badass. They go way over the top and act like Shu is now the scariest, badest mother-fucker in the whole damn world, and it fails more miserably then you can imagine. The show tries to convince you that Shu is a selfless individual who has never cared about himself throughout the entire show; only others..... WHAT??? Remember the first half of the anime?? All he cared about was himself! He was the exact opposite of selfless! And now we have Inori falling in love with him because of how selfless he has been! Absolutely pathetic!\\n\\n\r\nOh, and that brings us to Inori; the love interest. Ohhhh boy. FUCK Inori. Besides the fact that they drop a huge bombshell about her toward the end that makes Shu and Inori's relationship COMPLETELY fucked up, that's not even mentioning how inept and inexcusable the execution of her character is. Inori has about as much personality as a ham sandwich. She is so insufferably boring that to say I never got emotionally invested in her is an understatement; I was rooting for her to die just so she would stop wasting so much damn screen time. But, occasionally, for no reason what so ever, she will take on traits that are convenient for the plot to advance. She's like a Ditto from Pokemon; she can can morph into whatever the hell you want her to. Inori is considered the postergirl of this series and fans of the show absolutely adore her. For the life of me, I can't figure out why! She might as well have been pair of singing, floating boobs, because this is one of the worst characters in anime history. Guilty Crown, I fucking hate you SO much for creating this monstrosity. Burn in anime hell for what you've done.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 3/10\\n\r\nIf ever there was a physical embodiment of everything wrong with the modern anime industry, including the willingness of its fans to eat up lazy and uninspired pieces of dog shit that are objectively terrible, Guilty Crown is that embodiment. Why the HELL do people like this show? Only the most naive children with 1-second long attention spans could possibly consider this to be a good plot with good characters. Everything about this anime that is unrelated to music and animation is a complete joke. I cannot recommend watching Guilty Crown to anyone; it is not worth your time. In fact, take away the music and I would rather watch a 22 episode version of Mars of Destruction. Yes: it really is THAT bad. It's not the worst anime I've ever seen, but it might be my least favorite.",

            "content": "Cliches. What anime nowadays doesn't have cliched moments? In my opinion, using cliches isn't that bad. That is, when it's not overdone and poorly used.\r\nGuilty Crown is the perfect example of an interesting premise going wrong. It is a very formulatic show : following every damn cliches in anime history. It seems Production I.G tried really hard to make something revolutionary. It is revolutionary ; this anime completely changed my opinion of what a poorly written plot is. And not only the plot, the characters are mostly one-dimensional, and some of them bipolar.\r\nFirst of all, the story is just plain uninteresting. It's mostly a mash-upof every cliches the team behind the production could find. I mean, couldn't they come up with something more original than the usual \"boy meets girl who grants him power. (Actually, she carries the power, but it's pretty much the same thing.)\" And then, the main character, Shu, joins some resistance team to go against the government. This sounds fine and all, but we've never got to know the motive of the resistance group. Why did they go against the government? What was the point, exactly? Especially after the first half of the show, it seems like the resistance group thing was dropped because I.G ran out of ideas and tried to take another direction. Now, we're presented with some episode trying to be overly symbolic a la Neon Genesis Evangelion, but it failed epicly. Not only was the whole thing pulled out of nowhere, it transitioned to the worst part of the story. Let me remind you, the beginning of the anime was about a corrupt government abusing their powers; a problem on a national scale. In the second half, it's about a school (with no teachers apparently) in crisis, trying to escape the zone they're isolated in, or they'll die. It's hard to take a show seriously when it takes another direction that is completely different, in a bad way. Overall, the story did not satisfy me, and I really doubt the remaining episodes will do Guilty Crown justice.\\n\\n\r\nI find it very ironic that some episodes are rushed, yet I.G still managed to pull off a BEACH episode in a supposedly \"serious\" plot. Atleast perverts got what they wanted.\\n\\n\r\nNow, let's talk about the so called \"void\" power Shu has. The power itself is very interesting, I mean, extracting weapons and tools out of a person's body, and the tool/weapon representing their personality, who thought of that? The problem is that the power is FILLED with inconsistencies. Let me begin with how the power is convenient, up until the second half of the anime, every tool/weapon Shu would draw in a difficult situation would be JUST THE RIGHT THING to deal with it. Every time Shu would draw out a void, it could be convenient for the situation and would get him out of that difficult situation easily. That is the perfect example of what a deus ex machina is, used in a bad way. Of course, Gai has the power to see people's void. How did he get that power? No one knows. It just sounds like a convenient excuse used as a plot device because the writers have no idea how to make a progress a plot correctly. The second inconsistency is people fainting from void extraction. Basically, when a void is extracted out of a person's body, they faint out of \"shock\". Now for the inconsistency, sometimes people faint, sometimes they don't. There is NO explanation as to why they sometimes do and don't. I heard some people claim that when Shu held someone's hand while having their void extracted, it would prevent them from fainting, but I do remember times where he held their hand and they fainted anyway. It seems like the power wasn't explained because what if the writers run out of ideas again? They'd probably add another unforeshadowed element to voids and we, as watchers, will be forced to accept it.\\n\\n\r\nAlso, why the fuck can Shu only extract voids from people under 17 years old?\\n\\n\r\nTo go back to the one-dimensional characters, I believe Shu and Inori are the WORST PROTAGONISTS to EVER exist. To this day, I still laugh at the interview where I.G claimed that they wanted Shu to be the new Shinji Ikari.\\n\\n\r\nHahahahahahahahahahaha.... Are you fucking kidding me? Shu is just your average pussy character that doesn't want to hurt people, even though they are killing without remorse and hesitation. I.G tried to make a character full of flaws with no real strength. They succeeded, but no way in hell is that close to be a realistic character. It's not that he doesn't want to hurt people, he's just scared. What a lame protagonist, right? Never once does he really change, his personality is and always be that of the average useless main character. And in the second half of the show, his personality takes a sudden 180. I'm sorry, I.G, but people don't instantly change like that, this character is a complete joke.\\n\\n\r\nInori, on the other hand, has no personality. Or too many. She behaves in a different way in every episode, it's really strange. At first, she completely depends on Gai, but suddenly decides to switch to Shu. I don't understand exactly why she's so dependent on people, since we've almost never seen her take a decision herself.\\n\\n\r\nI won't continue talking about characters because honestly... I have no clue about them and their motives or whatever. Especially the \"villains\".\\n\\n\r\nI.G can be praised for two things about Guilty Crown. First the animation and art, done by Redjuice, are excellent. The animation is realistic, with a somewhat dark mood attached to it. In my opinion, it's pretty solid, very fluid, I don't remember seeing many repeated frames, and animation quality was consistent in every episode. Still, the style itself is pretty generic and isn't memorable. Same thing applies to the background animation. The details are amazing, I.G really did put a lot of work into the animation. (I wish they had done the same thing with the story.) Personally, I really liked the metal-like effect when a void is being extracted. It's pretty cool.\\n\\n\r\nMusic is quite good. I personaly really like the second opening by EGOIST, which is essentially supercell. The animation of the opening sequences are well done, although the moments in the anime don't really seem to happen in the story. The background music is also very fitting and helps deliver the mood of the show.\\n\\n\r\nIn the end, do I enjoy Guilty Crown? Yes. Guilty Crown is a very enjoyable anime, there are a lot of action scenes, animation is amazing and so is the music. Story is still terrible though.",

            "content": "I began watching Guilty Crown on a whim. It was a pure coincidence. If I had anything else to do that day, I probably would never have started watching. However, it just so happened that I was bored out of my mind and at the bottom of my current \"to watch\" list. When I saw Guilty Crown peeking out at me from another member's favorite anime list, I couldn't resist the temptation. Reading the synopsis turned me off. It didn't seem very promising. \"Boy has power in his right hand that makes him special.\" Okay... cool? \r\nSo I started reading the reviews. They were horrendouslymixed, ranging from three to nine with very little middle ground. Well, the positive reviews piqued my curiosity. The negative reviews seemed rather confrontational and angry, as if the show had somehow personally wronged the writers. They railed and ragged on clich\u00e9s, flat characters, and brought up similarities to other shows. \\n\\n\r\nBeing immensely bored and slightly curious, I couldn't help but make Guilty Crown a guilty pleasure. I'll admit that the story takes a while to warm up. The first episode was incredibly clich\u00e9, with the generic \"boy meets girl; boy becomes superman; boy is involved with terrorists\" story going on up until the end. But it diverged. The character (of his own volition) refused to acknowledge his power and left me wondering what could possibly happen next.\\n\\n\r\nIndeed, what could this story be about if the main character refused to join up with what I had assumed to be the protagonist group? Well, Inori happened. Now, I've seen people complain endless about her. She's essentially Ein with pink hair, a lovely singing voice, and a sword in her chest--right?\\n\\n\r\nSure, if you watch the first six episodes or so. Once you get past the initial \"OMG SHE'S SO ,\" you'll start seeing how she grows. She's a parasitic character. That is what makes her, well, her. She simply cannot function without a strong character to depend on. I don't see how that makes her unrealistic? There are people like that in this world. The only hiccup is the justification. She's weak because she's a blank slate. Okay, maybe that is a little clich\u00e9. Does it make the character terrible? No... if she didn't grow at all, then yeah, it would be clich\u00e9. Instead, facets of her personality are revealed throughout the show, including the afore mentioned shaky justification. \\n\\n\r\nI'm surprised people don't talk about Gai. He's a sixteen year old who leads a terrorist group, who is a better killer than trained soldiers, a genius tactician, and has the ability to see Voids (which is all too convenient since the main character has the power to extract these Voids). There isn't anything realistic about him for quite some time. He is my least favorite character of the series. He \"grows\" the most, if you can call it that, but his character itself is subjugated to Shu's growth. \\n\\n\r\nWhile I'm addressing things that were detrimental to my enjoyment, I'll mention that there were a few inconsistencies as far as Voids are concerned, and a certain character that is built up as being incredibly important with a pretty serious power who is completely ignored in the second half of the show. Actually, if I recall correctly, he stops making an appearance before the plot changing event even occurs. I'm not particularly put-out with his exclusion, but a little explanation would be nice.\\n\\n\r\nAs for other inconsistencies, the Void regulations are pretty flighty. The whole \"person must be under seventeen\" rule is pretty laudable, and the Voids themselves don't seem to be very relevant to a person's heart except in a select few cases--which, if I might add, is downplayed afterwards. You have a character whose Void seems pretty useful, put to heavy use for support purposes, but then you find out that his power is actually among the weakest of the bunch. \\n\\n\r\nHowever, I can overlook these inconsistencies. I can overlook some questionable plot devices. I can overlook quite a bit as far as this show is concerned. Why? To put it simply, the show is beautiful. The art is magnificent, and the sound wonderful. Everything is so fluid and Inori is just stunning. Couple that amazing art with a clich\u00e9 story that becomes progressively darker, and I simply cannot help but enjoy it. \\n\\n\r\nI'm not going to lie; there are plenty of areas that could have been handled better. The second half of the show, while my favorite in terms of mood, felt rushed at times. The first half annoyed me with its developments. The character's choices were predictable at times. But, even though we could predict them, it was because of the way the story was told. (I'll refer to everything revolving around Hare. Did we see that coming? Yes. Does that make it clich\u00e9? A little. Does that mean it wasn't realistic or handled well? I'd beg to differ. I felt that the changes in mood that resulted were worth giving in to a few minor clich\u00e9s to attain.)\\n\\n\r\nThis is a show you're either going to love or hate. You will either latch on to the little things, or you'll take the bigger picture into mind and just enjoy it as it comes. I personally enjoyed every second of the show and would re-watch if I had the time. Some people may draw parallels to Code Geass, but I don't see them unless I specifically look for similarities. Even then, the ones I see are just general clich\u00e9s rather than pieces drawn from the show. Some people may complain about the fanservice. I guess they'd be referring to Inori, or Ayase in her flight suit. To be honest, I didn't see any of that as fanservice. It's debatable, and heavily reliant on taste.\\n\\n\r\nThis show is not a master piece. It's good, yes, but isn't particularly insightful or groundbreaking. It's eye candy, and interesting enough to spend a few days over. I'll be sad to see it end, but it lacks that certain force other shows have.",

            "content": "The first few episodes had some problems, but nothing unforgivable, and the show actually seemed really awesome at first. There was so much they could do in the world they had set up.\r\nWould the main character become a cunning LeLouche? Perhaps a brave Suzaku? Will we identify with his teen angst like we do with Shinji? Will he seem human?\r\nThe answer to all of these questions ends up being \"no.\" The main character is someone you increasingly dislike as the show goes on.\r\nNot only is he generic, he's a bad execution of the generic shonen protagonist. He doesn't feel very human, and his courage &competency literally manifest only as required by the plot, only to disappear immediately afterwards.\\n\\n\r\nSadly, despite an A-list team and a huge budget they really just made an unbelievably bad series. I can't understand how this could have happened. Even mediocre garbage like Symphogear told a more emotional story, and that show was butchered by a huge budget-cut (and a much worse premise, honestly).\\n\\n\r\nFairly early on you start feeling a sense of disappointment as they layer on extremely generic \"twists\" that the main character literally cuts through with a magic sword.\\n\\n\r\nThe worst part of this show rears its head mid-way through, but it becomes especially prominent in the second half. I am referring to the fact that people change sides without ANY reason to do so, only to change back later without any serious reasons for their actions. The worst example of this by far is the student council president.\\n\\n\r\nIt's my guess that the flailing writers looked for any opportunity to inject some kind of pathos into a story that is honestly much to happy for its apocalyptic setting. \"Why don't we have his mom help the bad guys for a while?\" \"Oh yeah! Awesome! The audience will be shocked!\"\\n\\n\r\nSo many of these twists end up half-baked. Mana's character is a particularly strange creation, honestly. Who came up with the idea to add in all the (barely avoided) creepy incest and rape to a show that is already struggling to tell a convincing story about geopolitics? Not to mention the plague that turns people into crystals. Not to mention the terrorist v.s. government war. Not to mention the other sub-plots that get forgotten until the last episode clumsily ties everything together with a big \"reset\" button after a boring \"final battle\" influenced by strange forces never explained.\\n\\n\r\nNot only does an abundance of cheese-ball dialogue ruin the mood on the few truly dramatic scenes, but the writers lacked the balls to really hit us with anything big. The audience never feels much when people die, because the people that die are almost exclusively fodder.\\n\\n\r\nThere was one exception to this, but it felt really artificial. It was a terrible 3-episode mini-arc where the main character ends up killing the sibling of his friend, but special circumstances removed all the moral questions in this case. Why not make your main character kill a friend who wasn't already about to die? It worked in Evangelion. Twice in-fact.\\n\\n\r\nEven the action - which should be the one area this show simply cannot fail on - is often really simplistic and boring. If you compare the knightmare suits duels from Geass to the mech battles here, it's just pathetic. Not that these battles ever end up mattering, since the entire show is setup to allow the main character to save everyone repeatedly.\\n\\n\r\nIf they had just stopped trying to layer on really shallow twists and developed the core Japan v.s. The World narrative a little more, putting Shu in a moral dilemma regarding Gai's ultimate actions, and dropped the character Mana entirely then this would have been a much better story.\\n\\n\r\nWatch it for yourself. Maybe with low expectations you will enjoy it as a \"pretty mess\" as some have suggested. As for me, I can't see myself ever recommending it to anyone after this post. It's a cautionary tale for writers, perhaps, but beyond that it has little value.\\n\\n\r\nWe all weep for the show that COULD have been. What a waste.\\n",

            "content": "When I saw Guilty Crown on the preview list with the synopsis and the production team, I thought this was it. I thought that this would be an anime that would save the industry. Guess what? I was right. After all if you cannot be a good example, then you will just have to be a terrible warning. \r\n  Lets get to the good points. Art. It is Production I.G we are talking about here. Even the haters have to agree that the art is amazing. The animations were fluid and detailed. The character designs are appealing as well. The only problemis the uninteresting mecha designs though lets be honest, there are only a few ways that you can draw a giant robot. It is obvious that they spent a large part of their budget in this department. The music is beautiful too except for some engrish and the fact that sometimes the music does not really match the mood of a particular scene.\\n\\n\r\n  Oh boy, it is time for the bad stuff; namely the plot. Now I am not going to say that the premises is a copy of Code Geass or anything like that because there is no problem exploring a concept that has been done before. It does become a problem, however, when a previously explored concept is horribly executed. The writers wants you to take the show seriously but it is especially hard to do that when hardly anything follows logic along with the lack of consistency and cohesion of the story. To me it just seemed like the authors all got together and wrote 50 plot progressions and added them into a box. Before every episode they draw one out of the box and say \"this is what today's episode is going to be about\". This sort of progression leaves little to no explanation nor even any information for the viewer to infer what is happening. Surprisingly the producers think they have enough time to produce a beach episode which again makes me unable to take this show seriously. \\n\\n\r\n  The character is another aspect of this anime that made it not enjoyable for me. None of the protagonists' nor the antagonists' motives are explored other than the generic good guys versus the bad guys black and white conflict. The bad guys kill people and the good guys are the heroes of justice oppressed and hunted down by the bad guys. With the inconsistencies of personalities and sudden illogical character \"development\", it is hard to even give a damn about the characters. The special ability of the protagonist is basically a Deus ex machina used for plot convenience. Coupled with several layers of plot armour that protects the protagonists just makes the characters that much more uninteresting. \\n\\n\r\n  With the huge budget, superb production team, and the so called golden time slot given to this show, it pains me physically to see it become the train wreck that is Guilty Crown. Perhaps through a modicum of sadism that exists in every human being, I decided to savor every aspect of its shortcoming by finishing the show; despite all the crap that was thrown at me since episode 3. All in all it seemed to me that 80% of the budget was spent on art and music and a janitor was hired to write the plot. The flashy action scenes and music basically carried this show. At the end of the day I just cannot decide whether or not this is an anime or just a new form of advertisement for promoting Supercell's songs.\\n\\n",

            "content": "Guilty Crown belongs to what could possibly be the most frustrating of shows: ones which are well produced but poorly executed. Sharp visuals and a strong soundtrack are always a plus. However, they don't compensate for haphazard writing and overly hammy direction. Guilty Crown suffers from both of these.\r\nThe story takes place in a post-apocalyptic Japan, that is ridden with a deadly disease after a catastrophe called Lost Christmas. The nation has been taken over by militarists in order to supposedly prevent the spread of the disease. Shu is a normal high school student, going about his life adhering to the status quo. That isuntil gets involved with Inori, the lead singer of the music sensation Egotist, and member of the resistance group Funeral Parlor. Shu then finds himself in the middle of the action, gaining the power to draw items called 'voids' from the hearts of other people. All he wants is to get back to his normal life, but circumstances keep pushing him back into the conflict, which goes deeper than he ever imagined; holding the fate of the human species in the balance.\\n\\n\r\nNow, admittedly the premise sounds pretty intriguing , and could have actually made for something pretty compelling... that is if the writing was any good. Unfortunately, it is not. It is bad. It is really bad. The plot is just overflowing with silly cliches. Whether it be the action-pack conflict or Shu's mundane school life, the plot consists of retreaded and uninspired material; to the point of being laughably obnoxious. When it is not wallowing in cliches, the story takes some ridiculous and downright asinine twists. It is as if the writers didn't know where they wanted the story to go, and were pulling ideas out of their butts as the story went on. Sure, there are somethings that are foreshadowed and some characters whose roles don't become clear until far into the story; but honestly the reasoning behind them is just so flimsy and often make minimal sense, if any at all. This all leads up to an ending which is completely unsatisfying, even for those who enjoyed the show.\\n\\n\r\nThe cast for this show is just as unorganized as the plotting. Shu isn't exactly a terrible lead, he is just exceedingly bland. All that could really be said about him is that he has a kind heart and struggles under pressure, because he spends majority of the show looking like a sad wet puppy following the ideas of everyone but himself. Now, it is clear that the creators meant him to change from this wimpy kid into a mature young man, which would have been perfectly fine if his character development wasn't so forced that it feels hollow and insincere. The rest of the cast is no better, if anything they are far worse. Leading lady Inori has next to no personality at all. Besides her striking look, she is hopelessly dull; nothing more than a glorified plot devise. That the show is intent on forcing viewers to sympathize with her helps nothing. Funeral Parlor leader Gai likewise has inconsistent characterization. This is especially true for the latter half, where his motives are largely unclear at first; then become utterly contrived in an attempt to make his actions sympathetic at the series end. The other characters are barely worth mentioning and all into simple archetypes such as the fiery Ayase, spunky Tsugumi, psychotic Daryl, etc. This over-sized cast eats up eats up the running time, while providing little in way of substance.\\n\\n\r\nDirector Araki Tetsurou previously did good work with the wickedly exhilarating Death Note and stupidly fun Highschool of the Dead, and manages to breathe at least some life into this dreck. If nothing else, the action sequences in Guilty Crown are energetic. There are some moments that will certainly get the adrenaline rushing and are very well animated. If only Tetsurou directed the shows dramatic moments as well as its action; he has always had a penchant for over-the-top drama, and that does not work in favor of this series. Often quite drama is the most effective and the most compelling; Guilty Crown doesn't understand this, its drama is constantly heavy-handed and overwrought. Moments that might have been interesting in theory are completely ruined because of how overblown the show is dramatically. It is as if the show decided to supplement plot and characterization by making this as dramatic as possible, it does not work.\\n\\n\r\nAs previously mentioned, the show is strong as far as visuals go. The landscapes alone look quite something to behold. The futuristic cities look fantastic, but also fittingly oppressive under the military rule. The otherworldly fields of crystals seen throughout the show are a dazzling sight, despite their rather ominous role in the plot. Likewise, character designs are striking and attractive; once again anime has brought us into a world occupied by gorgeous, or at least above average, looking people. Inori is particularly eye catching in her more often than not revealing outfits; as is the inexplicably cat-themed Tsugumi. The animation usually looks great, at times it is rough around the edges, but that is expected for a TV anime; and it comes in full force when it is time to show off. The music is, of course, also well produced and nice to listen to. Whether it actually fits is up in the air, as the soundtrack features a ridiculous number of insert songs. At times it can be very effective in setting the mood of a scene, but other times it sounds silly and feels out of place.\\n\\n\r\nIn the end, Guilty Crown is a big, loud, glossy mess. The show provides plenty of eye-candy and some nice tunes, but falls flat on its face where it really matters. The plot is wildly confused and constantly tripping over itself. The characters are poorly developed and largely irrelevant. Honestly, there isn't very many reasons to watch this. Sure, it is very pretty on the surface, but underneath the decadent facade it is completely empty.\\n",

            "content": "BEST COMEDY OF 2011-2012. 10/10.\r\nOh wait. This isn't a comedy?\r\nWell then. \r\nWhere do I even start with this mess, then?\r\nGuilty Crown seemed to promise to be one of the best series of the season when it first aired. Boy, was I wrong.\r\nThe writing in this show is an absolute mess and tends to try to just throw random plot devices at you in random intervals to try and surprise you. It is not particularly surprising, but it's a bit cute (cute as in, a child seems to be writing the show).\r\nThe characters are really awful. The writing staff seems to be trying their hardest tomake characters of a certain archetype, and to make characters stick to their archetype without fail. I'm not sure if they realize that character complexity is derived from the fact that people aren't simple enough to act only based on a single characteristic, or if they're just trying to create characters that might possibly mature. So far, it seems to be the former. \\n\\n\r\nThe show has many laughable situations. Take episode 6, for example. Fully armed guards, holding guns in their hands, charge at an enemy instead of shooting with their guns, resulting in a teenage girl killing them without returning a single shot. Hilarious, but I don't think that was really the intention.\\n\\n\r\nThat's not to say the show's completely awful. The art, animation, and music are really quite good, even if at times they cut a few corners. But really, a mess with art, animation, and music is still a mess.\\n\\n\r\nSo? The bottom line? Don't take this show seriously. You'll be able to enjoy it a lot more if you don't. Because... well... it's funny to ridicule at least.",

            "content": "*Updated*\r\nI take back what I said. This series  is a complete mess.\r\nRemember the first episode? Guy meets girl; evil government; le resistance; Deus Ex Machina (Gai); guy is thrown into battle; guy gets power from girl to fight giant-robots-from-nowhere - all done before, nothing new. And guess what? It GETS WORSE. Onwards from there, the build-up of episodes is just awfully underdeveloped. Towards the semi-finale, its revelations rushed past the audience like a train, or over the audience if you\u2019re trying to figure out what the whole first half was for. The GHQ? Virus? Terrorism? Shuu manning up? Yeah, alot of those issues arejust not important. Perhaps the proper title for this series is \u201cGuilty Crown: What the heck is this?\u201d I'm gonna directly quote critic M0rg0th here: \\n\\n\r\n           \"And it\u2019s strange because everyone (I\u2019m also guilty as charged) complained about the generic dullness of this show but surprisingly neither the script-writers nor the director realized that this show concerned itself far too much with stuff that isn\u2019t important.\"\\n\\n\r\nNow the characters... oh god, the characters are so bland it makes me want to scream. Perhaps the biggest mistake Guilty Crown has done until now is just one word: Shuu. Shu Ouma - 17 yrs old, and a bit of a wimp... or so I thought. Turns out he's the biggest, whiniest, and retarded douchebag in the entire series. We never get a good explanation on why he's doing what he does (other than some useless split-second flashbacks). Why was he chosen as the main focus of the story? Shuu is a weak character, not just in the way that he\u2019s bland and dull but also because he simply has no charisma; a poorly made plot-device. Not to mention it's his own damn fault that the city's in danger in the first place.\\n\r\nInori Yuzuriha - a completely dull female lead. Inori is a different character in EVERY EPISODE. Plus, her comments on \"love\" are nothing short of face-palm worthy. Nothing more than an stereotypical otaku's wet dream.\\n\r\nAyase Shinomiya - mech rider of the resistance who rides a wheelchair (accident maybe?). She's very modest and kind, and has feelings for Gai. But she also likes Shu?! Seriously?!\\n\r\nTsugumi - Genki-girl and fanservice. Who the heck is she and why is she there in the first place?\\n\r\nGai Tsutsugami - okay, he's a strong-willed, stern, conflicted but inspiring leader of the resistance. Initially cold to Shu, he accepts him in the end (which is a big mistake). AKA the best and most developed character in the series.\\n\\n\r\nOk, undeniably the art direction is this anime's strongest point. From the very beginning the animation is as expected from I.G Production - the transitions and movements of characters are smooth and realistic. Character models are rich with expression and personality, all differentiating in unique ways. The action and fight scenes are free-flowing and cinematic, rivalling that of many animated action movies. The backgrounds and environments are fully developed, blending a mix of futuristic and modern Japanese architecture, filled with vibrant shades and colours. Special effects are very pleasing to the eye.\\n\r\nMusic is of great importance in this series, as the music direction is lead by Ryo of Supercell, with Supercell themselves providing the opening, ending, and insert songs. The soundtrack ranges from bittersweet ballads to fast-paced rock-guitar riffs, and the random insert songs from time-to-time don't hurt either. One problem is that there are too many insert songs in one episode, so it can become somewhat of an annoyance. Voice acting, however, is top-notch work that doesn't really need explaining. Sound effects are what you'd expect from a sci-fi anime.\\n\\n\r\nBut you know what? None of that matters. Michael Bay is pretty much all of this. But how is it that the director of \"Code Geass\" and \"Death Note\" became so much worse? Someone, please tell me.  \\n\\n\r\nThe \"future\" is pretty much dead. The series excel in Art and Music, but fails spectacularly with an awfully undeveloped story. But perhaps I'm being too hard, and that things will pick up in the second half! But by then, it'll be too late to make much of an impact. We can't keep calling incompetence as brilliance.",

            "content": "Note: These are my opinions only. Everyone has different tastes, and thus, what I think is cheesy may not be cheesy to someone else. I try to judge the show based on technical mastery and evidence of being well-thought out, but in the end, a lot of it is still based on personal judgment. That's it.\r\nSo anyways, I first wanted to watch this anime because of its freaking epic art, and animation-wise, I was not disappointed. But almost everything else was, in the purest sense of the word, utter crap.\r\nTo be completely fair, though, GC isn't /that/ bad (a 5 is still a \"mediocre\"), butthe discrepancy between the expectations and the actual thing is so large that you can't help but feel disappointed. That probably accounts for at least 60% of the negative feeling towards the show.\\n\\n\r\nStory 4/10\\n\r\nGeneric plotline and obvious Code Geass rip-off, but that's not the bad part. I've seen plenty an anime that took a generic plotline and kicked ass with it, but Guilty Crown... no. For one thing, the gratuitous use of deus ex machinas and clich\u00e9d plot devices is annoying enough, but the plot also has to be jerky and abrupt. Also, the show shifts between cheesy comedy and fast-paced action with all the subtlety of a bipolar psychopath. Comedy is important for high-strung shows, but it has to be done /well/. And all of the (amazingly animated) kick-ass actions scenes are really mostly there to try to trick you into believing that there is decent plot development.\\n\r\nThere have been objections - and I quite agree - that the /overall/ plot of GC isn't that bad, but sadly, this is lost in the chaos of the individual episodes, which are done rather sloppily.\\n\\n\r\nArt 10/10\\n\r\nABSOLUTELY AMAZING. NO WORDS TO DESCRIBE IT. Every 2 minutes, there is pretty much at least one masterpiece scene. The background is never too detailed to be distracting, but neither is it plain. Overall, every scene is unified and clear, and yet there's still plenty of contrast. And all the angles! There's no such thing as messy rotation that makes a character's face look weird. The colors are beautiful - there are so many hues and values of each color. They're somehow soft and yet still vibrant, and no one's outfit is ever just \"red\" or \"blue.\" \u007fTons of attention and care are put into everything, down to the movement of each individual strand of hair. I mean, someone spent a LOT of money on this show; if only the plot and the characters could make the cut as well. But dang, this show is worth watching for the art all by itself.\\n\\n\r\nSound 9/10\\n\r\nThe music is really nice. The opening and ending as well as the inserts are all very well done, and they match the overall feel of the anime. The background music tends to be very well done as well, though occasionally they drop something a bit cheesy on you. Overall, though, the sound was done very professionally. I'm not really an sound-oriented person, though, so I can't elaborate much on that.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 2/10\\n\r\nTHIS IS THE PART THAT KILLED ME.\\n\r\nI'll admit that I rather like the concept of Shu. He's a normal person with flaws and doubts who wants to believe in his ideals, and that's a very powerful concept. But, like pretty much all of GC, it's a concept that's executed crappily.\\n\r\nFor one thing, someone really needs to tell the script writers that thing that English teachers always like to say: \"Show, not tell.\" This show likes to substitute cheesy narration for actual character development, and to cover it up, they just add in abrupt action scenes. Even without that, though, almost all the characters are flat and predictable. Everyone on the enemy side is appropriately sadistic, twisted, evil, etc. Everyone in Undertaker is appropriately badass/cute/energetic (and mysteriously young). I started watching GC because I saw an epic AMV with Daryl in it, and I was looking forward to him, but in the end he was just psychotic, and not in a good way.\\n\r\nAlso, they were trying to show the main character's growth, I believe, but it was done badly because they just kept trying to force actions and words on him without allowing time for transition. Admittedly, Guilty Crown may be one of the animes to suffer from the recent trend towards short animes, but then again, Madoka Magica handled a similar development ridiculously well, and it only had about half the number of episodes.\\n\r\nI'd say that the only exceptions to the crappy character development of Guilty Crown are Inori and Gai. Gai is probably the pivot around which the entire plot of GC rests (I'm just guessing here), and having the leader of your rebellion be a complete Gary Stu would be too predictable, so that's probably why he seems to have a rather dark side to him. Either way, his character development is still kind of jerky and abrupt, but at least it's a lot better than everyone else's, since it actually exists. Inori is also done well, most likely because she's so \"mysterious\" that there's not much to develop yet. But I rather like her.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 6/10\\n\r\nThe animation was AMAZING, and the sound was great, but sadly those two are really not nearly as important as story and character, and GC screwed up BADLY on both.\\n\r\nGC was also trying to go for the profound and philosophical and introspective type of thing, but it pretty much failed at that, too. Cheesy narrations are not thought-provoking, no matter how much they want them to be. The \"Void\" thing is more of an excuse to come up with cool weapons than a method of introspection, and since character development is crucial to the philosophical value of a story, all of the flat characters in GC really kill it. To be honest, I don't think the script writers of GC even thought about their philosophical theme when they wrote the story - they just threw in some generic themes and thought it would work.\\n\r\nLast but not least, GC has screwy logic. The substitute government is evil, but it's the one that got Japan through the virus. Undertaker is fighting for the people, but no one knows what the heck it's about. There are lots of paradoxes in the story, and if done well, they could have been mind-blowingly amazing, but they're not done well at all. They're just half-assed, and the result is that the show just doesn't make much sense when you think about it.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 5/10\\n\r\nSo, GC on episode 6 needs some SERIOUS improvement. It may or may not get better, but if it doesn't get better... Well, it really should. It's a ridiculously high-budget anime that didn't deliver the way it could have and should have. There was so much that could have been done better if it had been thought out properly, but GC decided to just slap together some clich\u00e9s and random action and call it an anime. It doesn't work that way.\\n\r\nI'd still recommend watching a couple of episodes, though. Just for the amazing art. :DDD I mean, the animators did their job. The script writers and whatnot just didn't.",

BUT, to everyone that thinks this is a copy of Code Geass, the only thing related between these 2 shows is \"Magic girl appears and gives powerto highschool boy @random\" or \"Boy finds girl and they go on a honeymoon together fighting baddies everywhere\" or this, which is practically the same thing \"Highschool boy +random people + magic powers = Bleach\", but who the fk cares, it's not like I'VE NEVER SEEN THIS TYPE OF STORY HURRDURRDURR ITZ PURRRRDDY ORIGINAL (Code Geass, Sacred Seven, C, Dantalian no Shoka, Bleach, Reborn, and MANY MORE SHOWS THAT ~TOTALLY~ DON'T HAVE THE SAME SHIT GOING ON!!)\\n\\n\r\nStory: Pretty much already explained this dumb story, and if you've seen many other anime shows you won't expect anything new. But midway through the show, the whole average shounen thing of \"one's loss of a loved one transforms or changes the main character into a mature leader\" is discarded. It was the ONE episode where I expected Shu to mature like Simon did in Gurren Lagann because it always happens like that in anime right? But I was wrong, oh so very very wrong. Overall I don't even know the point of this story. From the average \"Group of good guys vs bad guys\" it turns into something fucking crazy and far more stupider like this: \"Highschool kids in Japan get infected by some disease shit that turns people into a pink stone and breaks them apart. Main character Shu tries to become the King of the school (lol) because a friend died. He forces dictatorship onto everyone, who soon rebel against him. While that happens some weird government organization who securely closed the area around the infected highschool kids, soon kill them off, and suddenly plan to exterminate Japan. And with an added plus Gai (Shu's friend) is revived and turns against Shu\". As you can see this show starts out as an average pathetic shounen show, until the highschool lockdown begins where it changes dramatically. It's just so stupid. A \"government\" suddenly plans to exterminate Japan without a good reason? Who were the bad guys again? Why did the good guys wanna kill the bad guys? What are they trying to accomplish? \\n\\n\r\nTHEN IT HIT ME! This show is nothing. By that I mean it throws in random plot lines at random times trying to make it seem like it's something that has a unique and interesting story, of course all that would make the fanboys and fangirls go \"OHMAHGAWD! I DIDN'T SEE THAT COMING!\" They only say that because it shouldn't happen, the shitty show doesn't stay on the same FKING PLOT for the whole show. Just like Inori's personalities.\\n\\n\r\nArt: This is where GC goes right. The art is pretty good, though I don't care much since I'm more of the Story type guy. I do dislike Inori, main female character, because of what she wears 24/7. She barely wears anything at all. Like whatthefudge I don't find her to be \"smexy\" or \"cute\" at all in the first place, get her to wear some god damn clothes.\\n\\n\r\nSound: \"So everything that makes me whole\" TROLLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLMAO. i no spek ingles, plez u talk me in English. Other than that opening, sounds = decent.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: No one has their own unique personality. It's like everyone gets a lot of screen time but, nothing about their character traits are shown. \\n\\n\r\nInori: sucks, since she's clearly a robot from the future with a \"daily personality changer\" system programmed into her. Plus she's also Shu's sister.\\n\\n\r\nShu: is your typical failure w/ magic powers who soon becomes epic, in fights, not character, but soon due to death of a loved one he becomes Hitler for some time (aka wannabe Gai). \\n\\n\r\nGai: is the \"badass\" who owns everyone and does it with robotic Inori at night. He's so damn godly that once he dies, he comes back to life. \\n\\n\r\nMany other characters too but they juz backgrounds so who cares =D In total there is almost no character development for anyone, other than Shu of course, since he is the main character.\\n\r\n\"Noob is Evolving! ...dudududududududu! ITZ LELOUCHE. Oh my bad, it's a Hitler\"\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: It's just a \"watch cuz I'm bored\" show.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\n-The fight scenes suck hardcore since Shu can just swipe away like a crazy monkey playing Fruit Ninja and chop them robots to pieces. Overpowered bish! \\n\r\n-Empty characters, almost none are likable\\n\r\n-Pathetic action scenes\\n\r\n-There's a lot of errors in this show, you can see them easily if you actually pay attention to whatever the hell is going on\\n\r\n-Needs more BETTER music, no Ingrish\\n\r\n-No original story \\n\r\n-Typical boy meets girl with powers in highschool anime for 14 episodes\\n\r\n-Story suddenly changes FKING 50 TIMES! (exaggerating a bit)\\n\r\n-Episode 1-14 So yes, it's one of those retardedunoriginalfaggotrystorywheregirlgiveboypowertogopewpewthembaddies\\n\r\n-Episode 15+ Completely funny\\n\\n\r\nGoodDaySir.\\n\\n\r\nP.S If you like this, watch Mars of destruction =D",

And they do it little by little. Too bad that people never cared to look into it. \r\nArt \r\n9/10\r\nIt was wonderful in most episodes, but some were sloppy (e.g. ep 21). The character designs are great. By the way, there are very specific reasons why they made Inori wear those outfits other than the fan-service. \r\nSound\r\n9/10\r\nThe OP/ED's are real monster. What's more, they're perfect fits for GC. Departures is singing of the people who died from FP's struggle for freedom(though nominally it seems like a love song). TEGC is singing of hope, one of the bigger themes explored during the latter 11 episodes. EGOIST continues to release songs for other anime. These also often make references to the story of GC.\\n\r\nThe soundtracks are also nice, though now thinking back it doesn't feel so special compared to other recent anime (soundtracks are pretty big these days)\\n\\n\r\nCharacter\\n\r\n8/10\\n\r\nPretty amazing. Inori's personal growth occurs just about on every episode. \\n\r\nAs for Shu.. the story would've been meaningless had he not survived at the end. The whole point was that he would grow into a person who isn't so easily influenced by the thoughts of those around him, and killing him off would've denied that purpose. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment \\n\r\n10/10\\n\r\nYou know, this anime is like a hidden gem that you'd never discover unless you were a diligent miner..\\n\\n\r\nOverall \\n\r\n10/10\\n\r\nI think that people should've hated this show less and actually gave it a chance. And by giving a chance I actually mean to watch carefully for character/plot development rather than nit-picking.",

            "content": "Truly original anime concepts are rather hard to come by these days, for a variety of reasons. For one, simple formulaic concepts are much easier to produce and usually cater to a wider demographic. Reason two being that the anime industry is an incredibly fragile business in terms of profit, meaning that risks that should be taken, or unfortunately shafted in favor of simpler anime. However, there is one reason that stands out above all, a general lack in inspiration. Pouring in countless amounts of influences and concepts from highly acclaimed anime of the past in order to create something unique is common ground. However,anime such as Guilty Crown use these influences and concepts and jumbles them up into an incoherent mess of an anime, complete with extremely high production values to please the audience. \\n\\n\r\nGuilty Crown\u2019s influences seem to plague the anime more than enhance its concepts. Taking place in Tokyo 10 years after the \u201cLost Christmas\u201d incident, Guilty Crown seems to have taken some cues from Neon Genesis Evangelion in terms of its setting, leading to an obvious originality issue. An ordinary (yet obviously troubled) high school student named Shu Ouma eventually finds his way into a rebellion group named \u201cFuneral Parlor\u201d who seek to usurp the totalitarian government now running Japan, the GHQ. This story element was clearly influenced by Code Geass and even approaches copying it during certain scenes in the anime. Guilty Crown\u2019s influences make the anime much harder to take seriously, as the concepts the show adapts are from anime that did a much better job of executing these concepts. \\n\\n\r\nThe plot eschews any sense of realism, instead adding needless drama and more opportunities for dues ex machina, thus making the plot come off as contrived and nonsensical. The plot adapts more and more story elements as it goes along leading to many inconsistencies and plot holes without any coherent explanations for these changes. Sometimes, these changes suit the plot quite well and the anime benefits from a change in pace. However, one change in particular is absolutely jarring as the show takes a darker route in order to keep the suspense factor up, but it only comes off as laughable and unnecessary. Guilty Crown tries so hard to make the audience take it seriously, but the dialogue and scenarios come off as angst-ridden and over the top at times. Guilty Crown\u2019s plot and execution are too far off base for it to be taken as anything more than it is, making it a huge let-down despite occasional moments of clarity.\\n\\n\r\nGuilty Crown\u2019s characters suffer the same issues that the plot does. The leading and supporting characters are full of clich\u00e9s and elements from other anime and thus aren\u2019t compelling individuals. Protagonist Shu Ouma often comes off as angsty and annoying and goes through an erratic spell of character development that will only make the audience sympathize even less with him. \u201cFuneral Parlor\u201d member/idol singer/mysterious waif Inori suffers from an inherent lack of a personality, as well as a lack of character and motivation. \u201cFuneral Parlor\u201d leader Gai is basically an even more twisted Lelouch vi Britannia. The supporting characters are hardly worth mentioning as they are simply anime character archetypes. \\n\\n\r\nFortunately there are a few areas where Guilty Crown excels in, namely in its production. Guilty Crown deserves top honors in the production department, featuring fluid character animation, high-quality art designs, and a really good soundtrack to round out the package. All of these components add up to make a rather entertaining anime, despite its many flaws in the writing and character department. The opening sequences by supercell and Egoist respectively are well-done and were made with a grand production in both music and display. The ending sequences, performed by supercell, are similarly well produced anime ballads. In other words, Guilty Crown\u2019s production is amazing and they took much more time refining this aspect than in regards to storytelling and character development. \\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s actually rather sad that an anime with such good production values and potential falls flat on its face. Guilty Crown is essentially this tragedy personified, as it honestly could have been something so much more than it turned out to be. Lost in a mess of misapplied concepts and influences, Guilty Crown was truly a disappointment.\\n\\n\r\n6/10\\n",

            "content": "Note that this show isn't finished and I probably won't update this review for ages so my opinions might substantially change.\r\nAnyway, lets begin on a positive note:\r\nArt: Clearly the best part of the series so far. \r\nA lot of detail was put into the art, and it shows clearly with the backgrounds possibly being the most detailed you will ever see, the saturations of colours are amazing, etc. Don't really know how to describe this further so moving on.\r\nMusic: 'Out of place' is probably the correct term to use here. For example, the opening of the FIRST EPISODE had a really soft ballad over ahectic chase scene with giant robots/explosions. In the fight scenes the music is a little more appropriate but it is pushed further down the mix in order to hear more explosions, so it doesn't really create the 'get up, get pumped, fuck shit up' feeling in the viewer (or at least me) that it obviously intended to do. When the music attempts to create tension, the score sounds too orchestral and ends up failing at this.\\n\\n\r\nThe actual quality of the music itself is good, but I don't really like it. However your tastes in music might be way different to mine (listening to dubstep now) so you might end up liking it. Plenty of effort was put here as well, maybe too much in my opinion.\\n\\n\r\nPlot: Basically, a rebel organization named Funeral Parlour is fighting against the government for ?????? reasons while the government (GHQ) are apparently evil and oppressive for ?????? reason. As you can see, plot holes everywhere but I'll give this section the benefit of the doubt and hope it closes the plot holes at the end. \\n\\n\r\nThe 'void' thing was extremely awkwardly handled, but that might be me looking at the synopsis and expecting 'tools' to be undercover spy tools that the MC uses to go all vigilante on the evil plans of 'oppressive gov't', eg stealing weapons, canceling satellite launches, infecting giant robots with viruses, etc. Instead we get this generic action setup where only a few people actually have useful 'voids', so only a few people are important. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Oh boy\\n\r\nThe MC in this show is probably the most unengaging MC that the writers could have possibly put into this show, Which is a shame, because he has moments which have almost entirely convinced me that his entire body is made of a strange kind of plasma substance because this guy is so far completely unharmed after standing near a fire and being only a few metres away from explosions (ears don't even ring!), which probably convinced me that the MC should be a tiny bit more confident than he is (wallows in self pity most of the time when not fighting). \\n\\n\r\nThe other characters have potential, but character development seems extremely forced so far (\"I don't like you even though you saved my life twice! I must obey Gai!) - *facepalm* (\"I don't want to appear weak in from of them! They trust me completely\") - I cannot think of a situation where a leader would want to look weak, so the scene was pretty redundant.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: i was expecting more. Maybe it's my fault that I don't enjoy the series so far, but it isn't engaging my brain in anyway, despite \"cool 148 backup plans\".\\n\\n\r\nSee you guys when this ends!\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

I was being fooled by the pretty art from episode 1 and the fact that it was a Notamina series [they usually have potential].\r\nOk, so the graphics are nice. The ost...ok, but I hate all the songs Inori sings. They have no heart. And up until now I thought that the artist was bad, but after seeing episode 16 I'm starting to feel that maybe they lack heart on purpose?\r\nAnyway, spoilers might follow so if you haven't seen the anime till episode 16 you might want to skip the rest. Or rather, you can read this and skip the animeinstead, because I'm sure you won't want to watch it after you'll hear what I want to say.\\n\\n\r\nThis can somehow be split into 2 seasons. Season 1 are episode 1-12.\\n\r\nWe see how our main character is described as your typical shounen main protagonist. Starts as a wimp, but he has the \"ultimate power\" to draw out voids. Everything is rater predictable and slow peaced. He develops very slow and remains pretty week till the ending of the first season. This apply to the rest of the characters as well. Maybe except Gai and the president chick.\\n\r\nAnyway: they fight for freedom and in the end they save the world from the evil sister that was the one who crated this town to begin with. Confused? Just wait, it gets better... \\n\r\nIf things would have stopped here everyone would have just rated this show as average. An average shounen with a predictable plot and good art. We can dig it.\\n\r\nThen it comes season 2: episode 13-22.\\n\r\nI have seen only the first 4 episodes from this one [aka till ep. 16] but I can tell that this show is using the antihero in the most horrible way possible. \\n\r\nSo, let's start with the first 2 episodes. Everything seems to be going well, they are trying to get better after the war but they are still in quarantine after what happened in episode 12. Of course things will get shitty and the government decides to annihilate all the infected zone without letting any of the survivors out. And how do they do it? By shrinking the space they can go to from time to time. Now that's like applying torture to a group of people who know that they are going to die in the end. Why not just kill them from the start? That I did not understand, but it helped the anime develop into one hell of a \"full of shit\" anime. [please excuse my words...it's because of the frustration]\\n\r\nSo now they need to find a way to get out and not remain without supplies, but it seems that Shu is too kind and is not able to make the right decisions. So after one of the girls dies in a fight he becomes this super evil king that thinks he can save people by killing other people. [Death Note anyone?]\\n\r\nAnd then his mother,  in some sort of a lab, is resurrecting Gai for god knows what reason + she's working with the antibodies now. Plus Inori goes all berserk on the president girl and on some classmates and kills them with cold blood. I knew she was heartless, but that thing now made her no. 1 evil character in this show.\\n\r\nSo we have it like this: Shu [going all berserk in his own world; Death Note style], Inori [the ultimate expressionless assassin or something like that; God, her face annoys me!], the antibodies [evil from the start], Shu's mother [working for the antibodies], the head of the mafia going away after his granddaughter is killed.\\n\r\nIs it just me or is this show left with no main good characters? If you transform all your remaining heroes into anti-heroes who will it be left to fight the bad guys? At this point I'm not rotting for anyone anymore. I really hope they'll just throw a big atomic bomb over Japan and kill them all. [and I really hope no one misunderstands my post, I just want all of them dead except Ayase and the remaining sane people around there].\\n\r\nThere is a very small chance that this show can be saved, so I'm making my review now. If anything will change by the time I reach ep 22 I'll come and revise it.\\n",

            "content": "This really isn't much of a review, more of a first impression from watching the first quarter or so of the series. I may or may not update this in the future.\r\nFrom the outset, I feel like I'm watching a Code Geass clone. It's quite a generic series. The ability of the main character (which allows him to draw out \"Voids\" from people) is even named the \"king's power\" (I recall the Geass being referred to as \"the power of the kings\") and it even has mechas!. The story, from what I've gathered so far, is about your typical shounen main character who has aspecial ability fighting in a resistance movement (\"Undertaker\") against the government. I'm not going to say that having parallels to Code Geass is a bad thing, however, one can see that this isn't going to be a standout series of this season (unless some convoluted, Madoka-esque twist happens very soon) and is in all senses a generic series of average quality.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are fair - again, we have a somewhat generic cast. Shu, our main character who starts off as a \"wimp\" but in more recent episodes seems to have become more confident, Iniori, your typical quiet female who seems to have some connection with Shu and Gai, your typical anime badass who is the leader of Undertaker. None of them come off as particularly memorable characters, although it might be too early to make such a call.\\n\\n\r\nThe art however is exceptional, and I'd say it ranks among the top of this season. The characters look good and the animated sequences are usually fluid and appealing for the eyes. The sound is also quite good with the soundtrack being performed by supercell and all.\\n\\n\r\nAt the moment it is your average and rather generic anime. Unlike some other anime of this year, it isn't downright horrible or unwatchable in any sense and it is certainly a very visually stunning series, however, I ultimately don't think it's worthy of these 9 or 10 reviews it seems to be getting. If you really liked series like Code Geass then you should probably check this out and see whether or not you enjoy it. Otherwise, I wouldn't personally recommend it.\\n",

After watching the first few episodes I realised how bad this anime was, it had potential but was ruined with shallow characters and little development. I decided to continue watching to see if it improved as I went along but to no avail. If i had watched this before CG and was told that CG was similar to this I would have never even considered watching it. \r\nThis anime is one of the worst I've seen my list may befew but I have no preference to which type I watch. This is complete and utter filth. I have to vote this as a score of 1 to counter-act the amount of fan boys who scored it a 10 on its first episode after seeing some fan service and familiar plot which was awful",

            "content": "\u201cThe right to use my friend as a weapon. That is the sinful crown I shall adorn.\u201d\nIntro: Whether you like it or not, opinions from others can affect an experience. This can also become apparent when you watch an anime. If you hear negative opinions, you end up going in with low expectations and you might enjoy it more. Set your expectations too high, and you end up disappointed. Today I\u2019ll be reviewing Guilty Crown, an anime that was really freaking popular back in 2011. But unfortunately back then I wasn\u2019t into anime so after hearing generally mixed opinions about it, I decided to checkit out for myself. So was it a decent anime or does it completely crash and burn? Well let\u2019s find out.\\n\\n\nStory: The story of Guilty Crown takes place in the year 2039 in Japan. 10 years prior an apocalyptic event known as Lost Christmas spread a cancerous disease known as the Apocalypse Virus throughout Japan. Since then Japan has relied on a multinational organization called the GHQ to get them out of these hard times. The GHQ however does not care about Japan or its people and use the Apocalypse Virus as an excuse to slaughter innocent civilians. A rebellion organization named Funeral Parlor was created in order to free Japan from the grip of the GHQ while saving the people of Japan in the process. \\n\\n\n\tI\u2019ll be honest, the story in Guilty Crown is a complete and utter mess. The plot comes off as jumbled and confusing. And the story is full of clich\u00e9s and terribly written plot points. It gets worse in the second half when the story has ass pulls so big I\u2019m pretty sure the story was left with an asshole the size of the Mariana Trench. I thought that the story had a lot of potential with its plot set up but it completely fails to capitalize on it. Most of the time it just leaves you feeling confused and to an extent you might even start to get pissed off at the show. I feel that the story in Guilty Crown tries to cram too many elements together leaving you in a state of confusion throughout the story. This is one of the many weak points that Guilty Crown has. And trust me, not just its story has problems.\\n\\n\nCharacters: The main character for Guilty Crown is Shu Ouma, a normal 17 year old highschool student who ends up right in the middle of the conflict once he obtains the mysterious and supernatural power know has the Guilty Crown. This power gives him the ability to extract a person\u2019s \u201cVoid\u201d.  A \u201cVoid\u201d can best be described as a physical manifestation of a person\u2019s heart. He is then recruited into Funeral Parlor so he can help bring an end to this war.\\n\\n\n\tNow the Guilty Crown power that Shu obtains is where some of the plot holes come up. It helps create what is known as Deus Ex Machina writing. For the uninformed, Deus Ex Machina writing is defined as:\\n\\n\n\t\u201cA plot device whereby a seemingly unsolvable problem is suddenly and abruptly resolved by the contrived and unexpected intervention of some new event, character, ability, or object. Depending on how it is done, it can be intended to move the story forward when the writer has \"painted himself into a corner\" and sees no other way out, to surprise the audience, to bring a happy ending into the tale, or as a comedic device.\u201d\\n\\n\n\tSo you have a door that needs to be opened? Look, conveniently there\u2019s a Void that can do that! What\u2019s that? We\u2019re all about to die? How can we be saved from that? Let\u2019s just fuse Voids together! The Guilty Crown even has rules and limits to its power. But those rules and limits don\u2019t apply to it when the plot demands it. This is something that infuriated me when I was watching this at first. The lack of consistency holds the story back.\\n\\n\n\tI\u2019ve noticed that when people talk about the characters in Guilty Crown, most of them don\u2019t like Shu as a character. Everyone complains that he\u2019s too weak or indecisive making him one of their least favorite characters. Now while I agree that these are some of Shu\u2019s flaws, I didn\u2019t hate him. Hell I thought he was a great character. While yes he has these issues, I was actually able to relate to him and some of the social problems that he has. There were times where I could see why he was acting weak or indecisive and I didn\u2019t hate him for it. Shu gets plenty of development in the second half of the show, even though for a short period of time in the second half he becomes an unlikable prick. So unlike most people I found Shu to be a good main character and he ended up being my favorite in the show.\\n\\n\n\tInori is the name for our female lead in Guilty Crown. She is known to be a famous pop singer in Japan and I have one word to describe her: Lifeless. She basically has the personality of a cardboard box crossed with Kirsten Dunst. I DID NOT LIKE HER. Throughout the entirety of Guilty Crown she has almost no point. Inori basically serves as a plot device to give Shu motivation for the second half of the show. The romance between Shu and Inori felt forced and awkward and as a whole unsatisfying. It just goes to show that even though you\u2019re hot as hell, it doesn\u2019t make up for the fact that you have no personality. \\n\\n\n\tThe last main character is Gai. Gai is the leading member of Funeral Parlor and he actually showed promise in the beginning episodes of the anime. But once we get to the second half of Guilty Crown, he becomes the embodiment of Deus ex Machina writing. What happens with him in the second half is considered to be the worst part of Guilty Crown\u2019s story. This caused him to be one of my least favorite characters in this anime. \\n\\n\n\tActually the characters in Guilty Crown are one of its major problems. Guilty Crown tends to introduce a lot of characters at once and gives them all little to no development whatsoever. In fact I find it hard to actually remember a lot of the side characters names, even when I was watching the show. I just gave them nicknames like Asshole, Comic Relief, Cat Girl, and Slut. The only character that I felt got enough character development for me to like them was Shu. The characters were a definite disappointment in Guilty Crown. I wish some of them got more development then they did. Then maybe they would be good characters. Or maybe if some of these side characters served a point. This is one of Guilty Crown\u2019s biggest weakpoints.\\n\\n\nAnimation: One of the things in Guilty Crown that I will give universal praise, is the animation. The animation is BEAUTIFUL. Production I.G. did a truly amazing job with Guilty Crown. The animation is consistently great looking. The character designs, the movement, the colors, the action sequences, everything is visually appealing and there are little to no errors with consistency throughout. \\n\\n\nGuilty Crown was directed by Tetsur\u014d Araki, who is most well-known for directing shows like Death Note, Highschool of the Dead, and Attack on Titan. And just like the shows I mentioned, Guilty Crown has amazing action scenes. The points in Guilty Crown where I had the most fun were definitely the action scenes. The combination of animation and music made them my favorite part of the anime. It is probably one of the reasons people watched this anime in the first place. The animation is a definite strong point for the anime and I can\u2019t praise it enough.\\n\\n\nSound: Speaking of the music. THE MUSIC. Throughout all of Guilty Crown I never had one problem with the music. Guilty Crown\u2019s soundtrack is filled with powerful songs for both the action and the story heavy scenes. Upon watching Guilty Crown, its soundtrack quickly crawled up into my favorite anime OST\u2019s of all time. The music is overall amazing.\\n\\n\n\tGuilty Crown has recently gotten a DUB by FUNimation. The English DUB and Japanese DUB are both very well done. I would even consider this one of the best DUBs FUNimation has ever done. Austin Tindle does a fantastic job playing the role of Shu, making him sound nervous but also confident when he has to. While I didn\u2019t like Inori, Alexis Tipton did a great job portraying her character. In fact the only character that seemed to be off in the DUB is Monica Rial as Tsugumi. Overall the DUB is great and I would recommend either the SUB or the DUB to anyone wanting to watch the show. You guys are good with either one.\\n\\n\nEnjoyment: Judging by the large amount of bitching I\u2019ve done throughout this review, you would assume that I hated Guilty Crown. Well actually it was the opposite, I loved Guilty Crown. You see before watching it, I heard generally mixed to negative things about Guilty Crown. So I went into it with low expectations. Due to this I was able to enjoy it more than others. Yes the story and characters were pissing me off. But once I got to around the halfway point, I decided to stop taking them seriously and I had a much better time because of it. I believe that if you want to truly enjoy Guilty Crown you need to accept it for what it is, pure entertainment. I believe you will have a much better time doing so. I know I did. Hell, I\u2019m pretty sure that\u2019s what most people who enjoy Guilty Crown did. My recommendation is to just shut your brain off and enjoy it for what it is.\\n\\n\nConclusion: Guilty Crown is an anime filled with problems. A plot filled with holes and ass pulls, some uninspiring characters, and serious writing issues. But Guilty Crown is saved by its amazing animation and music, a fantastic DUB, and just being all around entertaining show. Guilty Crown is not for everyone, but if you don\u2019t take the story and characters seriously, you might find a show worth watching. I give Guilty Crown a final score of: 8/10\\n",

            "content": "Guilty Crown is a very good example of a anime that throws away the potential originality, in favor of generic action tropes and overdone characterization also a cluster of big budgets, big ideas, many cliches, often bad execution, and a truly horrible fanbase. It uses asspull after asspull and wasn't enjoyable enough for them to be overlooked. The characters were bland and only a few were even slightly likable(Dan, Hare, Cripple, etc), it used every anime cliche in the book, the plot was beyond generic, and it obviously took from other anime without fully understanding what made them good in the first place.\r\nThe part ofthe show where Shu is basically king of the school should have been pretty much the entire anime. That arc had tension, politics, polarizing debate, stuff to really make the show interesting and keep its viewers intrigued. The unique concepts the anime had were used well here. Fuck Gai, fuck Funeral Parlour, it was an entirely wasted 10 episodes in the long run. I honestly, honestly can't believe the writers thought they were making the next GiTS when they were writing that abortion.\\n\\n\r\nFrom there on It isn't coherent, the character development is flawed, they didn't answer all questions and Inori has almost no personality. I dislike almost everything about Guilty crown but I kinda of liked the end. Everything I felt...it was not for Guilty Crown itself. Just the end. It was remotely nice and kinda bitter sweet. So that's why I'd give it a 4 instead a 1.  \\n",

            "content": "\"There are no innocents fighting a war\"\r\nspecially when it comes to the front line.\r\nIf you are fighting, you're fight for an ideal, fighting to protect the lives of the ones you cherish, but in order to do it you're ceasing the lives of those who oppose you. Inevitably, together with it comes a feeling that question if what you are doing is right or is wrong.\r\nThis feeling is called Guilt. The main focus of this anime.\r\nThis review will follow a different approach than the majority here. Trying to present a different viewpoint.\r\nAnybody who searches through reviews will noticed that a lot of people gave prettylow scores to this series, and even lower to its story. Why is it? There will never be a consensus, since each reviewer have a personal interpretation of the matter, however, I strongly believe these scores results from a unexpected complexity of the storyline, not common to action animes.\\n\r\nFrom the surface, Guilty Crown seems just like any other action/battle shounen series, the first episodes will really remind -those who watched- of a certain series that also has mecha and this genetic/genome element on it. However, as the story progresses it becomes clear that its storyline is way denser and heavier than it appears to be. If it happened to disappoint so many people, this is because it was badly driven and poorly organized at critical turning points, but it certain had the elements to be a masterpiece. \\n\r\nThis is something to give credit for.\\n\r\nAnother common complain is its ending. This review won't touch this matter. It's unreasonable to blame the series for not making the ending you wanted. It wasn't a ambiguous neither a vague ending, so there are no complains towards it. \\n\r\nMany people misinterpret what this anime really is about. It isn't a romance, neither a adventure, it's far from it. Interesting that some OST gives a clue of its true motivators, and yet, many seems to not get it. (Listen to the OST -Ready To Go)\\n\r\nGuilty Crown is about how a society can go to ruin when a crisis appears, how power can corrupt, the importance of friends, and specially, family. One can simply watch it for the battle scenes (worth mention: their background music was really well elaborated) but should have in mind the story isn't simple as a swordplay like that. \\n\\n\r\nThe reason why Guilty Crown story collapses on itself is the amount of different elements presented in a short period of time. Imagine a book series. One of those trilogies that each book have more than 500 pages, no pictures, and a heavy built background story. Now take everything and compress into a 22 episode anime series. There is no way it would have room for everything. Guilty Crown tries to tell a entire saga from it's birth, through its glory and till its fall. New action and thrilling elements are introduced non-stop to a point the viewer starts to question what is all that about anyway, and this is where Production I.G lost it.\\n\r\nThe big mystery, the key for the story, was perfectly and cleverly elaborated, hidden from the beginning till the end and when it was time for the curtain to fall, it closed up with a grand-finally that just a few could say they saw it coming.\\n\r\nHowever, while the writers were focusing into elaborating this solo segment of the story, they complete piece was running towards a dead end, with a absurd amount of loose ends and continuation mistakes. In order to save it, they manipulated the original structure of the characters, performing a completely change of ideology and personality of some of them. This, not the story, ruined Guilty Crown's kingdom.\\n\\n\r\nThis sudden change in some characters is what did the most impact on this show dignity. People sure change as time goes by, and some tragic or happy events can also make their feelings and attitudes to change. However, nobody goes through a complete ethical and moralistic meltdown from the night to day, neither someone can recover from days of suffering in a blink of an eye. Perhaps if the second arc of the anime was divided from its main piece as a second season, it would be easier to swallow, but the way it was done, doesn't mater how you see it, it's too abrupt. -Dear Production I.G, just one \"breather episode\" (ep.13) can't possibly be enough to shoulder a change like that.\\n\r\nAlso, interesting to mention, Shu -our protagonist- isn't the \"hero\" of the series. The character that holds this significance is another, but in order to now spoil it, I'll void its name. Shu, instead, is the figure of the anti-hero. That is why it's correct to expect from him some attitudes he took, and that is also why some changes in his character are acceptable. He drives away from the pattern of shounen's heroes. Where the protagonist \"seeks power to protect\", he is afraid of it, is insecure, childish and lacks of determination. If Guilty Crown has any of originality on it, it's right on this topic.\\n\\n\r\nEven though, the OST makes up for this series. The reason why I can give it a solid 8 is because of the magnificent job that was done regarding the sound production. From all the little blasts or fire effects to complex insert songs, they all sounded real, equating to a cinematographic production. These insert song, themselves holds an important meaning on the story and also works as a breather for action-packed scenes.\\n\r\nThe reason why the enjoyment reached a fair score was also due to the pieces chosen for some key scenes. Strong operas at some parts, along with epic fast-paced drum & bass, and even some classic-style compositions, turns the entire sound division an pleasure to listen.\\n\\n\r\nI prefer to consider Guilty Crown as a deviant series. Not for what is on its surface, neither for its concept. But for hidden aspects of the show. First, some subtle dark humor in the villains dialogue aligned to a curious irony in some episodes and twists of the story. Second, for the way it manages to be eccentric at times but still don't loose its main characteristics as a \"battle shounen\". The final couple of episodes brings ideological senses with a \"sweet\" sarcasm that you gotta be courageous to try it. That conflict of what is sick and what is beautiful contrascenes with what is right and what is wrong.\\n\\n\r\nIt is the most honest truth say this series is fascinating. Fascinating, and this is it. \\n\r\nIt failed in so many aspects it becomes hard to give it a higher score. However, it is entertaining, have some alluring elements -I'm not talking about Inori (...) Or maybe I am?- and ends the game with a interesting plot twist plus a acceptable epilogue. \\n\r\nAt least, I'm glad this didn't end up being a 200 eps. anime.\\n\r\nNumeric score: Story 10 - Art 8 - Sound 10 - Character 4 - Enjoyment 7 - Overall 8. \\n\r\n(You know you can see it by clicking the hyperlink where it says \"overall\" right?)\\n\\n\r\nPutting it simply. Definitely worth watching for its uniqueness. For being... Exceptionally ordinary.",

            "content": "When I saw a preview of this anime I thought 'This seems like it can be good and it'll help me kill some time while I wait for new episodes of recent animes to air'\r\nHowever, when I began watching I thought 'Let me guess, he's an ordinary HS boy who meets a chick and gets powers.'\r\nSure enough that's just what happens. Honestly, it's to the point where anime creators don't even bother hiding the fact that their story line are a generic cliche. Mind you, cliches exists in all forms of the media but when your industry is saturated with the same story told overand over and over again then perhaps you should try a new story or give the audience a different spin on the story. But then again, what's one more generic story heaped on there, right? They all manage to become successful anyway, right? right? sigh.\\n\\n\r\nSo the story is about some poor, innocent Japanese High school boy who for some odd reason has his homework and computer sitting in an abandoned warehouse, we'll just pretend this is normal and not actually an illogical way to get the boy to meet the girl. Anyway,  some mystical monotone talking anime chick with powers just so happens to end up while she is being chased by some goons with guns...\\n\\n\r\nSee where this is going?\\n\\n\r\nSo she is injured and of course we now have to see how innocent and lovely she is by having her sing a song randomly. Never mind the fact that she is injured and dudes with guns are looking for her. Yeah it's totally smart to draw the guys with guns to you by pretending like you're on Glee.\\n\\n\r\nSo the sweet, innocent, high school anime boy archetype finds her first and is of course instantly in love with her. Cause you know, watching someone with big shimmering eyes means that you have found your soul mate at seventeen. They have a \"misunderstanding\" where she or her little robot attacks him, mind you, not lethally...Yeah let's just forget that she should be expecting dudes with guns.\\n\\n\r\nThey have a little moment of her watching his video homework and she calls it beautiful to establish their connection.\\n\\n\r\nDudes with guns finally appear and threaten the boy and take the girl away. Pretty much, the boy gets the location of where to take the robot from the robot (cause the story has to progress) and he meets the leader of a \"terrorist\" organization. Stuff happens and he gets powers and can fight suddenly while the girl falls helplessly in his arms with her wh*re clothes on.\\n\\n\r\nThe anime tries to have moments of depths after the boy joins their terrorist group by putting him in a possible position to betray the group's leader, for some reason can't have the power himself. But that plots falls flat fast and you're basically just watching a simple good guys vs bad guys where the good guy's leader does questionable things but is still good because everyone is happy and loves him. This anime is pretty much a weaker Eureka 7 that fails miserably. None of the characters are worth rooting for, the plot is paper thin and transparent, and over all not very enjoyable.\\n\\n\r\nLook out for the following cliches that other animes have done much better:\\n\\n\r\nAnime boy is in HS\\n\r\nAnime girl is in terrorist group \\n\r\nAnime boy meets and fall in love with Anime girl\\n\r\nAnime girl has obligation towards terrorist leader (He gave her a name *eye roll*)\\n\r\nAnime boy gets random powers\\n\r\nAnime boy now joins terrorist group cause for some reason they NEED him to save them. Never mind the fact that their members are stronger and have more of a cause to fight than him.\\n\r\nAnime boy gets jealous of terrorist leader's relationship with Anime girl.\\n\r\nAnime girl tells Anime boy to simply trust and believe for him to fall in line\\n\r\nAnime girl dresses like a wh*re but can shoot a gun with perfect accuracy and is better than all the other characters.\\n\r\nAnime girl suddenly enters HS and ends up in Anime boy's class\\n\r\nBad guys are interested in Anime boy\\n",

            "content": "In a word: OUTSTANDING\r\nnow, this series seems to be getting insane amount of hate.\r\nusual complaints from my observation (note, DROPPED can be substituted with GC is crap):\r\n1. OMG! rebellion! Code Geass Ripoff! weapon from chest? OM, Dantalian ripoff! DROPPED\r\n2. Shoe is Annoying! DROPPED\r\n3. tits bouncing! absolute cleavage! DROPPED\r\n4. boy meets girl? boy gets powers not originally for him? sudden drastic change of life? bishies and bishous? genius leader? brutal antagonists? CLICHE STORM!!! DROPPED\r\n5. Plot Armor! Ass Pull! DROPPED\r\n6. (insert random reason) DROPPED\r\nokay, that pretty much summarizes most complaints i think. now, on to the review:\r\nStory: 10/10\r\nWhile nothing original and obviously very familiar as evident inthe usual complaints.  It's a nonetheless tried and tested and have produced classics outside anime.  The story is told properly. they don't attempt to cram everything in one episode and tells the piece by piece.   each episode (so far) introduces new characters and develops the ones in the previous episodes.\\n\\n\r\nSure they use cliches here and there. but that's exactly what makes it awesome. since it's familiar you wouldn't have trouble digesting the story. though admittedly i had to rewatch the first five episodes because of my previous \"OMG awesome everything! ignore plot!\" way of watching. also, the main character can get VERY annoying at times. (note: this is an understatement)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nLook at the previews and the official art. now, watch the anime itself. and now pickup your dropped jaw. the character (and not to mention the COSTUME) design are great. the mecha's are detailed. the environment is even more detailed. and The special effects feel very integrated. also, great camera work.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nOne word: EGOIST. the in-universe music group's music really lives up to it's in-universe popularity. and action scenes get awesome background music. Sound effects are pretty fitting too. and lastly, the powerup music.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nOkay, so the protagonist is your \"Ordinary Highschool Student\" who is also coincidentally a huge jerk. Probably just like most of us. and there's this \"Perfect Girl\" who wears a skimpy outfit most of the time and has a great voice. and is also very skillful at other things (may or may not include seducing people). and there's the \"bishounen strategist with attitude\" who is badass in every way. but hides a secret.\\n\\n\r\npretty familiar right? But it doesn't make them flat at all. and those are just the main characters. each supporting characters with prominent roles in the episodes are given good amounts of character depth. flat characters are also developed minimally and their deaths are foreshadowed. and when they do die they do a good job doing it. i.e. a bad guy deserves it, a good guy is sympathetic.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nNow, I wouldn't defend this nor give it a high rating and praise if i didn't enjoy it would i?\\n\\n\r\nTo summarize: Lovable characters (including the annoying protagonist), great art, great music, great (if rather cliche) plot.\\n\\n\r\nInstead of reading these biased in every way reviews though go watch this and judge for yourself. Because the high rating reviews ignore the flaws, which are greatly overshadowed by awesomeness, by the way; and low rating reviews see nothing but flaws, and the great art.",

            "content": "When you build something up to impossibly high standards, it's inevitable that thing will fail to live up to those standards. Guilty Crown was built up to be an epic, God-Tier Anime, and that's understandable. Art by Redjuice, music by Supercell, and directed by Tatsurou-Sensei. That sounds like a pretty epic combination. However, the end result is, in fact, not epic. Not God-Tier. Now, don't get me wrong. It isn't that Guilty Crown is a BAD Anime, by any means. It just isn't as outstanding as most people built it up to be. I would imagine that's why it's getting so much hate. Well, that,coupled with plain ignorance (if you haven't seen more then one episode, you have no right to be bashing any Anime).\\n\\n\r\nWell, that's my opinion on why these particular haters are hating. Now, onto an actual review...\\n\\n\r\nStory: 7\\n\r\nIs the story completely original? No. But, what is these days? I'm not saying completely original Anime don't come out nowadays, I'm just saying that, for as long as it's been around, it's to be expected that some ideas would be recycled. I'm not going to go into the comparison of Guilty Crown with another series that has strikingly similar initials. When I judge an Anime, I look at it as an independent work. So, when judging the story, I will look at the story of Guilty Crown, and ONLY the story of Guilty Crown. Which, I must say, is pretty good. It's interesting, but more importantly, it's entertaining.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 10\\n\r\nWhat can I say? It's beautiful. Even the haters will admit to that.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9\\n\r\nSee art.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 6\\n\r\nMy only real complaint with the series so far is the character development. Sometimes it seems forced, others it's non-existent, which can be infuriating. I mean, really, who want's to see a ball-less protagonist?\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8\\n\r\nI can honestly say that there has not been a moment watching Guilty Crown that I did not enjoy, and hardly any episode that I was not on the edge of my seat come the credits.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8\\n\r\nGuilty Crown is not BAD by any means, it just isn't GREAT. It's good... Very good.\\n\\n\r\nOk, so less of a review and more of a defense. This is my first review. If you've read this far, then thank you ^^",

            "content": "The most hyped show of 2011, but is all the hype worth it? To be blunt, no and if you can't see that you probably haven't absorbed a lot of media or you are a twelvie.\r\nStory: 5/10- interesting, but poorly executed.\r\n Neon Genesis Evangelion + Code Geass + darker than black + a hole lot of S*** = Guilty Crown\r\nThis show tried it\u2019s absolute hardest to steal from other anime whether it be the seemingly pointless episodic structure of Darker than Black, the group of freedom fighters led by an anti-hero in Code Geass and if I mention the numerous Neon Genesis Evangelion references throughoutthe show it would spoil a lot of the plot, so I wont. It also has every single generic episode in the book such as the swimsuit episode, the ship/cruise episode and what a surprise it's based in a highschool! Japan, you sure like your schools, dont you? \\n\\n\r\n Another thing to note about this anime is it\u2019s writing, which feels a lot like fan-fiction, and not your good kind of fan-fiction written by someone who is actually passed there English classes in school, I mean the fan-fiction written by unpopular fourteen year old girls who think they have a good grasp on love even though they have never felt it. A true shame considering if this show had done the story or the characters right they would have had quite a good anime on there hands. However the show does have an \"interesting\" premise even If it is wishy-washy eighty percent of the time so, to sum up, this show puts the \u201ccorn\u201d in corny and can only be watched with your brain turned off (figuratively).\\n\\n\r\nArt and Animation 9/10: \\n\r\nThis show has created a phenomenon that I like to call the \u201cGuilty Crown Effect\u201d (everything sounds better if you add \u201ceffect\u201d to the end of it). This is when a show has amazing animation and art but awful characters and story and somehow manages to get fan-boys/girls screaming about how amazing EVERYTHING is. Getting back on topic, the art is crisp and the animation is in my opinion, the best of its time. It also avoids lazy animating such as making the background or scenery move instead of the characters, moving the bodies slowly up and down to simulate walking or my personal favourite, moving the camera to a spot which would require less animation which is something that one show it copied is quite famous for.\\n\\n\\n\r\nMusic 10/10:\\n\r\n The best part of the show, it created some feeling to scenes that would normally warrant no feeling from me, which, was to be expected after seeing Ryo and Supercell were working on this project. If you don\u2019t know Supercell is a group that have created many catchy and famous Hatsune Miku songs such as Black Rock Shooter, Odds and Ends and World is mine and have also written music for Claris (Mahou Shoujo Madocka Magica) and Kotoko (Shakugan no Shana, Ano Natsu de Matteru). In short the openings and endings are catchy and contain smarter writing than the show itself.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters 4/10:\\n\r\nShu: A wannabee Shinji who just runs away for half of this show and magically dodges bullets because getting hit by bullets is only for hipster protagonists or something. He occasionally shows moments of badassness but when it happens it feels extremely shallow and just happens for the show to move forward. He is relate-able for a large amount of teenagers at the start of the show and is constantly trying to be Gai.\\n\\n\r\nInori: soft spoken and cute so basically top-tier waifu material. She is another badass who likes to shoot guns and is probably a gymnast as she can do gravity defying flips and dodge bullets. She is as generic as every other character in this show and quite forgettable unless you watch a lot of 18+ material.\\n\\n\r\nGai: leader of a terrorist group known as funeral parlour, he tries really hard to be Hei from Darker than Black and is your generic badass character. He has no clear motive for leading Funeral Parlour and apparently no one ever questions this. \\n\\n\\n\r\nPersonal enjoyment-8/10\\n\r\nI actually liked this show a lot and was a rather quick watch for me. If it wasn\u2019t for the god-awful ending and some other large quarrels with this show it would have been a nine.\\n\\n\r\nSummary\\n\r\nAn extremely enjoyable show with poor writing, story and characters. A definite pop-corn flick, but Shingeki no kyojin exists so just go watch that if you want top-tier animation. Now if you will excuse me I have a date with itunes.\\n\\n\r\n~SAO and guilty crown are equal.\\n\\n",

            "content": "Guilty Crown Review:\r\nSheesh.... This show... just... I don't know. It really was awful. But at the same time.... it was great? What's wrong with me!? Why can't I figure out if this show was good or not!? AHHH!\r\nAll kidding aside, it's funny that the name of this show is Guilty Crown because if there is any phrase to describe my feelings toward it, it would be \"guilty pleasure.\"\r\nStory 6/10:\r\nGuilty Crown takes place in future Japan, where a disease has ravaged its way through the city. The government is corrupt and killing anybody who they think is infected, thus causing a terrorist group called \"Funeral Parlor\"to fight against them. Enter our main protagonist Shu who accidentally gets a super power to pull out weapons from people's hearts. Shu is forced to join Funeral Parlor and fight against the government. Cliche anyone? Of course, much like far too many shows nowadays, the entire focus of the plot shifts halfway through, but I will avoid talking about it because of spoilers. \\n\r\nHm. This is without a doubt the hardest aspect of the show to rate. This story suffered GREATLY due to its writing. First off, the show just takes itself wayyy too seriously. I mean, if a show doesn't take a break to relax and show what \"good\" life is, then it's hard to see what exactly it is that everyone is fighting for. It also has a hard time identifying itself at first and really tries to do too much. But, the REAL main problem was that there were sooo many plotholes and inconsistencies that it was almost comical. The lack of logic that the characters had was also tear inducing. Some random and fun plotholes are: where on earth were the teachers at this school? Since when does student government have so much power? How does the nobody notice all the massacres the government performs? Why didn't somebody kill Inori long before the show even started? I won't get too deep into why there are so many errors in the writing, but trust me, there are a lot. \\n\r\nSo why did I still give this story a 6 if it was as bad as I said? Well as embarrassing as the writing could get, the writing could also be, well, great. Wait... what did I just say? Well, seeing as the writer and director were involved in works like Code Geass and Death Note, it would be quite unusual to not see flashes of brilliance in the story (I will not go into this do to spoilers, just know that this show does have its moments). Although the whole base of the story is a huge \"kid gets superpowers and joins a ragtag team to defeat the corrupt government\" cliche, it did have an interesting background to make it unique within this cliche. Some plot twist (while often poorly detailed) were indeed surprising, and the show did do a great job of maintaining suspense and making you want to marathon the show instead of taking your time. However, the strong points of the writing could be eerily similar to those in Code Geass, making it seem somewhat unoriginal. \\n\r\nThis is one of those shows that is convoluted at its finest, and will somehow keep you interested in the story even though it fails to explain why or how half of the stuff is even happening. The story is just full of hit or miss elements, shining gloriously one moment, then falling down the stairs and landing on its face the next. The story was definitely enjoyable, but was majorly held back by its inconsistency.\\n\\n\r\nWow that was a lot of writing. Don't worry, it gets easier after that.\\n\\n\r\nArt 8/10:\\n\r\nGuilty Crown really does have great animation. The lighting isn't particularly special, but the character models, movements, colors, and just overall feel were definitely high end. This is the kind of animation you hope to see out of more modern anime and is truly impressive.\\n\\n\r\nSound 8/10:\\n\r\nMuch like the art, the sound in this show was very high class. The openings and endings were great and the vocal tracks used in the show were good too (although sometimes overused). The background music wasn't particularly notable compared to the vocal tracks, but I never heard anything out of place, and the music only enhanced the vibe in the show. The voice acting for the Japanese version was nothing special as far as I could see, but I usually hold back judgement on this unless it is really special seeing as I don't even speak Japanese.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 5/10:\\n\r\nEven more flawed than the story were the show's characters. The two leads were Shu and Inori. Shu starts off as a wimpy high school student who doesn't want to get involved, then like all other wimpy leads, slowly becomes more confident. His development doesn't end there though! Shu's personality flip flops so many times that it is almost ridiculous. Why Inori claims to have loved him throughout this entire time is beyond me, seeing as he was at least 5 different personas in the show. To add onto his multiple personality disorder, he has almost no backstory, and the only backstory he does have is poorly explained. This goes for everyone else involved in this flashback. The characters aren't really developed, instead they just briefly explain how everything happened when they were kids, not why the characters acted how they did. Gai is similar to Shu, where his personality changes multiple times during the show, and it never quite explains his reasoning or actions. Inori also has to go down as one of the most uninteresting female leads of all time. She basically is confined to one liners and barely shows any emotion throughout the entire show. The side characters weren't nearly as bad, but they too lacked any back story or true motives for their actions. It's also sad to see probably the two most interesting characters (Daryl and Segai) get pushed aside for most of the show in favor of more bland ones. Now even though the characters were extremely flawed, it was still interesting to watch how they acted in certain situations. Although I'm sure it was unintentional, the poor portrayals of the characters, along with their complete lack of ability to use logic and reason, actually helped them become more unpredictable and fun to watch. The characters weren't necessarily \"bad\" because to be \"bad\" you really need to be annoying, or something that makes me cringe while watching. The characters were just lacking in anything that could make me attach to them, and many shows have this problem. It's just that with a plot as heavy as Guilty Crown's, you kind of need to establish strong characters.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 6/10:\\n\r\nGuilty Crown did one thing right in this department: it kept me watching. It's one of those shows that keeps you wanting more due to its piling on of questions and cliffhangers. At times I could be pretty shocked by what happened in the story. However, I never laughed, nor even came close to getting emotional. The show really does try to be emotional, but the glaring mistakes this show has makes all of these attempts at being emotional feel forced, sometimes adding even more questions. Usually errors in writing don't really bug me, but when they start interfering with my connection to the show, then you know it's serious. I did like Guilty Crown, no doubt about it, but it also wasn't even remotely hard to see its faults.\\n\\n\r\nRecommendation:\\n\r\nI really can't recommend this show sadly because it is just too flawed. I'm sure many others may love this show, but the chances of that aren't high enough for me to tell you to go out and watch this.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 6.8/10:\\n\r\nGuilty Crown was very strange for me. Usually with shows like this, people either love it, or hate it. For me, it was both. It sounds strange, but for every glaring mistake this show had, it also had a shining moment. Yes the characters were relatively weak, and there were plot holes all over the place. But, Guilty Crown is no pile of crap either. It succeeds in telling an interesting tale that will keep you interested throughout. Add in its stand out performance in animation and music and you easily have an above average anime. Many people hate this show, and many people love it. I didn't love it, but it was definitely worth my time watching.\\n\\n\r\nThe Verdict:\\n\r\nA thrilling ride that fails to reach its potential due to poor writing.\\n\\n\r\nPros:\\n\r\n+ Thrilling, kept me wanting to know what happens next\\n\r\n+ Vocal music pieces are stellar\\n\r\n+ Ending was actually very satisfying\\n\r\n+ Quality animation\\n\\n\r\nCons:\\n\r\n- Plot holes everywhere\\n\r\n- Poorly developed characters\\n\r\n- Fails to deliver in emotional moments\\n\\n\r\nIf you liked Guilty Crown, watch...\\n\r\nCode Geass:\\n\r\nThis is the obvious one. Mecha. Intense. Cliffhangers. Main character with a super power. Yep. But believe me when I say that Code Geass is far superior in the character and storytelling departments.\\n\r\nGurren Lagaan:\\n\r\nIf you enjoy nonstop mech action and fun and have the wonderful ability to turn your brain off while watching a show, you will also enjoy Gurren Lagaan like I did.\\n\\n\r\n6.8 - Good",

            "content": "\"My Heart is the Worst Kind of Weapon\" \r\nPreface: \r\nGuilty Crown has a bit of a bad rap in the anime community. One side proclaims it as a huge ripoff of popular series like Code Geass and Death Note, and another decries it as a flashy, plot hole and cliche ridden mess with unlikable characters. While I do think that there are very valid criticisms of the plot development and illogical actions taken by the characters, I don't think that it stops this show from being enjoyable. \r\nWithout further ado: \r\nArtwork and Animation: 9\r\nI've never been a huge Production IG animation fan, but I haveto hand it to them- Guilty Crown looks really good. It's extremely fluid, and the character designs are very reminiscent of Ghost in the Shell. The CGI, while not ufotable quality, is also pretty watchable. It, at least, didn't make me want to vomit. The real beauty in this anime comes from the gorgeous backgrounds and fluidity of character movement. Someone at Production IG studied their physiological kinetics, because the characters move excellently. When they get shot, their limbs hang, they limp appropriately, and the expressions on their faces are pretty human as well. \\n\\n\r\nThe animation is overall very consistent, and vibrantly colored in juxtaposition to the dark, brooding atmosphere and backgrounds, particularly in the second half. Characters like Inori, Ayase, and Tsugumi really pop where the others are in drab or black. \\n\\n\r\nThere's also the hand of Tetsuro Araki, which is very present in Guilty Crown. His feel for dramatics and excellent use of angles don't go unused here. Long uncut shots, deep sweeps and long pans over extremely fleshed out backgrounds give the show a grandiose feel. Small details like reflections of people's faces in glasses, off windows, and computer screens, along with over the shoulder, or through shots really make the cinematography very movie-like. \\n\r\nThere are plenty of enormous, illustriously illustrated backdrops that make for epic setpieces. These coupled with the soundtrack really make for a wowing experience on the audio and visual front. \\n\\n\\n\r\nSound and Voice Acting: 10\\n\\n\r\nGuilty Crown is a bit experimental in this department. Similarly to how FLCL used one group, The Pillows, to record the entire OST, Hiroyuki Sawano used a group called Supercell (actually inserted and fictionalized in the anime as a musical artist named EGOIST) for the openings, endings, and the insert songs, along with some featured artists. Boy, has he outdone himself this time. \\n\\n\r\nThe openings and endings are all four very listenable and enjoyable songs, but the award goes to the song \"Bios\", with Mika Kobayashi as the featured singer. The reader might recognize her from... I don't know... DOOOOOOOOONT LOOOOOOOOOSE YOUR WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAY!!\\n\r\nBios has all the makings of a 'successful' and well produced atmospheric and mood enhancing song, and it's a shame it's only used as an insert, because it's incredible. It has a lot of uses in the anime however, so no fear.\\n\\n\r\nOn an excellent note, the usage of Inori being a main character, and as an embodiment of the Supercell vocalists in the anime really brought the soundtrack to life, in more than one way. \\n\r\nThe English casting director did an excellent job matching up Alexis Tipton with Inori. The parts where she's singing and then directly speak are either dubbed absolutely perfectly, or edited to where they flow flawlessly. Her soft voice also fit with the portrayal of Inori very well. Austin Tindle also did good work portraying the progression of weak and shy Shu, then conflicted and commanding Shu. \\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 6\\n\\n\r\nShu Ouma has been called one of the worst shonen protagonists in all of anime. People cite his lack of decisiveness, weakness of character, and generally failing to take charge when necessary, along with his total 180 of character about 3/4 of the way through the show. He's a loser, he's a whiner, we know. \\n\\n\r\nI think there's more to Shu behind the scenes that a lot of people are missing. \\n\r\nShu Ouma is autistic. \\n\r\nHe wouldn't be the first autistic spectrum character to be shown in anime. The much loved L, (and much hated Near) from Death Note also fall onto the spectrum, with a lot of classic signs and symptoms. \\n\\n\r\nIn the beginning, Shu talks about how socially inept he is, and how he just can't understand how anyone thinks (no empathy, no emotional intelligence.) He's very easily frustrated, and that serves to be his undoing. He has no concept of Charisma, particularly when he attempts to emulate Gai, but to poor effect and doesn't understand why. He misunderstands people's intentions constantly, and has poor social cues as well. \\n\\n\r\nShu makes a number of inappropriate comments and over-reactive measures throughout the show that, while may just be from social awkwardness, could also be part of the explanation. He also has a very routine-oriented life- which is disrupted when he's given the chance to join Funeral Parlor, though he can't deal with the changes it would bring to his life. Later, and throughout the show, we see Shu dressing in his school uniform, complete with the tie, even though the rule of law and social order have all but collapsed. He wears the same type of clothes all the time, and is, generally speaking, rather orderly throughout the show.\\n\\n\r\nHe's resistant to friends and people trying to be close to him, aloof, detached, and very much a loner, which lead to his \"loser\" status. \\n\\n\r\nAll of these things lead me to believe that Shu is on the autism spectrum, which, in several ways, explains reasoning for his actions and makes them more believable as well. \\n\\n\r\nThe rest of the characters fill their voids. Some of them are mere plot convenience, some of them are genuinely interesting characters. I can see the Code Geass parallels in the characters more than the story, honestly- given that each side has a counterpart for each 'position' in their ranks: the ace fighter, the mastermind, the technology specialist, the conniving lieutenant, the mysterious woman, the parent/child antagonist dynamic, and naturally, the rival. \\n\\n\r\nI personally thought Ayase and Major Sagai to be the most interesting characters, particularly Sagai. He gets stuff done, and doesn't ask questions, along with having a twisted streak to match his stereotypical villain's scarred eye. \\n\\n\\n\r\nStory: 4\\n\\n\r\nOthers have covered this one pretty well already, and there's a nice synopsis up there as well. Guilty Crown left me with a lot of questions that went unanswered, and there's also a lot of plot convenience that goes beyond suspension of disbelief, even about a show that involves a guy using his powers to remove people's hearts in order to turn them into weapons. The story watches like a summer blockbuster movie. It might not be the most nuanced and compelling thing, but it's pretty fun to watch for a couple hours and be done. It has some heartfelt moments, and there are a few cheesy spots where I chuckled, but overall nothing particularly remarkable. The second half is a definite improvement over the first, with a change of setting- to a more interesting one. \\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment and Overall: 8, 7\\n\\n\r\nGuilty Crown, like Code Geass (if I really have to go there) is fun to watch. Yeah, not everything always makes sense, but what's the point of a tv show or movie, if not to be entertaining? I do have to say, that were it not for the talents of Tetsuro Araki and Hiroyuki Sawano, Guilty Crown would be yet another rather generic, if flashily animated, shonen super powered protag anime. It's something a little more, when you enjoy other parts of the show than just the plot and characters. \\n\\n\\n\r\nRecommend? \\n\\n\r\nGuilty Crown is fairly anime-culture significant, and a fair visual feast on its own. If you can ignore some plot holes and underdeveloped characters, there's no reason not to enjoy this one. \\n\\n\r\n\"The world offers the choice to live or die. Survival of the fittest, that's the only rule this world recognizes.\" - Gai",

            "content": "The setting:\r\nSo, the animes setting is in the not so far future.\r\nAnd for some reasons japan got attacked by foreign countries\r\nand now loads of foreign military is stationed in japan.\r\nAfter the war, that took place in japan, lot's of japanese\r\npeople are forced to live in rundown parts of the cities.\r\nAnd war is not fought with tanks anymore, but with giant robots.\r\nOur maincharacter is a normal student, who gets involved in the battle\r\nof a terrorist group, just because he wanted to help.\r\nThe main character meets a girl in strange clothes at a crashed truck\r\nand they decide to flee, but ofcourse the military chases them down.\r\nAnd agun is pointed at the main character.\\n\r\nHe's certain to die, but then some strange background popps in\\n\r\nand the girl grants the MC the power to kill all the Soldiers near him.\\n\r\nA power which is reffered to, as the \"power of the kings\".\\n\\n\r\nThe MC then helps the terrorists to do the usual terroriststuff, like\\n\r\nfighting the military out of a ghetto, freeing a person whos charged of\\n\r\nmurder, public anouncing of the terroristgroup, now with a fancy name,\\n\r\ndeclaring that they are actually the good guys.\\n\\n\r\nAfter terrorising the enemy gobverment, they move on to a big showdown in\\n\r\nsome other dimension, fighting some god-thingy.\\n\\n\\n\r\nWhile i really liked the first season so much, i even bought the DVD,\\n\r\nthe second was much weaker, in my opinion, but if you are a fan of\\n\r\nsigtly more intelligent military/mecha-shows, then Code Crown is\\n\r\njust right for you... i mean Geass Guilty... i mean...\\n\r\nWhich plot was i just summarising?\\n\\n\\n\r\nYeah, i'm pretty sure you all have already heard of the jokes, that\\n\r\nGuilty Crown is basically a copy of Code Geass and yes,\\n\r\nGC is not only a ripoff of CG, but also a very shameless ripoff.\\n\r\nEven to the point of giving the MC's iconic power the same name,\\n\r\n'The Power of the Kings'.\\n\\n\r\nGC is basically a kick in the teeth for everyone who worked on CG.\\n\r\nGC is basically just copying most parts and adding some stolen ideas\\n\r\nfrom other series. It's like one of these movies, which are only made\\n\r\nout of clips of several other movies and then voiced over so it\\n\r\nbecomes an other plot.\\n\r\nBut don't get me wrong, i'm not against \"borrowing\" ideas,\\n\r\ni think good stolen is better, then bad selfmade.\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunatly, in Episode 12 of GC the shit hits the fan.\\n\r\nThe meachafan in this case was me, and it hit me right into the mouth,\\n\r\nso it left a very bitter taste.\\n\r\nIn episode 12 GC starts to become \"original\".\\n\r\nIt suddenly adds so many things to te plot, it's becoming a total\\n\r\nclusterfuck of ideas.\\n\r\nNot good ideas, but badly stolen ideas smashed together and only\\n\r\nholding up through brute force.\\n\\n\r\nEpisode 12 suddenly adds incest, some sort of crazy demonqueen, amnesia,\\n\r\ngreek gods, steroid abuse and god knows what else.\\n\r\nEverything sewed together by bad and formost lazy writing.\\n\\n\r\nYep, that's my opinion.\\n\r\nAnd of course i took the time to write, where my thoughts came from,\\n\r\nso enjoy my look at Guilty Crown!\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe characters:\\n\\n\r\nShu Ouma:\\n\r\nTalking about the characters is quite difficult in this case, because\\n\r\nthe people in this anime have no character, for the most part,\\n\r\naside from one exeption, which i will address later.\\n\\n\r\nAs i already told you, the exeption will be spoken of later, so the\\n\r\nMC follows the rule of having no character.\\n\r\nAt the beginning he's the just a coward, whose only problem is, that \\n\r\nhe gets in his own way, over and over again. \\n\r\nHe get's in his own way, then he learns his lesson, then makes another\\n\r\nobvious mistake, learns his new lesson and changes from coward to hero, \\n\r\nstep by step.\\n\\n\r\nIronically, the best description i have for him, is 'void', the name\\n\r\nof the weapons he pulls out of other people.\\n\r\nI'll go into detail with the Voidpower later, since there is quite a lot i have to write about it.\\n\\n\r\nIn Episode 12 it's suddenly reveald, that he suffers from amesia.\\n\r\nWell, he doesn't exacly suffer, since he just doesn't seem to care.\\n\r\nThere is at least a whole year missing from his memory, but he never asked\\n\r\nwhat happend there.\\n\r\nThis is especially strange, considering the fact, that the memoryloss covers the\\n\r\nlost christmas incident.\\n\r\nDid he never ask himself, where he was at that point?\\n\r\nDid they not talk in school about such a big event so he could realise,\\n\r\nthat his memory is missing?\\n\r\nSpeaking of not caring about anything, why was he shocked, when he realised,\\n\r\nwhere his mother worked?\\n\r\nDid he never ask her?\\n\r\nEspecially if she's sometimes away for days?\\n\r\nIs this even legal, to let his underageed kid home alone?\\n\r\nAt least here in germany it isn't... did nobody look out for Shu?\\n\r\nAnd I'm pretty sure, that's something everybody was asked by a teacher in Kindergarten\\n\r\nor elementary school, 'What do your mommy and daddy do?'\\n\r\nAnd did he never realise, that he has no father?\\n\r\nWhy is that topic never brought up?\\n\r\nThose are massive plotholes.\\n\r\nDid the MC never question his unusual livestyle?\\n\r\nThere are just so many questions...\\n\r\nDid the writer really think we whouldn't notice that?\\n\r\nIf so, i'll take that as an insult.\\n\\n\r\nFact is, this kind of amnesia often serves as a cheap way to built up tension.\\n\r\nThe writer tells you, \\n\r\n\"There happend something, stay tuned for it's stunning revelation\"\\n\r\nIt's just their way of admitting, they arn't able to built up tension with the\\n\r\nstuff happening RIGHT NOW, they have to foreshadow.\\n\r\nThat way, the audience can ignore that nothing interesting is happening right now,\\n\r\nand just wait for the final showdown.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nInori:\\n\r\nJust as the maincharackter, she basically has no charackter.\\n\r\nShe's just doing what she's told, and looking cute in her skimpy and \\n\r\nabsolutly not battleready outfits.\\n\r\nAnd from time to time, she's acts as the MacGuffin to advance the plot,\\n\r\nwhen the writer couldn't think of anything better.\\n\r\nOh, and she's a famous songstress... which is kinda stupid, when she's\\n\r\npart of a terroristgroup, which has to stay undetected at first.\\n\r\nAlso, there is actually no reason for her to be a songstress.\\n\r\nWell, aside from two things,\\n\r\n1) To have her be famous, in order to rebuild the scene, when Suzaku\\n\r\nenters the classroom. Since was famous by that point too, because\\n\r\nof his trial.\\n\r\n2) Make musicvideos where she puts on even more skimpy outfits.\\n\\n\r\nI already wrote, that she's basically nothing but a Macguffin.\\n\r\nSince it was already foreshadowed, that the Void a person has,\\n\r\ncan change, this will mean, that, in the final battle, Inoris heart will\\n\r\nsuddenly change and shu will pull his ultimante weapon out of his a...\\n\r\nI mean, out of her chest.\\n\r\nLazy writing in it's finest...\\n\\n\r\nOh, by the way, she looks like Shus sister, so he only helped her at the beginning,\\n\r\nbecause he had the hots for his sister... our hero ladies & gentlemen...\\n\r\nIsn't the love between siblings a wonderfull thing?\\n\r\nA little sticky and a little sweaty... i suddenly feel ill...\\n\r\nSeriously, that's probably the first idea, which wasn't stolen from Code Geass\\n\r\nand this makes me feel like i want to throw up...\\n\r\nGreat writing...\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nGai Tsutsugami:\\n\r\nThe supposed to be badass character is named Gai.\\n\r\nHis first entrance made with a guitar played in the background,\\n\r\nflashlights everywhere, beating up some thugs, who want to rob our\\n\r\nMC, because he's an idiot and ran into a ghetto, without keeping in mind,\\n\r\nthat it's probably not safe for a kid at night, when he's carrying an\\n\r\nexpensice looking ROBOT!!!!\\n\r\nAs i already said, Gai is the badass character but because being just badass\\n\r\nwhould be boring, so the writer added the plottwist, that he's actually ill\\n\r\nand will die eventually.\\n\r\nOh and by the way, he's just as old as Shu...\\n\r\nYeah, i know, i don't know what he took in order to grow up that much faster,\\n\r\nthan Shubut,.... who am i kidding?\\n\r\nI'm sure it's just bad writing again.\\n\r\nOh, and he knows Shu and his \"beloved\" sister since their childhood.\\n\r\nGai was washed up to the beach, where Shu and his sister were playing.\\n\r\nThey met during the year, that's missing in Shu's memory.\\n\r\nSo it was the fate of Shu and Gai to meet again, right?\\n\r\nOn the other side, it could be just lazy writing again,\\n\r\nsince this is just a very easy way, to establish a connection between\\n\r\ntwo characters, who never met before.\\n\r\nStill, if you think about it, since the audience did not experience\\n\r\nthe growth of their bond, it still means nothing and is, yet again, instulting\\n\r\nit's audience since the writer thinks the audience is not intelligent enough\\n\r\nto realise obvious plot holes.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nAnnoying Nerd-Girl:\\n\r\nWell... to be honest, i can't remember her name and it's way much to \\n\r\nmuch work to look it up.\\n\r\nShe has no character, no purpose aside from being fapmaterial for lolicons.\\n\r\nShe does nothing but dressing up in a skintights rubbersuit with nekomimi\\n\r\nor Maid-outfits.\\n\r\nEven during operations she's totally useless.\\n\r\nWell, on the bright side, she's fully aware of this.\\n\r\nSo she doesn't get in the way and instead plays Dance Central...\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nAyase Shinomiya:\\n\r\nAs i mentioned earlier, there is an exeption to the no-character rule.\\n\r\nAyase is a really interesting character.\\n\r\nAlmost to good, for this kind of show... i guess you can drop the 'almost'...\\n\r\nHowever, she's paralysed, but she's not the typical wheelchair-girl\\n\r\nyou get in anime. She exepts her circumstances but that doesn't mean,\\n\r\nshe let's other people push her around.\\n\r\nEven though she can't keep up with the other footsoldiers,\\n\r\nshe knows what she is capable of and she's very proud in what she can do,\\n\r\nand that's piloting a huge robot and kick the MC's ass(pluspoint) even \\n\r\nwithout her meacha.\\n\\n\r\nHandicapped people in TV are a rarity, especially in anime.\\n\r\nAnd when there are any, they are often portraied as extremely helpless\\n\r\nand dependent, like Nunnaly from Code Geass. She did basically nothing\\n\r\non her own.\\n\r\nI worked some years ago with handicapped people and most of them tried not\\n\r\nto show their hanicap and others drowned in self-pity.\\n\r\nOnly a few were really OK with their handicap and just make the best out of it.\\n\r\nI think showing a fictional character who is able to do her best could show\\n\r\npeople that do can still do something, if you are aware of want you can still do.\\n\\n\r\nAnd a in a mecha show, this is not to much to ask for.\\n\r\nParalised people can drive cars, so why not pilot a robot?\\n\\n\r\nBut why the rubbersuit for her, too?\\n\r\nOK, fanservice, but if you think about it, it's really stupid.\\n\r\nFor one, this thing serves no purpose since she's not actually in the field.\\n\r\nSo it has no protective value.\\n\r\nAnd just think of how hard it has to be to get in and out of that thing,\\n\r\nespecially for her?\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe three Goons:\\n\r\nYeah, the three guys who are foorsoldiers for the Undertakers,\\n\r\nthat white haired guy, the big guy and the Tamaki ripoff...\\n\r\nI don't think any of these even have names, just as they don't have characters\\n\r\nor real roles in the operations, so let's just skip them.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nShu's schoolmates:\\n\r\nVoiddispenser, nothing more, nothing less.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of the Voidpower...\\n\\n\r\nYeah... one of the biggest flaws of this show, the iconic void powers.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe Voidpower:\\n\r\nFirst things first, void means, there is nothing.\\n\r\nSo if there is a sword, a giant flower, or a fridge, there is no \"void\",\\n\r\nthere IS something!!! So this power already fails at it's name.\\n\r\nGreat start...\\n\\n\r\nSecond, in true Code Geass fashion, Shu has to have eyecontact with the person,\\n\r\nhe draws the void from. At least at first. Some episodes later he explains,\\n\r\nhe has problems with keeping eyecontact... *nocomment*\\n\r\nSo Shu is told, that he doesn't have to hold eyecontact,\\n\r\nhis victim just has to think that they are looking into each others eyes,\\n\r\nwhich is stupid.\\n\r\nI Code Geass it made sense, in a certain way.\\n\r\nLelouch had to look into his opponents eyes in order to give basically controll\\n\r\nhis opponents soul. You know, the eyes are the windows to the soul.\\n\r\nLelouch looks into the other persons souls, taps into it and gives it a direct order.\\n\r\nThis whould also make sense in Guilty Crown, but no, Shu has to stand in his own way,\\n\r\nagain, and somebody has to help him. This is mainly, because the writer has no sense\\n\r\nfor character development, so he has to take every slight chance he gets to\\n\r\nmake someone into some sort of mentor-character and thus form a bond with Shu.\\n\r\nSo Shu has at least some reason to fight on for the terrorists.\\n\r\nAnd if i remember correctly, he doesn't even try to make eyecontact in later episodes,\\n\r\nso that whole thing was pointless.\\n\\n\r\nAs you might see by now, the mainproblem of the voidpower is, \\n\r\nit's ignoring it's own rules.\\n\r\nI personally like weapons, which are unique er character,\\n\r\nlike the Pactio cards in Mahou Sensei Negima,\\n\r\nthe Volt weapons in Freezing,\\n\r\nthe Fragments in Needless,\\n\r\nthe unique machas in Isekai no Seikishi Monogatari\\n\r\nor the different Geasses in Code Geass\\n\r\nand the list goes on and on.\\n\r\nThis is a very simple trick to open up to a large variety of differnent\\n\r\nsituations.\\n\r\nBut these things always have to follow rules.\\n\r\nSomethings that was done greatly in COde Geass, you watched the maincharacter\\n\r\nactually studying his power in order to use it effectivly.\\n\\n\r\nGuilty Crown doesn't have specific rules stated out\\n\r\nand the vague defined rules that it has, are broken,\\n\r\nfor example, in episode 11 Shu draws out a pair of scissors, which are able to cut\\n\r\nsomebodys string of life. OK, nice idea.\\n\r\nSome missiles are shot at Shu. He swings the scissors and the missiles explode.\\n\r\nOK, here it gets strange.\\n\r\n1. He wasn't actually using the scissors, so he isn't cutting anything.\\n\r\nIf this works, the next question is, to what extend does it work?\\n\r\nCan he just wave it and everyone and everything within several kilometers dies?\\n\r\nThe anime Shingetsutan Tsukihime shows how this kind of power and it's rules\\n\r\nare handled propperly.\\n\r\nThe maincharacter in that show also has the power to see the lifestring and\\n\r\nthen cut it, destroying his target immediatly.\\n\r\nThe difference is, in Shingetsutan Tsukihime Shiki has to close in on his target,\\n\r\nin order to acutally touch it AND he has to cut exacly the lifestring in order to\\n\r\nsucceed. Shiki has to follow these rules in order to win his fight.\\n\r\nShu's enemy just dissapears without being an actual threat.\\n\\n\r\n2. Why is he able to run up a straight wall?\\n\r\nDid he just kill gravity with his scissors?\\n\\n\\n\r\nTo summ it up:\\n\r\nThe Voidweapons are nothing but a Deaus Ex Machina.\\n\r\nIt doesn't follow any rules, it's just an \"iwin\"-button for the maincharacter.\\n\r\nUp until episode 12 ther was absolutly NOTHING that could withstand Shu's firepower.\\n\r\nWith Irinos void alone he whould have been able to destroy nearly any foe.\\n\r\nThat's also something, this show lacks, ther is up til now, no proper villian.\\n\r\nSimply nobody can match Shu.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSo, to my final verdict:\\n\r\nStory: 1/10\\n\r\nIt's just pathetic.\\n\r\nThe writing is lazy, the plot is boring.\\n\r\nAnd you through the plothole, you can drive a truck, blindfolded.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 6/10\\n\r\nThe first two episodes have rather good art, but later the overall lazyness\\n\r\ndrops in and you realise, that the first two episodes were just to catch the\\n\r\naudiences attention.\\n\r\nI doesn't get horrible, but it stays mediocre.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 7/10\\n\r\nThis is basically the best about this show.\\n\r\nI have read, that many people like the opening and ending of this anime,\\n\r\nand while it's not my personal taste, i'm still able to see, why they like it.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 2/10\\n\r\n1 pluspoint catched by Ayase.\\n\r\nNothing more to say, moving on!\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 1/10\\n\r\nThere was really nothing i really enjoyed about Guilty Crown.\\n\r\nMaybe if they had reduced the cast, so for example Ayase had more screentime,\\n\r\nbut not even she can rescue at least on additional point.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 3,4/10\\n\r\nAll in all, this anime is just poor.\\n\\n\\n\r\nFor me, personally, this was the worst anime of 2011, while i have to add,\\n\r\nhavn't seen everything last year.\\n\r\nBut to be honest, if there was something even worse i hope i will never find out.\\n\\n\\n\r\nFor those who still watch this show, i hope it gets better, so you are able\\n\r\nto enjoy it to the end.\\n\\n\\n\r\nThanks for reading my whole review.\\n\r\nI hope you enjoyed it.",

Built behind the shadow of ever-popular Code Geass. It's rather hard to tackle a \"higher than Code Geass standard\", nope more like EVERY series around. There's just one thing I don't understand, just \"WHY PEOPLE COMPARE EVERY GOOD/BAD SCENE IN LITERALLY EVERY EPISODE TO OTHER ANIME(S)?\" Most good/better/best ideas were usedor recycled on most in/famous animes and didn't get criticized. \\n\\n\r\n\"Whoa, this guy is biased! He even got GC on his Top Favorites O.0\" I'm not gonna deny this part since I literally enjoy Guilty Crown. At first I never cared about the plot, I was just excited that Supercell will be a part of a series again(yeah I'm a fan, U MAD?). There were times that when I saw posts in the forums like \"This sh*t sucks, too cliche\" and alike. And \"This show is really predictable\": CONGRATS you're one of the elites o/.  I just can't agree when I saw the post \"Inori is for pure fanservice only\", almost every action genre anime always has a girl on it's main character that would either be support him or cheer him (eg. Tessa-FMP, Saber-FSN). It's just either they are successful or not. And being silent and stoic doesn't necessarily mean weak. (eg. Yuki-Melancholy).\\n\\n\r\nOk sure, enough the rant here's your standard review. \\n\\n\r\nStory - Yeah, the start was a bit too slow and rather predictable. Character developments were out of place. Elite soldiers that can't hit a simple non-moving target (No surprises here, I forgot the term but it's being used on many action films and action-genre series. nb4 Chuck Norris ), Falcon kicks across rooms and swords on Mecha fights, the \"Keikakud\u014dri\" guy, and the meddling friends. The momentum of the story was just a bit too slow that many users dropped it during the first half. \\n\\n\r\nArt - The colors were like \"dancing\", just too epic. Basically one reason that people keep watching this anime. Even \"haters\" agreed so yeah.\\n\\n\r\nSound - Too biased here, so continuing this might just be a waste of time.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - The cast basically contains a \"suddenly-became powerful guy\", a \"black-belted-sharpshooter-silent\" girl, a Keikakud\u014dri(again) guy, etc. If you're judging Guilty Crown with this criteria, then it's easy to say it's cliche. Most anime(s) do have those qualities, so what's with the discrimination?\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - Read Above.\\n\\n\r\nOverall - Guilty Crown is more like a combination of ideas that succeeded to appeal to the viewers in the past anime(s). Added with some spices and ended up being worse/better. Just watch it as an \"independent series and not as a copy of others\" then you'll possibly enjoy it more. Those who dropped it should picked it again and those who haven't watched it yet should watch it.\\n\\n\r\nFeedback greatly appreciated, and also grammar correction.",

            "content": "If you have read or seen another Guilty Crown reviews you have probably noticed that there is two sides. Those two sides are the haters and the lovers. Also it has alot of romance in it even though MAL's genres doesnt include it. \r\nAnyway lets get onto the review.\r\n= (Story 4) =\r\n The story is not something speciel. Most fo the time i didn't think about it, but after watching the show and thinking bad i realised it was pretty bad. As i said, there's nothing special about the story. It's very sad cause the story could have been so much more then itwas. \u00c8ven though this show made you wanna watch the next episode right away, but if you want a good story don't watch Guilty Crown. \\n\\n\r\n=  (Art 9) =\\n\\n\r\nEverything about the art was just amazing. The backgrounds were amazing. It made the scene alot better because  of the feeling i got by the backgrounds. The colors were kinder dark which gave the show the feeling it was supposed to have. The character design were also amazingly done. Now the best thing about the art was the crystal virus. It was just so beautiful. This is definitely the best artwork I.G. Production has ever done. I've never seen something like this before.\\n\\n\r\n= (Sound 10) =\\n\\n\r\n The Sound were just as stunning as the art. All the openings and ending were done by Supercell which is one of my favorite bands so that just gave this series a plus. The first opening Euterpe was so beautiful that i couldn't move and do nothing but to listen to the amazing song. Sadly it was only played in the first episode. The second opening My Dearest was amazing as well and quickly became one of my favorite openings i have ever heard. The same goes for the third opening The everlasting guilty crown. It was almost just as amazing and was perfect for a opening. It really pumped up the mood and made you ready for another episode. The first ending Departures ~Anata ni Okuru Ai no Uta~ was amazing for an ending because it was very calm and that's what a good ending has to be. The second ending Kokuhaku was also very good even though i prefer the first ending over the second. Also the OST for this show were fantastic. It could change me from happy to sad in only 10 seconds I've never seen a anime with as good soundtrack as Guilty Crown. If your not gonna check out the show at least give the music a shot.\\n\\n\r\n= (Characters 5) =\\n\\n\r\nNow alot of people has different opinions on the characters. Some says the development were amazing and some says it was very bad because it was to fast. I have to agree with both sides. I'm just gonna list some of the characters and give you my opinion on them because there's so many character that i can't even list them\\n\\n\r\n Inori: Inori is the main Female character. Inoris development were actually pretty good. Now its kinda hard to explain her development because she didn't really change on her outside, but her inside. She was just fighting for what she thought was right. But slowly though the series you could feel for her. You could could feel her love towards Shu, especially in the last few episodes.\\n\\n\r\n Shu: Shu is the completely opposite of Inori in terms of character development. He isn't really relatable because he changes to much. He goes from Jesus to Hitler in 1 episode. In the first half of the series hes this quite guy who just help out the Funeral Parlour, but in the second half hes the evil king. So overall hes just to clich\u00e9.\\n\\n\r\n Gai: Gai.... I can't really say that much about him. Hes a badass character who leads the Funeral Parlour. He means a lot to the series, but i just can't relate to him. He dosen't get any development. He just never changes which i find really annoying.\\n\\n\r\n = (Enjoyment 8) =\\n\\n\r\n Even though it was a very clich\u00e9 anime it's just one of those series i couldn't help but love! I was bored once in this series and it made me wanna watch it over and over again. If your gonna watch this anime you shouldn't really be thinking. And yes i am on the lover side, but i do understand why some people don't like this show.\\n\\n\r\n= (Overall 8) =\\n\\n\r\n Overall i give it 8. Even though the character's where clich\u00e9 and the story where really odd, i still enjoyed it though out the entire show. Now do i recommend you this anime? Well, i think u should at least give it a try.",

However, what it lacks is a coherent story that can fully engage a wide range of viewers.\r\nStory \r\nLike I said the plot was very loose and weak. Floppy.\r\nArt \r\nEye candy art. A lot of effort can be seen here, the producers wanted to make this show as gorgeous as possible. The art alone makes this show so watchable, given the lack of sophisticated plot.\r\nSound \r\nGreat OP. Great ED. Background music also does its job. \r\nCharacter \r\nCharacters may seem a bit dull and robotic. ButI predict that this will change in the second half/arc of the show. I believe that the producers intended to create characters that are initially cold and lifeless, and developing into each of their unique persona to create contrast, however, this is only what I hope for.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment \\n\r\nThe art and character design made this series to enjoyable. So I would say that the selling point of this series wasn't a mind-blowing story, but rather fancy characters doing what the director wanted them to do. \\n\\n\r\nOverall \\n\r\nI recommend this to those who look for a show with stunning graphics and nice looking characters. Also, I hope the show gets better and better in the second half. However, this is only my personal opinion.",

            "content": "This show is split up into like 2 seasons : (1-12), (13-22). The first part was fine though the plot was a bit confused but not so bad. A current shounen with a current plot, good art and perfect animation. It could stop here when the heros finally return to save everyone...then they're all happy ... then happy ending. If it was, I would have just rated it as \"average\" or \"fine\" score... But no, starting from the 13th episode, it began to disappoint me.\r\n I'll talk a little about the characters before the second part...Well, they're all annoying! they have poor personality, I onlylike Tsugumi and Ayase. Inori is doing nothing serious, just serving as a tool for Shu. She's emotionless but she's singer, an emotionless person with sexy clothes, there is something wrong with her...Gai doesn't really suit the role of leader by apparence, he's way too perfect and cool.\\n\\n\r\nLet's start with the second part. Everything seems to be alright, they try to cover little by little the pain they suffered after what happened, they even did a festival. But the government decides to lock them in the infected zone to let the virus kill them, I don't understand why they don't just come to kill them instead of locking and isolating them with that immense wall that came from nowhere around the infected zone. Starting from here the show has completely derived. The protagonist became insane because one of his friend died though he already saw the death of many people, he suddenly turned to good side to a despotic side, all characters changed because of his influence. This \"second season\" has completely messed up the show, a new story that came from nowhere, that's completely illogical.                                                               \\n\\n\r\nI'm really disappointed of this show even if I'm still only at the 17th epi. I don't think it can get better though I'll still watch it just by curiosity and I may edit after the end of the show.\\n\\n\r\n1-12 episodes (overall : 6), You can stop watching from episode 12, there is a real ending\\n\r\n13-17 episodes (overall : 2), If you continue from there, it's probable that it ruins your enjoyment from the 12 first episodes especially if you had a liking for the characters.",

Both the scenery and characters look very good. I liked the music as well. Great soundtrack and openings.\r\nHowever, the story is poorly written and hard to keep up with. I don't even think I dare try to explain the plot. When you think you're starting to understand what's going on, there's a plot-twist and you're totally lost again. I started watching this anime in english, but I had to chance to japanese so that I'd have to be morefocused and read the subtitles. I thought I'd keep up with the story better that way, but it didn't help much.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are kind of hard to get a grasp of as well, even the main character. I though I had a pretty decent idea of who he was and I liked him, but he totally changed at certain point and acted all weird. No wonder though with all the crazy stuff going on. And he's not the only character who changes.\\n\\n\r\nIf you can stay 100% focused while watching in order to understand this anime's complex plot, you might like it. However, I couldn't keep up with the plot-twists and therefore I didn't find Gulity Crown very enjoyable. It's such a shame because I really wanted to and I tried very hard to do so.",

As I watched the show, I was entranced by the action and the background music, but I was almost always confused by what's going on. There were too many things being thrown at me. The protag, Shuu was a bit cliched and the motives of the government were sometimes unclear.As for Inori, it felt like she served no other purpose than to be everyone's mold. The first few episodes were amazing, don't get me wrong, but by episode 6 and 7, I started losing interest. But I pushed through, and I was rewarded with an amazing second half opening; That's it. There was no salvation in the ending either. I might try to watch it again to try to get a better understanding, but it's upsetting that I even have to do that.  I really like Guilty Crown - but definitely not for the story.",

            "content": "*edited* As I've finished Guilty Crown, I'll re-review it, keeping the end of the series in mind.\r\nGuilty Crown had an endless amount of potential. While watching its earlier episodes, I really, really liked the series and fought to support it among the fandom. But then, this happened--\r\nmusic: I'm amazing.\r\nart: I'm beautiful.\r\nplot: I suck\r\nThis pretty much sums it up. Guilty Crown's OST and animation are phenomenal, and no viewer can deny that. However, the plot, in essence, sucked. It seems as if it was made to specifically rely on cliffhangers and events that would excite the audience for a few seconds. You could actually relate theplot to the classic penny dreadfuls.\\n\\n\r\nThe plot got very lost among those attempted plot twists, as a few elements of the story were not justified or relative. Or even necessary. Details were left unattended, resulting in this very messy outcome.\\n\\n\r\nStill, I quite enjoyed watching it because I was so interested in what was happening next. I must at least commend GC for executing the plot twists so well. All in all, the ending was fulfilling enough, but the way we got there was less than satisfactory.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters were also very weak, as many only held a purpose as walking fanservice. Shu doesn't count, because he is the protagonist who starts out all lame; but a large portion of the females were not strong, admirable characters in respect to their role in the story.\\n\\n\r\nOnce again, Guilty Crown had incredible art and music, and greatly lacked a good plot, but did plot twists and cliffhangers well. I wouldn't really recommend this. But I'd recommend listening to the OST by itself.\\n\\n\r\nNote: For you OST junkies like me, the OST is exceptional; with powerful orchestral movements full of energy and triumph, or suspense and a somber mood when necessary. Of course, as this show was placed Twenty Minutes into the Future, there is a large influence of techno and guitar that fit right in place. The vocal tracks had some problems with the German and English pronunciation, but it can be easily overlooked as the backing track is amazing. The multiple reprises of a singular theme also deserve praise, as it is versatile enough to be used as an emotional piece or battle music.",

No explanations, random subplots never explained, contradicting statements, and no pacing whatsoever. Was the author high or something?\r\nArt:9/10\r\nAmazing art, with fluid animation and the use of color is just right. Fight scenes were animated well, they made me feel hype. As well, good looking and well designed (visually) characters.\r\nSound:10/10\\n\r\nThe only saving grace to this anime, the first op was amazing, the second not as good but still awesome. Both EDs were great as well. To top it off the OST's knocked my socks off.

If that was expanded on and we could see the MC's growth it would be amazing but suddenly they want to make him badass.

            "content": "Warning: Non professional review incoming.\r\nAlso, my first one.\r\nSo, every once in a while, some random anime pops out and causes lots of hype. Guilty Crown is just another one of them. What's fun is that most of the viewers have 1 of 2 very different opinions on this turd. Me? Well, the score should be a good indicator of my opinion.  Anyways, back on track.\r\nStory: 1/10\r\nTerrible is all I need to say to this cluster fuck.\r\nLet me summarize it without spoiling.\r\n- High school boy wants to change things but doesn't have the power to do so.\r\n- High school boy meets famous female singer\r\n- Saidsinger is being chased by soldiers\\n\r\n- Soldiers capture woman\\n\r\n- Boy obtains super powers\\n\r\n- Boy joins Terrorist group called Undertaker\\n\r\n- Train wreck occurs.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8/10\\n\r\nThe art is good no doubt. Beautiful in fact. That's all there is to it.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8/10\\n\r\nOnce again good. Maybe even great. You won't forget this anime's OST... Unless like me you don't really pay too much attention to it.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 3/10\\n\r\nDisgusting. All the characters are disgusting except for maybe some side characters and Shu.\\n\r\nLet's branch it off into 3 groups:\\n\r\n- Shu's friends: Stereotypical group with no depth.\\n\r\n- Undertaker: Same as above with some actually decent people in there like Ayase and Tsugumi.\\n\r\n- Enemies: Well... while most of them are forgettable, Segai, Daryl and DAN EAGLEMAN (That's right motherfuckers) are awesome.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 7/10\\n\r\nYou're probably all going like \"Wtf this guy just gave the story and the characters terrible scores. How can you enjoy an anime where you hate the plot and the people?\"\\n\r\nSimple, think of this as a comedy. The moment you do, everything's gonna be so much nicer. Plenty of hilarious moments which normally should've been taken normally but I just couldn't because it was so bad.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 5/10\\n\r\nWhile the story and it's characters were terrible, this anime is a sight to behold. It broke out of its' shell and became a comedy! Wouldn't have believed it if I hadn't watched it myself. Definitely give it a try if you want to see a story written by a 12 year old.",

            "content": "Wha-a-at?! I'm bewildered by the number of reviews I've read on Guilty Crown that rated it poorly (6-), and although Guilty Crown had it's flaws, in addition to my strong dislike towards mecha (this was actually the first anime with any sort of mecha I've finished), Guilty Crown was still a decent, no, a great anime. People seem to like to compare Guilty Crown to other popular, similar anime like Code Geass (I think?) therefore giving it a bad reputation for not being on the same level as them. Since I haven't seen these other anime, I can't compare, but Guilty Crown in itself wasa highly enjoyable and interesting anime. I actually like the title of the anime, because it was fitting towards the anime. Guilty Conscious. Crown: Monarchy. All points in the anime. Anyways, although when I first started the anime, I had my doubt but as it turns out, I really, really like this anime.\\n\\n\r\nStory: Japan is in chaos after the Apocalypse Virus spreads after Lost Christmas on December 24, 2029. During this time, Japan is under the military rule of a global organization called the GHQ.\\n\r\nOuma Shu, the quiet main character ('s) life completely changes when he meets the beautiful pop idol, Inori, who is on the run from GHQ soldiers. While trying to save Inori, Shu accidently acquires the mysterious King's power called the Void Gene that allows him to pull voids, the manifestation of a person's heart (a weapon or useful item) out of people. Ouma Shu's destiny completely changes and he becomes intertwined with not only the GHQ, but also with Funeral Parlor, a terrorist organization that is rebelling against the GHQ (Inori is part of this group, and she has her secrets). A story of revealing what's just, and what's corrupt. The addition of the Adam and Eve references seemed a bit redundant to me in this story, because I didn't really see any theme of temptation. Maybe when Shu became a dictator, the power of temptation? Eh, whatever, it's not like it took away from the anime.\\n\r\nThe story overall was good and intriguing (really intriguing to me). The first half of the series was wonderful, then there was a frustrating and unnecessary plot twist midway that lasted for a couple episodes and sort of tilted the direction of the anime which eventually made the anime rush it's end. But the show, despite it's pretty random, and confusing end, redeemed itself with the tragic, and great last 10 - 15 minutes to wrap-up the story of Guilty Crown. I think Guilty Crown had too many things going on in the plot all at once though, and that caused there to be many easily noticeable plot-holes. But not enough for me to dislike the anime. By the way, thank goodness Guilty Crown didn't revolve around mecha, otherwise I think I would have hated it, the mecha scenes were boring and dumb to me.\\n\\n\r\nArt: Phenomenal art. You just can't get any art more beautiful and well-drawn than Guilty Crown. The character's themselves were drawn to perfection, Inori was beautiful, Shu seemed pure, and just, I loved all the character's portrayals! But even more so than the characters, the artwork of the background design, the apocalypse disease crystals, the voids, and the action scenes. \\n\\n\r\nSound: Okay, I'm going to say it right now for Guilty Crown because it deserves it. Guilty Crown has the best music I've heard in anime eevvveeerrrr!!! The first opening, when I listen to it, I feel sorrow, happiness and joy. The ending, great conclusion to every episode. The soundtracks were beautiful. Inori's voice actor, Ai Kayano has the most angelic, beautiful voice I think I've ever head. She sings multiple songs (I LOVE DEPARTURES BLESSING!) in the anime that fill me up with emotion, and make me tear up. But as I've mentioned before, the voices aren't the only great thing, all the pieces of music are perfect! But the soothing, sad songs aren't all, the epic action scene songs (Bios) certainly add to the \"fun\" aspect of the action scenes that I wasn't too big of a fan of. And... when I thought the sound couldn't get any better, the second opening hit me, and it instantly become my favorite opening in anime ever. Everlasting - Egoist (Inori) is my favorite opening in anime, no doubt. I loved it. Repeat and repeat and repeat and repeat. But wait there's more! Remember when I wrote that the very tragic last 10 minutes of the anime made up for the anime's mistake? The last song that comes on to wrap up that ending was BEAUTIFUL (Release My Soul). Just thinking about the song, and the ending scene is making me tear up. Wow, I really ranted about how great the sound is, but it really is!! Best in anime that I've seen so far by far!\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: Okay, so the characters start off with lots of potential and interest especially Shu, Gai, and Inori, the 3 main characters. But... Gai never really develops, his character just changes personalities for actually no apparent reason. Shu obviously changes, but in my opinion, in a worse way. It's like the show plays around with the audience with Shu's annoying character: Just when you think that he\u2019s finally come to accept his destiny and his powers, he quickly regresses back to being a weak, stupid boy. Inori is a character that I don't know why I liked to be honest, because the anime completely throws in a blender and shreds to dog food all her character's potential. But, once again the last 10 minutes of the anime really makes me love Inori. The side characters were all interesting as well, at first that is... And once again, Guilty Crown never develops them, and they really become nothing. And the antagonists... Who actually is the antagonist?... BUT, despite all these flaws in the characters part of the anime, I still gave it a decent score because of a specific female character named Hare Menjou (and Inori). Hare and Inori made the entire story of Guilty Crown a tragic tale. Hare and Inori made me cry soo much, that... Oh my, they made me cry so much. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: To my surprise, I found myself smiling and seeking more of Guilty Crown after every episode. Guilty Crown is definitely a good anime that I think other people just talk poorly about for no real good reason. Maybe I'm biased, just because I enjoyed watching it, and I LOVED THE MUSIC! Listen to \"Release My Soul\", Listen to \"Departures Blessing\", Listen to \"Euterpe\", Listen to both the openings, and most definitely listen to Krone. Loved Guilty Crown a lot despite it's flaws! Why do I give it a 9/10? ENJOYMENT, I was never bored, ever while watching Guilty Crown, an anime I'd recommend to anyone that seeks enjoyment and simply amazing muuuussiiiiccc.",

            "content": "HERE'S WHAT I ORIGINALLY POSTED (at the bottom, you'll see my feelings now that I've watched further in):\r\n...Also, I'll be leaving out the story for this anime. It's quite bland, but at the same time, it's a bit hard to go into any detail without blowing the whole plot for you. I'm sure there are plenty of other reviews for this anime that include the story, but to get it done and over with I gave it a 6/10.\r\n______________________________________________________________\r\nI'm going to start off with the sound. 8/10.\r\n--The Music--\r\nIt's absolutely beautiful. Everything from the lyrics of the intro soundtrack and outro soundtrack to the person singingthe verses. Most of the time, Inori will be shown singing the songs. This is mainly because in the world of Guilty Crown Inori has created them, being an online star and such.\\n\r\nUsually, I never actually comment on music. In fact, I don't even stick around for it. I skip it and just move on to the anime. This is a different case.\\n\\n\r\n\"So everything that makes me whole, ima kini na sasageyou.\"\\n\r\n\"So everything that makes me whole, I now present and offer to you.\"\\n\\n\r\nI honestly don't know why I find that verse alone (among many others) to be so beautiful.\\n\\n\r\n--The Voice-Acting--\\n\r\nI think the voice acting in this anime is very good. It doesn't really sound all that cheesy to me, and it seems more realistic than traditional script for anime.\\n\\n\r\n______________________________________________________________\\n\\n\\n\r\nNext up is the art. 8/10.\\n\\n\r\n--The Style of Art--\\n\r\nThe style of this art revolves around a sort of moody atmosphere. Generally the color palette of the surroundings are dark variants of... eh, dark colors. The style (in terms of general character design and color) is also quite similar to that of Sora no Otoshimono, though is much more serious. You don't really see the main characters turning into chibi-form every 2 minutes.\\n\\n\r\n--The Quality of the Art--\\n\r\nThe quality is very good, it's very clear and even though the colors are very dark most of the time, you always know what is going on. The scenes that include fighting aren't like trying to run Crysis 2 on an unplugged laptop (like some anime that I've seen), and are actually quite seamless. \\n\\n\r\n______________________________________________________________\\n\\n\\n\r\nNext, character. 6/10.\\n\\n\r\n--Character Build-up--\\n\r\nI'd say that the character is a meager 6/10 because the only character build-up that I've seen within 4 episodes of the anime is Shu (the main protagonist). Though I do care about Inori, and some of Shu's friends... I guess I really don't have enough of any emotion from them to actually give a crap for more than a minute, if that makes sense. To sum it up, the only character I can actually relate to, feel for, and hate at times is Shu because he's the only character that's been truly introduced.\\n\r\nMaybe I haven't watched the anime enough, but so far all I've seen is Shu being a depressed emo bitch (excuse my language). Don't get me wrong though, this doesn't at all hinder my enjoyment of the anime. There are plenty of twists and questions I'd like to get answered that have me sitting on the edge of my seat, though not to an extent where I'm lost and mind fucked... we'll leave that for later though.\\n\\n\r\n--Character Interactions--\\n\r\nSo far I haven't seen too much important interaction from most of the characters. It's only been limited to Gai, Inori, and Shu. This is also the reason I give the character portion a 6/10. It would've been at least two points higher if there were more interaction between him and his classmates about what is going on in the current time, and what everyone thinks about it (or something so that he can increase his relationship standing with everyone).\\n\\n\r\n______________________________________________________________\\n\\n\\n\r\nRight, now for enjoyment. 8/10.\\n\r\nSure, the story is bland and I can already guess what happens. Sure, the characters are bland, and I can already guess what's going to happen.\\n\r\nThat doesn't at all (like I've said in the character section) mean I don't like and enjoy everything that's going on though. For me, it's not all about the story when it comes to anime. It comes down to how much I can follow the dialogue without getting my head burned to a crisp from thinking to much... like Spice and Wolf. Great anime, but the economics confused the hell out of me at times (lol).\\n\r\nFrom the action scenes, to the art (which I am very fond of), to the music (which, again, I am very fond of) I can actually appreciate this anime for what it is. Some people may hate it, but I think that a lot of work has indeed been put into this anime. I look forward to completing it in the future.\\n\\n\r\n______________________________________________________________\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall I gave this anime a 7/10. I don't believe I need to explain why, the answer is above.\\n\\n\r\nAside from that, if you're looking for an anime similar to Code Geass then this is what you might be looking for. It has tiny hints of romance, but it's not unrealistically chaotic like To Love-Ru, or any other romance... it's almost like Brave 10 when it comes to romance.\\n\r\nIf you're not into the main protagonist being an emo bitch that takes a long time to decide on things, this anime might not be good for you at the same time. It isn't too much of a big deal, but if you're very sensitive towards these things, you might want to stay away.\\n\\n\\n\r\nHERE'S WHAT I THINK ABOUT THIS ANIME NOW:\\n\r\nVery bad, characters are terrible. I recently found out that I absolutely hate every guy in this anime, they're all bitches, pussies, psycho, idiots, or all of the above.\\n\r\nAs for the females? Hate them too. They're all on the bitchy side as well. Character interaction? Close to nothing. And if it's something, it's always Sho whining and saying to much like a fucking retard -- I find myself repeatedly telling my screen to shut the hell up while facepalming. This of course hinders my ability to enjoy the anime in the slightest, especially when each individual character annoys the living shit out of me.\\n\r\nI was wrong to say this was like Code Geass. It was good for the first two episodes, then just got straight up annoying. Might as well be a damn Yaoi, I'd have as much interest in watching that as I do this (close to none).\\n\\n\r\nSTORY: 4\\n\r\nART: 8\\n\r\nSOUND: 8\\n\r\nCHARACTER: 2\\n\r\nENJOYMENT: 2\\n\r\nOVERALL: 4",

XD\r\nOverall, I did like the anime because of the following reasons: its beautiful animation graphics and the effects, which is kinda realistic(one of my criteria with the animes I watch); the characters, I liked them. :) ;the songs are also beautiful, which is composed by ryo of supercell[ i must say they chose a good group to make the songs]. Also, the plot, where an ordinary high school student who thinks hecan't do anything changes and realizes that he can & he has the power to do it if he will believe in his own strength and become a hero...and where people fight for justice and peace. < I think it has a moral/lesson which is really good because most animes now don't have this.hehe..and the situations of people being shown in the anime is something where we can open our eyes with the society we're living in. It happens to us,  right? \\n\\n\r\nThough I don't watch these kind of genres, there is something that has drawn me to watch this. I fell in love with the anime before watching it.[true.promise] There aren't parts which were boring and most of the time it has surprising events.\\n\\n\r\nsfx's and bgm's, great. :D\\n\\n\r\nand i think the plot is far from Code Geass and it isn't a total copycat. :(\\n\r\nalso, [if you haven't seen this] check out this interview with the producers of GC [http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/interview/2011-11-28/interview-koji-yamamoto-ryo-ohyama-and-george-wada-on-guilty-crown]\\n\\n\r\ngomen for the long review! this is the shortest possible i can give and i want to give my review. :) thanks for reading.",

            "content": "Guilty Crown has beautiful animation and great music.... and that's it. This show is one of the worst trainwrecks I've ever seen, everything aside from the animation and the music (so practically everything that is important) is bad. So many plot holes, poorly written characters, so much unnecessary fanservice, so much Code Geass (but a bad version of it) and a main character whose personality changes every 4 episodes (no, that's not great character development, just laziness and stupidity), our main heroine is a emotionless doll that looks pretty and we still don't know if our main antagonist is actually an evil guy, oh andour stupid, bland protagonist has a harem. While watching this, I almost believed that the producers made a list with the most unoriginal anime tropes and decided to put them all in one anime: Guilty Crown.\\n\\n\r\n~story~ 1/10\\n\r\nWe start in a school setting, where we meet our main character Ouma Shu and the first thing he does is monologuing about not fitting in and being anti-social. Wow, you can't say that the writers weren't straightforward. And because of the fact that he is an angsty, teenage outcast he decides to have lunch in an abandoned building. There he finds a half naked idol, who is making a cat cradle..... (happens to me every day) and he behaves awkward (because he's the anti-social main character) and out of nowhere the police barges in to arrest the girl, Inori, and our awesome main character starts whining and says that he \"wanted to get close to her and touch her hand\", okay...... it's not like he knows her or anything so that's maybe more than a little bit creepy. The first 5 minutes of this show were ridiculous, a half naked idol (oh wait, those are her normal clothes, great, the main heroine dresses up like a stripper 24/7) who is a terrorist or something, a whiny anti-social main character who is totally not going to fall in love with pinkhaired stripper-chan and the evil police.... I love the premise of this show so much. Then the robot of stripper-chan appears and gives Shu some kind of vial, so of course our whiny main character decides to oppose the evil police and bring this vial to the terrorists base. There he meets Gai, the leader of stripper-chan's terrorist gang. Shu decides to save stripper-chan and breaks to vial..... now he has super powers, he can pull weapons out of people's (of course especially women's) chest and it totally doesn't look like he's pulling weapons out of stripper-chan's boobs. And that's the first episode.... and one of the best. Just try to imagine how bad the other episodes are *shudder*.\\n\r\nI'm not going to spoil every episode like this, don't worry. Well, let's go to the second episode, we learn that those weapons are voids, and the represent their owner (this does raise the question 'why is Shu's void useful?' because it's owner certainly isn't). We also meet the other terrorists who want to free poor Japan from the evil world that's ruling it *sigh*. First we meet Ayase, a young woman in a wheelchair who pilots a mecha and has enormous boobs, we also have a loli named Tsugumi. By now you have probably realized that every female in this show is a fanservice object... even the main character's stepmother. I'm so done with this show! Then we meet the villains, who are evil for the sake of being evil, especially Daryl, a guy who wants to be called 'the butcher' and murders people for fun, such a subtle and nuanced evil. After kicking the evil governments ass, our favorite main character decides that it's time to go back to high-school and then the most original thing ever happens.... stripper-chan is a transfer student and joins his school. I'm not making this up, this famous idol, who is a part-time terrorist just joins Shu's school as a transfer student, HOW? Well, now at least we can have stupid high-school comedy moments.... yeah!  During the other episodes we see our 'hero' being a whiny emo outcast... but wait, this guy with an enormous amount of friends who all want to die for him or want to bang him is a social outcast? Yeah right, at least he behaves like he's a friendless loner for no good reason, but he also joins the terrorist group and is actually a badass during battles... but then goes back to acting like an anti-social jerk in other scenes. Until episode 12 everything is quite predictable: fan service, Shu being cool during battles, fanservice, Shu being an useless anti-social jerk hitting on Inori, fanservice, the evil government being evil, fighting, fanservice, Shu being an annoying jerk, Inori being emotionless and pretty, every female falling in love with Shu for no good reason, a beach episode, Gai hitting Shu (high point of the show), Shu being whiny and more fanservice. And then episode 12 turns everything upside down in a bad way, what follows is: the only likeable main character dies, so the viewer is tortured with more Shu and stripper-chan, Shu taking over his high school like some kind of dictator, there is an evil organization called \"Daath\" that just appears without any explanation and has superpowers or something, scientists apparently find a way to bring dead people back to life but only use it once (what? That's stupid) and a finale battle between good and evil....... SO ORIGINAL!\\n\\n\r\nThis anime has one of the most ridiculous stories ever, the best moments in the story were when Shu was suffering or being slapped in his face. I couldn't care less about the characters and there are so many unanswered questions (Like who and what is Daath? How did a certain person come back to life? Why do all this girls fall in love with Shu? Why is Mana evil? Why does a certain person die at the end of the story? If voids are supposed to represent the soul of their owner, why is there a guy with a void that is a damn fridge? How does Shu win the final battle? Why does it take characters 30 seconds to fall of a building? Why do people like this show?)\\n\\n\r\nAlso the pacing is just off, sometimes the story is rushed, while at other times there is a whole episode dedicated to visiting a beach. A BEACH, as if this show needed another lazy excuse for fanservice. The plot was inconsistent, filled with plot holes and some of the plot twists don't make sense at all. \\n\r\n[CONCLUSION]\\n\r\nA high-schoolboy meets a girl with a weird hair color by accident, he gets superpowers and the girl turns out to be somewhat supernatural, our high-schoolboy has a harem and joins a terrorist group that's trying to free Japan, there is fanservice and his childhood friend becomes his enemy. I've seen this story somewhere before, it resembles a certain other anime called Code Geass, an anime I didn't love but it was at least ten times as good as this mess.\\n\\n\r\nLazy writing, horrible characters, fanservice, stupid plot twists, plot holes, pacing problems and a bad ending. This story deserves an award for being mind numbing stupid. Also, every women is portrayed as some kind of stupid sex object that can't do anything else than falling in love and being rescued by men. It's painful to watch!\\n\\n\r\n~art~ 10/10\\n\r\nIt's pretty, really pretty. I'm not joking, I loved the art of this show. The battles look fantastic and the backgrounds are detailed. Even the characters look really good and original (this can't be said about their personality), the animators did an amazing job and I hate them for it. Thanks to the beautiful animation and music, I gave this anime a try, thank you animators, thank you.\\n\r\n[CONCLUSION]\\n\r\nBeautiful, it's amazing. It's the best thing about this anime, though that's not saying much. You probably realized that I dislike this show, but the animation is on a whole new level, it's really great.\\n\\n\r\n~sound~ 8/10\\n\r\nThe opening songs were great. 'My Dearest' and 'The Everlasting Guilty Crown' are both upbeat songs. Supercell deserves all the praise it got, their songs were great and the less upbeat, sad song 'Euterpe' is just as good. The ending songs weren't very spectacular but certainly above average. The background music and sound effects are both fitting and the (Japanese) voice actors did a great job with that horrible script, they made ridiculous lines sound less stupid, which is a great achievement. One problem: now and then there is a j-pop song playing in the background during battles, which is unfitting.\\n\r\n[CONCLUSION]\\n\r\nThe music and the sounds were great, the voice actors did a good job and aside from some small problems, the sound is good. It's aside from the animation the only good thing that came forth from this mess.\\n\\n\r\n~characters~ 1/10\\n\r\nHahaha my favorite part, our main character is one of the most annoying fictional characters I've ever encountered. Shu is an\\n\r\nunlikable and unpleasant person who spends the first half of the show whining and hitting on an emotionless doll (best main character ever) he has no character development, only personality swaps (I'm a whiny brad, 10 minutes later I'm a badass, 10 minutes later I'm a dictator ruling my school) and speaking of a lack of character development, his girlfriend Inori has no personality to begin with so there is no character development at all. She is an emotionless pretty doll, nothing more and nothing less. We also have Gai who is not the worst character of the bunch (not like that is saying very much), he was bland but at least he had a personality and him hitting Shu in his face was hilarious. The villains are evil for no good reason, Dan Eagleman is my hero (and the most awesome character of this show) and every female is part of Shu's harem or a fanservice object. We still don't know who the guys who are working for Daath are and Mana is just there for the incest vibes. \\n\r\n[CONCLUSION]\\n\r\nEveryone who loves poorly written characters will love this show, especially if you love incest vibes and useless half naked women. This cast is more than bad, it's an insult to anime and women, or humanity in general. \\n\\n\r\n~enjoyment~ 3/10\\n\r\nActually, it was extremely enjoyable. I was laughing out loud while watching this, the pure stupidity of this show turned it into a hilarious comedy. And watching Shu suffer was the ultimate wishfulfillment, how is it possible to create a main character so unlikable? This show is a glorious trainwreck with beautiful animation and awesome music, but it's still a trainwreck. Still, laughing about the stupidity of this show is fun.\\n\r\n[CONCLUSION]\\n\r\nThis show is bad, the things that make an anime great are well-written stories and characters. And let's face, this anime has a horrible story and a terrible cast. If it was not for the 'pretty colors' and 'nice music' everyone would have neglected this anime. It is funny when it's supposed to be serious and it's plain bad when it's supposed to be funny. And the fanservice, the damn fanservice is everywhere, because why would you write a good story when you can just use fanservice to keep viewers interested? \\n\\n\r\nDo you want to watch it? No, you don't want to watch this show. I warned you, don't blame me if you lose you faith in humanity after watching this. This train wreck is not worth your time, and I want those 8 hours of my life back! Peace.",

            "content": "Just as the average idiot that is fooled by fast food commercials, I must admit I felt the same when watching Guilty Crown. I'm not that much of an avid anime viewer, to be honest, I watch a fairly modest amount of anime to base an opinion (At least I hope so). I decided to try out Guilty Crown because I was enticed by the animation and mechas. Of course, I had no idea it was a decision that I would regret.\r\nJudging from the first episode, I couldn't really say much. I decided to continue with the hope that it would get better. Boy, wasI ever wrong.\\n\\n\r\nEach episode I watched, the more I hated the show, and its characters.\\n\r\n With unlikable characters, it was even harder to watch. But what made it extremely unbearable was the amalgamation of every single anime cliche. I'm not saying that cliches shouldn't be used. Sometimes they work or you need to use it for the sake of the plot, but in this case, they overdid it.\\n\\n\r\nCompiling typical high school anime cliches such as cultural festivals and beach episodes with serious science fiction anime cliches like mechas, monster girls, and evil government scientists, it just didn't and couldn't work.  Because of all these cliches pieced together, there was no discernible plot that was comprehensible. Well, there was a plot of course, but it wasn't easy to follow or properly explained.\\n\\n\r\nI can rant all day and night about the show, but I must admit that the animation and visual effects were superb. Not to mention, SOME elements of plot that I managed to extract, like the Apocalypse Virus, and the Void Genome. Those I found fascinating and I honestly wished they focused more on just ONE those elements  because it would be a far more successful show, or at least more bearable to watch.\\n\\n\r\nAlas, I am just one opinion in the world. For those who actually enjoyed the show , I apologize and I accept your opinions as well. Maybe I missed something when I watched it. Or maybe I took it too seriously. I don't know. Anyways, feel free to watch Guilty Crown and judge it yourself. If you find something I missed, please let me know and enlighten me.",

            "content": "Time does a lot of strange things to a show's reputation, doesn't it? Once acclaimed anime like Kill la Kill are now considered terrible disappointments that couldn't live up to the legacy of its infinitely better predecessors, Mari Okada has gone from being cool to hate to cool to like to back again without any real middle-ground, and not getting into Symphogear is apparently the equivalent of suffering a major personality disorder. It's gotten to the point where I'm kind of missing the moe trend a bit. At least cute girl/slice-of-life fans have an understandable reason for why they like what they do. It remindsthem of a calmer time in their life. Not a reason I can sympathize with, but it's better than your reasons consisting of nothing but shouting memes all the time like you're the reincarnation of fucking He-Man.\\n\\n\r\nAnd yet, while Guilty Crown has definitely enjoyed a warmer reputation since it invited a fuck-ton of anime fans to smash it over the head with all the hammers at its disposal, people are still undecided regarding how much they enjoyed it. It's not like Samurai Flamenco where they say it's a great show that uses the insanity in order to get a message across. Most people just say it's a fun show to point and laugh at before refusing to put it on their favorites list because apparently being enjoyable in that vein is an automatic disqualification. Then they link Shinmaru's or Draggle's \"epic\" posts on the anime and relish on the fond memories of dumbness that trainwrecks like Aldnoah Zero could never hope to achieve. You know guys, I don't like it when you consider the show God's gift to anime because nothing spoils a product more than rampant fanboyism, but at least be honest with said gift when you receive it. If I can put the goddamn thing on my favorites list despite my generally pessimistic views on most of what surrounds the show, why can't you?\\n\\n\r\nI admit to having warmed up considerably towards Guilty Crown over the years. I don't find it as funny as most people, I don't consider it one of the most fun anime in years (although it's probably my favorite anime of 2011, a year that had quite a few shows I liked), and it kind of takes a few episodes to get really fun (first arc is okay, but everything after just dwarfs it by comparison). But in a medium that constantly winks to the audience and indulges on the joke to the point of over-the-top weariness in order to produce laughs or \"awesomeness\" or stupid donut metaphors that the characters in Silicon Valley would find dumb, shows that take their stupidity as seriously as Guilty Crown whilst simultaneously using the stupidity as an essential part of its core message are as hard to find as a five-legged gecko. Not to mention, the pacing, action, and characterization (however fucked up it is) are all solid for the most part, and the animation/music is generally great. And any anime that accomplishes all that deserves quite a few props, even if the stupidity you have to swallow in order to appreciate what it's going for can be a bit too \"anime\" for my taste, ironic or not.\\n\\n\r\nIn case you're one of the few people who haven't seen this show, I'll fill you in. Guilty Crown is about a boy named Shu Ouma, who on paper is your standard teen who's bored with life and treats his friends like they don't even exist, yet refuses to do anything about it, but in practice is the guy whose picture would be used as the definition of the word \"chew toy\" since everyone in-universe and out-of-universe loves to dump on the dude no matter what he does to the point that Lara Croft is recommending therapy. After discovering his scantily-clad crush, a pop singer named Inori, hiding in his secret place, he ends up getting roped in the middle of the conflict between a resistance group called Funeral Parlor and the Brittania-copy cat organization known as GHQ after acquiring a mysterious ability to pull objects out of people called \"The Power of the Kings\" (hahaha, insert Code Geass-ripoff joke here). I'd attempt to fill in the details regarding this conflict, but I'd rather not turn this review into an essay and Guilty Crown's plot is such a cluttered pile of bananas that Ikuhara fans wouldn't be able to explain in a way that makes any sense. So let's just say for simplicity's sake that the show is about Shu and his growth from a nobody to the king that Japan deserves. And since Japan is run by a bunch of idiots in this universe, it stands to reason that their king would be the biggest fuck-up the likes of which has never been seen.\\n\\n\r\nAs I was doing my third rewatch of the series, watching the show go to more and more desperate attempts to torture our pretty boy main, I kept getting a high school version of Jack Raiden from Metal Gear Solid 2 stuck in my head: a controversial pretty boy in love with a badly written fucktard whose attempts at being cooler than he actually is is both sad and kinda tragic when you realize why the creators made him out to be the protagonist in the first place. And since we're bringing up Metal Gear Solid, Guilty Crown shares a fuck load of similarities with that franchise, doesn't it? Like the horrible dialogue, superpowers mixed with mecha, girls taking every opportunity to show their cleavage even when being shot at, campy military leaders that are at odds with their more realistic underlings, post-modern themes that people are divided on regarding their existence to this day, and the fact that it pulls off the goofiest shit with a straight face. Wonder if Hideo Kojima has ever taken the opportunity to watch this thing. I'd be surprised if it didn't end up in his top five anime series of all-time.\\n\\n\r\nFortunately for you, Guilty Crown, I really love Metal Gear Solid. Especially 2. And I have a certain amount of fondness for Mr. and Mrs. Fucknugget too. But at the same time, whilst I'm glad we agree that turning Shu into a break-dancing cyborg ninja would have been a bit too post-modern for the series (and we live in a world where an Alexandre Dumas adaptation can have a giant mecha fight out of nowhere and still get acclaims across the board), I will say that not turning Dan Eagleman into a shirtless right-wing nut who body slams people from his giant mecha is a fucking missed opportunity. Because honestly Guilty Crown, I kind of find your villains a bit on the meh side. Scarface ain't bad or anything, but he's no Revolver Ocelot or Liquid Snake or Solidus...uh actually Solidus was worse, so never mind.\\n\\n\r\nAnyways, Guilty Crown comes off to me more and more over the years less like a bad anime and more like a good show that nobody wanted because it didn't fit within what they were used to. Mainly, being offensive on purpose, because this show is clearly trying to offend you and it's not getting any of the context wrong whilst doing so like, say, Cross Ange. Shu is not as inconsistent a character as people say he is. He's a nice but REALLY stupid dude who just can't win and goes to more and more extremes to try and compensate for his personality flaws, only to fuck up in a very consistent rate. Every time he tries to grow, he finds himself unable to do so because something (really stupid) always happens that gets in his way. Even when he turns into a neo-Nazi wannabe, he (hilariously) reassures us that he's doing it for the good of the school and that after they were free, he could drop the act. And when that plan failed, he went through the standard character growth we expect from an underdog protagonist before finally becoming the Jesus Dalai Lama Christ the cast deserved. A very dumb one, but it's not like the characters surrounding him were much better at that point. Specially Inori, who's so blatantly wish-fulfillment-y that it gets hilarious.\\n\\n\r\nI'm gonna be straight with you guys here. I laugh more at Guilty Crown whenever somebody (particularly Shu) worships Inori like she's every man's fantasy when it's plainly obvious she's the sexist caricature that the underbelly of the Evangelion fans picture Rei to be. When Shu does something incredibly climactic to him, but to an outsider's view, it's just something people see as normal. When he's being a wannabe Neo-Nazi, because don't we all? The segway joke that the Internet seems to have latched onto is cute, but I honestly think it's an overrated thing to focus on, and Shu getting tortured can be a bit hit-and-miss. That joke when the entire school zoomed in on him after he touched a classmate's boob whilst testing out his voids was cool. The one when Ayase put him through the crapper after he took pity on her handicapped status, not so much.\\n\\n\r\nBut something about that first joke really sticks with me, probably because it's Shu's entire motivation for even being the main character before all his convoluted backstory gets revealed (and even then, it's the major reason for why he does everything even when he says he's doing it for his friends). I know a lot of people, including me, have criticized that relationship in the past, seeing it as nothing more than a joke that makes Raiden's and Rosemary's relationship drama look well-written. But also like Raiden and Rosemary, I can't help but see it as intentionally bad given how it's an attraction that's entirely based on lies and even when something genuine comes from it, it never works out to the characters' benefit. The final scene in particular makes me laugh like a hyena when it's revealed what came out of the relationship. It's just so fucked up and so fitting that Shu can't move on from a relationship with a living sex doll even when she doomed him to a life of blindness. In fact, my only complaint with the relationship is that it was never consummated at all. What? Like it would have been more out of place than anything else in this show?\\n\\n\r\nHaving said that, Guilty Crown still has moments of dumb that not even being satirical/ironic about can excuse. The fact that Shu can only pull voids from those under 17 years of age is incredibly contrived with no good (or any) explanation given for it whatsoever. And the final act sort when an important character is brought back to life on the opposite side...without wishing to spoil much, remember the final climax in Metal Gear Solid 4 when Snake and Liquid Ocelot had their last showdown? Then after the latter is defeated, another character shows up at the last minute to put everything into perspective whilst trying to make his side in the right despite the many lives that were lost in the process? Well let's just say Guilty Crown's final bad guy fares no better at justifying himself, and I doubt we'll be getting another sequel sometime down the line that paints his journey towards peace as Evil vs. Evil.\\n\\n\r\nI'm not really sure what the reaction to Guilty Crown would be if it came out now, or what my reaction would be if my current self saw it for the first time, especially if I wasn't marathoning it. Nonetheless, the fact remains that no other trainwreck has really caught on as much as this show has to the point that it was put on a now defunct comedy watch with people saying \"it's enjoyable, but not for the reason it thinks it's being\". You wouldn't hear them say the same thing about Sword Art Online and Psycho-Pass 2. And Aldnoah Zero just bored folks a few episodes into the second season. Whilst I can say what I enjoy about this show fine (mainly by being Metal Gear Solid 2 if converted through an anime filter whilst removing most of the parts that would work in a video game but not in a series), what exactly was so special about this particular trainwreck that made it constant entertainment for them? And why are they so hesitant to rank it amongst their favorites if it kept their eyes glued to the screen the entire way through, especially when stuff like Code Geass, Star Driver, and Symphogear can make it on?\\n\\n\r\nI suspect that both questions share the same answer. Maybe it's the cynical characters. Maybe it's the pretentious tone. Maybe it's the fact that whilst shows like Code Geass and Symphogear make no sense, Guilty Crown really makes no sense.",

            "content": "Guilty Crown was definitely an absolute blast to watch due to its amazing visuals and amazing sound. However, it was extremely difficult to really immerse yourself in a story that is incoherent and full of loopholes. In essence, I award Guilty Crown with the title of Michael Bay's Transformers of anime.\r\nStory: 5/10\r\nGuilty Crown's story isn't bad per se. It's actually a really really good and interesting story, one which actually had me excited from when I started this anime. It follows the primary protagonist Shu as he meets Inori, a famous singer who also happens to be part of the terrorist organisation Funeral Parlour. Hisadoration for her then leads him into a life threatening situation where he tries to save her and she gives him the Power of the Kings, a power which, frankly, is way too overpowered when given to someone who actually knows how to use it. Due to this encounter, he joins Funeral Parlour in their attempt to fight against GHQ, an organisation which has seized authority and power in Japan after they were meant to prevent outbreaks of the Apocaypse Virus, a virus that had broken out ten years prior to the setting of the current story.\\n\\n\r\nDid you get all that? If not, then you may not want to watch this anime because it gets a lot more complicated than that. It only takes a few episodes for the entire story to go completely balls up and I spent a solid few minutes after most episodes reading a synopsis of what had just happened and to see if I had missed anything that was particularly important. However, having already made such negative comments about the story, I want to say that it's not bad. It's actually really good. I was stongly interested and intrigued by what it actually had to offer me. It's just the way in which the story is told leaves so many loose ends that will have you scratching your head and asking many, many questions... So many questions. The story continually introduces plot point after plot point without explaining previous plot points and it simply becomes a huge mess.\\n\\n\r\nIn addition to such a problem, the pacing is horrendous. For example, the beginning of the anime is somewhat slow; Shu tries to balance life with Funeral Parlour and life with school after gaining his powers. Then a few episodes later, Shu is desperately trying to save the world from some sort of evil scheme which is never really properly introduced. It takes well over a full episode to establish the fact that Shu is a socially awkward boy but it takes a few minutes for someone to steal something of importance and almost kill everyone in the world with it. And I just want to reiterate once again that the pacing is absolutely horrendous.\\n\\n\r\nIt's only after episode 12 when I feel like things improve quite a bit. However, episode 13 is a pretty huge leap forward in time, which might cause some people to become quite pissed off. I didn't mind it and I also believe that it was pretty well explained though you might ask some questions about the logic regarding certain decisions that were made during the time skip but hey, one does not simply question the logic of an anime. This second half of the series stop introducing new plot points and finally starts explaining a few of them and answering some of the questions that you may have. Key word: few. But after 12 episodes of an absolute mess, it might be a bit late for some people to start accepting answers and explanations.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 6/10\\n\\n\r\nThis story is focused primarily on Shu and Inori, along with other main characters like Gai, and... Gai, the leader of funeral party in the first half of the series. These are only three characters who really ever receive any development. And this bugs me quite a bit because the supporting cast of around 20 other characters was just as interesting, if not more interesting, than the main cast. The supporting cast (this includes villains) isn't given enough screen time for us to want to know more about them but given nowehere near enough time for any meaningful development to occur. Even when surprising revelations were made about the supporting characters, it really had no impact on me because I couldn't really bring myself to actually feel that much for them.\\n\\n\r\nOn the other hand, you have the main cast of Shu, Inori, and Gai. Each of these characters is developed rather nicely. However, due to the pacing of the story and the requirements of each character for their respective roles in this mess of a story, the process of their development is also somewhat a mess. In the second half of he series though, just as quality of the story improves, the development of each of the three main characters improves as well.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation & Art: 11/10\\n\\n\r\nNow forgive the 11/10 that I have given the animation and art. It's because I've given 10/10's to anime whose animation and art doesn't even come close to comparing to Guilty Crown's and I feel like it would be a huge injustice to Guilty Crown if I gave it a measly 10/10. Having said all that, you should already know that the animation and art is absolutely stunning; an absolute feast for your eyes. The normal scenes like when Shu is sitting in highschool or at home would be considered amazing in many other anime. I can't even begin to describe just how good the action scenes are. Or how good Guilty Crown can look in scenes where it tries to be beautiful.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nJust like the animation and art, the sound is also sublime. The openings and closings provide really great listens whether in the anime or outside the anime. The background music really scales up the epic-ness of the fight scenes and CAN evoke some emotion. And Inori's singing  is as beautiful as beautiful can get. There isn't much I really can say about the music in this anime, except that I strongly recommend you go listen to every single song that they have to offer.\\n\\n\r\nThe voice acting (I watched Guilty Crown dubbed) on the other hand is the reason I didn't also give sound an 11/10. It wasn't bad. But it wasn't good either. Some characters had really good voice acting which contained a lot of emotion and really helped me immerse myself in the anime while some characters had somewhat bland voice acting.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8/10 \\n\\n\r\nGuilty Crown is a good anime and I enjoyed it quite a bit. Episodes 1-12 were difficult to comprehend to say the least but when some things are explained in the second half of the anime, I began to really appreciate what had actually occurred in the first 12 episodes and it really took the burden of all the questions I had off my mind. If there's anything that everyone should enjoy when watching Guilty Crown, it's the animation, art, and sound. And it's mainly these three things coupled with the interesting but somewhat badly-told story that I reccommmend that you watch this anime.\\n\\n\r\nThank you for reading! Any feedback is much appreciated.",

            "content": "After watching this anime, I found myself thinking about how I may randomly lose very good scenes and animes only because of my lack of trust in covers. Of course, if you look at its name, at its description and even at its cover, you (whoever that might be) could consider this anime to be quite another clich\u00e9. In the end, maybe it is. But isn't it quite difficult nowadays to choose between fake and true? We are bound to our own personal feelings and reactions when watching an anime; in the end, all we see is our own enjoyment (received while and after watchingthe respective anime). So, after watching Guilty Crown, I got a very nice feeling inside. I thought to myself \u201dthis is not such a wonderful anime; but, even so, this is a very good anime, even with its clich\u00e9s and traps, I enjoyed every bit of it\u201d. After realising that, I couldn't but understand that whenever one cannot objectively rate an anime, he or she can at least react subjectively with his/hers honest and fresh emotions, feelings, and views. \\n\\n\r\nGuilty Crown is not special in many ways : there are a series of clich\u00e9s in it: the personalities of the characters are not new, the lines they use are not new, anything they may say or act is not entirely now (the cliche of a very good main character, too kind to bear the burden on his shoulders, the girl who can save the day, but is broken inside... a blonde students' president, a bunch of friends that might easily get hurt, a world in destruction, a twisted past, lost memories, etc. They are all there: but yet, how do we judge the originality of such an anime? I cannot do it, for I have not watched that many animes as to know which took what from another. If you are in search of originality, I might not be the one to entrust you with such a hint regarding this particular anime: for I do not know. What I do know, though, is that you will probably enjoy its fine art and style, its beautiful soundtrack; that you will perhaps enjoy Gai, the handsome, beautiful and mysterious long-haired guy, that you will love and hate Shuu for his shyness, for his kindness, for his stupidity... that you might love Inori, both her songs and her characters, that you might as well get crazy over the plot and its doings, that you might enjoy every second of its action without even realising it... that is, without even realising it, you might get caught in a very twisted, beautiful world: the world of fantasy. A place where you can no longer realise who you are, nor think about that. \\n\r\nWhat I am trying to say is that I do not think this anime is about originality at all - I do not talk nowadays too much about originality, it's suspiciously hard to really know what is original or not. But you have too look into it and see if it moves any parts of you. And if it does, I think that is a good anime. That is what I believe Guilty Crown is such a good anime: because of the feelings it transmits.\\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed the story, also the arts, the sound tacking and had a very good time watching it (2 days /22 episodes). I strongly recommend the band Supercell also (the ones who provided the song themes for this anime; Inori's Departures is perhaps one of the cutest songs I have heard in anime up till now). So, for a weekend, you might as well try watching Guilty Crown: I believe you will find in it the drop of action-drama-super power- science fiction -and love-and music- you need to relax and fill your mind with fantasy and beauty.",

            "content": "Guilty Crown is a lot like a soup with too many ingredients in which half of them have gone stale. The setting is pretty much Code Geass--occupied Japan, resistance fighters, and a mysterious power given to a highschool student. The cast is glutted with underdeveloped characters, quite a few of which go on to become cannon fodder, and the subplots and sequence of events are choppy and uneven. The series does touch on one particularly interesting theme however; those seeking to change the system start turning into the very thing they despised. Unfortunately some pretty bizarre and incredulous events put an abrupt end to severalepisodes' worth of development in lieu of some out-of-place Judeo-Christian esotericism and a few climactic battles. The final ending is either laughable or bittersweet depending on your take. Overall I'd say Guilty Crown brings in too many elements and themes which are better handled by other series, and then leaves them half-baked.",

            "content": "One word to describe this anime: Overrated.\r\nYes it is overrated not because of it's great artwork, but because the most important aspects of a show the characters and story are extremely weak.\r\nStory\r\nIt's just a mess. Talk about Deus Ex Machina...it just seems that every thing almost always works out OR they seem to be doing fine and all of sudden something just happens that's suppose to shock us GASP..no. It tries to be complex, new, but it's not. It's all stuff I've seen a million times before and well that just makes the story plain mediocre and uninteresting. I give it a 4.\r\nCharacters\r\nTurrible (in aCharles Barkley voice). No one you can relate to, no one you can sympathize with because the characters just do not develop throughout the entire anime. The lack of going deeper than the skin, really hurts the shows characters. I ended up hating most of them, especially Shu, Inori and Gai. I felt worse for the guy who's brother had been infected with the virus. He had a lot more depth than the 3 main leads. I give the characters a 2.\\n\\n\r\nArt\\n\\n\r\nGreat. That's all I can say, but makes me think they probably spent too much on the artwork rather than on story/character development which is a damn shame. I give the artwork a 9.\\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\r\nA few good songs in here, but your typical jpop stuff. Voice acting...well ok I guess. Inori is the silent type just plain boring. I give it a 7\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment/Overall\\n\\n\r\nI basically watched it expecting more and well I was just disappointed. It's not deep and it's only good to look at. That's about it. I would not recommend it. It's extremely overrated. It's just a plain mediocre anime. Not worth watching.",

            "content": "Story: 3/10\r\nI'll try my best no to spoil anything... How can you describe the story? The story is inconsistent from the very begining to the end. The first few episodes follow a storyline that has quite an original setting (NB: a vaccin isn't used this way) and is decent. Then for the rest of the show the story makes no sense at all. A whole bunch of unbelievable coincidences happen which don't make any sense. It feels like the story was out of breath and the author added that at the end to be able to make it more interesting. It had the opposing effect.\r\nArt:8/8\\n\r\nThe art is breathtaking. It is extremly good and saves a little bit this anime. I think it was truly wasted on this.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8/8\\n\r\nThe background music is good and all the themes are just awesome.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 3/10\\n\r\nI don't particularly dislike the characters. I just think that the story destroys them. For exemple, numerous times you should pity the characters but the only thing that comes to mind is WHY? I mean they some overly stupid things for no real reason and you're suppose to sympathize with them? There still are some good characters like the woman in the wheelchair but most of the characters are so poor. That was without talking about the almost non-existant character developpement. It is there with the two main characters and then fades away for the other characters\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 5/10\\n\r\nI think I was pretty pissed off while watching this but the romance made it still enjoyable.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 5.4/10\\n\r\nI think it was a less than average series. I would never recommend it to anyone. In fact, I'd do the opposite. If you don't really mind a crappy story and pathetic characters then watch Guilty Crown. If not then don't\\n\\n\r\nSorry for everyone that really likes this series but let's face it: It ain't great!",

Its phenomenal.\\n\\n\r\nbasically if your going into this anime with high expectations you'll be pretty disappointed. for avid anime watchers you'll soon see many plot holes, unexplained scenes and tons of other things. HOWEVER, if you expect some ass kicking then there's a little less let down.\\n\\n\r\nstory 3/10 : \\n\r\ni'm not sure if i should say anything here at all. the story was just meh. there was nothing here that really pulled me to watch more. the story is pretty bland. you get a wimpy average boy, and of course with superpowers, getting pulled into a mess. cliche if i may add. i have nothing against cliche but this was poorly executed IMO. i've never read the original (if there is one) so i can't tell if it's supposed to be rushed. the story has itself rushing through it's paces before you even understand what happened. this is a technique some writers use and sometime turn out well, but in this case in didn't. if your not someone that enjoys deep plot then this won't matter.\\n\\n\r\nArt 10/10:\\n\r\ngod this was amazing. i have this strict rule on how the art at least has to look before i watch it. in this case, it's the reason i watched it in the first place. it's just amazing, so much so i feel bad for the artist because the story is so poor.the art is brilliant no matter from buildings to mechas to people. they are all beautifully designed and drawn. i don't have much more to say, it's just brilliant.\\n\\n\r\nSound 10/10:\\n\r\nhere's something most people don't look into. music, sound, is always in the background and people hardly notice unless it's VERY bad. here's another thing about sound. it's not only how it sound but when. a theme song place at the right scene can make tears drip from you. although the story itself wasn't enough to propel me to  tears, the combination of the art and sound could, a few times. it has it's music placed at very nice moments, and mind you this is really good music. even the voice actresses aren't bad. BTW, music by supercell!\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 7/10:\\n\r\nthe characters are bland.for the first half or so you don't see much of the characters (internally). however this is not the case throughout the anime. the characters have amazing development (negatively IMO) and revelations. the character designs where good and so were the relationships between them. some of these relationships for complex than others. although at the same time we have some flat relationships(meaning relationships with little complexity) . all and all it was good. i have a thing against wimpy male leads which was minus one for me. if you have nothing against whiny crybaby male leads plus one to the rating for character.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 7/10:\\n\r\nthe enjoyment of the anime for me was really the killing.this isn't in the tags(no idea why) but there is romance(not sure if spoiler). which is always something i like to expect. the fighting scene are very nice(thank you art &music). there were some rage moments, for most people at least, i don't rage much so i'm just guessing here.generally it's an anime that can be enjoyed more if less hope is put in. the story itself isn't intrigueing, but the art&music is well enough to keep me watching. the characters, design and voice acting, are quite good as well.unless your a fan boy/girl then no problems here. \\n\\n\r\nOverall 7/10:\\n\r\n i'd hate to say this but this anime pretty much had everything going for it, but the story. the story was just too poor for me. i was tempted to give it a 1/10 but there was a lot of thought placed into the backstory of the anime. honestly i feel bad for the other parts because the story really put them to waste, since usually it's always the story that keeps the anime up.\\n\\n\r\nso all and all. it's a good watch if your someone that appreciates good art&music. it's a bad watch if you enjoy deep engaging story lines. it's a great watch if you enjoy cliche moments and cool fighting scenes.\\n\\n\r\nnote: first review and honestly don't think was that good.",

[audiovisual glitch] v-v-viewing Guilty Crown.\r\nGuilty Crown is this absolutely gorgeous looking show with designs by my main man redjuice and directed by Araki Tetsurou whom I don't seem to remember anything about because he's so easily forgettable.\r\nOnto the main event, lets start with the story (by the way I don't give a shit what you think, spoilers ahead). It all begins when this dude whose name sounds like \"shoe\", shu(?), shuu(?) - in any case we'll name him shoe or something because Japanese language is stupid. So this dudefinds this scantly dressed wen- sorry, girl in an abandoned building where he uses to hang out (boy what a creep). It turns out the girl is a popular niconico idol so naturally he wants to tap dat ass but shit happens and she gets captured by the JSDF or something crazy like that. The nigga gets the crystal meth from her and decides to listen to some voice coming out of that doraemon looking thing. So this guy goes to finish the drug deal in Inori's stead and he gets beat up by some macho looking sperglord. After that he gets saved by this yakuza jesus. So then two minutes later he gets shot in the fuckin heart like a true street ninja and it blows up the crystal meth vial, which goes to his head immediately and gives him the power to pull fridges out of people's chests. So he pulls out this fridge that looks like a sword from Inori's valley and then cuts a fucking gundam in half.\\n\r\nDUDE IM SOLD\\n\\n\r\nSo now that we got that out of the way, lets get onto the main dish. The plot.\\n\\n\r\nIf anything I learned from this is how dumb people can be at times, or how you SHOULDN'T TRUST A FORMER DRUG ADDICT THAT SOLD YOU OFF LIKE JUDAS. THANKS YAHIRO.\\n\r\nI'm 100% serious when I say that Yahiro is a fucking dick, and a TON of things could've been avoided by not listening to him. But our MC here is a tough nut to crack so he didn't realize he lost his hand because of him in episode 22 at the table.\\n\r\nThere are so, so many simply dumb things about the story that I could list here but that's not the point of the review.\\n\\n\r\nI could probably go over the sound or the art, but I doubt anybody is interested in that.\\n\r\nI give both the art and sound a 9/10, those are pretty much the only solid points of this show.\\n\\n\r\nDue to the fact that MC went through life very quickly and suffered of PTSD from a young age, it makes me wonder if the author had some sort of sick fetish with torturing him. He suffered every kind of pain possible, atleast psychologically, from the impact of a friend dying to despair, hopelessness, fear, anxiety, the list goes on. I don't think people give him enough credit when they say he \"TURNED ALPHA\" or \"BECAME A REAL MANE\" in the end because the poor lad went through so much in these 22 episodes I'm surprised he didn't end up in therapy after episode 22.\\n\\n\r\nSo, basically, if you enjoy lots of anime, if your backlog is infinite and you don't mind something that's different from the sea of garbage shows and stock plots most anime seems to originate from, you can try this. This is a perfectly fine choice for anybody who wants to see something refreshing. I myself have enjoyed it and I would recommend it. \\n\\n\r\nAlot of people seem to worship the plot of this like it's a masterpiece or something, but, really, it's simply not that amazing. I've seen so many other shows that did the \"strong ass moralfag\" trope so much better. And in a show where people have morals like this you need scenes where people are screaming their will at the top of their mother fucking lungs. Unfortunate lack of screaming real, legit screaming in this show.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters that are advertised in the show as \"having strong morals\" are actually just jokes. There's this yakuza jesus that does a 180 at some point in the plot and basically ruins everything the series has been building his character up to. Which is just dumb.\\n\r\nIf it helps, I know it helped me in any case, the girls are cute, most of them, not talking about that blonde slut here. Fucking piece of shit didn't even die.\\n\r\n(That's about it the only girls that ever do something are Inori, Ayase and Tsugumi, by the way Tsugumi best girl) \\n\r\nRedjuice's strong point is drawing girls that you'd tap without a second thought, masterfully shown in his works ranging from the Beatless illustrations to that one cover on REDALiCE's album that had like one good track because the guy can only do shitty J-Core that died back in 2008. So basically if you're into cute girls you might as well watch this because you won't be disappointed. From catsuits and bouncing fat cat tats to designer costumes and the dude's trademark hairclips. If you want to find your waifu do take this ride.\\n\\n\r\nI was very impressed to see EGOIST being a cameo in this show, I very much enjoy whatever comes out of their funhouse and I was not disappointed by Guilty Crown. Strong vocals by Chelly and very well crafted and composed lyrics by my main man Ryo from supercell that made this really cool Vocaloid song back a couple years ago. Very touching lyrics, very fitting for the setting the plot runs in, very, very soothing. I must admit that when I was watching episode 22 the ending song hit a number on me and had me tear up because of how well executed the scene was, the timing was just right and the premise was decent enough for a tearjerk moment. I guess it all goes to the director on this one, very well done. The music is nothing short of great, tracks ranging from warm instrumental arrangements to just-right electronic \"time to get pumped\" kind of tracks which are very well embedded in the last couple episodes near the climax of the plot. \\n\r\nIf only the plot was better, my god, this could've been a 9 or even 10. Instead?\\n\\n\r\nI give this a light 7. Nothing more, nothing less, because this show can make you very mad if you're a no-bullshit person like me that likes to nitpick and question everything, even when I told my disbelief to hang itself somewhere in the corner there were still things that ticked me off. And I can say that I enjoyed shows of magical qualities like Kakumeiki Valvrave without rising an eyebrow constantly through the second half, although that show too has a shitty ending. But this is just my opinion. What's yours? Did you like Guilty Crown? Did you hate it?\\n\r\nCheezburgr Fantano here... Production I.G. ... EGOIST... Guilty Crown.\\n\r\nForever.\\n\\n",

            "content": "Most overrated anime of 2011. Which had a lot of potential and nice art but ! (yeah here it comes) Because of poor execution of storytelling, failed character psychology design and not so good episode structure, is definitely far from great. Not mentioning all the clich\u00e9 present in big portions: high-school, black and white, every important guy has to have his girl, she has to be cute or capable(not both), mentally unstable main character, badass char, saving futuristic japan issue... The worst thing is probably the continuity of episodes. Many things doesn't make sense, main plot is barely holding throughout the episodes. Anime itself doesn'tstick to any genre. You can find mix(mess) of romance, fantasy, sic-fi, mecha, action, tragedy, psychology elements that are misapplied in whole concept. Its obvious that GC tried to copy loads of stuff from Neon Genesis (Shinji,Dad,mom), Code Geass (Rebellion,Tyrant transformation) etc.. Unfortunately Its not working out in the incoherent story with illogical behaviour of characters. The only thing worth of praise is fluid animation and high-quality art design. The anime might be targeting younger audience with lesser anime experience.\\n",

I don't do Mecha anime so my ignorance is probable cause for the outcome. \r\nShy boy becomes OP, overcomes tragedies and solitude and joins organization for the greater good of the nation. How many times have we seen that happen? Well, it's not as cliche as it aims to be which was a relief actually.\r\nPlaying with the physical boundaries of someones soul, their true selves, their hearts? What a basis for a story! Action sequences were absolutely fantastic! Thoroughly enjoyable and the animation didn't cut corners formost of it either thank goodness! They hit the fight scenes with everything they had and timed them perfectly, just when you wanted Shu to be a badass, he compelled. Honestly, I never expected any form of romance or even emotional course for this anime but it sure did take me there. \\n\\n\r\nSecond half pressed a bit of downfall in story and development but it picked up by the end. Speaking of, the ending that WAS going to happen, I feel I would have enjoyed more than the what happened but I am not dissatisfied with it. This is worth a watch, not top notch priority worthy though",

            "content": "After finishing this series, Guilty Crown left me feeling\u2026 rather empty. The production value behind the show was great, the animation breathtaking, the OST was conducted by one of the renowned musician in the industry, and above all else, we had an all-star seiyuu cast. Everything looked very beautiful and it was a joy for my eyes and ears to enjoy. So what went wrong?\r\nI believe this was mostly because of the production committee behind GC played everything \u201ctoo safe\u201d, and \u201claziness\u201d was to blame. \r\nGC took a lot of themes and tropes from many other different animes and mashed them all up together, packagedthem so well that it could easily appeal to the mass audience. In one way, GC was quite a hit and a commercial success, but on the other hand, it became a train wreck and a huge loss of potential. \\n\\n\r\nOne of the many tropes GC used was by making a \u201crelatable\u201d male protagonist, Shu Ouma, who was presented as a shy boy who had difficulties in making friends with others, he was a coward, low self-esteem and selfish, in essence, hardly any good trades. He felt that he would be of no use to the world. In a sense, many teenagers who are still developing could well face these issues in real life and may find Shu \u201crelatable\u201d, as personally I did face similar troubles years ago. \\n\\n\r\nGC then proceeded to develop him more as a character by having various traumatic events of different magnitudes affecting him. Unfortunately, I can\u2019t help myself but feel that the creators put a rather half-assed effort on this. Minor events that shouldn\u2019t affect Shu so much made him depressed for weeks, yet a much larger event which should have a bigger impact on him, Shu just brushed it off as if it never happened. The said traumatic events affected Shu in practically any way the creators made it convenient for themselves to portray Shu the way they wanted to.\\n\\n\r\nAs a consequence, any thoughts of believing Shu as a \u201creal\u201d character was turned into dust. His progressive growth as a character was nonsensical, and he was like a totally different character throughout the series, he turned from Haruyuki into Kirito at some point, and turned into Lelouch thereafter. He was socially inept at the beginning, and then suddenly he became so likable to others around that he managed to form a pseudo-harem and even became a leader. I understand how major life events can turn a person 180 degrees, but sadly it wasn\u2019t done very well here.\\n\\n\r\nAnother mess of a character in GC would be Inori Yuzuriha, the poster girl of the series. Her character designs were no doubt decent, sadly it felt way out of place when used in the show. Who on earth would wear a sideboob outfit in the middle of a fight against robots? Sorry but to me she was created merely to help promote the sales of merchandises and Blu-rays. Her personality was also tailored into what could be the perfect waifu material \u2013 soft spoken, kuudere, beautiful, sexy (who was never aware that Shu was ogling at her tities), strong-willed, badass and wasn\u2019t afraid to kill. Sounds to me she was the ultimate otaku fantasy wife who should be able to fulfill most of their fetishes. \\n\\n\r\nAll of these were fine should they provided a fine backstory for her, but unfortunately there wasn\u2019t any, despite the fact that she was very relevant to the plot. I found myself picturing her as a sex combat maid android sent from the future, as it made much more sense this way. (sigh)\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of the plot, I am often perplexed by the fact that the anime producers did not want to let go of the school setting. Yep you guessed it, the usual school festivals and onsen scenes were present. The terrorists were mostly teenagers who for some reason so immensely talented and trained well enough to stand up against the military. Gai was merely a 17 years old boy but he acted as if he was Hitler, somehow Inori could shoot more accurately than James Bond because she was \"talented and trained\", and the wanted serial killer cum super hacker was only 14. The fact that they were merely teens made it convenient for the producers to brush off any silly actions the characters made as \u201cpubescent mood swings\u201d or \u201cbecause love is blind\u201d.\\n\\n\r\nFurthermore, they made all the good guys in GC teenagers, and most of the adults were the bad guys. The black and white hat that were assigned to the characters were so blatantly obvious that it was difficult to take the antagonists\u2019 ultimate evil goal seriously, and the show did not actually explain it well on the motive of their plans, simply throwing in the mask of \u201cI am evil just because I am\u201d to them.  \\n\\n\r\nThe plot elements introduced in GC were actually very interesting, especially the concept of the shape of a people\u2019s heart in the form of \u201cVoids\u201d, which I believe to hold immense potential to make a great show if handled well. However, it seemed to me that the producers were lazy to elaborate on the Void concept, using it merely as a convenient Dues Ex Machina that Shu and Gai often pulled off to solve whatever difficult situations they were stuck in. What happened to \u201cas the emotions and fears of a person change, so do the form of their Voids?\u201d I never see any change in a person\u2019s Void whatsoever in the show regardless of the so-called \u201cchange of feelings and fears\u201d occurring in said person. \\n\\n\r\nNotice how I repeated the word \u201cconvenience\u201d so many times in this review, basically, this summed up how lazy the writers were when they were concocting the plot of GC. This extends further to the Apocalypse Virus, the Lost Christmas incident and the subsequent selective amnesia Shu had, the ultimate motive of the antagonists, to the entire setting of GC itself. The writers hardly finished anything they started.\\n\\n\r\nUltimately, GC could be seen as a summer blockbuster anime which came in with a bang, and ended without leaving a trace of excellence behind. With its beautiful presentation and many tropes thrown in, it might appeal to anime newcomers, and personally I also believe that GC is a decent choice to introduce anime to others. But the poorly written plot and characters left a bitter taste to those who expected a mesmerizing tale from one of the most famous modern animes out there. \\n",

            "content": "Review [After watching eps 1-6]\r\nAll right here we go. I've decided to make a review so that I could express my thoughts regarding this slightly overhyped shounen series. I'm not going to compare it with code geass because I've dropped code geass recently (for some reason, I really don't like mechas :P and I have only managed to watch a few episodes). \r\nStory: [5/10]\r\nHere goes the story. It takes place in Tokyo in 2039 after the outbreak of a mysterious virus. A random wimp (Shu) meets a cute girl (Inori) who is supposedly a member of a rebel group (wth?) called \"Funeral Parlor\" and getscaught up in a small-scale war between the aforementioned group and the multinational organization called GHQ (an org that governs Japan). Amidst the heart of war, he aqcuired an ability (called power of the king) from a canister which enabled him to extract ZOMG Godlike powers from Inori and other people (those powers are called voids). Each void varies accordingly to a person's personality. Upon witnessing the events that took place, the leader of the Funeral Party (Gai) invites Shu in his rebellion against GHQ, and so the story goes on. \\n\\n\r\nWell for me, the story isn't very original and fascinating, plus the school life part is extremely unneccesary because it reduces the seriousness of the anime. Anyway, there's still a lot of time for it to flourish (we're not even half-way yet), and recently it's slowly picking up its pace, I'm hoping that the plot would get a little better. \\n\\n\r\nPresentation: [7/10]\\n\\n\r\nThe art is pretty good, and the soundtrack as well, however some scenes are really odd for me. This series contains wtf beyond chuck norris moments, cheesy, and some lolwut? moments (well, I'm not going to spoil them). \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: [6/10]\\n\\n\r\nI'm going to start with Shu. He's basically a wimp, but his character slowly develops as the story progresses. I also hate the fact that he can easily\\n\r\nbe deceived, and that he turns into a badass out of the blue whenever he gropes Inori's chest (LOL)\\n\\n\r\nNext would be Inori. All I can say about her is that she is cute, and yes that's all into it. Her character is dull, lifeless, and inconsistent. \\n\\n\r\nLast, but not the least, Gai. He is your typical badass leader figure. I hate the fact that he can execute his plans flawlessly, I'm hoping that it wouldn't go like this forever (it's a bit cheesy).\\n\\n\r\nAs for the other characters, they are the usual stereotypes that you would find in many shows.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, this anime has some interesting points however it isn't really mind-blowing. Anyway, it's still quite early so who knows? It might get better\\n\r\nor worse. So for the meantime I'm going to give this a 7 for being a so-so.  \\n",

            "content": "I just had to write a review after seeing the two latest episodes! A lot of people at first were really excited about this anime because this anime has an outstanding ensemble of creators. You have the writing team behind code geass, the director of both death note and high school of the dead, and the music behind bakemonogatari, supercell. I've been with this anime since the start, and from my perspective i believe the most eloquent phrase that could be used to depict this anime, is that of a \"roller coaster ride\" (in a good way)\r\nyes this anime starts off as very similar tocode geass, in the way that the protagonist gains the \"power of the kings' from a mysterious girl. But the team behind it said they never intended for it to be another code geass. This anime soon diverges from the similarities it shares with code geass, and we see a lot of amazing plot twists and WTF moments (also in a good way). the first 6 episodes got me hooked, and albeit episodes 7 and 8 were seemingly boring and a waste, everything comes together incredibly well as evident in the CRAZY, AWESOME, MINDFUCK that is episode 9 and 10. lately the anime has been coming out of its shell and if have stuck with it, then you know what im talking about.\\n\\n\r\nI recommend this to those who love action, romance, comedy, drama, mechas, apocalyptic scenarios, rebellions, tragedy, school life, and character development. This anime has a little bit of everything, even a small amount of ecchi.\\n\\n\r\nI suggest that everyone at least goes to episode 10 before they quit on this anime if they dont like it. The writers and producers said themselves,    \\n\\n\r\n\"We're not trying to be like Geass. We didn't plan to take anything from it for this show. Actually, as for the setting, Code Geass is quite apart from, way beyond modern Japan. But for Guilty Crown, the situation is more natural. So we're not trying to do a similar plot. Of course, there are some similarities.\"\\n\\n\r\nNow on with the rest of the review and the summary.\\n\\n\r\nOn Christmas Eve, 2029, an unknown \"apocalypse\" virus appears out of nowhere in japan and creates a quagmire in the infrastructure of japan, political, social, and economic pandemonium, as well as countless deaths of the citizens of japan. This event, now referred to as the \"Lost Christmas\" incident, was able to be contained through the interference of the GHQ, an international organization.\\n\\n\r\nFast Forward 10 years, 2039,. The GHQ keeps order and stability in japan through their Martial Law. Ouma Shu the socially inept yet perspicacious 17 protagonist has a run in with fate. Through sheer chance, he meets Yuzuriha Inori (the heroine) the lead vocalist in a rising band called egoist. And of course, she turns his life inside out as she is actually a member of Funeral Parlor, a resistance groups that seeks the freedom and liberation of Japan. Through his encounter with funeral parlor and Yuzuriha Inori, he gains the \"power of kings\" in his right hand, bestowing upon him the power to reach into a person and extract a part of their soul (known as voids, and each person has a different void just like how each person is unique) and materialize it into a weapon.\\n\\n\r\nHe is now blessed with this new power thereby making him a prominent and essential member of funeral parlor. Is this power and the support of new comrades enough to help Shu change the outcome of devastating events around him? or will he break from the pressure and death of those around him? \\n\\n\r\nThe art is simply outstanding compared to other anime series. Of course thats just my opinion, just like everything else ive said so far. The music is also very unique to this anime. The action, romance, comedy, WTF, drama, and slight fanservice moments really blend in well with the anime, almost all of the time. \\n\\n\r\nthe characters are pretty good, but nothing new. \\n\r\nwe see a variety of characters here\\n\\n\r\nthere is Shu the hesitant and indecisive main character who has a lot of heart and compassion. The mysterious enigma, Yuzuriha Inori. The badass strategist and leader, Gai Tsutsugami, and many others. We see a huge amount of character development in every episode. Especially with Gai throughout the anime, and with Shu in episodes 9 and 10. I would have given it a 6 at first but lately its been getting really good so i was even considering giving it an 8, but i settled with a 7.\\n\\n\r\nI have really enjoyed this anime so far and i hope everyone gives it a chance and i hope many who disliked some aspects of it, reconsider\\n\\n",

            "content": "Let me start off by stating that Guilty Crown was not a recommendation given to me by anyone, nor was it a show that I \u201cplanned to watch eventually\u201d. Before watching this, I had never heard of GC, and the only reason I picked it up is because I came across it on some random anime generator and it seemed like a good filler show to enjoy.\r\nThat said, I was pleasantly surprised by the anime; with no external biases or influences, I was able to appreciate this anime for what it truly is : a decent anime. It had some really strong moments, and somepretty weak moments. I just happen to enjoy the stronger moments more than I hated the sub par moments.\\n\\n\r\nSTORY: 5/10\\n\\n\r\nThe overall plot was at best unpredictable and at worst disjointed. The story line, relative to other animes, is pretty complex. By complexity, I mean that there is a lot of mystery involved in the plot concerning motives, and characters; there are implied and explained back-stories, and lot of dodging questions. This is not necessarily a bad thing, but when you finally hear the explanations and you are only vaguely intrigued by it, you are left wondering... \u201cWhy the heck didn't you just reveal this in the first place?\u201d.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime would have been a lot better if they had left the story line simple and focused on the aesthetics, emotions, and actions in the show.\\n\\n\r\nThe plot wasn't too bad, overall. They were moments that left me in shock (in a good way) and these moments made the show worth watching.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nThe art style was amazing and eye catching. I was intrigued immediately by the first scene of the show, and there weren't too many times where I was enthralled by the aesthetics of their art, whether it is character design, or background. The art was really really good.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nWOW!\\n\\n\r\nIf this anime was half as a good as it's music production, then this would be one of the greatest anime ever done. \\n\\n\r\nI was considerably blown away by the background music that seemed to elevate every mediocre scene up to a good scene, and the good scenes up to a masterpiece scene. \\n\\n\r\nI don't have much words to describe how good the sound of this anime was episode by episode. Inori's singing was also always beautiful, and was probably the only good thing about that character. \\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack was so good that I sometime wondered if it wasted for such a show, and maybe could have been used for a better anime. However, that doesn't matter.\\n\\n\r\nWhat counts is that this production did really well with the sound aspect of the anime.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 3/10\\n\\n\r\nI pondered whether writing a detailed synopsis on the main characters of GC, but I've decided not to. It's not worth it. The characters are nothing unique and most of the times, they really pissed me off with their actions.\\n\\n\r\nShu Ouma has a memorable name, and maybe at some points seemed to have some potential to be a good introspective but assertive main character but most of the time, he turned out to either be recklessly stupid or a pitiful coward. Most of the time, I was left wondering what mental illness this kid seems to have. He seemed to lack the rational part of our brains, especially in the first half o the series. To his defense, however, Shu did have some redeeming moments. \\n\\n\r\nInori was just a mess of a character, extremely inconsistent, and really just used as a crazy eye candy that can sing a bit. \\n\\n\r\nOut of all characters, I really enjoyed Ayase and Hare, they at least seemed genuine and I've had nothing to say negatively about them the entire show.\\n\\n\r\nI hated Arisa, though I respected her in the beginning of the show, and I really really considered condescending this show rating just because of this bword...but I held myself back.\\n\\n\r\nThe rest of the cast, including Gai, were in my opinion, mediocre at best. Nothing to be excited about.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment : 8/10\\n\\n\r\nDue mainly to the art and music, and partly to the surprises of this show, I really enjoyed he later half of this series. I was watching this episode by episode and not really caring too much, and just going through the  motions..but there came a point where the show \"turned up' and really went on high gear. At this point, I couldn't help but look forward to the next and next episode. It really got suspenseful and entertaining and I enjoyed that moment. Not too many shows can make you wonder or be excited for the next episode, but near episode 12-14, GC was able to do that, and thats something I appreciate.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nThe art and sound really is inflating this show, it should a bit lower than seven, but it was a decent show. I would definitely watch a second time, and I plan to but it's not because this was a masterpiece or anything, but because I really enjoyed the emotions that this show try to convey.\\n\\n\r\nThere was a particular episode, which I won't spoil, where you could really feel the emotions of Shu Ouma..oh man, was it heart wrenching! and probably this was the moment, that I started not looking at this anime as a a filler, but as a stand alone anime that I should look forward to and enjoy.\\n\\n\r\nSo yeah, based on this review, there is a lot of mixed feelings here. If you improve the characters, and made the plot a bit simpler to follow then this could have been a really special show. It's really disappointing when you think of the potential.\\n\\n\r\nI would still recommend this show to anyone. It's decent anime.",

I didn't care about the plot, I thought that it was just another ripped-off series of Code Geass. and to my dismay, it was a copied version that failed majestically.\r\nI'll just get to the point, because I really forced myself to watch this series for the sake of finishing an anime.\r\nThe story is really a rip-off. They didn't even bother hiding it. The cliche tropes were all there. Incest,boy meets girl, my-life-suddenly-changed, hero, saviour, god-like etc. there were so many plot holes that that it became difficult to watch.\r\nthe characterswere just so \" meh.\"\\n\\n\r\nShu was such a bastard, bitchy, cry-baby and everything that I don't want in an MC. He's the embodiment of MCs that are full of crap. He was a character trying to be a bad-ass but failed miserably that it was excruciatingly difficult, unbearable and embarrassing to watch.\\n\\n\r\nInori...y'know the only lines that I can remember from her are \" shu \" and \"shu \" that was all. They could've just hired someone from anywhere and make that person utter \" shu \" every episode. Her character was so..wait, was she even a character to begin with? She didn't even have a personality for god's sake! She was literally a walking cardboard that just wore revealing clothes and had a tape recorder that has a record with an awesome voice glued to her mouth for the sake of advertisements and appearances. \\n\\n\r\nother characters: they were here and there. Killed off when the story needed them to be dead and revived when the story needed the crap to be alive.\\n\\n\r\ntbh, I really hate guilty crown to the extent that after I finished watching the show I have cursed so many times that I don't even know what to say.\\n\\n\r\nfor the other aspects of the show like animation, soundtracks, ops and eds, they were so beautiful that they became wasted on such a garbage crap.\\n\\n\r\nWith a superior production team, great directors, top-notched musics and art and a golden time slot, what could possibly go wrong?\\n\\n\r\nEverything went wrong and for reasons that are unknown to us.\\n\\n\r\nThe only thing that kept me going was the superb animation and the awesome opening theme \" My Dearest \" Actually, the shows so bad that this might have just been an advertisement for Supercell.\\n\\n\r\nthis show is so bad that I would rather watch Bob the Builder.\\n",

            "content": "Guilty Crown is an anime I had heard so much about and was really looking forward to finally watching. On the outside, this show looks like an action-packed thrill ride filled with stunning visuals, an amazing soundtrack, and some of the best animation I have ever seen, but the more you watch the more you realize that all of these are just covers for the shows complete lack of proper story telling. This show gets a ton of hate AND a ton of a love from a bunch of people in anime community, and hopefully my review will give you an honest opinion of theshow :).\\n\\n\r\nStory: 2 \\n\r\nThis anime has one of the worst told stories I have ever seen, and its really fucking depressing when you realize how great this show could have been if it would have been given proper attention. Basically, this show follows our main character, Shu, who has been given the power to take the \"voids\" out of people's hearts (for some reason). He later uncovers a conspiracy surrounding the Japanese government and their plans to take over Japan using the \"apocalypse virus.\" Shu ends up joining a terrorist group know as Funeral Parlor in an attempt to overthrow the Japanese government and stop their plans to use the virus to take over (I think?). The show was just incredibly confusing and 75% of the time I legit had no fucking clue what was going on. It was a gigantic mess from start to finish. They tried to cram in way too many plot elements and it just ended up making the entire thing unwatchable from a story standpoint. The ending is also extremely disappointing, and leaves the viewer with no satisfying feeling whatsoever.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 10 \\n\r\nAs much as I hated the story of this anime, and found it to be incredibly confusing, it does have some redeeming qualities. The art and animation in this show is some of the best I have seen in any anime PERIOD. The show looks drop dead gorgeous. Everything from the color palette to the crisp and fluid animation is top notch, and I would highly recommend anyone watch this show just for its artistic value alone. This was definitely the highly light of the show by far. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 9\\n\r\nThe soundtrack in this show was almost as equally fantastic as the art. Both openings are memorable and catchy as hell, and I honestly looked forward to them every single time I started a new episode. All the songs in the actual show are great as well, each doing a good job of adding to the mood of the scene they are being used in. I still find my self listening to the opening theme songs from this show from time to time because they are just that damn good. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 3\\n\r\nJust like the poorly told story, the majority of the characters in this show are just as as shit as the plot itself. Shu is your standard high school student main character. This type of main character has been done so many times at this point that I just really don't care anymore. He's your typical whiny bitch main character that is afraid of everything, goes through a metamorphosis mid way through the show, and then becomes a badass by the end of it *Yawn*. Its been done time and time again, nothing special here. Inori, who is Shu's love interest (Lol), is even more boring. Nothing special, she is simply in the show because reasons. She is really only there to be the forced love interest of Shu. Yes, she does have some back story, and yes, she serves some kind of purpose to the plot (I think), but its so poorly explained that I couldn't care less about her. The other characters aren't even worth mentioning, they are basically just cardboard cutouts. The only side character that I found somewhat interesting was the girl in the red suit that had to use the wheelchair (can't remember her name). She was actually given some decent backstory and purpose, but it sure as hell wasn't enough to save this cluster fuck of a show. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 5\\n\r\nThere were definitely parts of this show that I enjoyed, but I most certainly wouldn't watch it again. It was the definition of \"Meh\"\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 5\\n\r\nThe only reason this show gets a 5 is because the art and sound were just so outstanding. This show would have easily been a 3, but the art and sound at least make it somewhat mediocre of a show. Like I said earlier, I would recommend this anime to anyone that wants a beautiful show to watch with an amazing soundtrack and crisp animation. However, if you are looking for a show with an amazing plot and in-depth characters you are not gonna find it here.",

            "content": "It seems that guilty crown is an anime that viewers either love or hate. Personally, I loved it, and give it a 10 in my own list. However, to be fair, their are many flaws in this anime. In terms of review score, the points given should be lower.\r\nStory: 7.5\r\nI really like the premise of guilty crown. The ending is very emotional and there are several high points in the story. However, there are clearly also flaws in it. This anime took many elements from previous awesome animes like Code Geass. Some of the copied elements doesn't really fit into the story as well asit did in the original anime. For example, the King's Power that Shu possesses is pretty ridiculously absurd compared to the technology in the anime. The motives of GHQ and most of the characters in the anime are not made clear to the audience or are unreasonable. Furthermore, much of the plot development is strained. I especially dislike how Gai turned evil just to protect Mana. Still, the revelation toward the end of the anime of how Shu and his sister caused Lost Christmas is powerful. Overall, despite many flaws, guilty crown does deliver a entertaining story and coherent plot that really comes together in the end.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 10\\n\r\nWhat can I say. Even the haters of guilty crown would admit that guilty crown has amazing art. The costumes and background scenery are well designed. The mood conveyed by the animation reflects well the theme of the anime.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9\\n\r\nThe songs are also amazing. I love the introduction, the conclusion, and the intercept songs. To this day, I can still hear the lyrical line \"all the things that make me whole, I'll now give it to you. I am yours\" clearly in my head.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 7\\n\r\nThe characters in guilty crown is generally not as well done. This is especially apparent in the protagonist, Shu. At first, he appears to be a constantly depressed and cowardly boy. He is supposed to grow during the anime. However, the growth portrayed is not subtle but instantaneous. A prime example would be when Hare died, Shu suddenly becomes a lot crueler. It is funny because Hare and Shu do not even talk that much, yet the extent that Hare's death on Shu is so great. Then, somehow, Shu realize how important friends are. Overall, I still like Shu, but he is not a very consistent character. \\n\\n\r\nI think that inori is a very likable character, but her existence is pretty random. I mean, she is a popular singer and always dresses up in a flashy dress, yet she always charge in the battlefield and has off-charts power in terms of void. Her purpose in the story is revealed at the end of guilty crown and actually is a central piece of puzzle in solving the Lost Christmas virus. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9\\n\r\nWhat can I say. I just really like sci-fi/superpower anime, especially when the protagonist grows from a weak boy to a OP fighter. I actually had a blast watching this anime.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8\\n\r\nThis may seem to contrast with the score on my anime list, which is 10 (totally fan-boyism). If I look at this anime objectively though, it probably deserves a score of 8 - 8.5. Ultimately, it depends on whether a person like this genre of anime. I know this is really cliched, but if you like Code Geass, you would probably like guilty crown.",

            "content": "At this point in time as I'm writing this review, I've watched 17 out of 22 episodes of guilty crown, and to be honest, I'm not sure I'll be finishing it.\r\nI'm not one to whine about cliches or similar plot elements to other series, because there is nothing wrong with re-using what other series have already explored. My biggest gripe with this series is the execution of the project.\r\n Let me go about this review with Shu Ouma as the focus, since my interpretation of guilty crown is a show portraying the chaos in an apocalyptic world through the eyes of protagonist.\r\nAs I first started,I felt that this story had good potential to build up wonderfully. It wasn't a unique development of any sort, But the development was acceptable, and fits in to the story.\\n\\n\r\nShu Ouma's weak outlook at the start was great, although to some, it might seem like he has no character (frankly this no character business is what people seem to be calling characters that end up dragged along by circumstances, and while shu did end up being dragged around later on, his internal conflict struck with me.) \\n\\n\r\nWhat screwed Ouma over was how the plot played out. I'm not sure why, But the writers went ahead to add in many unnecessary plot twists, with the characters hopping from one boat to another, switching their allegiances all of a sudden, without any clear motivation. \\n\\n\r\nPerhaps their intent was to create more chaos and confusion, to produce the mood for the post apocalyptic setting. If they were trying to do it by removing anyone that Shu could really trust, it was poorly done and the only thing that betrayal after betrayal by everyone around will achieve is many haters on every forum. \\n\\n\r\nThe writers could probably have cut down on the complexity by reducing the number of characters, devoting screen time to a few characters, and developing them well. As it is, it seems like none of the characters know what they want, except keeping their most important people alive and close to them.\\n\\n\r\nApart from the characters, some events seemed to have been added just simply to bring Shu on an emotional journey, fighting with his fears. Take the rescue inori mini arc which concluded the first half of the series. Shu started off by moping, which was fine, Then events lead to him deciding to take action. Up till Then, it was perfectly OK. Then he met inori, and shit happened. He got dragged into another dimension, took a trip down memory lane, and... for what? The most significant development for me there was that gai died. But gai could have died outside too, and the memory lane wasn't necessary was it? But no, they had to make things more complicated, by adding some underlying plot that started 10 years ago. Completely unnecessary.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, guilty crown struck me as a pity. It had such potential to become wonderful, plenty of room for character development, plenty of times to make use of the setting, the concept of void. The script writers though need to properly iron out how they want the story to play out. Stories that mix in many elements without clear direction age bound to fail. \\n\\n",

            "content": "Well. This is my first time writing a review, and I registered to MAL especially for this anime.\r\nFor this piece of dirt that was summoned from the deepest depths of hell...\r\nLet's start, eh? We'll review the anime part by part. \r\nFirst, story. (6)\r\nAnime starts with a blast, causing unaware viewers to raise their hopes for this anime. And let's say, for a few episodes, I was one of them. \r\nStory follows a teenager named Ouma Shu, who by the way, is a wimp. But one of a kind. There is so much I want to say to him, but gonna save it for the Characterpart. If you read the summary of the anime, you can see it's a pretty generic shounen anime, that brings nothing new to the anime world and just... well. 'till the end, it won't leave the way of being generic, I'll give it that. But what is this show's point? Another Code Geass? Many have failed there, my dear friends, and don't be mistaken, Guilty Crown didn't make any groundbreakes. Actually, it failed miserably. Because there is no system. First half and the second half of the anime, completely different. In the first half, you can understand things, feelings, thoughts. But second half... I mean, wtf? This cannot be possible, since it's practically impossible to make such a mess, it leaves you with a feeling of chaos. \\n\\n\\n\r\nArt. (10)\\n\\n\r\nArt is quite wonderful. I mean, it is really wonderful. Fight scenes, backgrounds, character's bodies and faces, all in a sync, it's almost refreshing to the eyes. Nothing bad, or if there was, I didn't catch it. \\n\\n\\n\r\nSound (9) \\n\\n\r\nThis is one of my weak points. My ears are not good enough to make a decent comment like most of you, but I'll say that nothing made me uncomfortable. Background music matched with the fighting scenes, and the voice actresses of characters were chosen with great care. Nice job. \\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacter (5)\\n\\n\r\nAnd now, most awaited part of this review. Character. Let's just start by saying, \"fuck you, shu!\"\\n\r\nOuma Shu... he's definetly in the lowest tier of MC's. No one can be a bigger pussy than him. It's just not possible. Having dropped a quite a lot anime for their weak, pussy MC's, I'm going to say it took all I have to watch all the 22 episodes to write this review. I can't even begin to understand why people love this wimpy, pathetic MC's. I even punched the wall while watching the anime, 'cuz he made me mad. Character development for Shu was... well, bad. He never acted out on being a pussy, actually he made it clear that he will be a pussy 'till the day he dies, 'cuz that's just him. He actually ran off from his group which he \"willingly\" joined, well because, they needed him to act like a man. But no! God no! Oh heaven's no! Don't let Shu be a man, please god! Let him grow a vagina, and let him join Ichika's harem of wonderful mecha girls! Well, guess what you pathetic human being, if you don't want to act up, do something, or just even say something, DON'T GO TO THE PLACES WHERE YOU HAVE TO DO THOSE. Actually, if you can, please just die. But wait, there's more! When you get to the second half, he goes bad-ass, ruthless, and a piece of shit. Don't get me wrong, his bad-ass phase was even more girlier then any GF's I had, and trust me my otaku friends, I have the experience. He's just... oh my god. Why does characters like him get to be the MC, and good characters like Gai just goes unimportant? Anyway. I'm leaving him now. I'm not done swearing on that moron, but I'll be doing that verbally while writing the review.\\n\\n\r\nInoha... well, she's a bitch. Yeah. I really didn't get how she turned out to be a good character, but she was a bitch. She admitted that she was using her girliness to get Shu to join her terrorist group, (don't worry, no spoilers. She says that in the start) and then story picked up for her from there. But let me go back to Shu, how he was after Inoha said she tricked him to join the group, how a little crying bitch he is, and an episode later, voila! He goes back to be her little dog, who pets him around like the little puppy he is. I mean, you have to be somewhat angry right? When you learn that she tricked you, she gave you hope of love then ripped that dream apart... No! Of course not. Be the little pussy you are, and totally go all over her!\\n\r\nGood job Inoha, for driving that bitch around.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment/Overall (3)\\n\\n\r\nI had hopes for this anime. High hopes, I dare to say. Well, thanks to Ouma Shu, my hopes were shattered like when William Wallace found out those pussy Scot lords turned him over to the Brits. I couldn't swallow my pride as a man and as a viewer, and for every few minutes, I punched something. MC really ruined the show for me. \\n\r\nIf you like a pussy, spoiled little brats who turns into a girly bad-ass in the second half for a MC, then go for it. Art and sound is pretty good anyway, so... \\n\r\nWell good luck. Find the jewelry in this anime which I failed to find.",

            "content": "When i first watched Guilty Crown, my first thought was that it was going to be a great anime. I was expecting 50 episodes of more good music and animation. The story would get better, and the weak protagonist will grow to become a cool and likable lead. Unfortunately, it did not exactly do that.\r\nThe music and animation stayed good throughout. It made the show bearable to watch after the story kinda went down hill for me. I found myself listening to the second opening on YouTube even after the anime ended.\r\nThe character development is where it gets tricky. This is probably also where mostpeople found fault in this anime. The main character,Ouma, Shuu, starts of as like a typical shounen anime character. He seems pretty weak, but he obtains powers that allows him to help his friends. That's great and all, and we expect him to use said power to help and save people. However, as the story goes on, his personality and actions greatly change. You can't even tell if your watching the same anime anymore because he's a jerk in one episode then the Messiah in the next. It gives off an extremely unlikely and non relate able feeling to the story.\\n\\n\r\nAnother problematic character was the  main heroine, Inori. She is a very generic heroine with a  flat/ 1 dimensional personality. It can get pretty boring to listen to her go on  about Shuu, then say barely anything for the rest of the episode. Her main selling point seems to be the fan service. She a very revealing outfit, and she can sing very well. Once agan, pretty generic. Don't get me wrong though. I still found her to be a very likable character (one of my top tens actually), but i could not ignore the fact that she was poorly made in order to appear more cute and sexy for the fans.\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe story... When i first finished Guilty Crown, I really thought they should have just ended it after the first 12 episodes. I mean the last few episodes were pretty good, but the episodes from around 13-20 both depressed me and angered me. So much stuff happened at once that it was hard to take. I found myself asking again... This is Guilty Crown right? It was probably just because the way the characters acted, but the story just did not cut it for me. There was still some unanswered questions when the story was over, and i found myself wanting to see more. Since Guilty Crown only got 22 episodes, everything felt rushed. Like i said before, i thought that it would be a 50 episodes+ anime because then there could be more explanations and better character developments. Unfortunately... this did not happen. \\n\\n\r\nThe first 12 episodes felt like a nice, enjoyable, and well built anime. The next 10 episodes felt like it switched completely into a different world of hate, deception, and betrayal. A smoother transition and several other improvements could have made Guilty Crown one of those anime that people still talk about after years and years have passed since its release. It did not of course, and people quickly started to right bad reviews about it. \\n\\n\r\nDespite all that was said above, i really did enjoy Guilty Crown .It still takes you through a nice and thrilling ride,(although a bit bumpy) and it might make you shed a tear or two in the end for the characters, or the poor anime that did not quite reach its full potential.",

The only problem here is, that the main protagonist isn't fit forthe role of Lellouch and the Anime overall wasn't able to build up any relationship with the characters as a whole. \\n\\n\r\nThey should have made this a 13 EP Anime with a good Ending EP instead, then it would be worth an 8 I think. That way it's just a 5 for mediocre, with a stupid plot and uninteresting characters but at least with good visuals and audio.",

            "content": "STORY\r\nGuilty crown boasts their powerhouse production crew lead by the series' DirectorTetsuro Araki, who had directed highly popular and crtically acclaimed works such as Death Note and Black Lagoon followed by their series composers, who had joined the production crew of top-rated Code Geass. The series' interesting concept proves the prestige of its crew. Sadly, its first few episodes start many problems and plotholes. In fact, Guilty Crown's first few episodes exemplify the exact definition of cliche. But that isn't the main problem. In it's first few episodes, almost all the characters are introduced immediately, the conflicts were already present and everything else was allset but surprisingly it gave unsubstantial and disappointing episodes, which should have been the foundations of the series. The first half (Episodes 1-10) was annoyingly slow-paced. Speaking of pacing, the pace of the first half is the exact opposite of the second half. Still, it was disappointing how the depths and origins of the conflicts in the story were explained in a episode or two. It was like the production crew were in a hurry to forcefully shove information to the viewers' heads. Due to it's lack of strong foundation and with a seemingly hurried plot development, the series failed to discussed important topics about the anime and its characters. The viewers were uneccessarily left thinking and speculating about some aspects of the plot. \\n\r\nScore : 6/10\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS\\n\r\nThis aspect contributed to what I label as \"THE MAJOR FAILS IN THIS ANIME\" Well, it does not take a die-hard otaku or an anime fan to notice that the characters in this anime are unoriginal. In fact, the male lead is a rip-off from several other media, and yes not only anime. He is your typical wimpy kid who becomes god-like after a few episodes. This also goes for the other characters, also the villains are painfully stereotypical. It is annoying to see that the execution of their roles are as stereotyped and as unoriginal as the roles itself. Guilty Crown also gives a false sense of an ensemble cast (ensemble cast - all the characters in a show has equal importance and affects the story). Indeed, GC has a huge number of cast members but the other characters, although have adequate exposure in the series, lack depth; they can nearly be labeled as useless or display. It was disheartening to see that some of the characters served like fan service tools the whole run, the female characters of course. But definitely, some of the characters blended well with each other.\\n\r\nScore : 7/10\\n\\n\r\nSOUND\\n\r\nI think this saved this series from immediate demise in the anime world. (lols) But true, Supercell's OPs and EDs in this anime were top notch. The series' music featured other languages such as German. Truly, the BG music made each scene in the anime more lively and epic. The seiyuus (voice actors) in this anime were I can say a bit of newbies in the business but I can say that they did a good job. If an anime is all about music and sounds, Guilty Crown could beat the hell out of other animes. \\n\r\nScore : 9.5/10\\n\\n\r\nART & ANIMATION\\n\r\nThere is no question of Production I.G.'s prowess in terms of art and animation is this series. The animation company utilized digital animation (explosions, special effects and the like are replicated through computer, characters and scenery are drawn through a computer) well. I would commend how the colors blended all throughout the series. I think the coloring and also the drawings itself had a realistic touch. In the animation stand point, it was definitely top-notch and could compete to well known animation studios such as Kyoto Animation (Clannad) and P.A. Works (Angel Beats) Kudos to Production I.G in this aspect.\\n\r\nScore : 10/10\\n\\n\r\nENTERTAINMENT VALUE/OVERALL STANDING\\n\r\nGuilty Crown though fails in a lot of aspects especially in story/plot development still manages to entertainment and give joy to its viewers bigtime. It can't be denied that the show really executed well in the action standpoint. It is a highly competitive anime in terms of great and breathtaking scenes. Guilty Crown's scenes could truly be considered epic and could be compared to the highly popular, Full Metal Alchemist in terms of epicness. As I said earlier its catchy OST will definitely hooked you in watching this anime alongside with its great animation work. In summary, Guilty Crown is a must watch for anime fans who simply love epicness and simply wants to enjoy but if you're the type who is very critical on the different aspects of an anime, especially its story and its development, Guilty Crown is definitely not for you.\\n\r\nScore : 9/10",

            "content": "INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE\r\nOkay in my reviews i am going to tell my opinion on three things: plot, characters and overall. I may write some additional note if something was particularly good or not (like art or the characters voice).\r\nI am going to try to be impartial, even if i like the anime a lot or i dislike it like the kechtup on the pasta and put things in the right context (i can't expect a complex plot for an harem)\r\nREVIEW\r\nOk this is hard. GC really looks a cool anime and just my type. After the first episode i was screaming \"MORE! MORE!\" because i can'thelp love it. After each episode the things becomes more and more \"weird\".\\n\\n\r\nPlot - 6\\n\r\nThe plot it's somehow cool but it rely too much about characters: is this a problem? well yeah, it's the best problem, i'll tell you why later. The action scenes are really well done and the \"deep\" plot sounds interesting.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters - 4\\n\r\nWhy? All i can think right now is just ask to writers \"why?\". As i stated before this anime got a LOT of good promises: a singer and cute girl a terrorist, a boy that got problems about talking with others (or so he stated) and an amazing power: take weapon from people's souls. Mark my word: IT'S A TRAP.\\n\r\nOk listen:  a cute girl come to your home with a weird vial and after a bit the police rush in and arrest her as a terrorist, what you \"normal\" people should do? Well our protagonist blame himself for not being able to protect her so he take the vial and go to deliver it the terrorist chief, seems legit.\\n\r\n As other helpful reviews says (you should read them too) the proganist is totally too \"unstable\": he may like a thing, the moment after he dislike it, and the moment later he again like it; he has no time for a clear devolpment.\\n\r\nOther characters are ok: gai it's the best, really the \"real\" protagonist somehow while izuna got some problems like the protagonist (but she is really cute, even if her battle outfit doesn't look a battle outfit) while other secondary protagonist got everyone a well defined personality, simple but efficient.\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 5\\n\r\nAll of this is totally wrong: you can't focus a story on a character that unstable because if you start to hate him, the whole anime become hard to watch. I can't say it's THAT bad but seriosly this \"protagonist centered\" plot doesn't make me able to watch it anymore. I really loved it from the start so you should really give a try; if you manage to still watch this nonsense protagonist this show may be really a great one.\\n\\n\r\nPersonal tastes\\n\r\nI really loved shu, i like that kind of characters and he really broke my heart with this nonsense devolpment. This anime should be a lot better, i am pretty sad.\\n\r\nKeyword: Guilty Crown - The Betrayer",

            "content": "This was one of those animes that I really did hope to be good. Sadly it simply proved that you can't judge an \"anime\" by it's cover.\r\n-Story-\r\n It's mostly bs. It starts with young Ouma Shuu joining some \"terrorist\" group. Afterwards almost every episode of the first part, is made out of spectacular effects/art, explosions, betrayals aaaand a lot of crying and self-pity.\r\n The first 12-ish episodes could've been reduced to max 5 if it wasn't for all those explosions, shouting, running and crying. The first part of the story felt more like a filler than an actual part of the story. At times itdoes seem that the story advances too fast but that is only because they SKIP some parts, frankly most of the first part is made of the main character Shuu crying (I did say this before but it annoyed the shit out of me). \\n\r\n The second part starts with a more determined male character, someone that does what needs to be done for the best of the majority. While it seems that they worked just a bit more on the story part of the second half, it does have way more \"fuck logic\" moments.\\n\r\n It's just a pity that I can't spoil the ending but the last episode simply blew my mind, in a bad way. \\n\r\n While others did say this too but the story is full of cliche's, maybe they tried too hard, that's why they fucked up the story so bad. \\n\\n\r\n-Art-\\n\r\n10/10 nothing to say here (judge by it's cover, right?)\\n\\n\r\n-Sound-\\n\r\n Sound effects 10/10 but that's normal I guess...\\n\r\nThey did try a lot, nothing to say, even the main female character has an original song of her own.\\n\r\n While I really like most of supercell's / ryo's music I didn't like any of the songs in this anime, but hey maybe it's just me.\\n\r\n That makes an 8 for sounds for me in the end.\\n\\n\r\n-Characters-\\n\r\n At least we have some development on Shuu's side.\\n\r\n The problem with the characters in that most of them are simply without any personality. Seriously, it's like all of them are simple \"vessels\".\\n\r\n Shuu is an annoying piece of crap in the first part, the good part is that Shuu does develop a little bit, well at least he doesn't cry that much towards the ending.\\n\r\n Inori... she is simply nothing, I mean she is beautiful in the anime but that's kind of everything that you can say about her. For the most part all that I can remember about her, is her saying \"Shuu\" and that's it.\\n\r\n Characters 3/10\\n\\n\r\n-Enjoyment-\\n\r\n In the first part I felt many times that I should get up from my bed and skip those really annoying crying/self-pity/ full of effects but nothing else parts, but meh I'm too lazy for that so I had to watch it all. You can imagine how much I did enjoy this anime, right?\\n\r\n 3/10\\n\\n\r\n-Overall-\\n\r\n Maybe I simply expected a lot more out of this than I should have. All in all I do believe that this failed because they did try a lot. We all know that sometimes when we try too hard we simply fail.\\n\r\n Overall I gave this a 6 mostly because of the really \"wtf\" moments towards the end, otherwise it would've been a 6.5 (which means 7 to me).",

            "content": "Guilty Crown (GC) is a series that I have always thought had some real potential to be great, and I genuinely wanted to like it so much more than I did. However, the series lacks a clear focus and direction. GC is not a bad show, and is worth your time for any number of reasons, which I will explain below. That said, those people who are looking for a well written, tight, and coherent narrative that drives the viewing experience might want to look elsewhere.\r\nArt (9):\r\nOne of GC's strengths is its animation and visual style. I assume that the series was pitched around theconcept of creating a highly stylized and rich world. The action scenes are well choreographed and the level of animation is fairly consistent throughout. It is clear that a great deal of money was invested into making GC look and feel like one of the best produced shows out there, and to that end, mission accomplished. Everything looks great.\\n\\n\r\nSound (9):\\n\\n\r\nGC has great sound work to accompany the great visuals. While the effects themselves are good, the real star of the show is the soundtrack, which features some great original tracks that fit the mood of the show. I particularly enjoyed the opening track from the intro sequence of the first season. I also liked how the soundtrack was tied into the show via Inori, one of the protagonists, who is the lead singer of a pop group called Egoist. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter (6):\\n\\n\r\nThe characters of the show are difficult to peg into a numerical score because there are some inherent strengths and weaknesses in almost all of them. On the one hand, many of the supporting characters are very strong, and are consistent throughout the series. Although not every supporting character has a clear arc or any real reason for the audience to become invested in them emotionally, they often serve their purposes well within the framework of the story.\\n\\n\r\nOn the other hand, the aforementioned supporting cast is also a major pitfall of the show. Often these characters are much stronger, more relatable, and more likeable than the main characters.\\n\r\nGC's main protagonist, Shu, is a real conundrum. During the first season, Shu is a very cookie-cutter archetype. His character arc is fairly predictable, which is certainly not always a bad thing. Yet, it works against him in this case. He is particularly annoying for a large portion of the show (an argument can be made that he never stops), and there is very little incentive to be emotionally invested in him as a person, or the things he experiences throughout the course of the show. During the second season, Shu's character makes dramatic leaps in personality on an almost episode-to-episode basis that is unrealistic considering the set-up of the show and the world it creates. Again, this works to Shu's detriment, since he is supposed to be the driving force of the show, yet who he is, why he is, and how he changes never follows any sort of reasonable arc. It's hard for me to invest in a character that is so confusedly schizophrenic.\\n\\n\r\nGC is a character driven series that does not take care of its characters very well. Some of the strongest characters are the least important given context, and some of the most important feel much less substantial and underdeveloped than they should.\\n\\n\r\nStory (5):\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately, GC's narrative is the weakest and most baffling part of the series. Without divulging any real plot details, the easiest way to sum up the main problem with GC is that the story has a severe case of mistaken identities. The first season sets up its story arc in a very specific way and ends on a pseudo cliff-hanger, which is fine. However, the second season is written as a completely different show from almost the first frame. The two halves of the show could easily be watched as stand alone series, and work fine. They do not necessarily add anything to each other, and the change from the first to the second series is actually pretty jarring. Each season has a first, second, and third act, but there is no real overarching structure to the series as a whole. \\n\\n\r\nThe other main problem with GC's story is that it is pretty poorly written. Many Interesting concepts are introduced into the show and promptly left alone. These concepts and plot points then stack on top of each other to the point of general confusion. Nothing is really explained in very much detail, and there are several plot twists and developments that are introduced out of nowhere without any logical explanation or reason behind them. Granted, this problem is much more prevalent in the second season than the first. But, it does not really matter. I do not expecting to have every detail laid out and explained in detail, but GC has more than its fair share of head-scratching, \"what the hell just...\" moments.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment/Overall (6):\\n\\n\r\nDespite the significant problems I have with GC, I do not think it is a bad show, and I liked it just fine. The quality art and soundtrack are well worth giving this show a fair shake, and to be fair, I kept watching every week until the final moment. Ultimately, what holds GC back is that all of the creative effort was seemingly spent on the art and sound. The characters and storytelling - overwhelmingly the most important aspects of any television show - were confusing, slapped together, and not well constructed. I would definitely recommend this show to people who are looking for eye-catching action, stylized visuals, and a killer soundtrack. GC is a great show to watch without having to invest too much brainpower. \\n\\n\r\nHowever, as previously mentioned GC is not a show that will satisfy those who are looking for a well constructed narrative that is thought provoking and easy to become emotionally invested in.\\n\\n\r\n---\\n\r\nIf you have any questions, feedback, or just have something to say, let me know in a message or on my profile page.",

            "content": "After reading the synopsis for this anime, I was really excited. After reading that the Guilty Crown had a lot of criticism, I then became a bit hesitant to watch this series. With such a promising premise, I was surprised to see so much hate. However, I have never been someone who did not watch something because of mediocre reviews, so I went for it. Did Guilty Crown end up being a crown I wish I had never tried on, or is it my \"guilty\" pleasure. Bad puns aside, this review will dissect my feelings of this often criticized anime.\r\nStory: (5)\r\nI would give this a5.5 if I could. The story in this anime is one that I loved and did not fully understand at the same time. In short, the story consists of a somewhat weak high schooler who meets a strange girl and receives a mysterious power that lets him grow stronger. I will not give any more detail in that to keep everything spoiler free. In the first twelve episodes of the show, the plot was all over the place. The base story was set, but random deaths and plot twists were thrown in several spots that. These plot twists either did not make much sense or were way too rushed. I felt the ideas in 11 and 12 were introduced too quickly, and took away a lot of the emotional impact of the emotional events. Despite the action-filled, shaky plot-lined first half, the last ten episodes of the show improved on just about every aspect of the plot I wanted. The plot was more centralized, made a lot more sense, and it had a better mix of action and dialogue scenes. In those last ten episodes, I was thoroughly excited to see what happened next at the end of every episode. The plot still had a few shaky points, but it ended up being very fulfilling in the end. \\n\\n\r\nArt: (9)\\n\\n\r\nWow. The art in this anime is beautiful. The environments are unique, the characters' appearances are memorable, and the opening and ending credits look fantastic. The art when a void is extracted look brilliant, and the character's expressions while being extracted from looked very believable. My favorite aspect of the art style was during cutscenes with the crystal-like virus (which I will not describe any further). The crystal effects were menacing and beautiful looking at the same time, which perfectly conveyed the theme of beauty being a symbol of destruction in this anime. Overall, right at the 9.0 score level.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound: (9)\\n\\n\r\nI may just like the music in this anime than the art. That is saying something. With the power of song being a supporting theme, this anime needed a good soundtrack, which it definitely had. The vocal music was all beautifully sung every time. The instrumental music, particularly in the last few episodes, was nearly perfect in matching the mood of the situations. I loved how Inori sang a lot of the songs rather than just being in the background. It was a touch to make the soundtrack more human-like. As with the rest of the soundtrack first opening is now one of my favorite opening tracks of all time. I liked the second one too, just not as well. Additionally, the voice acting was very good. I thought every voice matched up with the emotions of the respective characters very well. I would give this category a 9.5 if I could.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: (6)\\n\\n\r\nThe characters in this anime were a bright spot and a letdown at the same time. The characters who were developed the most were all very likable, or at least memorable. As far as fairly weak main, male protagonist, I liked Shu Ouma a lot. He was a lot less whiny than a lot of other characters in other animes from his archetypes. Interestingly enough, I thought the female characters in this anime were a lot more likable and developed. Hare, Ayase, and Inori all were very cute and likable. Even though I do not think Tsugumi received enough character development, she was also very likable and cute. On the negative side of of the score, I think that the villains were highly disappointing. Each of them were intimidating, but none of them had very clear motivations for their actions. Along with that, I thought that there were too many of them. I thought Daryl could have been an interesting character, for example, but he was not shown in enough dialogue scenes to merit this. Similarly, I thought there were too many characters on the heroes side too. Souta was the only one who I thought received enough depth, besides the ones I have already mentioned. I think if the writers would have worked more character development into the first 12 episodes, this problem would not be as big. The only times I ever felt emotion for a character was in the back half of the series, which should not have been that way.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: (8)\\n\\n\r\nEven through the dizzy plot line of the first half of the show, I enjoyed the anime as pure entertainment a lot. Even when character and plot development were lacking or sloppy, the action kept me highly entertained. The humor was overall very funny, the action was fast and exciting, and the dialogue was solid. When I watched this show, this is exactly what I planned on wanting: entertainment. This show was fun to watch, and with a little patience pays off for an ending that did not disappoint me. The only hindrance to this fun is the confusing and murky plot line of the first half. It was a little frustrating at times.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: (7)\\n\\n\r\nGuilty Crown is not a perfect anime by any means, but I definitely enjoyed it. I think you all should give it a try too. If you like high-octane action, quirky characters, fantastic art and sound, a little fan service, and debating connections between religion and science, this anime will be enjoyable to you. So, the story is not Shakespearean and the character development is lacking, it does not ruin the show. I think this show is almost criminally over-criticized. It is still a hell of a lot of fun. All in all, this is a crown that you should not have to feel guilty to try on.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "VERY MILD SPOILER WARNING\r\nAt the very start of watching Guilty Crown, one thing was going through my mind.. And that was \"I'd much rather be watching Code Geass\". I had this anime dropped for several months due to the fact that I couldn't bring myself to watch it, I liked nothing about it. I later picked it back up to clean out my dropped list and I am somewhat glad that I did because the show certainly gets better after episode 14 or so.\r\nStory - 4/10\r\nThe story was pretty standard and I didn't get engaged at all by it, the first half of the serieswas so boring that as mentioned before I dropped the show. The second half of the series turns up the pace and actually becomes watchable. One thing the story does well is making you hate characters, which is why it's satisfying to see them die.\\n\\n\r\nArt - 8/10\\n\r\nArt doesn't make an anime good, but it's always nice to look at and Guilty Crown does a great job setting atmosphere, with an ensemble of well drawn characters with unique designs (for the most part)\\n\\n\r\nSound - 8/10\\n\r\nAgain like with the art, the soundtrack actually does a good job of presenting an atmosphere especially during battle scenes, nothing to write home about though.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters - 3/10\\n\r\nThis... This is where the show became unwatchable, the worst part of this show was the bland characters, the unnecessary attitudes of some characters, the pure unlikeable heroes, the only good characters in this show were side characters. A lot of the drama of this show stems from poorly written characters being needlessly dramatic. \\n\r\nInori is the poster girl of this show and you're MEANT to like her, but I was not given any reason to like her other than the fact she is well drawn, but that doesn't cut it for me, she had nothing going on for her except her voice acting.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 3/10\\n\r\nIf not for the heel turn in episode 15 or 16, I would've given this a 1/10\\n\\n\\n\r\nFirst half of the series: 2/10\\n\r\nSecond half of the series: 8/10\\n\r\nOverall I would give it a 5/10\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Guilty Crown is a great anime that does a poor job informing its audience.\r\n*REWRITTEN REVIEW*\r\nWithin broader anime culture it's usually pretty cut-and-dried what shows are the standouts and which are the stinkers. Though there are always exceptions, any given show is pretty quickly labeled worth your time or a waste of it by general consensus. However in recent years we've seen a rising trend of shows that are much more polarizing in their nature--not universally accepted as good or bad, but most frequently panned by the vocal half (minority or majority is hard to say) while the often-drowned-out, supportive half scratches their heads and wonderswhat the naysayers don't get about the show they enjoy so much. I would say Guilty Crown is one of these shows, but in actuality the situation is a bit more unique than that. In the wake of its more popular contemporaries and the shadow of Code Geass (an anime from a few years earlier that featured similar themes), Guilty Crown is all but forgotten. And that is a real shame, because beneath an ineffective flow of key plot information lies a diamond in the rough that deserves far more affection than it receives.\\n\\n\r\nArt & Sound: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nFirst off, Guilty Crown looks and sounds amazing, as even the staunchest of critics will usually admit. Indeed, this may be the primary attraction for the show--while the story is good, as we'll get to in a minute, it is the vivid imagery and rousing soundtrack that truly sell it as something more than average. For every memorable scenario, there is a locale and audio track that are twice as memorable. The show's vision of near-future Japan is a simply delightful mix of realism and science fiction, crafting an atmosphere that is both unique and appropriately familiar. Characters were designed by Japanese artist 'Redjuice', bringing a stylistic flair that is rare even among anime, a genre of entertainment well-known for its style. Hiroyuki Sawano also shows up to grace Guilty Crown with one of his greatest soundtracks ever--if not the very best--accompanied by popular J-pop band Supercell and a new spinoff act of the group, Egoist (named after a fictional band within Guilty Crown). From every angle, Guilty Crown represents a sort of dream team of artistry, and it shows in every second of audio and animation.\\n\\n\r\nAs a side note, it's worth mentioning that Guilty Crown received an English dub following its original Japanese release, and not only are the English voices bearable, but in some cases they seem to represent their characters better than the originals. Dub fans rejoice, but it's hard to go wrong either way.\\n\\n\r\nStory & Character: 8.5/10\\n\\n\r\nOn a single watch through the season it would be very easy to deduct a few marks on Guilty Crown's story and characters and call it a day, but this would be a disservice to both the show and its viewers. The simple fact of the matter is, it's practically impossible to pick up on every nuance of Guilty Crown's intricate and ridiculously complicated plot without prior knowledge of the story. When approached with an open mind it's still plenty enjoyable the first time around, but you will probably be left with more than a few unanswered questions, both large and small. The answers are out there, and most of them are even present in the anime alone, not to venture into the tie-in visual novel prequel and spinoff light novel. The problem here is how the anime prioritizes saving up big reveal moments over making sense. The first eight episodes--easily the highlight of the show--are fairly straightforward and may almost come off as entirely too simplistic, not preparing viewers for the depth that will suddenly come upon them out of nowhere starting thereafter and continuing until the show takes an awkward twist for a few episodes before finally coming back around to the same refreshing caliber it began with. If that sounds like a bit of a rollercoaster, that's because it is, and as such embracing the ride will be a bit of a struggle for some people. This challenge is made all the more difficult by seemingly unpredictable characters that not everyone will identify with. Most prominent personalities in the show are modeled after classic introverts, and just like in the real world, those who think along different patterns may find themselves frustrated, failing to grasp the inner conflicts Guilty Crown's author attempted to depict in the story's characters. The rest of the characters are mostly based on staple personalities of other dispositions, but despite the lack of originality all but a few are fun and interesting and manage to avoid falling flat.\\n\\n\r\nSo where does the 8.5 come out of all this? Easy: multiple viewings. Despite the poor job Guilty Crown does at informing its audience of the world it portrays, it's not for a lack of information or even for conflicting information. While certain story elements do need to be taken and simply accepted at face value, this is far more often the exception than the rule, and they are there for pure spectacle and enjoyment value. When things get serious there is actually a pretty terrific urban fantasy/sci-fi/dystopian narrative going on. Put differently, Guilty Crown's primary story flaws are not in content, but presentation. The story is there and it is a unique, fantastical experience made the more interesting by a believably realistic backdrop, but you will probably have to dig a little to find it. The kicker: it's worth digging for. Chances are you won't see Guilty Crown as it was meant to be seen until the second or third time through, and while it's a shame it takes so long to get there, there's certainly plenty to keep the experience enjoyable in the meantime. Guilty Crown aims to be many things, and in general it succeeds at them. Highschool? Check. Mechas? Check. Mysterious, intentionally mind-blowing super powers? Check. Quiet, cute, and deadly love interest? Double check. Ordinary guy thrust into extraordinary circumstances? Check. Amnesia? Check. Super virus dystopia? Check. Secret rebel organization versus evil government? Check. Guilty Crown manages to tie it all together in a pretty satisfying way, so in theory there should be something here for everyone. The question is simply whether Guilty Crown's mix of everything will resonate with you or not. As far as quality itself goes, Guilty Crown easily stands on at least an equal plane to the likes of more popular shows such as Sword Art Online or Attack on Titan. It just doesn't explain itself quite as plainly.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nGuilty Crown is a stylish and atmospheric take on many different, familiar anime themes all rolled into one. Though not without its missteps, the broader narrative operates on fascinating and engaging concepts that are simply buried beneath a layer of poor information delivery. Though a bit of criticism is due for this one central flaw, it does not ruin the experience of the anime as a whole. Early on each episode is a delightful showcase of imagination, and while the transition to the deeper plot is jarring for first-time viewers the show doesn't fail to come back around well before the season's end, and definitely offers something to repeat customers during the same time frame. Guilty Crown is an anime best approached with an open mind and a love of great art. The story may take a disproportionate amount of time to get a grasp on but it is a story well capable of getting yourself wrapped up in should you take the time to do so. Meanwhile the fantastic character and location designs and the memorable, deeply moving soundtrack will carry you along from beginning to end. Guilty Crown is not the sort of show that will resonate with everyone, but those that 'get it' will really, really get it.",

More so, both the anime are the work of the same writer. So it really is fair to call this anime a CG Spin-Off.\r\nStory: 6/10 (Since it's almost the same story as CG)\r\nThe Story revolves around a guy given mysterious superpowers by a girl (Wow this is so unheard of). The power\u2019s name is \u201cThe Power of the Kings\u201d (CG much?). He joins a terrorist group and uses thesepowers to try to save Japan, from being controlled by a foreign organisation. (Again, totally not similar to CG). I would like to end this here since I feel like exposing more of the story would be too \u201cspoil-ey\u201d.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 7/10\\n\r\nI loved the art in this anime, especially the vivid use of blue. It\u2019s very eye-catching and one of my favorite colors.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8/10\\n\r\nThe music in this anime is very catchy. The centre of it, of course, is Inori\u2019s voice actor.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 4/10\\n\r\nI would have given 8/10 for character if MC wasn\u2019t such a whiny kid.\\n\r\nAgain, most of the characters are very very similar to CG characters. Like, I couldn\u2019t believe that they would even recycle personalities. Especially some of the scenes.\\n\\n\r\n*****Spoiler*****\\n\r\n- Both the anime involve MC\u2019s being anti-hero at some point.\\n\r\n- And at one point when the MC\u2019s are in big despair, they try to take advantage of the girl who has a crush on them.\\n\r\n*****Spoiler End*****\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 7/10\\n\r\nOverall 6/10\\n\r\nAll and All, I enjoyed this show a lot. Even though it was a Spin-Off, it was fun recalling CG which I happened to have watched about a year ago (10/10).\\n\r\nFor CG fans who have watched CG a long time ago, I would suggest this series as it would be a good way to refresh CG memories.\\n\\n\r\nThank You for reading.\\n\r\nBye.",

            "content": "First off I would like to mention, I have watched the entire series and have come back to finish and give a complete review of Guilty Crown. Although this Anime series has many faults, I wouldn't say that it's complete garbage like so many people are making it out to be. I actually found Guilty Crown to be a beautiful piece of work despite it's faults. \u2665\r\nStory :: The plot of Guilty Crown is a weaker element of the series. In the beginning it starts of strong, but the further it goes the more it lingers and becomes hazy. However, I did really love thestory, I think the issue comes with how it's presented and exicuted. A lot of details are left out and never explained all that well leaving many plot wholes and inconsistencies.  I wish that Guilty Crown went more in depth in the story so we could get a better understanding. Many viewers will point out similarities with other series. Guilty Crown contains many cliche and inspirations from other series. But to be honest, this never bothered me much. Although I did notice similar ideas, I found more differences. Overall I enjoyed the story, but I think it could of used many improvements! It was pretty good, but not great.  I give plot a score of 6 {Fair} \\n\\n\r\nArt :: This a very strong point in the series. The animation and artwork is stunning! I could tell that the creators put a lot of thought into character designs and overall artwork. The animation is smooth and the color is vivid, giving it great detail. The battle scenes ate done beautifully and the quality never strays. I love the art style! Probably one the best animation I've seen in Anime. (: For Art, I give Guilty Crown a score of 8 {Very Good} \\n\\n\r\nSound :: The music and sound is another strong point along with the animation. The songs from the opening & ending themes warmed my heart. The lyrics are beautiful & the music is captivating. Inori's songs give Guilty Crown a nice touch. The background music is also nice. Many fit nicely and create the mood. Overall, Guilty Crown has a great soundtrack! I give it a score of 9 {Great!} \\n\\n\r\nCharacters :: Although the series presents many interesting characters with a variety of personalities, this is were things get sloppy. I felt that the characters never fully developed throughout the series. There are some moments of change, but it becomes inconsistent. I felt like I couldn't fully feel or connect with many of the characters, not to say that I felt nothing. Something about Inori's unconditional love for Shu, Shu being able to see Inori as true person instead of just an empty shell, and Gai's weaknesses under his facade & strong desire to be with Mana. It moved me and touched my heart. Guilty Crown shows glimpses of  the deep desires and depth within the characters, which gives off an interesting vibe & energy. I found the connection between the main characters to spark my imagination. Many will say that they have no true meaningful connection, but I feel that they do, even when it's not expressed through words. Although I liked many of the characters, the development needed some work. A few characters where rememberable, while others are easily forgotten.  I give characters a score of 6 {Fair} \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment :: All in All, I really enjoyed this Anime! I found it captivating and a nice series overall. However, it did suffer from minor cliche elements,  plot holes, inconsiticies, and lack of total character development. But that doesn't automatically make me hate it. I found beauty in the story & characters despite there faults, nothings perfect! It gave me inspiration and sparked my imagination. I give Guilty Crown a rating of 8 {Very Good} \\n\\n\r\nMy overall score for the series is a 7 {Good} \\n\\n\r\n\u2665 Emily \\n\\n",

            "content": "I've gotten back to watching anime for quite a while, so I do have a firmer grip on what's good and what's bad in my mind.\r\nStory: 4\r\nThe story starts out pretty nicely. The visual effects and the music together are indeed great, but it started out a bit slow. I didn't have any gripes about that at all. I think it was up until episode 11/12 that everything went smoothly. Everything was pretty calm: the school life, Shu and Inori, the fighting.It wasn't anything tragic, except maybe the fact that Gai dies. The 2nd cour (for those of you who don't know what a couris, it's typically 11-13 episodes that air over 2-3 months) however, was where things started to trouble me. \\n\\n\r\nThe second cour is very, very different from the first one. You have people dying and losing powers. The hierarchy created at the school along with Shu's complete change in personality-- just set a new atmosphere. It took a more serious hold. Shu is heartbroken by Inori being taken. He uses his admirer's/lover's feelings as a replacement for Inori -- that is -- until she dies saving him. I thought of this part of the 2nd core was OK. It wasn't really much of anything compared to the first cour. \\n\r\n     Now, when Shu and the others start fighting back is where the fun actually starts to begin. The infiltration was pretty good. Shu loses his Power of Kings, but regains it eventually, thus making episode 19 the epitome of awesomeness in the 2nd cour. \\n\r\n     The ending. To be frank, they should have ended it with Inori living, or Inori AND Shu dying. There's an interpretation saying that Inori is still with Shu through the fact that he took in her heart (the guilty crown). However, the ending did not cut it for me. The single, biggest fault for fairly to good anime, is the ending for me. If it's entertaining but doesn't end with at least a bang, then it just really turns me off. GC pretty much set itself up with that ending in that they pretty much had almost everything nailed. This is why I gave the story a 3. GC set itself up.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9-10\\n\r\nIt's great. I'd expect no less from Production i.G.\\n\\n\r\nSound:10\\n\r\nFor jpop, this anime nailed it. Supercell is pretty good. OP1 My Dearest sung by Koeda and OP2 The Everlasting Guilty Crown sung by Chelly (under the name Egoist) are both good. ED Kokuhaku was also up there.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:3\\n\r\nThe characters were very flimsy. Shu was pretty much pathetic until the end. He shined 19 onwards, until the end. Inori did not develop much, but was used as a love interest. She was one of the more solid characters. Gai was extremely easy to change. He died believing for one thing, but when he came back, he came back completely different. Daryl was OK, but the end just forgot him.\\n\r\nDarth. Darth just came out of nowhere. I mean nowhere. There's not much background on him at all. He was pretty much there for most of the story. He pretty much kidnapped Inori and fought Shu.  Other than that, he wasn't big. Not really a needed protagonist (he was really a meh character), there could have been another way to plot the series with better antagonists.\\n\r\nAs for Shu's brophilic sister, she was -- not to be redundant or anything -- OK. She played her part for the 2-3 episodes where she even did anything. The psychopath antagonist is starting to become more and more recurring.  \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 5\\n\r\nThe high school hierarchy, Souta (Inori's lover boy), some characters, and the ending lit my fuse. The other things I enjoyed, but these stood out too much.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 4\\n\r\nIt was decent. The visuals and sound made up A LOT for the faults. In terms of story, Full Metal Alchemist: Brotherhood and Clannad After could have blown this away. The characters could have used some improvements and been more solid.\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Overall guilty crown was a mixture of good and bad. The animation and sound were of great quality. Even the plot was excellent. BUT....the plot being excellent and actually following through with the plot to an entire storyline is two different things. I mean, the post apocolyptic japan, the void, the resistance, they were all interesting....felt A LOT like if they ripped it off from CODE GEASS (the BESTEST SHOW EVER). However, the story fell apart for the following reasons:\r\n1. Characters: the main character was pathetic. Given the first 8 episodes would of been okay, but eventually you would expect to see some growth. Therewas, but it was CONFLICTING, even when the main character became a tyrant, he was still pathetic, always looking for appraisal, always forgetting who he is, in other words, he lacked individuality. The other characters were not that better. To not spoil the story I will say, many of them did things for stupid reasons. Again on the main character, he should have truely taken a leadership position, yet he failed at that. There were many instances of people switching sides, which made the cast seem unstable. \\n\r\n2. The story was explained, but hard to follow. Many things were explained very breifly and even now at best they are still murky. Like: when did Mana change? What was Gui true motives? What was Da'at about? How was all this started? WHile these questions were answered, they were answered EXTREMELY breifly without much detail, thus blurring the chronological order of the show. Had they spent more time explaining these details in an extra 4 episodes I beleive the story would have truely been better.\\n\r\n3. As mentioned, many of the characters motivation for what they did were weak, unsolidified and unjustified. BUT, what really brought this show down was the ending. Without giving any spoilers; the ending was just plain wrong. There were 3 other endings that could and should have occured; that would have made more sense and would have been justifiable to the suffering of some of the characters. Yet, they chose a \"happy ending\" that sucked, was completely out of place, and really wasn't all that happy. Even the \"BOND OF FRIENDSHIP\" between everyone was weak. They all had soo much drama amongst themselves, yet they acted as if they were the world to each other in the end, like how the mugiwara (one piece) crew act; or how suzaku an lelouch(CG); tiger and bunny( tiger and bunny) acted...whcih in those shows those bonds actually existed from simple coincedences to history to friendships. This had too weak of bonds. There were some bonds that were justifiable like Hare and Shuu, or even Shuu and Gui (which in a sence got messed up), even Shuu and Sugar (can't remember his name); however the other relationships were just weak.",

            "content": "Ok, so you know how when you're writing a review the rating 10 says \"masterpiece?\" Well, yes Guilty Crown quite perfectly, simply put, a masterpiece. This is probably one of the best animes I've seen recently----well, actually probably ever. Yes, many people have complained that it is too similar to Code Geass. I can't say that I've finished that anime, but just from the very first episode, I can say: yes, there are a lot of general similarities, but not enough to say plagiarism. And besides, it really wouldn't be since both stories come from the same creator. But, on the standpoint of just drawingme in from the first episode, GC accomplished this almost effortlessly. \\n\\n\r\nSTORY 10/10\\n\\n\r\nPerfection. Wonderful. LOVED IT. Very well-thought out, kept me on the edge of my seat, fluid guiding throughout. The main plot was very unique with the idea of voids, the virus, etc. I'll admit I was a little confused in the first couple of episodes like, \"why do they have purple crystals on their face because they're inflected? why isn't it a rash or whatever? why is Shu so messed up? What's with Inori's robotic-like personality?\" But I found that all of my questions were gradually answered as the anime went on. There were so many plot twists that had me like, \"Oh...oh..OH MY GOODNESS.\" GC's creator=genius. \\n\\n\r\nLoads of action with a pinch of romance, and large general theme of friendship, courage, etc. Pretty much hit all of the clich\u00e9s. But the way that these themes were expressed was unique, and I feel slightly more realistic then portrayed by other animes. It wasn't always sunshines and rainbows. Many of these relationships came from loss and bonding, etc. \\n\\n\r\nI was NEVER bored in this anime. I wish there could be a season 2, but after the ending, I don't think it'll happen. All knots were tied neatly, and although the ending made me a little sad, it was beautiful. (Yes, I'll admit it, I cried a little)\\n\\n\r\nART/SOUND 10/10\\n\\n\r\nThere's no denying it. If an anime's appearance and soundtrack have me cringing, I probably won't watch it. NOT the case here. From the first second of this anime, you're immediately drawn in by it's beautiful, I mean BEAUTIFUL art and music. Inori's songs are absolutely perfection and get the right emotions across every single time. I think had it not been for her singing at the end, I probably wouldn't have cried. The emotion is SO compelling. The art is VERY comfortable to look at. I loved each character's outward appearance. They were very easy to distinguish by all the subtle details put into the designs, and just wonderful. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter 9/10\\n\\n\r\nThis is the only category that does not receive a perfect score from me. Don't get me wrong, I loved how each character had their own separate personalities, back stories, etc. I just wish that GC had more episodes to completely display their potential growth. The creators did a great job with the 22 they had, but I just wished there had been a little more development, especially from one of the mains, Inori. Yes, I get that she wasn't fully able to develop due to her character makeup, but I wished that her relationship with Shu was more convincing. It felt a little rushed. Other than that, I don't have any particular complaints regarding characters.\\n\\n\r\n I would like to give a shout out to Hare and Gai's  characters. They were probably my favorites in this anime, mostly because they stood out the most. Hare was one of those characters that was easily distinguishable with her undying friendship, selflessness, and sacrifice. Gai was overall badass. There's no mistaking it. From his first introduction right off the bad he is beating people up effortlessly and I'll admit it: he looks hot while doing so. And somehow he pulled off the long hair and still looked amazing. The main, Shu, was great as well. I applaud the creators for not sugarcoating things like loss in him. I like how you could easily tell how death greatly impacted his character and personality. \\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT 10/10\\n\\n\r\nPsh. I've already said this multiple times. Freaking LOVED IT. Would watch it again. Where's the like button???\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL 10/10\\n\\n\r\nGuilty Crown is going to remain one of my favorites for a while. \\n",

            "content": "Very short review: This is, of over 200 Anime, the only one I've ever set as \"dropped\". The Anime in and of itself is great. Every episode, however... Is poisoned by the Main Character's (MC) personality. I loath and detest the over use of the cowardly and naive traits. I pushed through 10 episodes, but could bear it no longer. \r\nI enjoy watching a character start off as week minded and cowardly, but then later become stronger and fierce! In 10 episodes, the MC seems to be going backwards... Starting off cowardly and dumb, and getting more scared and less intelligent. \r\nGravely unfortunate, as theentire Anime aside from him was beautiful and unique. I hate that I can't bring myself to finish it. It makes me nauseous watching the MC scream and sprint away from everything letting people die, because he's scared to let someone die? Fuqoutahere!",

            "content": "Well this is my first review so it may be a bit rough around the edges, but nonetheless I hope you enjoy it.\r\nGuilty Crown (GC) is easily one of the worst anime's I have ever had the displeasure of watching.\r\nWhen a close friend of mine recommended that I watch this abortion of creativity I was intrigued by its somewhat interesting premise to say the least. However, by the time I finished watching the second episode I decided to drop it rather than endure another 20 episodes of unoriginality, a mess of cliches and a severe lack of any redeeming qualities.\r\nStory: 2/10\r\nSynopsis: Japan, 2039. Ten yearsafter the outbreak of the \"Apocalypse Virus,\" an event solemnly regarded as \"Lost Christmas,\" the once proud nation has fallen under the rule of the GHQ, an independent military force dedicated to restoring order. Funeral Parlor, a guerilla group led by the infamous Gai Tsutsugami, act as freedom fighters, offering the only resistance to GHQ's cruel despotism.\\n\\n\r\nI can't say too much about this criteria as I have not subjected myself to the other 20 episodes of torture in GC however I can say that while the plot may sound somewhat interesting in the synopsis it is anything but interesting (mainly unoriginal). However, I can safely say (from what I have seen) that GC's story is one massive cliche made up of smaller cliches. It's astounding how many  cliches are used in just the first 2 episodes.\\n\\n\r\nOverall the story is uninteresting, easy to predict and just...boring.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nThe animation in GC is one of its only redeeming features. It is fluid and well done. Sadly, when it comes to action sequences it is a big let down preferring to bore its audience with cliche anime moves/attacks which lack any sort of impact rather than entertaining its audience with interesting and unique moves/attacks and visuals.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 6/10\\n\\n\r\nWhile I'll admit that some of the songs in this anime are actually pretty good (e.g the first OP) it still isn't enough to redeem this anime from being complete and utter shit.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 1/10\\n\\n\r\nWhat characters? You could replace some of the characters (namely Inori) with ROCKS and they would give better performances. Any \"characters\" with a \"personality\" end up being just archetypes. The one character that pissed me off the most was probably the mc. not only is he a whiny bitch that is too weak to do anything I am also lead to believe that he is too brain dead to think rationally. When a random girl who he finds in some warehouse he hangs out in tries to kill him and is captured by fully armed and trained soldiers what does he do? Cry and bitch about how he could and should of helped her of course!\\n\\n\r\nSidenote: Also is it just me or is everyone against the mc? It seriously seems that everyone the mc meets hates him in some way even when they have never met (maybe because he's such a pussy).\\n\\n\r\nAnd don't get me started on Inori, never in my life have I ever seen a character who can be outperformed by a potted plant. I have seen ROBOTS with more soul and character than Inori could ever hope to show or have. If anything she acts more like a glorified sex toy rather than a human capable of emotion or thought, saying stuff like \"Use me\" to a person she has only just met a couple hours ago in a very provocative manner rather than \"Do it\" or even just a gesture like a nod or...I don't know just SOMETHING that can't be percieved as sexual.\\n\\n\r\nI could go on and on about the \"characters\" in this anime but for the sake of this review I will now move onto my overall rating.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 3/10\\n\\n\r\nIn a way Guilty Crown reminds me in many ways of the new Star Wars Battlefront game (except worse). It looks and sounds fantastic but lacks any shred of soul, creativity and originality. To put it short a generic and poorly written mess.",

But i personally like the bittersweet ending where Shu lost both his sight and Inori at the end, because Inori sacrifice herself to help Shu.\r\nWhy i say a lot of people hate this anime ? Maybe because of the endingof this anime. Shu lost his sight, the anime didn't mention the cause of this. I think it's because Shu's void absorb all traits including souta's cancer, and he lost his sight in the progress.\\n\r\nOverall, the story is 6/10 for me.\\n\\n\r\nArt, as expcted from production I.G\\n\r\nThe art is fluid, character design is cool, each one of their void is amazingly well made. But sometimes the battle feel a bit awkward, but overall the art is pretty good, 8/10 for me.\\n\\n\r\nSound, i don't particularly dislike the sound, but i don't really like it too.\\n\r\nThe OST is nice, but nothing spectacular. 6/10 for me.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter development is pretty bland, the balance between number of the cast in this anime and the screen time that were given to them is not really enough. 5/10 for me.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment, 9/10\\n\r\nEven this anime is imperfect, i did enjoy watching this anime. i watch guilty crown 2 years ago, but i rewatch it to write this review. as i said before, i personally like the ending. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, if i sum up all the score and divide it with 5, 6.8/10\\n\r\nBut i round it to 7.\\n\r\nThis is an enjoyable anime (for me), but you guys who read this may find this anime good too. \\n",

It was just bearable to watch and with everyone calling it a \"Fan Service\" to what was \"suppose\" to be original.\r\nWhen someone posted that the whole first season was a troll to the anime industry, it hit me and that was entirely true. They actually are making fun of the cliche things that is happening over and over in the anime industry. Think of season one as a semi-filler or a warm-up to the realserious business.\\n\\n\r\nNow, all you need to do is watch the [ Guilty Crown Kiseki : Re-assortment ] and skip season 1, hence why it's called \"Re-assortment\"; they are re-assorting the real story, think of it as the true introduction to the series and season 2 is the real outline of Guilty Crown ( I hope ) and show it's true originality that we've been starving for.\\n\\n\r\nAlso, I know some of you hate the main character and gets annoying sometimes. Don't jump to the conclusion of him being a sob until you watch episode 12; then you'll understand why he is the way he is.\\n\\n\r\nI won't review anything else but the story, since we all know how good everything else besides the troll in the story in season 1.",

            "content": "*Will TRY to keep it spoiler free(thou I wont be able to describe myself fully that way) and short(not)*\r\nName: Guilty Crown\r\nSeason: 1\r\nEpisodes: 22\r\n*Opinions from others matter alot when it comes to your thinking. If someone praises a show and you felt it wasn't that good then you are left disappointed while if someone tell you to not watch a show, a high chance you wont start it or be in doubts but if you end up liking that show, thats a real good feeling tbh. When it comes to Guilty Crown, I was disappointed because of 2 friends. *\r\nPLOT:\r\nSet in Tokyo in the year 2039,a decade has passed since a mysterious outbreak known as the \"Apocalypse Virus\" killed thousands of people and brought Japan to its knees - a disaster that is called \"Lost Christmas\". Since that time Japan has lost its independence, and has become a martial state governed by an international organisation known as GHQ. Ouma Shu, an awkward young man who is a fan of the pop-group Egoist, whose lead singer just happens to be pure waifu-material girl with pink hair, Inori Yuzuriha.\\n\r\nInori Yuzuriha, a key member of Funeral Parlor(a terrorist organization), runs into the weak and unsociable Shuu Ouma during a crucial operation, which results in him obtaining the \"Power of Kings\"\u2014an ability which allows the wielder to draw out the manifestations of an individual's personality, or \"voids.\" Now an unwilling participant in the struggle against GHQ, Shuu must learn to control his newfound power if he is to help take back Japan once and for all.\\n\\n\r\nSTORY:\\n\r\nFor me, the story could've been better. It wasn't bad but it was not that good either. \\n\r\nA normal high schooler got superpowers after he met a beautiful girl and has to save the world even though he doesn't want to be a part of it. Thats pretty much it for the first half of the show and the first half was actually the good part of the story. After a certain incident, our protagonist got serious because the writer had to do it for \"Character Development\" and for the story to move forward(the term for this is Dues Ex Machina writing) and then started the 2nd half of the show. For the uninformed, Deus Ex Machina writing is defined as:\\n\\n\r\n\"an unexpected power or event saving a seemingly hopeless situation, especially as a contrived plot device in a play or novel\"\\n\\n\r\nImo, the story went downhill in the 2nd half. The hype moments were real, the action happened, alot of questions were answered(not all) but still it wasn't enough. \\n\r\nTalking about the romance, I think it was written by someone who has yet to discover how people fall in love because this show literally has the worst romantic feelings between characters. And ehm*Incest*ehm.\\n\r\nThe ending was bad aswell. There were alot of death flags raised but none of them actually happened. Maybe the reason for me to think this way was that 2 friends of mine told me it has a sad ending and I ended up expecting alot from the show and it didn't deliver even half of it. \\n\r\nI did enjoy the story itself as it was something different - haven't watched code geass or I might be complaining even more - and interesting but it could've been much better if it wasn't rushed or alot of questions weren't left unanswered. \\n\r\nCant explain more or else I might end up spoiling alot.\\n\\n\r\nANIMATION/ART STYLE:\\n\r\nThe first best part of the show was indeed its animation and arstyle. The fight scenes were amazing and everything from the start to the end was done PERFECTLY. That's what you would expect from Production I.G. Its one of those shows that has an amazing arstyle but bad characters.  \\n\\n\r\nMUSIC:\\n\r\nThe second and the last BEST thing about this show. I rarely listen to the openings and endings of a show but this show made me listen to them. Both the ops and eds were amazing. The BGM(background music) was good aswell. Inori's singing was one of the main reasons why I watched this show till the end.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS:\\n\r\nThe characters of this show were kind of the worst characters ever. There was only one character who actually stood out for me and that was Ayase(a supporting character) and she was the best girl of the show. *FIGHT ME* Anyways,\\n\r\n\u00a4 Ouma Shuu: The main protagonist and one of the worst characters that I have ever seen who just runs away for half the show and suddenly gets serious and destroys everything and then saves the world anyways. \\n\r\n\u00a4 Yuzuriha Inori: The main female character of the show who is cute and speaks in low tune (because Kayano Ai\u2764(her voice actress- another character which she voiced would be Persia from Boarding school Juliet and Mashiro from Pet girl of Sakurasou)), basically a top-tier waifu material. The only problem I had with her was her romantic feelings towards Shuu which came outta nowhere and we never even understood why. I could complain about her personality of a cardboard aswell but that has an explanation in the show itself. \\n\r\n\u00a4 Tsutsugami Gai: Another main character of the show who went 0-100 real quick due to his love being revived? In short alot of things went unanswered and the plot holes were real.\\n\\n\\n\r\nPersonal Enjoyment:\\n\r\nJudging by the amount of complains in the review, you might be thinking that I hate this show to death but to be very honest, I have no idea. This show was good? This show was awful?. It was something in between, even though I did enjoyed it. Its pretty confusing. An interesting plot but with poor writing and characters and alot of plot holes. The only thing which actually saved this show was it's animation and music which actually made the show enjoyable for me.\\n\\n\r\nScore:\\n\r\nStory: 6/10\\n\r\nCharacters: 5/10 Apart from Ayase(the best girl of the show)\\n\r\nMusic: 9.5/10\\n\r\nAnimation/ArtStyle: 9/10\\n\r\nOVERALL SCORE: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nI wont recommend this show to you, if you want some fantastic writing and badass characters and character development. But if you dont mind that at all then you will end up enjoying this show. Thats pretty much it. \\n\\n",

Sure, the sound and art are great, but its dragged down by its egotistical storyline and poorly-explained characters. I get what the studio was trying to do with the story, I think. And I understand the kind of characters they were trying to convey, but Shu ended up as an easily-manipulated ass and Inori, to me at least, was nothing more than a pretty idiot. The action scenes were terribly initiated. The story was everywhere. The characters were trying to do too much as was the genre. Guilty Crown'sbest feature was probably its randomly placed Supercell songs.\\n\r\nThere were too many characters, the story tried to be too many things, and the genre was all over the place. \\n\r\nBut if you still want to watch it even after reading all this, then at least take my advice into consideration: Pay attention, write down all the characters names (trust me, the minor beginning characters will come back), don't trust anything Gai or Yahiro says, and lastly, don't watch the last episode.\\n\r\nSayonara,\\n\r\nLeahReca",

            "content": "If I were to summarize my feelings on the entire show of Guilty Crown in a single word, that word would most certainly be 'Dammit'. Guilty Crown begins with the potential to be a fantastic anime, armed with crisp graphics, beautiful music and pulse pounding action, as well as a pretty good story. However, the moment a certain someone made a surprise reappearance, I nearly threw my PS3 (I watched it on Hulu) across the room in rage. \r\nThe point of that first paragraph is to say that Guilty Crown could have been great...if it stopped halfway through. Now, onto the actual review!\r\nThe story ofGuilty Crown is not anything extremely groundbreaking. The main man, Shu Ouma, awakens the power of the King and is able to pull out the manifestation of people's hearts, known as Voids. He must learn how to use this power as he fights with heroine Inori Yuzuriha and charismatic leader Gai Tsusugami to beat back government oppression. However, in terms of story, there are two 'arcs' to speak of. \\n\\n\r\nThe first one, which takes up about the first twelve episodes, is a wild ride of emotions, firefights and sheer, for lack of a better word, epicness. You will not be able to put this anime down. The plot of this one doesn't pick your brain, but you can still love the action and the character interactions. The opening scenes and the ending episodes are especially impactful, with Inori's songs not only playing a significant role to the story, but tugging my heartstrings as well. Overall, if it stopped here, it would have been one of the best anime of all time, without a doubt. \\n\\n\r\nSadly, there was a second arc. In this one, the damaged main cast pick up the pieces of the first arc and work to survive the following chaos. What makes this arc much weaker is that the somewhat grounded plot begins to float away into space. Some characters make unexpected returns in the worse of ways, and the background lore adds a level of complexity that only muddles the experience. This arc brings up nice concepts, but it implodes into itself leaving an ugly stain.\\n\r\nSTORY: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nThe art/animation of the series is among the best in the industry, with explosions, SEs, character/mech designs and environments looking fantastic and fresh, with a futuristic vibe different than other interpretations, yet just realistic enough. No qualms on this front.\\n\r\nART: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nThe songs are the strongest part of the series. The openings are magnificent, the endings (the first one at least) are beautiful as well and the in-anime soundtrack is good enough to warrant an import from Japan. Egoist will always be in my heart! The voice acting is good as well, but it's overshadowed by the score.\\n\r\nSOUND: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nAs far as characters go, the character's are solid as a whole in the first arc, but fall apart during the second. Shu is a bit of a Shinji Ikari-copy at first but he eventually grows a personality before becoming a dictator with the fate of his allies on his shoulders. Inori goes from silent girl to supportive sidekick of Shu. Gai is a charismatic man who captures the interest of the viewer and is one of the carrying forces of the show, but even he is not immune to the curse of the second arc.\\n\\n\r\nThe supporting characters as a whole are not very memorable with the exception of Hare, one of Shu's female classmates. She looks at Shu as a love interest and even though she is overshadowed by Inori, she is much more likable. Furthermore, she is one of, if not the only, characters whose quality actually INCREASES during the second arc. \\n\r\nCHARACTERS: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nI loved the first part of the series. I didn't get all of what was going on, but it was a great ride. It's \"ending\" led itself to a sequel (aka the second arc) but could have actually stopped right there and landed with at least a 8.5. However, the second arc took all the good things of the first arc and threw it in the mud. The actual ending to the series left much to be desired and I didn't like how some characters made some unwelcome returns and intelligence-insulting entrances. This, in turn, ruined the whole series.\\n\r\nENJOYMENT: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall, this is a series that could have been a King among anime if it only stopped half-way. It's characters were decent and the story, while getting a bit convoluted, was a nice tale. However, the second arc rips apart that goodness at the seems. Luckily the art and sound were great and set the bar high for other anime. \\n\r\nThe final grade for this series a 7/10.",

            "content": "Ohhh Guilty Crown, you started off strong but then ended off weak...really weak. I must say when i started this show, I was excited after the first episode, Animation was amazing, Soundtrack was top-notch, story was a little scratchy but i thought they could clear it up in the later episodes. Turns out, they didn't. So without further ado, lets begin my review\r\nSTORY --> 7\r\nHonestly, I was interested in the story at first. But the reason I gave it a 7 is because of the WAY Guilty Crown told the story. I genuinely liked the concept of voids, and how everyone has a different voiddepending on the person's personality, and also how voids lead to drastic character changes. As mentioned before, they didn't tell the story well and it felt plain compared to how complicated and interesting it could have been. .The pacing wasn't very good and they left many questions unanswered. You will just end up getting frustrated the more you watch it since there is still so much you don't know and don't understand. It isn't one of those stories where it lets the viewers decide, it IS a concrete story but they told it horribly. If they had put more effort in the story and hadn't rushed it, it would've made this anime from fair to amazing. .Overall story was interesting, storytelling was horrible.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER --> 5 \\n\r\nSome characters in this particular show were actually interesting, like Inori and Gai, but the main protagonist was boring and typical. The character development in the show, was at some points good, but at most points it was boring. The Character start to become interesting halfway through the series, but rather than that, it was the same dull characters. Gai and Inori were probably the only interesting characters, since they had unique personalities and also how they change throughout the course of the show. Shu was an alright character, what I liked was how the show actually made you hate the protagonist at some points of the show, which i found new and interesting. I feel that the character's could have been made much better and developed better. \\n\\n\r\nArt/Animation --> 9 \\n\r\nI gave art and animation 9, because it was actually amazing. The art was top-notch and the animation was smooth and not choppy. It made the fighting scenes that much more better and makes the enjoyment that much higher. I was surprised by how unique and amazing the art for this show looked. \\n\\n\r\nOverall I would recommend this show to anyone who just wants a time waster or a show which is great for the eyes. If you enjoy good battle scenes, then this show will satisfy. Don't expect much from the story though. I would still recommend this show to anyones since it is sort of interesting at some points\\n\\n\r\nEnjoy.. :D",

The sound is also really great, a nice fit to the strong visuals.\r\nStory wise, the plot isn't reinventing the genre but it is still great.  A virus that brought war, an evil organization ruling the country and a rebel group fighting them. \r\nIf anything I would say the that story was brought so they could push the visual and sound to anotherlevel. It will have been hard it it had been a slice of life or a drama. a futuristic world with action was a good choice. If anything this was created to be animated in the first place. the plot seems to go slowly but this is contributing to the smoothness of the anime which make me like to follow it.\\n\\n\r\nThe character can be basic but the little cliche they could bring are not exaggerated and are enjoyable and I don't get tired of them. They don't go focusing on the less interesting supporting characters so it helps a lot in that way.\\n\\n\r\nA lot of anime has released this falls and Guilty Crown is one of the 3 that really hooked me up. Other being Ben-to and Boku wa tomadachi ga sukunai. \\n\\n\r\nThis anime deserve a fair judgment and I don't think that the majority of the people are giving it the chance it deserves.",

            "content": "Guilty Crown is a series that had great promise from the getgo. Excellent artwork, a great director (Araki Tesurou - Deathnote, Highschool of the Dead), and an interesting and deep story.\r\nThe plot is about a resistance group fighting to protect Japan from UN interference after a strange alien disease devastates the nation.\r\nAn interesting plot, but at times it feels the plot is rushed and others like it is taking it's time. \r\nThe characters are a mixed bag and their inconsistency detracts from the story. Several of the secondary characters are great and could have used some more elaboration on their backgrounds. The main characters wereerratic and seemed to jump to bizarre conclusions without enough explanation. The Protagonist Ouma Shu was terrible. He starts off as your typical shy student without any confidence, but every time he take a step forward in development, he takes 5 back. How many times can a character chose the singe worst choice available to them before you start to root for the bad guys? Inori was drawn well, but was not really interesting at all. Meanwhile you have Ayase Shinomiya, whom while handicapped, is strong willed, interesting, loyal, tries her hardest and makes you want to root for her. The characteristics you wish would develop in Shu.\\n\\n\r\nI think the biggest problem with this anime was that it is only 22 episodes. An additional 2-4 episodes, which would have made it a normal 2 season length, would have gone a long way to filling in the holes and flushing out the characters and giving some redeeming qualities to Shu.\\n\\n\r\nSo after what started to be a promising anime, it ended up being rather irritating at points. If you are bored, feel free to watch it, otherwise, you aren't missing anything.",

            "content": "So this would probably be my first serious review about an anime.\r\nIf u have already read the first sentence then please continue reading, since this review is mostly about both the positive and negative parts of Guilty Crown and how people react to the series. I came up with my own ranking system to rank a series of how the series is developed and how I enjoy it (note: I won't use the Part 1: Rate the Anime Category much). I call this system the \"SPAMCALL\". So anyways I'll start.\r\nS-tory (7/10)\r\nI believe the story is really interesting, since the stuff about it is quite revealing(in the first part). Having stories like friends and betrayal are my kind of stuff, and I can say the same for some people. And likable areas for the story is parts where badass characters gets to pawn the assholes and stuff. Putting robot fights like ones in Gundam makes the story interesting since the series is about the future.\\n\\n\r\nP-acing (5/10)\\n\r\nThe pacing is quite bad for a good anime company. Since its an original story I feel like the series is being rushed and slowed in some episodes to make up for it (though it didn't work). That is one of the reasons people just simply dropped the GC. Battles were quite short. There is at least one or two death of a major character in every episode (villain or hero, either), though some of their deaths were just pointless, its like they just simply killed the character early since they didn't know what to do with the guy on the future eps. Even Though I said all of this, I still enjoyed the short battles. During the first two episode I gave the series a 9/10 but because of pacing it dropped pretty much. They poorly executed the series.\\n\\n\r\nA-nimation (9/10)\\n\r\nLooks really good, though not that perfect. Some people might be able to see the seemingly whitish or lightish stuff on every episode.\\n\\n\r\nM-usic/Voicing (10/10)\\n\r\nAll of the songs, whether it'd be OP, ED or In songs they are all awesome. Though for me the best is \"Everlasting Guilty Crown\" by EGOIST. Major characters has good voicing but extras were not, though that does not lessen my score for Music and Voicing\\n\\n\r\nC-haracter/Setting (7/10)\\n\r\nFor me, villains were more likable than the protagonist, facts that people don't like Gai and Shu (I also hate them) makes the villains stand out more sometimes. But I think Production I.G tried their best to make the protagonists stand out (even though it didn't work). Ouma Shu is an very unlikable but as u get to watch him and see closely, you will be able to reflect on a normal person, first of all, people sometimes does not want to use their power because u are afraid of hurting others, but that does not mean you will never use it, Shu is like this. Another case is that if your close friend dies, would you get angry? Of course, he/she is a close friend, Shu then became mad and beat the crap of the machines easily, with a pissed off face (people dislikes this) and used the Void ranking system. His attitude changed (this is normal for us people) and when time comes he shows a bossy attitude and at the same time a kind behavior, that just proves that some part of him is trying to fight out for saving himself from gloominess and sin. And when he learned about his capabilities, he started to help everyone and able to love someone (at first it was just crush). So with all of this info, Shu is probably has the most \"realistic attitude\" in the whole series (but I still hate him). The setting is good, the future and stuff with war and almost destroyed setting.\\n\\n\r\nALL- in all\\n\r\nI give the series a 7/10 (originally it is 6.6/10 but I rounded it off) The series a big mess but quite better than your average anime. Fanboys might give Guilty Crown a 10/10. But I guess that is understandable. \\n\\n\r\nOther comments\\n\r\nWell here is an advise from me, if u are a new fan of anime, and are looking for Fall 2011 Anime, do not start with this series, start with more enjoyable anime like F/Z, HxH 2011, Chihayafuru, Persona 4 and others. But if u have already started watching Guilty Crown, I also advise u people to not drop the series, you could just put characters like Ouma Shu and Gai Tsutsugami in your most hatest anime character list but don't drop the series. Know why?\\n\r\nWell doesn't really matter, I would just like thank people who read this review, I tell u Guilty Crown is an average anime, not really bad and not really good, but u will enjoy and hate many parts of it!",

            "content": "After watching the entire series in 1 night and giving myself a short amount of time to cool-off instead of writing this with the thought of it being the best/worst thing I have ever watched flowing through-out my mind.. I have taken it upon myself to attempt at writing a review for this series. :]\r\nKeep in mind this will contain *LITTLE TO NO SPOILERS* so if you haven't watched the series yet (Which is my targeted audience) then have no fear! anyway, here we go.\r\nInitially I was weary of beginning this series, in-fact I had put it off for so long I ended up watchinga total of 15 separate series before finally coming back and deciding to give it a go. My argument for this was that \"It seemed to much like all the other series out there... a modern day feel but with futuristic looking powers and loli girls\" But it wasn't until watching the first few episodes that I had realised I was wrong, definitely wrong. The series gives a vibrant and refreshing kick, It had been a long while since I had seen an MC being shy and having social issues. I quickly grew to liking Shu Ouma considering he is some-what like myself *shelters himself from reality* & thus I had become intrigued to see what type of person he would become.\\n\\n\r\nStory: \\n\r\nThe Storyline for Guilty Crown was very unique in my opinion, It was a very interesting take on the entire operation for obtaining their hidden weapons & clearly a lot of thought was put into the effects of doing so. With that being said I was also like to address the originality of it all, the entire plot was unlike anything I have seen before. I will admit at some points I was getting small reminders of a series known as Absolute duo, but the sense rapidly morphed into its own original point & led back to its own path.\\n\r\nOver-all I rate the Story 8/10. It was such an entertaining experience, the only reason it's not higher is because of that gut-kick for an ending TT~TT\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nThe art was absolutely outstanding! Everything was so smooth-paced and yet at the same time so exquisite, giving a sensation of high definition euphoria. The lighting was very well placed, everything seemed to be correctly lit at the right time giving a more realistic and intense feel to the scene. I would also like to note how well done the explosions and magical scenes are, they were a lot clearer and accurate compared to some of the other types of anime out there and over-all gave off a better experience.\\n\r\nOver-all I rate the art-style of the series a 9/10. :)\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nWhilst writing the initial starting point for this review I had to contain my excitement for issuing this subject, considering it was the topic that stood out most of all to me. Firstly, the soundtrack: The soundtrack for Guilty Crown was unbelievably incredible! Every time a new soundtrack would be laid out I was instantly hooked on listening to it. It gave such a more intense and unique feel to the series and really merged it into being quite the masterpiece! Secondly, the cast for voice actors: Everything was perfect with the selection of voice actors, from the MC's voice right down to the little cries and sighs from characters you'll see once and then forget about.\\n\r\nTheir voices really fit the type of display their character shows, for instance the character\"Gai\" has such a bad-ass personality along with his voice.\\n\r\nOver-all I rate the sound a 10/10, It was such an amazing experience and refreshing compared to all the soundtracks you'll hear elsewhere.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nThe character development is also another severe topic I was scratching to get at. I love how well it all played out, from the nicest of people becoming heartless monsters due to tragic experiences to the most heartless characters sacrificing their own rules and logic to make others happy, they have really portrayed an interesting group of characters. Each and every one of them has an intense background story, causing them to grow into more of a likeable character, and they all play their given role spectacularly!\\n\r\nOver-all I rate the characters 7/10, Initially I had intended for a higher rating, but I tried not to forget the flaws and down sides to them all, such as some of the most prideful women using themselves for prostitution in order to obtain something as simple as information.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: \\n\r\nI said it before and I'll say it again, I was definitely wrong with my first opinion on this anime. Of course it wasn't very professional of me to judge the over-all result from a few brief summaries and statements, but I have come to forgive myself because I ended up giving it a shot and was definitely pleased. Each episode left me dying for more and trying to self-plot the upcoming events in shear desperation to find answers on what was to come, however the events that transpired around halfway through the series really started affecting me. from then on I was on alert for trouble and sadness and began to miss the more cheerful times, however they had brought it all back together towards the end of the series.\\n\r\nOver-all I rate the Enjoyment a 9/10.\\n\\n\r\nOver-all:\\n\r\nIn conclusion to everything I have stated in this review, my Over-all score is 9/10. This series is an absolute masterpiece and deserves no less of a title, I'd like to personally thank all those who have recommended it to me for it was an experience I will never forget.\\n\\n\r\nThis is only my second review that I have ever written so don't be to harsh on how I did c: Thank you for reading and taking time out of your day to hear my opinion!",

            "content": "There are 2 sides to every story, The emotional side and the cognitive side. What I mean by this is what the story makes you feel and what is actually happening in a story. As far as Guilty Crown is concerned, it has been one of the most successful animes to make me \"feel\" something but it has been very lacking in telling a good and unique story. As many of the other reviewers have noticed already, this anime is full of cliches and to be blunt, nothing much in the anime comes as a surprise other than the ending or more like, the reasonwhy things turned out the way they are. \\n\\n\r\nPlot:\\n\r\nThe plot value of the anime I have decided to devide into 2 parts, one part for feeling and one part for story. \\n\\n\r\nFeeling: 30/30\\n\r\nAs you watch Guilty Crown, every episode and every arc(?) will make you feel something. There isn't very many moment when you dont feel something and when you don't something big is going to happen and your gonna feel something big soon. all the way starting from the first episode to the last episode, anxious, despair, indecisive, frustration, love, hate, agony, jealousy. All sorts of feelings that you will experience. Even though we all know how its going to turn out, we cant help but feel the that way. Even if your a dense person and you don't feel much this anime will still make you feel something and even though more often than not, those feelings that you feel are quite negative and I can say that this feeling is probably why some people hate this anime so much but to be able to make people feel strong emotions with only a screen and some speakers (or head phones) is truly a difficult task.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 18/30\\n\r\nThere were some moments that you get surprised by what happened but the majority of the show feels very predictable and if you are not surprised at the turn of events at all. If you look at the show from a top down perspective and see what happens from start to finish and think about it, the plot actually doesn't feel too bad it was predictable at a bit too many times but you are just rewarded too often for guessing what's gonna happen next. But the major events, those were well thought out and how those shape the over all shape of the story. I believe that if the minor small details are to be overlooked, the overall plot alone deserves 18/30\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 18/20\\n\r\nFor the first major half(?) of the anime the characters dont exactly develop at all. instead the idea of the first half is to get you to know the character and then the development all happens in the second half. I personally think that this approach is very effective because the aim is to show you at the end how far each characters has grown since the start of the show because you are introduced to alot of \"static\" characters in the start and these characters dont change much at all so when they do change, you can feel it and not only that, it makes the changes they undertake that much noticeable and dramatic. However I believe that this ties in very strongly with the feeling section of the plot because this is one of the ways Guilty Crown makes you feel something. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 10/10\\n\r\nI normally dont look at artwork in animes too much but man the artwork is beautiful. As unpractical as some of the designs were (common who'd go into battle looking like a red flag), but they looked gorgeous. The fights were also very pretty to look at. It is however at too many times filled with too much fan service. Not only that, its very direct in delivering it to your face. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 10/10\\n\r\nThis is probably a bit of my bias as I am a Supercell fan. Cant say much here but I loved the both the intro songs and both the ending songs and many of the insert songs that the anime's got. \\n\\n\r\ntotal:\\n\r\n30\\n\r\n15\\n\r\n17\\n\r\n10\\n\r\n10\\n\r\n---\\n\r\n86 out of 100 (round up to 9/10)\\n\\n\r\nOver all: 86/100\\n\r\nOver all Guilty Crown is a very feeling centered anime with a bit much excessive use of fan services and the over use of cliches. If you strip the plot down to its bare bones then it actually doesn't feel too bad. Overall, it was really enjoyable to watch. \\n\\n\r\nYou should definately watch this if: \\n\r\nA) if you want to feel something \\n\r\nB) if you want some fan services\\n\r\nC) wants something pretty to look at\\n\r\nD) all or some of the the above",

Like, seriously. Some more subtle similarities: There's a crippled kallen, a swig out of bakuretsu tenshi's cyber-loli after a few years, and then a bad play on renton/euruka/holland A La eureka seven with shinji as renton, lacusclyneXreiayanami's odd fusion as eureka, and gai as holland.\r\nThe whole thing reeks of WTF storyline,but the rest of the series could (dear god please) turn out better.

            "content": "Wouldn't be awesome and fun to watch a 10 year old kid deflecting nukes after nukes with his supreme powers that is meant to blow his hometown into smithereens? I guess it is indeed fun for those who want to watch an action-packed anime. But what if the cause of this said event was never explained? What exactly happened to Guilty Crown was exactly like that.\r\nThings happened without any warning and explanation. \r\nThe story is about Shu who has an ability to draw out Voids (a person's heart that materialized) from any person. A Void could be a sword, a kettle, a bandage, or whateverthat best represents the person's heart. While the logic of this phenomenon can be left without any explanation, the one thing that bothered me is that when Shu draws out a Void, he is able to obtain flashy movement skills. He began to learn how to jump high, run at incredible speed etc. How exactly these things happened when he just equipped himself with a Void was not explained, or if it was explained, the explanation was lame and had no impact to the viewers to be considered as an \"explanation\" at all.\\n\\n\r\nA lot of events and key points have not been explained especially near the end of the end series. Things just happened for no reason. Who in the world anyway wants to watch an action story filled with randomness? If this is a comedy show, maybe I'll let this pass, but it is not. The plot was very vague, it picked its paced half-through, and then it went down to the core of the earth near the end. It was a directionless plot. \\n\\n\r\nLeaving the \"no-reason\" flaw, I will commend Guilty Crown for having a lovely soundtrack and beautiful animation. The placement of each soundtrack was alright; it brings out the mood that needs to be brought out from the viewers. The OP and ED was also awesome. I rarely watch the OP and ED every episode but this series made me break my rules. The animation as I said earlier is beautiful. It becomes flashy when it needs to be. It presents the battle as very intense one. Despite the pointlessness of some events, the battles always puts me on the edge of my seat because of the well done animation.\\n\\n\r\nFor the characters, some of them are absolutely annoying. May that be a good point or a bad point for the series varies.\\n\\n\r\nOf course, being annoyed for the characters that brings illogical philosophy and that tries to destroy the human race is worthy of our emotion. There were also events that will make you frustrated because of those character's action towards the protagonist. I think these are good points. On the other hand, having a clich\u00e9d whinny protagonist is just... annoying.. (oh boy, how many times did I say that word). Some characters are ripped-off and many of them are \"empty\". Dwelling into this more deep will just be pointless. I guess any reader of this review will get what I mean.\\n\\n\r\nTo end my first review (or rant) here on MAL, I can say that Guilty Crown is a very fun series indeed. It has flashy battles, great soundtracks, awesome powers and a somehow great voice acting. Though this may be the case, it failed as a story.\\n",

But Guilty Crown, oh wow, i didnt think that i would encounter an anime that will be able to grab me with the first 30 seconds of the anime.\r\nI am both saddened, and happy at the outcome of this. Happy because i have found an anime that is looking more like its going to be added to my list of all timefavorites, saddened because the anime is still ongoing. I only start watching anime when the series is over, i really do hate waiting week after week for the next episode. But when i was just reviewing the animes that just came out and i was downloading, i never thought that watching the first minute of this anime would end me finishing the entire epsode.\\n\\n\r\nFor the basic review, i have only watch the first episode and i had given this anime a 10 across the board. Of course this will change as the anime progresses. I really hope that what i saw in the first episode continues on the succeeding episodes.\\n\\n\r\nI had described this anime as Epic, primarily because it is. From what i can tell its your basic story plot, great crisis, and a boy coming to age to save or help out. But what makes this First episode Epic, is undoubtedly the music. ITs the first 4 min of this anime and the last 4 that are the biggest scenes in this episode. The rest is there to continue the story, and introduction of characters, backgrounds to the story ect. But the music is the biggest draw to this, especially the last 2 min of the episode.\\n\\n\r\nIf i would compare it, it is like watching the cut scenes of any final fantasy game for the first time. Extravagant scenes, or touching scenes that has the greatest accompaniment of music. If you didnt like this one, well all i can say is were really not compatible with out likes in anime, so why are you reading this?... lol",

            "content": "A great deal has happened between the beginning of the series and the end so I though it be best to rewrite this review from the very beginning. \r\nGuilty Crown is centered around a boy who discovers he has an untapped ability in his right arm, after meeting a mysterious girl. This happens during a time when Japan has been infected with a deadly virus and had requested the help of the United Nations. The plot moves quickly and has many twists and turns, as well as some cliches. \r\nIn terms of technicality, the Art, Composition, Animation, and Sound design are superb (in my ownopinion). Character design was rather unique and above par in many instances and the interactions between them did have some dynamic moments. Composition (editing and cinematography), was as well occasionally unique and well done and kept me interested in the show (all perversions aside). Good use of effects and decent 3D work on the machines in the show added an extra touch to the show. This is, however, typical for such a studio like Production IG. This leads into Animation, work on the animation itself was well done. The show had a good balance of smooth animation and from what I remember, not too many jumpy scenes. Sound was also superb, music was outstanding and well composed (both themes and original soundtrack). So in terms of technical specifications, this show is of the charts for me.\\n\\n\r\n The story, however, did not hold out as well. The first 3-5 episodes were among the best in drawing the audience in. The story was dynamic, fast paced and covered ground fast and in a dynamic manner. However, as the the series progressed, the show slowed and became rather cliche-ic. Plot-holes were bountiful and irrationality soiled the great technical work. The show picked backed up its original pace as it reached the end but then the end itself was rather rushed. The premise of the show was good, and the writers, I believe really had the potential to make something great out of this show. Alas, the story would most closely be this shows Achilles Heel and to any perceptive anime watcher out there who enjoys a good story, this is not the one. \\n\\n\r\nGuilty Crown, however, still is good entertainment. The story, although not the most original and most enthralling, is still decent and is good middle of the road entertainment. The plot could use tweaks but still has the ability to stand on its own two feet. So if you are interested in watching an action-packed, mildly mentally-inticing anime, this may be for you. It's good entertainment. I enjoyed it. Maybe you would too.",

It may not be the BEST anime out there, however in my opinion the story is very well done. There were many questions left unanswered, however it captured me straight away.\r\n~STORY~  9\r\nMany people has commented the story was pretty bad but I didn't see how bad itwas. It may have been similar to other plots however it really was an eyeopener for me. So Guilty Crown is about a high school boy named Ouma Shu whom obtains an ability called \"The Power of the Kigs\" that enables him to draw \"Voids\" or weapons representing the person from other people. Because of this he is thrown into a fight between the quasi government organization GHQ and the group Funeral Parlor whom is trying the restore Japan's independence. Shu then encounters a wounded girl names Yuzuhira Inori who is a singer of the popular group Egoist. He later finds out she is involved with the terrorist group Funeral Parlor.During the story, Shu's memories start coming back and is revealed of the horrific memories of his past. That is basically the back story, I can't reveal many things due to spoilers however unexpected stuff pops up!!!!\\n\\n\r\n~ART~ 10\\n\r\nThe art... it was beautiful, it was just absolutely beautiful. Especially when they were drawing the night times, it was wonderful. The animation was also very fluid and flowy. And of course the characters were drawn wonderfully as well!! \\n\\n\r\n~SOUND~ 10\\n\r\nThe sound was amazing, and its quite amazing how Egoist is made into a 'band' as well. Egoist is the Japanese pop music duo consisting of songwriter Ryo of Supercell and the vocalist Chelly. Supercell is one of my faves but the music was fitting and really deep!\\n\\n\r\n~CHARACTERS~ 9\\n\r\nTo be honest my favourite character is Inori however Hare really captured me although she wasn't int he show for long... Shu, Inori, Gai, they all seem like a typical oh highschool boy with a girl and the 'bad guy', however the change they each go through is really really important. Shu goes from a person who tends to avoid others to a brighter and more loving character, to be honest a bit like Inaho from Aldnoah Zero! He changes in personality multiple times during the show for example when Hare died he became cruel and forgot about kindness and when he lost his arm he becomes very protective.  His love for Inori is very deep as well. Shu really has been through alot..(if you have watched it you will understand). \\n\r\nInori is very quiet but you can see she definitely feels something for Shu due to her determination of helping him although it might have been just orders first. She is shown to be emotionless, able to kill enemies without hesitation etc. however she is very sweet to her friends. Finding out she is a ------ (watch the show!!) really shocked her and it was hard for her to understand if she was real or not. However because of her feelings for Shu I guess that kept her going and she's always there for him. She's extremely loyal and helps him through emotional troubles and is willing to sacrifice herself just to see him happy. Really Shu showed her the beauty of the world even through the sad times. \\n\\n\r\n~ENJOYMENT~ 10\\n\r\nDo I even need to tell you my rating? OFC A 10. I absolutely just loved it. Again it has flaws like all other animes and its not one of the best but it really tugs on your heartstrings and feel for the characters.\\n\\n\\n\r\n\"I\u2019m fine with being a monster. I\u2019m fine with having fake emotions. But I\u2019ll protect Shu. Because I am me! Even if I\u2019m just a fake\u2026 To me, I\u2019m the only\u2026 real one!\" - Inori\\n\r\nOVERALL\\n\r\nIts just great. Might not be the best storyline and characters but definitely worth watching!\\n\\n\r\nThanks ~",

Overall, this anime is worth the watch. My previous review was messed up, so I made a new 1. This is not a perfect review, but please bear with it.\r\n-Why is Guilty Crown worth the watch-\r\n1. Main character's ability cannot be found in other animes.(None that I know of)\r\n2. After extracting tools of either friends or enemies. Tools display a variety of uses. None are repeated.\r\n3. The art of the anime is nicely done. (IMO, haters can GTFO)\r\n-Why Guilty Crowna waste of your time-\\n\r\n1. Main character resembles Sawada Tsunayoshi, always dilly dallying about doing this and that because he is a coward. Quite a waste of time. Nevertheless, they get the job done.\\n\r\n2. Storyline of main character getting involved with a group of rebellions, an exact copy of Code Geass. Lelouch meets C.C. and receives his power. In Guilty Crown, Shu meets Inori, afterwards, Inori uses the void on Shu, giving him the \"King's Ability\"\\n\r\n3. Similar to point 2, GHQ resembles Britania, both holds greater power than the group of rebellions. (Some of you might think this point is invalid cause the opposition should be stronger, if not the rebellious group would win immediately)\\n\\n\r\nThanks for reading, I wasted a few mins of your life.",

            "content": "When I watched the first episode of Guilty Crown I had high expectations for this show. I, like many others, was amazed at the first episode. The fluidity of the animation and the clear, beautiful artwork was very appealing. I am in fact a fan of this show, I do not hate it. However, I am very disappointed with the way it turned out.\r\nStory - The story is terrible. That's my point, short and simple. Although the animation and artwork was topnotch, the writers really screwed the pooch here. The story was all over the place, in short it was very disorganized. I had hopefor this show at first. The first four episodes were explosive. They were beautiful, had great animation scenes, introduced a few new characters, and set a foundation for what the story could have been. I expected something amazing, but then everything started fading away. I felt as if I had been backhanded by the writers. What was waiting for me instead, was much worse than I could have imagined. There were far too many plot-holes in Guilty Crown, more than you would see in the average anime. Not to mention the pacing was horrible. One important thing to mention is that Guilty Crown uses countless Deus Ex Machinae in its story to advance the already crumbling plot. Far too many details in the story were left unexplained such as the Da'ath organization. The one thing that could have changed my views on this show was whether the ending was good or not. Sadly, it wasn't. In fact, it was the worst ending I have ever seen in my life. You may ask me why I care so much about the ending. Well, I am easily satisfied. Just have a good storyline and an acceptable ending that matches said storyline and I will be happy. Guilty Crown accomplished none of the two. 3/10\\n\\n\r\nArt - The art was simply breathtaking. The clear backgrounds and special effects were the few things that enticed me to finish this series. The colors in the environment would clearly match the scenes nearly EVERY time. Character designs were also exceptional. In my opinion, Guilty Crown had the best art compared to other anime series released in it's timespan. 10/10\\n\\n\r\nSound - The music in Guilty Crown was outstanding. The voice acting was great. The opening and ending themes were memorable. The music is also something I regret about watching Guilty Crown. The music was so beautiful that it still haunts me ever since I finished the last episode. I also loved the way the writers managed to place Inori's songs in the plot. That is probably the only thing the writers did that appealed to me. However, it is still unclear why they would actually make Inori's music a part of the story. What really won me over was the background music. Whenever something happened, I always looked forward to the music that would accompany the scene. 10/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacters - The characters were mediocre at best. I hated Shu for most of the show. Inori may have been the more memorable character of the series, but she was nothing more than an emotionless, doll-like character who contributed nothing to the story. She also had no    back story, like the majority of the characters in Guilty Crown. My reasons for hating Shu was that he was a complete coward until late in the series. He had to have a character die in order to basically \"man\" up. I have seen the same trick done in so many different shows. It's not that it's bad, it's just that the show is already far too cliched already to be using the same trick that many shows have used over the years. Gai was an average character, I have no complaints about him. Ayase was one of the few character I liked in this show. She was a beautiful, strong-willed, and independent character who was also a paraplegic (something you don't see everyday in anime.) Seiga and Daryl are also two characters that I particularly liked. However, in the end, they did not play as big a role than I expected them to. Daryl's fate is also left unexplained, hence another plot-hole. Luckily, I managed to find one character that I adored, Hare. Her role in the story actually meant something to me. Her involvement in the story was also very limited unfortunately. Overall, most of the characters were lackluster, unoriginal, unmemorable, and had too little screen time. 5/10\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - I did enjoy this series. I enjoyed the music and the art but I was very disappointed by the characters and storyline. Had the story and characters been of the same quality as the sound and visuals, Guilty Crown could have been the best anime series of 2011-2012. I cannot stress this enough, I hated the ending. I hated it so much, that when the show ended, I was left speechless with a frown on my face. Afterwards I started screaming profanities at how terrible the ending was. I have never acted like that before, so obviously it was a surprise for me. I mean, I heard it was bad and many people raged at the ending, but I had no idea it was THAT bad. 6/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall - Speaking as a fan, this show had potential, too much potential to be honest. It had a great cast, a large budget, amazing music, and it had nothing to base itself on. It could've been as original as the writers wanted. Honestly, I believe the writers doomed this show. Guilty Crown did not leave me satisfied, in fact, it made me angry. Not at the story or ending  this time, but at the arrogance of the writers. Good artwork and music do not make up for a horrible plot. I would much rather watch an anime with a great plot but bad animation and music. The storyline, in my opinion, is the more preferable element. I am hoping for a continuation of the story, but then again, the ending nearly destroyed all hope for a second season. I can only rely on the poorly introduced Da'ath organization and the numerous plot-holes for a second season. I only want a continuation of the story to clear loose ends. An OVA is also acceptable. If we're lucky, it won't be atrocious as the original story. If you're are looking for an anime series that has a great story then I suggest you look elsewhere. If you watch mainly for artwork and music, then this series would be great for you. Just don't watch this show expecting a masterpiece, this show is far from one.  6/10",

            "content": "Guilty Crown... It receives the most hatred of any anime I've watched (besides SAO, but I won't rant about that anime's shit- excuse me, bland second half.)Honestly as shitty and horrible as the story was, and as bipolar the characters I can say I enjoyed this anime above anything else I've seen so far, granted I have not seen much anime. I gave this anime a score of 10/10 on MY anime list, that was based purely off my enjoyment,BUT my enjoyment doesn't truly reflect on how good an anime is.Let's get started.\r\n-Music/Sound(10)\r\nFantastic, this anime's music plays the biggest role in the anime. It aloneis what carried the mess of a plot on its shoulder and having one of MC's be a musician who sings these wonderful songs to us on an episode to episode basis is simply wonderful. I also mean to exaggerate the importance of the music in the plot itself. So, for music absolutely no complaints here. As for the voice actors... I liked them, but they weren't anything special, especially in the dub. (Shu's voice actor in the dub couldn't have fit his character better, but that's what annoyed me...)\\n\\n\r\n-Visuals(10)\\n\r\nYou've all heard it before and now I'm going to say it again: this anime is without a doubt eye-candy. The animation is consistent and beautiful. I really loved the animation having to do with voids especially, whether it was the voids being put to use as weapons or even simply being extracted. Episode 4 really ehpasizes the beauty of the series and was the hook that kept me going at the begining.Hell, one of our main antagonists goes as far as screaming,\" IT'S BEAUTIFUL,\" during one particular scene, to which I couldn't agree more. Character designs were good, excluding Inori's character design (which was excellent.)Amazing visuals overall.\\n\\n\r\n-Story(5)\\n\r\nIn most anime the story is the heart and soul of the show. For Guilty Crown the story felt like it was put off to the side as a, \"We'll think about that after we make the series beautiful,\" and it showed. I love post apocalyptic settings, but this one was kinda just meh. The apocalypse virus seemed like a cool idea at first until it was thrown aside being labeled as : generic kill off the human race type thing. The idea of Voids also struck me as being cool, until they didn't put enough depth on the concept. The rest of the story is a mix of clich\u00e9s, although those didn't bother me as much as they did other people. I also hear a lot of people basically calling Guilty Crown the failed version of Code Geass, why is this you might ask? You're asking the wrong person because I have never watched said show nor do I ever intend to( I do not like the mech genre, Endlaves in Guilty Crown played a very insignificant role being why I continued watching it.) As for the ending of Guilty Crown all I can say is I was disappointed. It seemed kind of dull compared to the rest of the series in terms of ACTION, however the emotion towards the end of the series, was heartfelt all the way to the very ending. Unfortunately, emotion also included anger, and I honestly can't believe how much of a 'WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU DOING' ending this was. It was a complete bull shit ending that made no sense until you watched it 5 times(this dropped the overall score from 8 to a 7. The 7 was me being to generous.)Plot holes were obvious, but nothing that couldn't be figured out with a little inference(lets just hope you aren't used to being spoon fed every answer otherwise this is not the anime for you.) As for the anime's two part setup all I can say is that the second half is much stronger in terms of character development and to some extent story and is a huge step up as the series takes a much darker tone. This is unfortunate considering most people did not stick around long enough to enjoy the second half. The story of Guilty Crown required far more then 22 episodes, to be honest it could have been an anime of two 25 episode seasons with all the content they tried to stuff in this tiny little anime and if they had done that this anime would be SO much better. Overall the story was mediocre, it had a lot of flaws and the cliches weren't hard to see, but its nothing you can't enjoy.\\n\\n\r\n-Characters(7)\\n\r\nThe characters are by far the most hated part of the anime for most people, even more so then the story for MOST people. Shu is annoying and bitchy, I almost dropped this series on episode 1 simply because Shu annoyed me so much, but I think the main reason I disliked him at first was because he was different. I was so use to the reckless badassory of most male main characters that this change felt very sudden and uncomfortable. After a while, although, his character started to man up. Did it take too long? Yes, but at least it happened. In the end Shu was the most developed character of the anime, although parts of his development made me hate him with a passion. Next we have Inori to which I immediately drew parallels to Mikasa of Attack on Titan, for the first... I don't know 10 episodes, before she became a damsel in distress. This disappointed me because to be honest I like stronger female characters that don't become very reliant on the male characters(like Mikasa.) She was also labeled as completely emotionless which is true, but her character has a lot of depth (unfortunately this depth is not explained to its fullest in the anime itself, however it was explained in the visual novel Lost Xmas which I had the pleasure of enjoying.) People also say she has an insignificant role in the plot, but I find her to be the source of every part of Shu's development. Without her, Shu would be the wuss he was at the beginning and this story wouldn't have gone anywhere.Also vice versa we have Shu to aid the developement of Inori's development, she goes from being a lost character at the begining with no true sense of purpose, to a person who has found a way to be human in the fucked up world they live in (I love dandere/kuudere archetype characters don't ask why because I don't even know.) This co-dependent relationship is what makes Inori and Shu simply wonderful. As for Gai, he's a badass sure, but his motivation or lack there of is... Disappointing?That's probably the right word. The rest of the cast was okay, though the antagonists stuck out to me as good characters. Overall I feel like most people make the characters out worse then they actually are. The characters that needed to develop, did (although some were done in a very shitty way) and I personally didn't hate any character that I wasn't supposed hate(besides one...)The number one thing you will notice about the Guilty Crown main characters is that they are broken. There is no better way to describe them as just being plane broken, but thats part of the reason they are enjoyable to watch.\\n\\n\r\n-Enjoyment(10)\\n\r\nI already said this was my favorite anime, right? The visuals during the action scenes were consistent and awesome. The music added a great emotion to a lot of scenes ,the OST is DEFINITELY something worth finding and downloading. Inori was adorable, Inori and Shu together was even more adorable. I love this show and I am able to say that yo\\n\\n\r\n-Overall(7)\\n\r\nGuilty Crown didn't have the greatest characters, nor the greatest story, but there's something about it that makes people like me really love the show. On the other hand if you nitpick this anime for every little thing it does, you will end up hating it like some people. So, is it okay for me to rate this anime as good considering everything wrong with it? Yes, because if you look at the music, the visuals, and even sometimes even the characters you could tell this anime was setup for greatness. Unfortunately, in the end the plot and (for the most part) the characters are what dragged this anime down for most people. Do I recommend this anime? I'd say you should procceed with caution, because you will a)love this anime, or b)beat the shit out of it for every little thing, depending on how you look at the series. So, go ahead give it a try, you might be in for a nice (or horrible) surprise.",

            "content": "The anime overall was amazing to watch. It's creative, more than average and it kept me excited to keep going into the next episode. If you're looking for a extremely happy story-than you may want to pick another anime. I only had wished that they made it longer and didn't squish everything into 22 episodes, would have been better if they spread it out and wouldn't have seem so clustered. It could have been longer to attach yourself better too it and explain somethings. The anime is enjoyable.\r\nPlot: The mix of ideas combined together worked out well. It takes skill to put that many ideasinto one and make it all work and fit together.I don't think most people understand what 'creative' is. Many people are obsessed with originality, and I can't watch anything that's not creative-but my point is every idea in the world is already used. Just because they used different ideas and made them into one does not mean it's not original. The story is original. It brings most of humanity's fear of a virus, of being trapped in a box to be killed. This is not an anime where you look into specific into certain things. All of us are afraid of the monster inside us, being trapped, losing someone to a virus. That's what the plot shows. There was a bit of  mecha in there that wasn't too dominate in the series-and it's understandable to not make them something too crazy. They used the story of Adam and Eve. The story does make me think, and hold symbolism about Inori's sword. If connected to Christianity and the representation of the sword, you can tell.  Of course, you actually have to pay attention and think about it the series, instead of bashing it back and forth like a know-it-all. It gives a lesson, humans are humans, they do wrong and good.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: It had character development. Inori was still inori but she's grown to feel more and there's other examples as well.The characters were realistic. They seemed human with the flaws they were given. Now some may label some characters stereotype but first you have to think that most of us have these personalities in real life anyway. They made mistakes, and at some point the two main characters turned to be like a villain themselves. The main character wasn't just a hero. I wouldn't know if I would even call him that. As for Inori, whom people call boring, or sometimes they call the characters flat. Untrue. Look more into it and think what the characters are going through. I hardly see really flawed characters in other animes or ones that have true life. Normally characters are either incredibly weak, all about doing 'good' and such.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nThe art was amazing. I don't know what else to say about it. I loved the whole animation about it. Well-except that some of the outfits just felt unnecessary but that's in about 90 percent of anime, so it's not a bother and it doesn't even cross the line. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: I was miserable most of the time, but in a good way. I felt upset for the characters and the life they lived. Now, to fully enjoy this anime, you actually have to stick to it to an end. Don't make a judgement before finishing.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: The series could have been longer. If it had been longer it would have shown character development better and people would be able to attach to themselves more. They should have given it more time to grow. There is some plot holes, but if it was longer it could have been fixed. It could have been better by not squishing it. It's a thought out anime, that could have explained more to people who didn't understand if it had been longer.",

An epidemic happens in Japan and the rest of the world comes in to confide \"peace\" and don't feel like leaving. Bad guys butchering innocents, then the main character comes in and there I was, sitting there thinking about Busujima's boobs wondering what the heck is going on.\nAs I have mentioned earlier, the story is complex. I had to rewind a single episode many times just to get a small fragment of what's going on. What I do know is that its sad and is mostly a tragedy. And I wasextremely sad and nearly cried...\\n\\n\nThe plus points would be the art. Even though the story was rubbish, the artwork and visual graphics were astounding and it was kind if like CGI porn instead of an anime.\\n\\n\nThe sounds and beats were also marvelous and astounding. It was so beautiful that I would rewind a certain part just to listen to the music. And rewind it again at a later time to understand the story.\\n\\n\nAn then there's the characters. This is the type of anime where the main character is whiny and should be beaten to death with a stick by another more eligible protagonist. Characters like these are terrible and downgrade the story. But there were a few good ones and for these characters, I give them merit badges. And cookies.\\n\\n\nThe enjoyment count is as low as it gets and the comedy is factor is a zero. The violence count is at a medium level and it was just sad.\\n\\n\nIn short the creators if Guilty Crown wanted to make it sad and emotional. Its just another one of those sad anime that have many plus points but is overshadowed by a poor storyline. 2/10.",

Its concepts and ideas are fantastic, its soundtrack is amazing, its art design is crisp and dynamic; its execution? Well it's a bit flat. The problem with Guilty Crown is that it had too many ideas, and subsequently had no focus. So many different things were incorporated into the show, there was so little time to flesh them all out (some were introduced and simply forgotten after). Voids, Mechs, Social Darwinism, Utilitarianism, Healthcare, Amnesia, a convenient plot concerning the protagonist's parents, some dabbling withincest; it's hard to really keep track of it all. And the plot itself; you're kind of just left to accept that things happen without much explanation, whether it be out of convenience or just a 'gotcha' moment. Lots of holes. \\n\\n\r\nBut as many flaws as the shows has (there's a lot), I think it's still a good show and worth watching. It was original in its material, and showcased the potential of an ambitious anime. I honestly think that if the characters weren't so one dimensional, it'd easily be one of my favorite anime.",

            "content": "Spoiler Free \r\nStory 7/10\r\nThe story of Guilty Crown revolves around Shu Ouma, a high school boy who inadvertently obtains an ability called \"The Power of the Kings\" that enables him to draw out items called \"Voids\" from other people. He is then thrown into the conflict between a quasi-governmental organization known as the GHQ and a resistance group called Funeral Parlor which aims to restore Japan's independence from the GHQ. In the process, Shu has to deal with the burden his ability puts on his shoulders and the horrific mystery of his past.  (Wikipedia)\r\nThe story is definitely interesting, combining political situations and daily issuesto create a struggling Japan. This is one of the stories when the protagonist gets caught in the conflict and has no idea what to do in the face of things. But this is done well as we see he is nervous, shy, and scared. 3 very real emotions majority of people would face and the story expands on his time as a member of  Funeral Parlor. There are numerous revelations throughout the story as well see those close to Shu react from the hardships of their daily lives. The story transforms in the middle when we understand more of Shu's past and the history of the cancer itself. Although the story brings out serious ideas, it does become confusing by the middle of the series. This is because of the new characters who enter the story and some plot holes that develop. However, it has a strong beginning, progressive middle, and okay ending.\\n\\n\r\nArt 10/10\\n\r\nGuilty Crown is definitely one of the most beautiful anime ever to be produced. The lighting and close focus on objects have made this absolutely gorgeous. Not to mention the perfect openings.\\n\\n\r\nSound 10/10\\n\r\nHiroyuki Sawano. This man is a legend in the anime industry for his epic scores as seen in Attack on Titan, Aldnoah.Zero, Seraph of the End, and many more. The OST hold a lot of emotion, specifically KrOne and Bios. The vocals are very powerful and the use of German was very well done. The openings were also amazing with SuperCell doing both \"My Dearest\" and \"Everlasting\". \\n\\n\r\nCharacter 7/10\\n\r\nOuma Shu has mixed opinions amongst anime fans. He is presented as a anti-social 17-year old who just leads a normal life. That is until he finds Yuzuriha Inori and gets thrown into all the conflict between the GHQ and Funeral Parlor. Even after receiving the void ability, he is scared for what will happen to him and how it can affect his friends. Once again, he displays cowardly, but realistic emotions. He does develop greatly by the second half to be rather forceful to say the least. After a major plotpoint, he becomes colder and more ruthless, presenting an arrogant demeanor. He changes many times throughout the show and it is a good display of character development.\\n\\n\r\nYuzuriha Inori is a pretty and quiet girl who serves as Shu's love interest. She is the singer of the popular band, Egoist and becomes Shu's classmate afterwards. She is responsible for giving Shu the Void Genome and is the person who Shu draws out his most powerful weapon. Although she seems innocent at first, she is also a valuable member of Funeral Parlor where she is a part of dangerous missions. For the most part, Inori is rather straightforward. She does change after a certain point but the change was rather forced and she reverts back to how she was quickly. Her main purpose is to be Shu's love interest and the person who cares for him during his darker times.\\n\\n\r\nGai is the leader of Funeral Parlor and becomes somewhat of a mentor to Shu. He approaches things with logic and acts, in many ways, opposite to Shu. He focuses only on the mission and gets things done quickly. He becomes a major point of the plot after a mission and has a controversial role in the second half of the show where we find out his past connection with Shu. The best way to characterize Gai is stating him as an anti-hero.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 9/10\\n\r\nBeautiful visuals. Beautiful music. Great action and an emotional plot. I enjoyed this series very much and it is definitely one of my all time favorites.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 9/10\\n\r\nI strongly recommend this anime to anyone. It has top tier animation and music along with a unique plot and good characters. Although the story does become a bit convoluted by the second half, it has explanations in the end to fill in the holes. The ending is beautiful and very memorable.",

When i started it, i was very impressed the first few episodes. I absolutely loved the music and it was just plain fun to watch. For the review I'm gonna split the series in 2. The first part ends at (if I'm not mistaking) episode 13. \r\nPart one:\r\nMusic is awesome, especially in episode 13. Characters develop somewhat, but satisfying enough and even though there coudl be so much more in the story you feel it this is it. It wasactually surprising that the story continued in my opinion, though i was happy for it because I was enjoying the series. \\n\\n\r\npart two:\\n\r\nfrom episode 13 on, you get confused. The episodes are enjoyable to keep watching, but you're just plain confused why things are happening and why other things aren't happening. A main character gets a personality transformation, and suddenly a few episodes later he gets another one and then a few later ANOTHER one. I  understand that humans aren't predictable either, but personally I found it plain weird. \\n\r\n I believe I finished the series only because I knew that in the last episode there was the last OST I hadn't heard yet, but the story went haywire and made absolutely no sense at all. The ending I didn't even understand until I read another (spoiling) review, it was very unsatisfying. \\n\\n\r\nSo in the end, the series is fun to watch the first 13 episodes, after that it becomes blah. The art is very well made and also somewhat original. Though the main thing that kept me going in this anime was the music. Well done with the OST! though try your best on making a better storyline the next time ;)  \\n\\n\\n\r\nLove\\n\r\nKelsey",

I have personally have had some enjoyment with it, not because of the story, but rather of the transformation of society and the characters. The major criticism comes from the poor characters and that the plot kills itself. Admitingly by the end of series the anime is drowning, concluded by a poor resolution and isn't in tune of the rest of the anime.\r\nMajority of the character cast is bound to hated because of their irritating attitude and irrational thinking. Empathy was meant to be created for the characters, however itsimply does not happen because of the anguish felt towards the characters. Shu, the leading protagonist, has a complete transformation of characters which is astonishing when comparing him with the character at the start. Despite this change there is still a feeling of remorse of the character because of his overall negative character.\\n\\n\r\nVisually it is up to scratch, which is expected from such a hyped anime. The action is fluid and the changes of settings are interesting but not very meaningful in most cases. However, the settings become duller and duller as the series progresses due to limitations and becomes a draw back. \\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is by far the greatest inclusion of the anime. It ranges from a soft melody to intense pieces of music. Guilty Crown is full of perfect music, and used effectively to enhance the moment.\\n\\n\r\nGuilty Crown has more downfalls than positives, especially with the plot and the characters. Despite this you'll likely watch all 22 episodes because of expectations, which are unfortunately never met. Guilty Crown could of been a masterpiece but falls as it loses its sight. \\n\\n\r\nEven if you don't end up watching Guilty Crown, at least listen to the soundtrack.",

The reviews here say that the characters all don't have personalities, I thought that there was nothing wrong with the character's personalities, except that everyone in undertakers or funeral parlour (whatever you want to call it) expects Shu to change into this person thatcan magically help them get rid of GHQ, when all they're doing is throwing him into dangerous situations and seeing what will happen.

            "content": "I had extremely high hopes for Guilty Crown when it was first announced. The story sounded promising, especially considering the presence of the Code Geass screen-writers, the art was easy on they eyes, and it had the vibe of a classic in the making. I finished it a few days ago and came away from the show with mixed feelings. Guilty Crown has proven to be a very divisive show, suffering some of the most hatred I have seen inflicted upon a show in a long time, a view that I partially agree with, but not to the extent that many do. Now that ithas finished airing, I've decided to write about my thoughts on the series as a review.\\n\\n\r\nStory\\n\\n\r\nGuilty Crown revolves around Ouma Shu, a socially withdrawn high-school student, who lives in a world where Japan is under the tight-fisted control of an oppressive military organization named GHQ due to an outbreak of a deadly virus ten years previously. Shu soon gains a genetic power derived from the \u201cVoid Genome\u201d which allows him to create weapons and tools from the hearts of other people. Shu joins up with a freedom fighting force known as Undertaker and sets out to stop the GHQ. Along the way he meets a mysterious girl known as Inori, the singer for the popular musical group EGOIST, who has decided to join with Undertaker.\\n\\n\r\nIt's not the most original story idea in the world, but its a workable concept in the hands of a skilled writer. The issue that arises is the show's obsession with becoming another mega-popular genre-spanning epic in the vein of Code Geass. Two of Code Geass's scriptwriters penned the series and its painfully obvious. Similar to Code Geass, Guilty Crown is a Frankenstein of genres, slamming together everything from romance to mecha in an attempt to appeal to a wide audience. This strategy worked for Geass, GC doesn't pull it off with quite the same level of grace. The show relies heavily on stereotypical anime cliches for its characters and story and the plot shamelessly rips off other better series such as but not limited to Code Geass on numerous occasions.\\n\\n\r\nThrough all of this, GC still manages to be a fun ride despite the chronic lack of inspiration. The main gimmick of weapons derived from the hearts of companions is a novel idea and helps create many exciting fight sequences. The action scenes rank as by far the best part of the series. The fight choreography is well-done and sets up some heart-pounding action sequences involving everything from standard shoot-outs to mecha duels.\\n\\n\r\nDespite an initially strong start, GC starts staggering several episodes in under the excessive use of cliches. The plot starts running out of steam at an alarming rate and defaults to standard boring anime high school antics.  However, things do pick up towards the halfway point. The show's story actually becomes somewhat unpredictable in the latter half of the series, leading up to a rushed but reasonably satisfying ending.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are a mixed bag. Shu isn't the worst protagonist ever, but there aren't many reasons to empathize with him in the first half of the series. Many criticize Shu for being a weak-willed character, however I didn't find him to be that unlikable for all his flaws. Shu's character evolves somewhat as the series progresses and he eventually gains some backbone as things progress. The varied cast of characters that make up Undertaker and Shu's school friends is hit and miss. Some of the characters are likable, others not so much. The one thing that ties them all together is a sharp lack of decent character development. The antagonists aren't that much out of the ordinary, but are fun to root against. Special note must be given to the character of Inori, who ranks as one of the most flat and uninteresting characters I have seen in any work of fiction. Her character is little more than an emotionless piece of eye-candy that exists solely to pander. I can't help but feel GC would have vastly benefited from a more likable female lead. Overall, the cast of characters isn't that bad, but suffer from a lack of charisma and character development.\\n\\n\r\nArt\\n\\n\r\nIn a word, gorgeous. Production I.G spared no expense in the animation and the result is awe-inspiring to look upon. Detail fills everything from the backgrounds to the characters themselves. The coloring is particularly pleasing to the eye. The fight sequences are many times a wonder to behold thanks to the detailed and fluid animation. Its quite obvious that a lot of talent went into the production of the show. Its such a shame that the story can't match up to the exceptional production values.\\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\\n\r\nGuilty Crown fares very well in the sound department. The opening and ending songs are pretty catchy. The background music is absolutely superb. Certain scenes in the series are elevated from mediocrity to greatness simply because of how fitting the music is. I would say that the music in many scenes, such as in the last episode, are of movie quality. The quality of the voice acting is very good even though many times the script doesn't do the the performer's talents justice.\\n\\n\r\nConclusion\\n\\n\r\nIn the end, your enjoyment of this show will depend on whether you can look past the gaping issues with the story and just enjoy it for the well-produced sloppy fun it is. If Guilty Crown would've had better script-writers, it is very possible it would have turned into a modern classic, but as it is now, GC merely ranks as a technically superb example of failed potential. For all the problems, I felt that my time with the show was time well-spent and I had a lot of fun along the way. If you don't care about poor writing and just want a slickly animated and fairly entertaining way to spend twenty-two episodes, Guilty Crown is your show; more discerning viewers will want to look elsewhere.",

The initial premise look interesting about the first half of the first episode.\r\nAlso I get people who says this \"borrows\" heavily to other animes. They sort of just mashed characters from other animes. Power of king?Girl in wheelchair? Ace girl piloting a mecha? Mysterious girl? Steiner? Orange (yes, also with the eye thing)?

What they didn't copy from C.G. is the amazing script writing.\\n\\n\r\nThere are just no clear cut-out goals for the main character. It feels very forced, in a very very bad way.\\n\\n\r\n----Some Spoilers, Just bits and pieces, nothing big-----\\n\r\nHere are some questions you will find asking yourself after you watched few episodes:\\n\r\n>Why in hell Shu go meet Gai in the first place? Is it because of the girl?\\n\r\n>Why would someone try to save a girl(a pretty one at that) he just met? Is it because she is pretty? Is it her dress? Why the hell would Inori wear something like that in the battleground(yes, I hear ya', it's fan service. No other reason)?\\n\r\n>What the hell is that? How can Shu move like that being a regular kid(maybe there is some reveal later in the series)?\\n\r\n>WHY IN HELL WOULD YOU PUT A FUCKING PEN IN A SWITCH TO A WEAPON OF MASS DESTRUCTION? It was like \"here is the simple fucking switch that can blow you to pieces, let's make it so that you can easily click it. Oh wait. I got an idea, why not put a FUCKING PEN in that thing? It would be nice wouldn't it? Oh what an ingenious thing to do!\". Damnit,so freaking stupid. And don't start me with \"it was given to Shu to deceive him\". You can't create something so fast, the freaking pen was there from the beginning. Even if it was created instantaneously, that device was introduced as a tagging device, so why would you put a pen in it?\\n\r\n>How in hell would Gai know what the pen does?\\n\r\n>Where is the depth in the attachment of Shu to Inori? Oh wait, you mean that's just how deep it is?\\n\r\n>Where did the sane reasons went for Shu? Where were the good script and plot writers?\\n\r\n>Why did I watch this series against all reviews not to?\\n\\n\r\nSorry, I just recently re-watched C.G. so bad things like these seems to show to me like a sore thumb. There's not much character introduction and build up here, the plot and reasons seem to be scattered all over the place(more like reasons are just not there).\\n\\n\r\nMaybe, just maybe, this is like Steins Gate where thing will get real and reasoning will come out after the first half of the series. And maybe, just like MN, the show will get better even the main character sucks so much (though yuki in MN didn't go too far).\\n\\n\r\nI watched only up to episode 7.\\n\r\nOverall rating is 3 out of 10",

            "content": "Imagine this anime as a copy-paste document form Code Geass where the makers just changed the font style and color and maybe added or deleted a few sentences. Unlike other reviews I'll write this one as if we are living in an universe where Code Geass does not exist and just focus on this reviews topic, Guilty Crown.\r\nA rating of 7,89 on MAL (My Anime List) is just right to describe the 22-episode-long anime that finished airing in 2012. The pros and cons of this series kinda cancel each other leaving a nice anime with an 35% approximate chance that I'll watch it again. Probablynot...\\n\r\nPlot and Storyline:\\n\r\nI don't know why, but if anime makers mess something up then it's always the end, or in this case the whole second half. Guilty Crown would be much better if it only had the 12 episodes it has in the beginning. The rest is nearly trash. The end was so rushed, the happenings were all so sudden and the  plot was somehow made up of loosely connected events that just caused a lot of plot-holes. Not to mention the untold love story between the main two characters. While watching the second half my facial expression only changed from What? to What the Hell? \\n\r\nThe idea it self seems okay to me. Tokyo, 2039. Ten years ago a lethal virus broke out causing a lot of deaths in whole Japan. This event is known under the name \"Lost Christmas\", and since then Japan has been under control of the multinational organization called GHQ. The GHQ however just kills everyone that might be affected by the virus resulting a lot of innocent lifes to be taken. Against the GHQ fights a terrorist group named \"Funeral Parlor\". \\n\r\nIn the middle of the story we have 17-year-old Ouma Shu who by accident meets Inory, a member of Funeral Parlor. After getting into a fight with the GHQ, in wish to save Inory, he gains, trough her, the power to extract voids from humans, tools or weapons that manifest a person's heart. Soon after, Shu joins Funeral P. and begins his fight against the GHQ.\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nAs for the characters of this anime, they are some interesting personalities and some you really just want to punch in the face. \\n\r\nAnimation:\\n\r\nThe thing that definitely makes everything right after the bad story end is the animation. It is the best animated anime I've ever seen in my life. The visual effects, the landscapes, the fights,  the character looks. Masterpiece! I mean, just look for instance at the way Shu pulls out the voids, that silver things around and....Awesome! \\n\r\nConclusion:\\n\r\nOkay, this anime really has a few setbacks. The second half really bombs the watcher with background stories and events that just complicate everything. You get the feeling that even the makers didn't know how to finish it leaving us with a disappointing anime that actually started pretty good. As said before, the animation on the other hand fixes most of the mistakes and really makes you wanna watch the show. One more good thing I want to commend is the imperfection of the main character. Shu is a bad character, but his personality gave the show that little drama. \\n\\n\r\nAfter considering everything I would give this anime a 7/10, I liked it and the only thing that I won't forgive the makers is the untold love story. I recommend you to watch it but don't get too disappointed, I've warned you.\\n\\n\r\nYour AnimeGirl",
