            "content": "I\u2019ve had this mixed reaction with school throughout my life. There were times when professors I\u2019ve faced just tries to get on your nerves to make life a living hell. Then, there were times where I come across the best teacher in the world where it\u2019s worth every minute attending the course. Ansatsu Kyoushitu (Assassination Classroom) isn\u2019t just about learning something from the teacher though. If you take a knife, gun, or whatever that can be considered a killing tool to school, you\u2019d get expelled. But in this series, that takes on a rather different direction. And I have to say, it\u2019s peculiarly interesting atheart.\\n\\n\r\nBased on the manga of the same name, the series is financially successful so why not an anime adaptation? This didn\u2019t came as a surprise as a special episode titled \u2018Ansatsu Kyoushitsu (TV) Episode 0: Deai no Jikan\u2019 already debuted prior to its television premiere. With a peculiar premise about a class of students trying to literally kill their teacher, you\u2019ll probably ask yourself if this is a suitable series for you.  \\n\\n\r\nA primary introduction into the series will easily set your eyes feasted into the story. The premise of the series involves a classroom of ordinary students known as Kunugigaoka Middle School's Class 3-E. Every morning involves them greeting their not-so-ordinary teacher. Known by many as \u201cKoro-sensei\u201d, he has a big smiley face, a body full of tentacles, and the personality of an easygoing guy. A main objective involves the students actually trying to kill him because in about a year, he will blow up the Earth. Now hold on. You\u2019re probably asking yourself \u2018what\u2019? It\u2019s not as twisted as it sounds though because the series is actually quite lighthearted. When molding the term \u201cassassination\u201d into any title, you would expect bloodthirsty violence or gore shoved down our throats. However, this series takes a satirical stab at the genre and transform it into a rather amusing series action-packed comedy of every day school life. \\n\\n\r\nThe main attraction that can draw any viewer into this series is the comedy. And this is because the series itself has a personality. It\u2019s especially true for Koro-sensei as he teaches more than just academics in class. He teaches about everyday life lessons and even connects individually with characters on a personal level at times. At certain points of the story, you\u2019ll find him quite likeable and even relatable by the topics he covers in class. And of course, his expressive face is always amusing and delightful to watch. In essence, the comedy is refreshing and takes assassination to a level that can be considered more of a parody. The theme of assassination is actually deconstructed on a multitude of levels when it comes to story execution. It also crafts a bit of slice of life as some episodes feels like an adventure that takes the students to places they\u2019ve never been before.\\n\\n\r\nWhile the comedy aspect of the show can be appealing, a large part of the series involves the characters. There\u2019s actually a double edged sword to this series when it comes to characters, although for the most part, it should be considered a positive. The plus side is that there is a very diverse category of students attending 3-E. Almost all the characters have a unique personality and their involvement in the story.  The downside is that not every character/student in the class gets a prominent spotlight. Being a 2 cour show (22 episodes) lacks the necessity to draw this out so the series does what\u2019s best to get what\u2019s needed on-screen. Nagisa Shiota is the main male protagonist although he has a rather androgynous appearance. The way the series operates includes him and other students trying to kill their teacher, Koro-sensei but fails to do so every time. So in other words, the students all gets chances in some shape or form throughout the story. What I find most appealing about this is how Koro-sensei is consciously aware of their motivations but also gives encouragements to these students for trying while teaching them life lessons. Most of the characters also build relationships that are meaningful despite some obvious differences with their personalities. This is especially true for Nagisa and Karma Akabane, a notoriously troublesome boy. And on an individual level, there\u2019s also distinctive amount of characterization focused on specific characters. Yukiko, Rio, and Ritsu are just a few to name as the series expands on their roles as the story progresses. Even teachers such as Tadaomi Karasuma and Irina Jelavic has a fluid characterization with their involvement in the main story.\\n\\n\r\nFor more or less, the story flows like a slice of life with direction pointing at various locations.  It expands beyond just the classroom as the students does go occasionally on field trips. And often times, their trips takes them to places that associates with different culture. It explores a realistic side that almost blurs between the lines of fiction and reality. Furthermore, there\u2019s an interesting degree of life lesson morality with certain aspects of the show. It even discusses certain sensible topics at times that people like you and me may be aware of. Of course, we also can\u2019t forget about the academics part. As a show taking place in school life environment, there\u2019s all sorts of subjects explored such as Math, Science, Social Studies, and even Physical Education. It\u2019s like living the old days at high school again.\\n\\n\r\nI will say this series is not for everyone though. As a show about deconstructing the assassination trope, the humor can be a hit or miss for some. Rather, there\u2019s a diehard attempt to illustrate a colorful side of killing. Assassination itself is a sensible topic but when it takes place in the classroom, it can sometimes be controversial. Luckily, most of the show is lighthearted and doesn\u2019t ever venture into shock value. However, as lighthearted as it can be, the comedy will sometimes feel blend and repetitive. Also do note that this adaptation is rearranged a bit so some chapters are omitted to make the overall story feel smoother. \\n\\n\r\nAdapted from Lerche, Ansatsu Kyoushitu\u2019s artwork succeeds in capturing the fitting art style of the series. It feels like the comedic tone and lighthearted atmosphere the creators are trying to bring out. Furthermore, the character designs matches their persona in terms of adaptation. Perhaps the most prominent design features Koro-sensei. I will say that this peculiar creature never ceases to amuse me whether he is teaching in class, his facial expressive reactions, or when he attempts to dodge his death. There\u2019s also a good stylized way to coordinate the action with assassination that involves tools and strategies. Guns, swords, knives, bombs\u2026you name it. They are there in the show and used in some very creative ways. The series puts the fun into their usage as we see how clever they can be used. Oh and did I mention Irina? The students may call her bitch sensei all the time but she has the figure of a femme fatale.\\n\\n\r\nPerhaps the lesser well addressed feature of the show is the soundtrack. Make no mistake though, the show doesn\u2019t neglect that. The catchy OP/ED songs has a goofy yet effective style to give viewers an insight on what they can expect. Character voice mannerism are fitting for their roles. Koro-sensei himself has a very laid-back personality along with a voice that equally matches his character. I give praise to Jun Fukuyama for stepping into the shoes of this creature as it\u2019s never easy to voice someone that is so otherworldly. OST on most parts is familiar although not the thing that stands out the most. Overall, the style is still an eerie beauty though.\\n\\n\r\nI know what you\u2019re thinking. It\u2019s probably something along the lines of \u201cthis show seems way too crazy\u201d. And to be honest, you\u2019re not wrong. But as crazy as it seems, it\u2019s a lot of fun with assassination, school life, and a cast of characters with how they spend their daily lives. Rather than adapting romance angles or diehard drama, we get this classic shounen comedy with a very stylish way of storytelling. Each episode offers something new thanks to its themes and performances of the characters. The comedy is fresh and doesn\u2019t rely on cheap cardboard fan service to get to its point. I highly recommend giving this series a try regardless of how unorthodox the premise may seem to sound. There\u2019s a chance it could surprise you. After all, isn\u2019t life just full of surprises?\\n",

            "content": "(This has been adapted from my blog/reddit thread. Spoilers ahead!)\r\nAs I made my way through my early education, I always considered myself a pretty good student. I read my books, did my homework, and played nicely during recess. There was a big flaw that took a while for me to shake off, though: talking way too much. I would talk while the teachers were speaking, I would talk over my friends, and I would talk during assemblies when I wasn\u2019t supposed to. No matter how many reprimands or punishments I got, I couldn\u2019t seem to get it into my noggin that there are times whenyou get to speak your mind and times when you just have to shut up. I eventually learned this lesson \u2013 it took a little too long by my family\u2019s account \u2013 but my teachers never gave up on me. They stuck through my incessant ramblings, allowing me to realize the error of my ways, making me into a better person because of their hard work. Assassination Classroom performs similarly, offering an anime that still has lessons to be learned.\\n\\n\r\nSTORY\\n\\n\r\nAssassination Classroom follows the \u201cEnd Class,\u201d a group of students relegated to the bottom-of-the-barrel in their school system due to their poor grades, abysmal behavior, or any combination thereof. One day, a new \u201cteacher\u201d arrives, tasking the class with a seemingly simple objective: assassinate him before the time limit is reached or the Earth is doomed. Picking up knives and weapons instead of pens and utensils, the kids train themselves to eliminate this otherworldly creature.\\n\\n\r\nThe premise is wacky, without a doubt. Having a bunch of junior high delinquents kill their artificially composed \u201csensei\u201d is pretty imaginative, but simultaneously seems as if there isn\u2019t much to work with. To an extent, this mentality isn\u2019t too far off. Assassination Classroom leans heavily on repetition for much of the season. Specifically, the children invent an elaborate way to go about taking out their teacher that ultimately fails. This is pretty much expected given the format of the anime; killing the teacher off early doesn\u2019t make any sense because the show would end. So no matter what the kids do, the audience already knows that the outcome will never succeed. It therefore falls on the actual events to make up for the constant lack of return on the investment already given.\\n\\n\r\nSadly, the show falls short here as well. The comedy is pretty simplistic because, like the assassination attempts, it devolves into repetition quite quickly. For example, \u201cProfessor Bitch\u201d never fails to get mad at her students, the kids always overreact to Koro-sensei despite being around him for so long, and their individual quirks aren\u2019t pronounced enough to be used as laughing points. Besides the comedy, the show has the tendency to reiterate the same ideas ad nauseam. \u201cThe E-Class is super dumb\u201d and \u201cKoro-sensei is incredibly fast\u201d comprise a lot of the dialogue, often said once or twice (each) per episode. These facts are understood and established rather early, but the anime makes sure to shove in these ideas at every turn. It\u2019s ironic, because such a tactic makes it seem as if the show \u2013 which is all about \u201cgetting\u201d to these kids \u2013 doesn\u2019t trust its viewers enough to also \u201cget\u201d what it has to say. There also exists an apparent tonal issue that the anime chooses to embrace. Assassination Classroom is meant to be a fun show. The weird teacher, the dichotomy of teenagers wielding combat weapons, and interactions of the students are normally meant to be lighthearted. So when the show diverts from this formula and goes dark or dramatic, it doesn\u2019t work. While it tries to present itself as such, it instead feels forced. This is wholly apparent when, for example, the anime goes right back to its comedic roots after experiencing a life-threatening trek through a guerilla-infested hotel.\\n\\n\r\nThere are other problems the show maintains \u2013 unnecessary narration since it rehashes whatever has already been discussed, one-time villains, an unclear antagonist \u2013 but the anime does manage to stick with its own theme: becoming a better person. However, it\u2019s a bit stronger than this, because the kids of the \u201cEnd-Class\u201d aren\u2019t ordinary children. They\u2019re the ones who need the most help, who require the greatest amount of guidance to get them back on the right track. Thus, the theme changes slightly to: anyone can become a better person. We witness this idea unfold nearly every episode. One student learns about how important it is to always take proper safety precautions, another comes to understand the value of free will, and another still realizes the benefits of friendships. They get better physically and mentally, sure, but it\u2019s these small but hugely important life lessons that leave the biggest impact, and subsequently make them better people. The theme itself also comes naturally \u2013 a teacher essentially does just this, teaching his or her students the proper ways of life. So watching these worse-off children improve their persons isn\u2019t only rewarding for them and the audience, but it\u2019s completely normal, too.\\n\\n\r\nANIMATION\\n\\n\r\nThere isn\u2019t too much to say about the art style for Assassination Classroom. Interestingly, it does employ this strange tactic when it comes to its foreground characters. They all seem to \u201cpop,\u201d mostly due to the black outlines they each hold as well as the varied colors the show uses. The backgrounds aren\u2019t too involved, mostly consisting of the same locations \u2013 the classroom, the surrounding field, and the main complex are visited the most. While they aren\u2019t impressive, they do at least capture the school feel needed to make the actual events remain relevant.\\n\\n\r\nThe character designs are nice for a simple reason: they aren\u2019t extremely unique. There are students like Nagisa who have the uncommon hair color, but for the most part, the characters look like regular junior high kids. Obviously, this isn\u2019t true for people like Koro-sensei and Irina, but they\u2019re designs also fit well with who they are as people. Koro-sensei\u2019s never-ending smile, tentacles, and pattern-changing skin coincide perfectly with his craziness whereas Irina\u2019s blonde hair, blue eyes, and large bust make her the sexy woman she is. The rest of the cast is a mix of the two \u2013 normalcy combined with uniqueness \u2013 that never feels out of place.\\n\\n\r\nActual animation is roughly average in execution. Koro Sensei takes up a lot of it, with his Mach speed and other physically impossible movements, but the students as well are given opportunities to strut their stuff. In fact, the premise makes this an easy matter; the gun fighting, martial arts, and other ridiculous situations give the show more than enough chances to work with. While it\u2019s never stunning to see, the animation at least keeps up throughout the entirety of the season.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS\\n\\n\r\nThere are a lot of characters within Assassination Classroom, and for good reason. It\u2019s an entire class of students, faculty members, and other people who don\u2019t fit into those descriptions. Now, it\u2019s nigh impossible for the show to give an adequate amount of screen-time or development for every single person, so many of them are as one-dimensional as they come. One girl is known for her chubbiness, one dude is sort of a pervert, one girl likes detective-oriented manga, etc. At the minimum, the anime, despite the cast size it boasts, does try to give everyone at least some time in the spotlight.\\n\\n\r\nThis widespread dividing of resources, though, introduces another problem of its own: not enough focus. Many of the bigger names within the show don\u2019t receive nearly enough attention as they should, diminishing who they are as characters. For starters, Gakuhou, the president of the academy, is painted as evil but still a formidable educator. Yet, outside of making a few snarls or spewing some condescending words, he doesn\u2019t do much of anything in regards to the plot. Itona, the \u201cbrother\u201d of Koro-sensei, follows suit. He appears twice throughout the series, but besides having such strong connections and similarities to the teacher, nothing else is learned about him. Even Nagisa, technically the main student and contender to take down their target, doesn\u2019t see much in the way of development. He sort of floats along with everyone else, gaining a ton of experience by observing Koro-sensei and participating in the daily training regimens. That\u2019s the extent of who he is. He doesn\u2019t seem too troubled by the events surrounding him, there doesn\u2019t appear to be anything extravagant about who he is, and he doesn\u2019t really grow beyond his current state. The final confrontation actually regressed his character for a time; while brief, he forgot almost everything he had learned up to the last fight.\\n\\n\r\nThe worst offender is, surprisingly, Koro-sensei. Maybe three times at best, the show provides the audience with a miniscule glimpse into the alien\u2019s background, but nothing more. His origin remains unknown and his ultimate motivations are unclear. Furthermore, his complete infallibility prevents him from being affected by the kids he advises so much. It sounds counterintuitive, but a teacher learns just as much from his or her students as they do from their mentor, but Koro-sensei cannot personally develop because there\u2019s apparently nothing left for him to learn. \u201cApparently\u201d is used here because, again, there is no knowledge about Koro-sensei\u2019s actual person, so while there may be some kind of problems or issues Koro-sensei has or needs to face, these aren\u2019t explored.\\n\\n\r\nLooking at these paragraphs here, there doesn\u2019t seem to be anyone worth mentioning, but there are a few. Irina is investigated nicely enough, as is Yukiko, but the best character of the anime is Karma. Karma is a difficult kid to work with. He\u2019s abrasive towards authority, he refuses to try hard, and has trouble making friends with others because of his constant bullying. Early on, Koro-sensei does manage to connect with Karma, to get him to understand the worth he has as a person. He calms down and opens up a bit to others, working with instead of against them, but still going about his own business. Later, when he loses grade-wise, he comes to learn that challenging yourself, not complacency, allows you to excel beyond what you were normally capable of. The culmination of his character development is seen near the end when, presented with a tough opponent, he not only chooses to fight him for the sake of his friends but also takes it seriously, more so than he ever had in the past. He began down and out, without people to guide him, but through Koro-sensei\u2019s words of wisdom and friends who accepted him as one of their own, he slowly but surely turned out for the better. Still a little mean, but better nonetheless.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND\\n\\n\r\nThe opening themes for the show, goofy dances aside, are crafted to be fun. The lyrics are mostly filled with references to their teacher, killing, and assassinations, but the beat and instruments are very lighthearted to go along with the comedic nature of the show itself. The repetition here also doesn\u2019t work in its favor; instead of being catchy, it\u2019s annoying. However the male and female vocalists sing in harmony \u2013 for both OPs \u2013 matching the show\u2019s sense of togetherness that it portrays.\\n\\n\r\nThere is only one ending theme for Assassination Classroom. It wasn\u2019t switched out for another because it\u2019s too fantastic to forego. Contrasting with the OPs, it\u2019s slow and gentle both on the ears and the heart. The lyrics and the singing give it a sense of longing; \u201cI was waiting for,\u201d \u201cHello, shooting star again,\u201d and the \u201cah, ah\u201d provide that grateful feeling when something finally returns. The instruments don\u2019t overpower the singer, the pausing in the middle is advantageous to the ED\u2019s theme, and the single guitar lead in at the beginning invites the listener to hear even more. It\u2019s a phenomenal piece, and is definitely the highlight of the entire series.\\n\\n\r\nThe rest of the soundtrack actually has a wide range of beats and tracks to fit many separate and varying occasions. \u201cYukai na Anatsu Keikaku\u201d is very upbeat with the jazzy brass, plethora of drums, and simple beat. \u201cHaritsume ta Kuuki\u201d is both ominous and mysterious, and eventually picks up to increase tension in a positive manner. \u201cTadashi\u201d is quite ambient, almost techno in its presentation, and rather fitting for the \u201calien\u201d scenario the students find themselves in. And \u201cNiramiai\u201d continues with the stealthy and covert-operation vibe that many of the events follow. It\u2019s all appropriate and fits the overall moods of the anime nicely, but nothing is overtly astonishing or memorable.\\n\\n\r\nVoice acting for the show is somewhere around average. A special shout-out is deserved for Jun Fukuyama as Koro-sensei for his zany mannerisms and way of speaking.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT\\n\\n\r\nAs I made my way through this one, I could not get over how kiddy it all was. No amount of guns, bodacious babes, or crazy bad guys could stop me from thinking that this one was designed for a way younger crowd than it was intended for. I never really laughed when I was supposed to, the bad guys were silly rather than scary, and the drama present didn\u2019t move me like it should.\\n\\n\r\nThere weren\u2019t even any characters I really liked, save for two. Irina was there as eye-candy for me and Ritsu (who isn\u2019t even \u201creal\u201d) was adorable after her upgrades. Besides these two girls, I found the rest of the known cast to be boring or lame. Koro-sensei, too, was not entertaining; he\u2019s really fast and crazy, I get that. But his love of big boobs and constant chuckling was never fun to watch.\\n\\n\r\nAssassination Classroom has an amazing ending theme, but the praise halts there. The narrative holds way too many problems to be purposeful, the characters lack the focus necessary to make them meaningful, and the show is way too childish for its own good. Hopefully this one goes to cram school before its second season, because all its doing right now is failing.\\n\\n\r\nSUMMARY\\n\\n\r\nStory: Bad, constant lack of return, too much pointless repetition, tonal issues, but learning life lessons is both rewarding and natural\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: Fine, okay art style, nice character designs, average actual animation\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Bad, many students are glanced at, important members like Gakuhou, Nagisa, and especially Koro-sensei aren\u2019t explored enough, but some like Irina, Yukiko, and Karma are\\n\\n\r\nSound: Fine, okay first OP, okay second OP, great ED, okay soundtrack, average VA work\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Bad, too kiddy, not funny, Koro-sensei is not entertaining, and only Irina and Ritsu out of the entire cast were tolerable\\n\\n\r\nFinal Score: 3/10",

            "content": "If I were to tell you that an anime called \"AssClass\" was about a tentacle monster that shows up to a middle school and... stopped right there- you'd think that this was some nasty hentai, right?\r\nWell, let me be the first to say that this show surprised me in several ways. \r\nNo, it doesn't have surprise sex scenes.\r\nAssassination Classroom, where a group of misfit students band together to try and take down their anthropomorphic, superpowered octopus teacher. The only problem is that while he can break all the rules of physics, they can't. How do you kill a monster who threatens to destroy the Earth,and backs his promise up by obliterating the moon, Death Star style? \\n\\n\\n\r\nArtwork and Animation: 7\\n\\n\r\nAssClass, as a comedy, has a fairly typical 'cutesy' exaggerated feel to the artwork. Everything is a little larger than life, and some characters are little more than animated caricatures, but it goes along well with the overall tone of the series. It's not made to look hyper-realistic, and it plays around a lot with sight gags and some fun oversaturated/negative color asides in the vein of Jojo. \\n\r\nIt's a very colorful and vibrant looking show, with some exotic locales and a seeming obsession with using every crayon in the box to make it look lush. For a new studio like Lerche, I'll give them the thumbs up. It never got sloppy or lazily drawn (Looking at you, Pierrot.) and stayed consistent from start to finish. \\n\\n\\n\r\nSound and Voice Acting: 7\\n\\n\r\nThere are 26 recurring named and individually voiced students, so prepare for an onslaught of names to remember. Some standouts are: Koro Sensei himself, with Jun Fukuyama (Lelouch, Code Geass) behind the mic, Aya Suzuki (Mako, KLK) as Kaede, and Shizuka Itou (Akeno, HSDxD) lending her sexiness to Irina Jelavich.\\n\\n\r\nDespite the immense amount of voices that are used in the show, they don't all end up in the blender and come out a gray, Japanese sounding paste. I won't say each character is unique, because they're not, but there were several memorable voices in this that set themselves apart from the rest of the class- Koro Sensei leading the pack. \\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters and Story: 7\\n\\n\r\nWith 26 different students, an ever growing staff of teachers, a mystery monster, evil principals, some arc-based antagonists, and a cheerfully murderous AI contained in a TV,  somehow they manage to wrap all of them up into a single plot and keep the characters relevant. While some of the students get their time in the sun, a group of kids stay at the forefront- and they're who I'll focus on.\\n\\n\r\nNagisa, the ambiguously gendered main character, Karma the 'bad boy', Terasaka the ruffian, and Kaede the green haired voice of reason round out the most prominent characters. (Man, this sounds like a boy band, hope that Backstreet Boys pun before isn't lost on anyone)\\n\\n\r\nNagisa is a little blue haired runt who gets picked on a lot, but turns out to be the one with the most potential to whack Koro Sensei due to his ability to think outside the box and react quickly. His growth over the course of the show is rather symbolic of the class as a whole. Unrefined, rejected, and isolated, Nagisa and the other students begin as yet another take on the \"ragtag group who grow together to do something awesome\" trope, but pass the test for being something a little more. \\n\\n\r\nSupporting them are the teachers; the aforementioned anthropomorphic, mach 20 flying, super genius octopus Koro Sensei, the straight man, government agent, and PE teacher Karasuma, and the beautiful seductress assassin, Bitch-sensei! \\n\\n\r\nWhile this disparate group sounds like a really cheesy setup for an ensemble comedy, AssClass manages to sidestep the garbage ecchi humor (some lampshaded or shut down gags from Irina aside), overplayed wannabe 4th wall humor, and mo\u00e9 stuff in favor of a generally amusing and overall decent plot, complete with a couple of twists and likable characters. The dynamic between Karasuma and Irina, and watching the group of misfit kids bond together over trying futilely to destroy their teacher while at the same time receiving the best instruction and support of their lives was fun. \\n\\n\r\nWhile a lot of questions about Koro Sensei go unanswered, and some character's backstories not explored fully- they don't necessarily take away from the show. I never felt like I had to know everything about Koro Sensei to be able to enjoy the struggle going on. It's apparent within the universe of the show that several people know what his story is, so I'm content to wait until it's explained to me.\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8\\n\\n\r\nOften with these ensemble shows, I end up hating the characters and want them to die brutal, painful deaths- and with a name like Assassination Classroom, one would think that it's a violent murderfest- but that couldn't be farther from the truth. \\n\\n\r\nAssClass was definitely a fun watch every Friday, and every episode felt like it had something to offer, even after the novelty of \"Will they get him this time??\" wore off. How all the formative events from the beginning and middle of the show came together at the end was nice to see, and the show never broke its internal logic- but it does have some Anime Biology \u2122 going on. Who cares though? It has an octopus that can destroy the moon and fly 15,224 miles per hour.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7\\n\\n\r\nI'm happy to hand Lerche and AssClass a 7, and looking forward to what they bring with Gakkou Gurashi next season. \\n\\n\\n\r\nRecommend?\\n\\n\r\nYes- if a light hearted action/comedy about middle school kids trying to kill their teacher while learning life's lessons sounds like fun, you'd be right. It is. \\n",

            "content": "Ah, school.  The inescapable part of our lives where we spend minimum 12 years of our lives learning a wide array of subjects, facts, and topics that we most likely will never use the majority of in our professional lives.  So, with another school anime, what kind of anime would we get from something about a bunch of middle school students?  Well...how about one where the middle school students try and kill their teacher?\r\nStory (8.08/10): E class, also known as the end class in the prep school of Kunugigaoka Junior high is a place fabled in the school to be the worstclass, housing the worst students in the school, grade-wise.  Here, the students of this fabled \"failure\" are tasked with a rather...unique task, killing this yellow octopus-like...thing who according to him, has turned the moon into a permanent crescent and this coming March, will blow up the earth as well.  Oh boy...that's a situation to be in.\\n\\n\r\nAssassination classroom, or AssClass as a shorthanded was of calling the show, follows the story of the end class as they try and kill their teacher during their first semester in 9th grade.  With every few episodes or so, one or more people in the classroom attempt to assassinate their teacher known as Koro-sensei (literally unkillable teacher in translation), usually ending in failure because this teacher can fly at Mach 20, is resistant towards conventional weapons, and only a particular set of weaknesses that you learn over time.  (Basically the story of \"teacher too OP, GG, plz nerf)\\n\\n\r\nWhile the show focuses pretty heavily on the aspect of killing an alien creature so to say, a lot of the show as well talks about the idea of teaching and comparing that to the idea of assassination.  Because the show is centered around these academically challenged students, the show also emphasizes on their growth as students and a person's learning potential, which actually puts in some pretty good themes.  But don't worry, this show is plenty about trying to kill an octopus, so you don't have to worry about the actually school learning taking over the story.\\n\\n\r\nComedy as well is well done for AssClass as well.  Much of it is done in this style where you get immediate comebacks from various characters as well as that brief, awkward moment to take in what just happened, which I think makes the show relatively fresh me never boring to watch.  Mostly, I think it's in part of Lerche doing the production of this show, but the manga itself is still pretty damn funny, which brings me to my next point.\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of differences to the manga, AssClass the anime focuses its runtime on the events that for the most part, don't focus on one character.  There're a lot of chapters within AssClass that are devoted solely on one student, chapters that give more life to class E.  On account of time constraints, not all of the students that were focused on those chapters are focused in the anime, which is a slight bother that I will bring up later.\\n\\n\r\nOverall though, this adaptation was no bad in the slightest.  The manga was perfectly encapsulated in this anime and I found myself to be laughing just as much as I did when I read it.  As usual with comedy anime, depending on your taste in comedy, this show may or may not suit your liking.\\n\\n\r\nOverview\\n\r\n+ Original story\\n\r\n+ Has some nice themes about learning (using assassination)\\n\r\n+ Good comedy (this can be bad depending on your taste in comedy)\\n\r\n-  Not all students got a featured episode\\n\\n\r\nCharacters (8.33/10): Whenever you're making any comedy anime, the most important part of making memorable comedy is to have memorable characters that you can remember the personalities of to deliver those sweet, sweet jokes that make comedy so good.  Luckily, AssClass succeeds in doing this.\\n\\n\r\nUp first, is our main protagonist of the story, the hero among heroes, the one who will bust our funny bones, Koro-sensei.  You thought it was one of the E class kids?!  No, it's the thing that wants to destroy the earth that's the real hero here.  (Ok, that was a bit contradictory). As I have stated before, Koro-sensei is for the most part, the pathway for the show's comedy. Being a bit of a silly creature that sometimes makes absolutely no sense, Koro-sensei is the most memorable character of this show not only because the show revolves around trying to kill him but because you won't forget him.  Like seriously, it's going to be very hard to forget a yellow, pervy octopus that flies around at Mach 20 speed going Nufufufufu everywhere with a big toothy grin.\\n\\n\r\nAnd then we have class E.  I grouped these characters up together for a few reasons.  One, there're 30+ of them.  I'm not making 30 paragraphs to talk about them, it's too much work.  Two, it's easier to talk about these characters' purpose.  Throughout the show, you do get to know more about class E.  Their names, personalities, and for a couple, how they got put into the end class.  A lot of these characters, namely Nagisa, Kayano, Karma, and a few others are talked about a lot and for the audience, are more well known.  Inversely though, many of the class E characters don't get as well as an introduction as others do.  As a result, many are otherwise unknown or mentioned for a brief second.  Because there're 30+ students, it becomes a challenge to really know the individual characters very well mostly because for the most part, the show treats them all as one unit.  \\n\\n\r\nAs for side characters, the most noticeable ones are the other teachers of the E class, Karasuma and Irina, or, as everyone loves to call her, \"bitch-sensei\".  (If I was lying, these parentheses would be saying something else.). As far as side characters go, these two are the most used and most recognizable, being blessed with roles that have them appear much more often than a standard side character, which makes them better characters overall.  The other side characters for this show serve similar purposes in the memorable department, but mostly only serve to be an obstacle for our class E to overcome.  \\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+ Best teacher. (Nufufufufufu =w=)\\n\r\n+ Great side cast\\n\r\n+ Memorable characters\\n\r\n- Class E was treated as a whole unit rather than 30 some odd characters\\n\\n\r\nArt and sound (8.00/10 and 7.44/10) the art for AssClass was a very brightly done style using a very light gradient that made everything sort of pop.  As well as doing some standard comedic faces for characters and good animation fluidity, the art was rather stable and standard fare.  But...what really stood out for the art for me was being able to pull off the more dark and menacing scenes in the same style.  It gave a sense of eerie feeling when things went dark for a second which I thought was a nice design flourish.  \\n\\n\r\nAlso, Lerche managed to squeeze in the symbolism for various characters from the manga into the anime itself, so good on you.  \\n\\n\r\nIn terms of sound, I didn't really find the soundtrack to be all that memorable.  I would describe it as fun more than anything else, not really a masterpiece.  As a show with 2 OP tracks that had a similar feel to both of them, I wouldn't say I didn't enjoy them, but I didn't think they'd were completely stellar by any stretch of the imagination.  Ed song was tranquil but didn't stick in my head.  Though I will give props for that creepy track whenever a realization happens.  That was a nice touch.\\n\\n\r\nOverview\\n\r\n+ Bright art\\n\r\n+ Menacing scenes looked great in the artstyle\\n\r\n+ Decent soundtrack\\n\r\n-  Soundtrack to me wasn't memorable\\n\\n\r\nPersonal Enjoyment (9.09/10):  While I did have some issues with various parts of the show, I'll be honest, it didn't matter, cause this was a fun watch.  I was skeptical of the AssClass series when this started airing, but after checking out the manga (and marathon read that for 6 weeks), I can't say I wasn't pleased to read/watch this series.\\n\\n\r\nDid I like this anime?\\n\\n\r\nYes.  I think this anime was a great adaptation of the AssClass manga.  There were no shortcuts aside from the student chapters, and everything was told just how it was without any unnecessary changes.  It was great to see some of my favorite scenes in animated form.  \\n\\n\r\nWhat didn't I like about this anime?  \\n\\n\r\nWhile the manga itself didn't make note of all the kids by the period of time where the anime ends, there were still some kids that had hi lighted chapters for them, which inversely, wasn't transported to the anime.  It made the students more individual and it felt unfair to see only some not all got animated, because some character jokes and gags don't really make much sense unless you actually know the whole character.\\n\\n\r\nWould I recommend this anime?  \\n\\n\r\nIn terms of comedy, I would say it is  one of the better ones to come out in recent times.  It has a fun, 22 episode runtime, there're great and memorable characters in there, and there is a method behind the madness.  The only major issue I have is that the jokes pertaining to a certain character don't always get translated well, so some things might be hit or miss.  But apart from that little bug, I give this show. Solid...B+, for effort\\n\\n\r\nOverall Score: 8.05/10",

            "content": "Naivety...children are overflown with it. However, naivety is a word with its meaning brought forth from grownups. What if naivety holds a nobility grownups can no longer understand, what if what you sometime used to know was all you actually had to...yes, E-gumi not fully experiencing the harshness of life could be called naive, them naive or those who called them  naive, incapable.  \r\nAnsatsu Kyoushitsu is not anime which aims to cultivate one's inner world or lay forth philosophical notions for one to ponder over, Ansatsu Kyoushitsu is a fun, comical and extremely enjoyable anime with that bright side of naivety being theonly worthy moral to reap from it.\\n\\n\r\nI got surprised by how unique and at the same time trite the story was, only to realize afterwards that originality in the story, characters or plot is not where the anime wants to focus, but the manner it will\\n\r\npresent them...\\n\r\nWe have our usual Japanese high school, and a class of misfits handled by an unusual teacher. Much like\\n\r\nGreat Teacher Onizuka, or at least sharing the same core. Koro sensei...he is  yellow, of unidentified species and flawless from more or less every aspect, but most of all, he is E-class' assassination target.\\n\r\nAnsatsu Kyoushitsu doesn't have a strong story, and even though the adventure part is serious, the anime as a whole has more of a comical appeal. It won't be long before the word assassination loses the awe it initially provoked, and at the very least by episode five you will realize that the only thing you won't fully know or expect from the anime-as it doesn't have much unexpected or hidden things-is the reason why Koro sensei involved himself with E-gumi. So, basically, you will have lots of fun as the class trains and at the same time attempts to assassinate its resourceful teacher, bonding stronger in every attempt. And fun is all you will get, in case you want complexity, originality-even though Ansatsu Kyoushitsu is like no other anime I've watched-suspense, hardcore adventure and seriousness, Ansatsu will fail you.\\n\r\nAlthough, it has its incredibly vivid art to make up for it,its cheerful and rhythmic openings, the amazing ending most people who like Japanese music will end up downloading, and lastly, a limited few of notable \\n\r\nand distinguishable characters. In fact, the range of characters is not exactly wide, and aside the two main and a few supporting, it is highly unlikely that you will remember the names of the rest. \\n\r\nThe anime progresses smoothly and pleasantly, only getting dark and heavy at a part or two with minor duration. All in all, it is rare for an anime with assassination as its theme to not be influencing negatively, but lifting your mood instead. Ansatsu will not leave a vivid impact on you, however the memory of watching it will be a happy one as it is from the anime that make you smile while watching.\\n\\n\r\nMy personal opinion, is that Ansatsu does not have much room for development, all the more, it should be short and worthwhile. The second season though, will be a thing to look forward to as the one thing it has to reveal has not been revealed yet.\\n",

            "content": "Usually I do not bother myself with writing negative review (this is actually a common MAL trend as reviews are usually written by fans) as  I have more or less good understanding of why tv in question are so popular despite being bad in my eyes. But this one is a total mystery for me. \r\nIt is pretty easy to split this tv  in 3 independent \"themes\" and analyze them separately:\r\n1. Class needs to kill their teacher in order to save the world. \r\nSounds fun huh? But it was not.\r\nI expected a lot of cunning assassination schemes, clever traps, constant progress in methodsbut alas - nothing of it. After few mediocre direct attempts to kill no one in class cares about it anymore,  and story is shifted towards normal school live show + occasional pro-killer come to do the same dumb direct attempts to kill which is never gonna work by setting design (and therefore boring to watch). The lack of creativity is astonishing, I can't believe it was possible to do such a boring write-up with such potentially-reach material on hands.\\n\r\nDefinitely a weakest part of the show. If you were primary  interesting in this part - skip this show. \\n\\n\r\nScore: 2/10\\n\\n\r\n2. Class E is a class of problem children. School system is a bit evil. Classical story about making misfits into nice persons via solving their problems.\\n\\n\r\nThe show is struggle to find a right  balance between assassinations and telling sad stories of the students. Both parts feels like incomplete attempts. But at least this part is done in more or less standard fashion. The bad part of it is the teacher character - he is very one-dimensional. He doesn't feel like a real person with any depth, and the main reason for it is a comedic relief. They wanted a comedy show similar to GTO, I assume. But while Onizuka provided plenty of fun while being a solid character which you can relate to, our teaches is just a clown with nothing to back him up. To make it worse variety of jokes are very limited and after 3-4 series you watched them all and they were not fun to begin with. This is huge letdown as show relies on it very heavily.\\n\\n\r\nScore: If if take GTO as 10 than this show would be around 4/10.\\n\\n\r\n3. Main plot aka who is Mr Teacher, why he needs to destroy earth, who is behind all of this  etc.\\n\r\nProbably the best part of the show, unfortunately show is dragged into second season therefore there are no answers and overall amount of plot content is abysmal. The best way to describe this series would be - filler, slow paced, repetitive, quite boring and a bit absurdic. It really feels like you watch worst part of a good show.\\n\\n\r\nScore: N/A, all in second season.\\n\\n\\n\r\nConclusion: While I expect second season to be much better, I still believe it is not worth to struggle trough 22 episodes of filler material.\\n\r\nWith 12  episodes format it would be so-so, but 22 puts it beyond salvation. And as  it was released alongside with pretty solid tiles - I see no reason to pay any attention to it.",

            "content": "I began to watch this anime thinking it would be both entertaining and interesting. It's not that I expected that much of this anime, but I have never been this disappointed in my life. Every episode I prayed to God that the agony would finally stop, but it didn't. I guess God gives and God takes. And he took the pleasure of living by presenting this shitty anime.\r\nThe first five minutes were quite interesting, as the plot was still in development. Some tentacle guy blew up the moon and threatens to blow op the earth unless he gets to teach some drop-out high school kidsto and train them to kill him. As I'm typing this I begin to wonder why I didn't stop watching after the first five minutes. This was the whole plot btw. In the other 21 episodes nothing happens. At all. Not even fanservice. \\n\\n\r\n- Spoilers: - The ending was entire shit. It turned out he turns invincible for a day if he wants to. Also the deadly poison of which everyone would die wasn't actually poison. \\n\r\nBut the most excruciating part of the plot, the part where I actually had to pause the last episode and think for a second about what the writers were thinking, was the part where our trans-gendered main character Nagisa actually tries to kill a man. This was unbelievable, I've finally watched to the point in an assassination anime where someone gets killed, and the whole class and teacher say 'No don't do it Nagisa killing is wrong!'. Can you believe this shit? I can't even start explaining why I raged so hard.\\n\r\nNow, if there is no plot, can the characters save this anime? The answer: No. The only decent character is the 2D waifu tactical warfare robot machine from Norway, everyone else has a generic background of failing their school exams for arbitrary reasons. Also, even though they failed every exams ever, everyone in the class is actually a genius with IQ's over 130 and ace every test if they feel like it.\\n\r\nHowever, there may be a target audience for this anime. If you're a teacher, there may be some useful tips 'hidden' in every episode. If you pay attention, more than half of every episode contains a long and in-depth preach about the secret techniques of teaching and the inner workings of children's minds.\\n\r\nThe art and sound were ok I guess. Nothing special, nothing as shit as the rest of the anime.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I was very disappointed and I feel like I wasted a part of my life watching this abomination.\\n\r\nEven writing a review about it made me cry inside, but I wanted to warn everyone else out there expecting something great because of everyone rating it 9/10\\n\\n\r\nBut the question remains... is Nagisa really a guy? No one knows",

The story is divided in many arcs, where the 26 students and a fucking robot, will try to kill the teacher. The problem with this is that it's fucking predictable when it focuses on killing the teacher. When, basically, the tentacle monster is leading the show with a few other students and is also over-powered, you don't think they'll kill him off easily, huh? Considering that the show was announced to have a second season and the manga is currently still ongoing, you pretty much know what's gonna happen every time that they get really close to killing the tentacle monster, Koro Sensei, so you really end up not caring. I mean, right from the start, you can tell that they aren't gonna kill Koro Sensei at any time soon; you already know exactly what's gonna happen and it's gonna frustrate you every time they get close to killing him. How do you solve this? Making your arcs interesting and not focusing on only killing Koro Sensei, which AssClass does quite well.\\n\\n\r\nAssClass does drift apart from the actual plot, to introducing other villains and many characters. Even though, some of them aren't really as good as the rest, it was the best way to go before it got predictable as it was in the beginning. So yes, the show does pick up after a few episodes. I found the beginning to be a rough start, but it got better along the way. Even though the plot isn't really all that good, it does its best at not completely going to shit. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters are rather hard to talk about because there are so many. I won't be covering every single character. \\n\r\nKoro Sensei is pretty much the most entertaining character in the series. There are many questions about his character that still go unanswered, that will hopefully be answered in season 2, as I've heard from a lot of manga readers. His character isn't really what you would call \"great\", but it's definitely the one that keeps it interesting. \\n\\n\r\nNagisa is the biggest trap there is. He's probably the smartest out of all the students, and let me remind that there's a fucking robot as one of the students. He's smart, energetic and thinks out of the box in order to kill Koro Sensei. \\n\r\nHis character is the one that had the most potential to be great and have a great development, and don't get me wrong, it wasn't bad, but it could've been way better. By the end of the series, I didn't felt like he grew much. We don't even know much about him, he's just a badass with potential, and hopefully he will improve in season 2. \\n\\n\r\nThe other characters aren't really worth mentioning. No, they're not bad, they're just there. I'll give credit to the plot for actually being a bit original. Yes, it might sound like a bit of a stretch at first, but it all it fits pretty well, even with its few plot holes. The characters aren't really original, they all follow feel like other characters I've seen many times, and makes them feel very one-dimensional. They do try to develop some of the characters, but the only ones I can give credit for actually doing something with them are Nagisa and Karma, which is a red hair psychopath that had a great introduction, but was barely shown ever again. He does have a different point of view by the end of the show, but boy, was it predictable. I couldn't find myself caring about any of the characters, which is a bit bad for a show that has many characters. You don't have to develop all of them, but at least try to make me care for, I dunno, more than one. I'm just hoping that they flesh out some of the characters in the next season, because this one didn't do it for me.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is pretty solid and I was pretty impressed with a lot of the show had to offer with some scenes. The backgrounds sometimes looked terrible and sometimes they looked pretty decent. Nothing was outstanding, but nothing was bad, other than some of the backgrounds, especially when it takes places out doors. I should mention that this was animated by Lerche, which is pretty new to the community. The next thing that they'll be animating will be Gakkou Gurashi this Summer, which I'm actually pretty excited to watch. Hopefully they won't fuck up. \\n\\n\r\nThe character designs weren't too bad, but followed the hair color thing to keep you from getting confused on which character is which. Remember guys, if you can't remember the name, just call them by the color of the hair.\\n\r\n The outlines of the characters were quite a bit annoying and reminded me of the outlines in Attack on Titan, which annoyed me, as well. Nothing really impressed me, but it didn't left a bad taste in my mouth. \\n\\n\r\nThe cinematography was rather average, but it did impressed me with some of the action scenes. This being a shounen, I wasn't expecting it to take such a different tone in camera angels. It was a bit refreshing, but other than the fight scenes, it was pretty average. \\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack fits rather well in the show. The songs played in the perfect time to set up a tone in the show. When it wanted to be serious, it had serious music, when it wanted to be goofy, it had goofy music, and so on. The opening is a bit awkward and can get stuck in your head. The second opening is more of the same, but the 2nd Ending song was actually quite impressive and I never found myself really skipping it. The 1st Ending song is just average.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, if you feel like watching a pretty entertaining anime about killing a tentacle monster involved with no hentai (kinda), then by all means, go watch AssClass. If it doesn't seem to interest you, I suggest you at least give it a try, because you might end up liking it more than me. It has its good and it has its bad. If I had to score AssClass, I would give it a 5.5/10 or a 6/10.\\n\\n\r\nI recommend you at least give the first episode a try and I'm hoping that Lerche can handle Gakkou Gurashi rather well. Hopefully Lerche will also step their game up with AssClass in the second season, as well. \\n\\n",

            "content": "\u201cAssassination is education. The sensei of the Assassination Classroom becomes stronger as he teaches.\u201d \u2013 Koro-sensei \r\nIn Assassination Classroom (Ansatsu Kyoushitsu), education is assassination, and assassination is education, to learn is to assassinate, and to assassinate is to learn.\r\nClass 3-E is not an ordinary clich\u00e9d school classroom, instead of pencils and calculators, we get knives and guns. Yes, Assassination Classroom is not your ordinary school comedy anime. It diverges and expands through the norms, and it transforms into something of utmost originality and uniqueness.\r\n(Disclaimer: this is going to be quite a long review, so hopefully you can bare with it!?)\r\nThe setting of the show revolvesaround Class 3-E, a group of students of a prestigious school named Kunugigaoka Junior High School, and is perceived as inferior, being the lowest class of the institution. However, at the same time, Class E is also the location of the government\u2019s confidential assassination scheme on Koro-sensei, the monstrous looking octopus-like being who has threatened to destroy Earth after teaching Class 3-E for a year. Being able to move at a speed of Mach 20, Koro-sensei is almost able to do anything at will, travel anywhere and even teach his students effectively individually with his speed. His advanced capabilities and powers make assassination a difficult challenge for the students, and ultimately show the indomitability of the human spirit, the resilience of the class, and their increasingly strengthening determination of the students to strive for success after experiencing defeat and failure. \\n\\n\r\nAssassination Classroom has one of the most unique and original stories out there amongst the anime and manga industry, and is able to utilise its main theme of assassination and education to its utmost benefit, to achieve development and characterisation within its particularly large cast, and to manifest as well, many other notable themes such as the value of friendship, class and discrimination, failure and defeat, and human perseverance. \\n\r\nMost of the episodes in Assassination Classroom contain many underlying didactic and moral powerful life lessons, and these are not only in the form of motivation, but also inspiration. With Koro-sensei helping the students out in both their actual education, and in their assassination attempts, the students are able to learn many values and life-changing lessons from their \u201cteacher\u201d and \u201ctarget\u201d whilst conducting the assassination attempts as well, and as this exchange benefits both parties, the relationship between both the teacher/target and the students/assassins are able to strengthen and develop. Many of the students have their own problems, be it their personality, or their background and upbringing, through assassination and education, Koro-sensei is able to aid these students individually as well, to seek out their troubles, and to bring good into them and show them the beauty of their lives and the bonds they encompass. \\n\\n\r\nWithout a doubt, with assassination as the central theme of the show, it is this that allows immense room for the characters to learn and understand more about each other, about Koro-sensei, and ultimately, permits characters to grow both individually and together collectively. Not only do the students learn from Koro-sensei, but at the same time, Koro-sensei is also able to learn from the students, forging trust and bonds between the two in Class 3-E. \\n\\n\r\nThe show however takes a very risky step regarding its diverse and large cast with more than 20 students, and 3 teachers. With limited screen time, it is inevitable that not only some characters are unrecognizable, but also some of the characters will lack the necessary screen time to properly convey their backstories and personalities and may thus be deemed as \u201cless important\u201d or trivial. Despite this noticeable flaw with the enormous cast, it is not only each individual that compose the cast, but instead it is all of the characters collectively that the characters are able to grow as a class. Unless specific students are the central focus of an episode and in the assassination attempt, they are left forgettable and are overshadowed by the more noticeable and outstanding characters such as Nagisa and Karma. \\n\\n\r\nShiota Nagisa is the central protagonist amongst Class-E and is often a calm and friendly person. Perhaps, it is also necessary to point out that Nagisa is the best trap. He occasionally takes on the role of an observer and narrator and is cautious in every situation. He is also very meticulous and diligent to exploring every detail of Koro-sensei\u2019s himself in order to aid future assassination attempts. Although calm on the outside, some scenes showcase Nagisa\u2019s inner-assassin potential and it is his calmness that makes him unique as an assassin as he is shown having the innate ability to hide his bloodlust.\\n\\n\r\nAkabane Karma is another prominent student within Class-E and is not only one of the most intelligent, cunning and witty in the class, but also one of the smartest in the entire school. Although he has a rather sadistic personality and likes to torture his opponents, Karma has a positive mindset, and also has good morals behind his intentions. He is known for being a delinquent and troublesome violator in the school, and has lost respect for adults after being betrayed by his most trusted homeroom teacher prior arriving Class 3E. However, it is because of his inner-caring personality and moral mindset that he was placed in Class E as he rescued a senior from being bullied by students of the main building. Even though he may seem to be extremely smart and a genius in assassination, he has a tendency to be overconfident, arrogant and lazy at times, hindering his ability to develop further. However, Koro-sensei realises this and after Karma received a \u201cdefeat\u201d in their confrontation with Class A, and fell in the academic rankings, Koro-sensei made it clear to Karma that he needs to abandon his overconfident self, and accept improvement because defeat ultimately incites growth, unlocking Karma\u2019s potential as both a student and an assassin. \\n\\n\r\nIt's these simple didactic and inspiring lessons that allows us watchers to also feel sympathy for the characters and at the same time, allows us to comprehend the true meaning of defeat, perseverance and the relationships the characters share together. Although reality may be harsh and dejected, one must always work his way through and persevere in order to achieve improvement\u2013 that is the glory and advantage of mankind.\\n\\n\r\nAlthough only glimpses of Koro-sensei\u2019s past have been shown in the anime, it is this enigma of his character that allows suspense to fill the watchers\u2019 minds, and keep watching further to truly understand Koro-sensei\u2019s underlying motives behind \u201cdestroying\u201d the world after a year of teaching. Koro-sensei is extremely humble, talented, and funnily enough, quite perverted. He cares for his students, not only about their education, but also their skills in the field of assassination as well as their own personal individual lives. It\u2019s truly teachers like these that these students are able to grow so fast and so much both academically and as an assassin, and have a widened outlook on their lives. Although Class E may be ostracized from the main school and the higher-up classes, there is no discrimination in Class E itself after all, the class itself is almost like a family, with close bonds interconnected through each other being peers of another in a group of assassins. Even as the students love Koro-sensei and understand that he genuinely cares for them, they know that they have to still carry out their assassination because that is the initial reason of Koro-sensei joining the class, and also, the planet is being threatened to being destroyed.\\n\\n\r\nKarasuma, is another one of Class E\u2019s teachers, a highly skilled agent sent by the Ministry of Defense. He is strict but also aids into developing the assassination skills of the students, and eventually become bonded with the class as well despite his stoic and dense personality, and suppressing his emotions because of his profession. It is also undeniable that there is a small degree of fanservice appeal brought by bitch-sensei, Irina, but again this revolves around the whole theme of assassination and is also manifestation of her assassination skills. Nevertheless, she also grows along with the rest of the students as well as Koro-sensei and Karasuma-sensei.\\n\\n\r\nThe comedy is extremely well done. Ranging from Koro-sensei\u2019s ridiculousness and his admiration for erotic magazines, to Karma\u2019s sadistic torturing methods of sticking chilli and spicy paste into someone\u2019s nostrils, the majority of the humour derives from the main central plot of assassination, and just goes to show how immense of a theme this is and how much it can develop the show.  \\n\\n\r\nUnlike the bland special of Assassination Classroom that was animated by Brain\u2019s Base in 2013, Lerche takes Assassination Classroom to a whole new level through its distinct art style. The art style makes use of conspicuous shadows, bold borders and outlines to highlight and define each individual character. The backgrounds also look nice and are vibrant when it needs to be, and dark when it needs to be as well. The details of objects look precise through the neat and clear art. Ultimately, the anime is able to bring out the manga\u2019s great art to life, if not, even better, taking it to a new level. The animation involved in showcasing Koro-sensei\u2019s super speed and the subsequent surrounding environment looks phenomenal and very fluid, bringing Koro-sensei to life. \\n\\n\r\nSound wise, both openings \u2018Seishun Satsubatsu-ron\u2019 and \u2018Jiriki Hongan Revolution\u2019 fit the show perfectly. Being upbeat and lively, the music itself pumps you up for the episode before it starts and brightens up the atmosphere. Visually, they involve the introduction of the characters of Class E and feature the characters dancing in a very comical manner which I definitely love and find hilarious. The soundtrack is also used appropriately most of the time, using suspenseful music at suspenseful moments, sentimental tracks at the more sympathetic scenes, as well as a short electronic/techno sounding track during thrilling moments such as when Ritsu analyses the floor plan during the hotel infiltration. \\n\\n\r\nThe ending song itself \u2018Hello, shooting-star\u2019 by moumoon is a masterpiece and depicts a more emotional approach to the show with its lighthearted and sentimental tone. The visuals are stunning utilising a chalkboard and chalks to visualise the ending song with its characters. For me, every time this ending plays I never skip it, and instead, I envision what it would be like if Koro-sensei were to actually be killed, and how emotional it would truly be. \\n\\n\r\nWith a second season confirmed in production, we can expect to see more intriguing arcs, more suspenseful moments, as well as increasingly more characterisation and story development as the show unfolds itself.\\n\\n\r\nUndoubtedly, Assassination Classroom diverges from the ordinary anime, and transforms norms into a show that is original, unique and creative. Through the central plot, the show is able to merge both assassination and education to develop the cast as a whole, manifest individual growth and exhibit the interlinking bonds of the class. Not only this, but this is a show that truly allows you to learn from its many underlying didactic messages as well, both subtle and explicit. And I certainly recommend everyone to try out Assassination Classroom at some point because this is a show that has shown me both inspiration and motivation.\\n",

            "content": "Confession: I originally rated this 8/10 when it first came out nearly three years ago. I enjoyed it, but didn't love it. I thought it was clever and funny, but it didn't really stick with me. \r\nBut with the stress of university exams and life expectations, I've been rewatching a lot of old shows I'd once forgot about and I realized something about Assassination Classroom that I somehow failed to see the first time around: This show is kind of freaking perfect. \r\nSUMMARY: \r\nYou've probably heard the basic synopsis of this show a million times before, but I'll recap it real quick for you anyway.Basically, Assassination Classroom revolves around a class of third-year middle school kids who have, for all intents and purposes, been deemed the \"losers of the End Class\" as part of some social hierarchy cultivated by their prestigious school's villainous principal. These kids are mocked and demeaned by the other students, hidden away in a small shack on a mountain away from the main campus -- and if that wasn't enough, they've been tasked with learning to be assassins to kill their giant, tentacled \"teacher\" who is unconventional in every way and happens to have a top speed of Mach 20. If they don't manage to kill him in one year, he's going to blow up the earth like he blew up the moon. \\n\\n\r\nSounds weird to you? You're right -- it IS weird. But it's also hilarious, ridiculously clever, and wholly original while managing to hit all your favourite archetypes in the best possible way. \\n\\n\r\nAnd, NO. Just because there's a tentacle monster and a big-breasted English teacher does not mean this is hentai. Get your head out of the gutter. This is so far from hentai, I should take y'all to church just for thinking it. \\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS: \\n\r\nThe best part of this anime is by far the amazing cast of characters. First, we have Nagisa Shiota, our awkward, unassuming, and ridiculously adorable narrator of sorts, who has a slightly androgynous appearance that makes for hilarious gags where his best friends like to dress him up as a girl, and he has a low self-esteem without being the pitiable fool they often cast in any sort of SOL/harem anime (which this definitely isn't). He may seem adorably defenseless and sweet like a newborn puppy, but when it comes to assassination, he's a natural born pro -- and not in an unrealistic OP way where it doesn't fit with his character. He may not be the best fighter and he's definitely not the strongest, but he has a killer instinct which is masked by his utter adorableness that stuns both his classmates and the audience again and again in really cool fight scenes and assassination attempts. If you dislike Nagisa, I dislike you. It's that simple. Don't hate my baby. \\n\\n\r\nThen there's Karma Akabane, everyone's favourite sociopath. He's ruthless, intelligent, and indisputably the best in his class. Watching him direct his teammates during complicated battle strategies and assassinations is nothing short of captivating. His cleverness and ability to foresee anything is incredible, and the way he is able to remain calm and condescending in almost every situation is the perfect compliment to his sarcastic back-talk and hilarious sadistic tendencies, a lot of which tend to revolve around teasing Nagisa. (Warning: Their bromance is freaking adorable.) \\n\\n\r\nOf course, we can't forget Koro-sensei! He's big, he's yellow, he's a bit of a perv -- he also happens to be the teacher everyone wishes they had and a surprising tugger of heartstrings. I don't want to write much about him without spoiling, so let me just say that while he may initially seem like an octopus pervert meant for comic relief and plot direction, he's much more than that. A LOT more than that. \\n\\n\r\nBut here's the thing: Those three may be listed as the \"main\" characters, but they definitely aren't the only ones you'll love. The cast here is huge and hilarious and individual and fun. While I have a ridiculous love for Nagisa, Karma, and Koro-sensei, so many of the other people in Class 3-E also managed to steal my heart, like poor Prince Charming Isogai, beautiful yet nondescript class idol Kanzaki, and SFA Karasama whose main purpose is supposed to be to teach the kids assassination techniques but is really to add a swoon factor for both the audience and Professor Bitch. I could individually describe every single one of them, but I don't want this review to turn into a gushing novel so I'll spare you my inner nerd. \\n\\n\r\nLarge casts are usually a hit or miss with me. You tend to like some characters and hate others, but here, I was a hog. I wanted them all. They all had their quirks, their strengths, and their weaknesses, and the way they interacted as a class was hilarious and perfect and fun. They complimented each other and stood out from each other, and let me just say that two seasons with these rascals was nowhere near enough to satisfy me. \\n\\n\r\nOVERALL: \\n\r\nWatch this show. Seriously, watch it. I don't waste my time writing reviews for just anything -- or at all -- but this show made me so damn happy and full of giggles that I just had to share the love. So you should watch it then come befriend me so we can gush over it together.",

True, the main character might look girlish, weak and elementary school, he is actually very strong. \r\nThe plot is simply amazing and fulfilling all aspects that I enjoy watching. They were very detailed and the jokes/comedy moments softened the serious moments, making it even more enjoyable. \r\nThe Art is splendid, so if you are getting tired of finding anime with art like One Piece(no offense), you can try this. \r\nThe character development is also fascinating.It is neatly done and there aren't really any holes in them.\\n\r\nSo all in all, I am giving this a ten! Plus, it has a second season so I didn't have to go anime hunting that soon after the first season. \\n\r\nSo if you are not sure or on the edge, just trust me and give the first few episodes a try. You will enjoy it if you like Mystery, Action, and Fights.  Or Highschool settings.",

Well, the plot was really unique and quite frankly I kinda like the idea behind it. But, on a moral basis, the plot was really twisted where one can't imagine that class 3E of Kunugigaoka Junior High School were trainto develop killer instinct which come with the training of the antagonist and the teachers, so the story itself was very much crazy and not much of any sense in even if it was meant as entertainment. \\n\\n\\n\r\nMy verdict: A poor 3.\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt \\n\\n\r\nBasically I would have give it a 2 since the anime itself still follows the usual cliche of MC's having their own uniform designed, I mean really Nagisa has to be this bishonen with female features, geeez now why didn't author Matsui, Yuusei portrayed him as a cute bishojo instead of a bishonen? Also , I kinda hate Karma having his own coat color instead of wearing his school's standard grey. Then again the silver lining here is Bitch sensei were she is as hot as hell, still I'm not much impress with this anime's art even in it's manga form.....then again the live version is as worse as the anime and manga combine.\\n\\n\r\nMy verdict: A poor 3\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\\n\r\nI gonna give a high score for the opening OST which is \u201cSeishun Satsubatsuron\u201d and \"\"Jiriki Hongan Revolution\" by 3-nen E-Gumi Utatan.\\n\\n\r\nSo my verdict: An outstanding 10.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter\\n\\n\r\nI'm only gonna focus on those who made an impact into this anime, since I haven't gone with the manga yet.\\n\\n\r\nKoro-sensei, if you look at him he was really portrayed as a funny antagonist , but unlike other antagonist he's one antagonist that one would love, ok so he gonna destroy earth just like what he did with the moon, big deal. Also, what make his character special was that it wasn't something that one needs to worry about- I mean his character in general is something that one wouldn't care whether he get's killed or not. You might say that the class of 3E are more annoying than Koro sensei.\\n\\n\r\nNagisa Shiota, ok so wtf did author Matsui, Yuusei made him into a boy with female features we'll never know, what I do know was that I really dislike him also, I really hate how his character was being exaggerated an innocent boy with a very deadly killer instinct.If author Matsui, Yuusei have made him a girl then his character would have added a good femme fetal into the whole series which was too bad.\\n\\n\\n\r\nKarma Akabane, I kinda like that he plays as this quintessential talking trash guy who can deliver, but, one part of me wants to see him gets owned by bigger guys which it did, but still hated him in the few episodes of the anime where he get's to owned a profession killer who was trying to get him. However it was rather unfortunate that he didn't get to duke out with the main antagonist Akira Takaoka where in my opinion would have also give this anime a good climax.\\n\\n\r\nAkira Takaoka, ok so he is the quintessential antagonist that one would love to hate, but I kind hate it that he never went it for the kill when he faced Nagisa for the second time where his character really did fall short of what was expected of him. And I always wanted to see him duke out with Karma.\\n\\n\r\nIrina \"Bitch-sensei\" Jelavi\u0107, ok so kinda like her for being this quintessential bimbo, then again that's what she is an eye candy of this anime.\\n\\n\r\nTadaomi Karasuma, if Bitch sensei is the eye candy for this anime then that make him the quintessential guy who just looks around and manages, you know I'd wsih that he and Bitch sensei would have a serious relationship, where either he kills her or she kills him kind of thing.\\n\\n\r\nSo my verdict: a good 7.\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment\\n\\n\r\nThe enjoyment part here wasn't whether the 3e class would be able to kill Koro sensei or what, the enjoyment stems as to how the next episode would go, it might not be boring , but the experience of watching it was that it wasn't something that one would expect something to happen to Koro sensei, but what would the kids of class 3E would be up to... or what would anybody be up to to get Koro sensei for that matter.\\n\\n\r\nMy verdict: good 7.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall\\n\\n\r\nIt maybe enjoyable, but definitely not for kids ages 12 and below, since there is no moral lesson in it , just random streaks of kids form 3E who are up to something to Koro sensei, other than that , there isn't much. \\n\\n\r\nMy final verdict: a decent 4.\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "8.8/10\r\nIn my own opinion, this is one of my favourite winter anime of 2015.\r\nTo start off, the story was very intriguing. After all, it has an octopus teacher capable of destroying 70% of the moon. The fact that junior high kids were also trained to be assassins really struck a chord with me. I thought it was quite an original story, and I have never watched an anime like this. However, some characters do not develop as much as I would have liked. The creators did develop most of the important characters such as Nagisa, Karma, and a few other characters, meanwhile the rest ofthe class stayed rather stagnant in terms of developing, and we only learn one or two things about them. The villains were also well created, giving them an authentic feel. They aren't average villains who would rob a bank, but would instead create plots that would prove to be a large problem for 3-E. One problem that I saw, though, was the comedy proved to be a bit repetitive and annoying.\\n\\n\r\nThe art style was great. In terms of quality, it was very good, with clear lines and defined faces. They make some lines on a characters' face thicker, which creates an excellent effect. It was a very refreshing art style, and none of the characters looked out of place in the classroom.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack and sound effect of this anime were excellent. The music has a very unique sound to it and really helps to set the mood. Whether it be a happy moment, or an intense moment, the soundtrack was great and I personally loved the way it sounded. It added more emphasis to any scene, especially the ones that had darker moments. The sound effects sounded natural and not artificial.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter development was a bit slow, and the director only developed a few main characters. I would have liked to see Koro-sensei develop more, but he didn't really say anything about his past. At best, there were a few flashbacks, but that was it. Karasuma and Irina don't develop much as well, but seeing both of them change to adapt to the conditions that were set in the classroom was very interesting. I enjoyed seeing Nagisa and Karma develop. When you first look at Nagisa, since he was in 3-E, he was often made fun of. But throughout the anime, you slowly start to see him develop into more and more of an assassin. Karma's development became really evident in the second half of the anime. I really enjoyed seeing his character change, and personally, he is my favorite character.\\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed watching this anime. I have rewatched it, and I enjoyed every second of it. I waited for Friday to come so I could watch it. However, after the 11th episode, it stopped coming out temporarily, before resuming again. \\n\r\nOverall, I really liked this anime. it was great, with an original story, great soundtrack, and a unique array of characters. I only wish that there was more developing of the story and characters.",

            "content": "While the anime came out a few years back, I have only gotten around to watching Assassination Classroom recently. I felt EXTREMELY compelled to write a review on the show after deciding to drop it.\r\nI find that a way to describe Assassination Classroom (at least, in a way I believe to be accurate), it to imagine a piece of paper that has \"GOOD CONCEPT\" written on it in black marker. Then, imagine handing that piece of paper to a toddler with a box of sharpies and telling them to go hog wild. Eventually, you cant even read the original phrase because it is just coveredin nonsense.\\n\\n\r\nGENERAL OPINION:\\n\r\nI was drawn to Assassination Classroom for its concept. The idea of a classroom of kids trying to kill their (somehow charming) alien teacher before he destroys the planet is exciting, and dare I say, unique! The design seemed okay, the characters seemed okay- nothing appeared like it was below average quality. My opinion at the start of the show followed this belief too.\\n\\n\r\nBut eventually, the scribbled-on-paper mess appeared before me. Assassination Classroom has one HELL of a plot going on... so why does almost 1/4th of the episodes not even develop it? This season is FULL of filler episodes, none really adding any progress to the students goal of killing their teacher OR even adding to character development. To me, it felt as though I had been watching for an hour when only 1 episode had gone by. Everything was so agonizingly slow (both slow to develop and slow to even unfold the events in each episode). \\n\\n\r\nI would like to mention that I do not mind shows that are slow and take time to unfold, such as Steins;Gate. BUT, unlike most shows that use this strategy, Assassination Classroom fails to even try and keep the viewer anticipating what will happen at the end of the buildup. It is honestly wasted episode time that could be spent in so many better ways.\\n\\n\r\nOPENING:\\n\r\nNot to be /that/ guy, but the first OP is one of the worst ones I have ever heard. The lyrics are quite cute, since they have all to do with the actual theme of the show, but but but the music itself just... does not flow right. It does not \"hype me up\" or get me into the \"mood\" for the show. Unless the point of it was to make me get to the show faster by skipping it, the OP could have easily been anything else and would have been better.\\n\\n\r\nSIDENOTE: \\n\r\nWhile this is not a legit critique of the show, it completely bothered me how happy the students were 99% of the time during the show. It seemed like every time they failed to kill their teacher, and were therefore one day closer to LITERALLY DYING, they all would just laugh the event off and pull a \"teehee haha sensei youre just too good! Back to math time!\". WHY are none of the actual students bothered in the slightest by this! WHY is everybody just so calm about their impending doom! okay thats all\\n\\n\r\nRATING:\\n\r\nI decided to give this show a 5 because I will recognize the fact that this show has been admired highly by most people, so there must be some appeal to it that only I am not catching onto. It was not the worst anime I have seen, but it has so far been the only anime I have decided was so bad I had to drop.   \\n\\n\r\nThanks for reading :)",

            "content": "Disclaimer : this is the second anime I watched, so I won't be objective in this review. And btw I'm french, tell me if I wrote total bullshit somewhere :p\r\n  I really enjoyed watching this anime after a friend told me to watch it, and as he told me, I cried several times.\r\n  About the writing of this show, I can't really tell if the best point is the story of the characters. Although I found it was a little long to start and introduce the characters - which I'll tell why it isn't totally a bad point - the sory kept mein suspense as much as I watched it in only 3 days, and I couldn't stop between two episodes. Furthermore, talking about this with my sister (who I told to watch it just after I finished the show) gave me chills just by understanding some pionts I didn't get at the first watching. Aboout the characters, I succeeded to remember the main names after only 3 episodes - which is for me a real miracle - and that shows how much they are endearing.\\n\\n\r\n  However, this show isn't good only thanks to its writing, but especially its animanion made with the greatest of care. Only looking at the second opening of the first season gives you a showcase of Lerche's best work. And then you see the second half of the second season and understand why I gave it 8. I didn't give a better note because, like in every series, middle-season episodes' animation is good but not outstanding.\\n\\n\r\n  Well as it's my first review I don't really know how to finish it, but all I'm going to tell you is to watch it if you didn't, and rewatch it two or three times, until you see all the easter-eggs - 'cause there are plenty of them.",

The name itself will elicit your own ideas of what this show might be but you soon find out how dead wrong you were! What makes this even more special is when you realize how easily this storytelling could have failed! You start with the basic setup of an octopus like creature blowing up the moon and now threatens to do the same to Earth. A deal is then made for him to become a teacher of aclass with failed students where he will teach them as well as train them in assassination. He comes to be known as Korosensei by the class after providing military with a special material that can hurt him only and all the kids are handed with special made weapons. Part of the deal is for Korosensei to bring no harm to the students and to postpone his Earth annihilation for a whole year. So, the show mainly centres around the students trying to kill their teacher! Once it becomes apparent that conventional methods aren\u2019t going to work, the students branch out to tactical means. And this is where each character traits, strengths, weaknesses and personality comes to fruition with everyone displaying their own ways to reach their goal. It does become predictable since you know all assassination attempts will fail until at least you reach the end but they more than make up for it. Another sub plot at full affect is the dilemmas on class 3-E due to the discrimination from the rest of the school and the principal.\\n\r\nKorosensei is a total badass whose smart, wise, funny and a pervert with an immunity to most types of killing and the power of super speed! A mysterious character whose motives aren\u2019t clear and his past is rather shady, yet he wins the audience over with his extremely likable and approachable personality and his desire to help his students! The professional yet natural way the show changes its tone are skilfully well balanced so you buy it whenever it happens. Most of this comes from Korosensei and what makes him so amazing is that he genuinely cares about these delinquents especially when nobody else does! He will mock his students with their failed attacks but then will also impart with good life lessons! This is where Korosensei and the script stand out with its inspirational speeches that has lasting impact on the kids as well as the audience! These words of wisdom touch you on an emotional level since they are usually directed towards life and future. The MC is Nagisa who\u2019s a guy! (Yeah I know) But credit to the show for actually playing that into the story later on. He gets good character development as the show progresses but he stands out for being the smart one by analysing Korosensei\u2019s behaviour and weaknesses. You also later find out his knack for assassination by playing the smart card! He\u2019s supported by somewhat psychopathic yet favourite character Karma and \u2018Forever Flat\u2019 Kaede. (You will get the reference later!) ;) Other characters also grow as episodes are dedicated to them where they have their own moment to shine as we learn more about their background on how they ended up in class 3-E. Other professional assassins make appearances though they mostly play as a companion piece. \\n\\n\\n\r\nI preferred the dub even though subs are good too mainly due to the voice acting for Korosensei. Sonny does a splendid job of channeling that calm and soothing tone which helped elevate the emotional moments as well as the gleefulness tone with his comedic moments.\\n\r\nThe sound effects especially during the action scenes were good while the OP/ED were ok. And the art design mainly leaps out with its colourful background and distinguishable character designs. \\n\\n\\n\r\nThis is a must watch that can easily be recommended to anyone despite its odd concept since its story is filled with a lot of heart. The anime also brilliantly plays with the audience by emotionally manipulating and teasing you to the inevitable end of this story where the kids must kill Korosensei or he will blow up the planet! You are just as easily conflicted about this as the students since they start with passionate intent to kill Korosensei but then form a deep bond with him and aren\u2019t sure about their next move later. Now we don\u2019t know how it will end but I can guarantee that majority of us wants Korosensei to live because he\u2019s the best damn teacher in the world! One could hope for Korosensei to change his mind or be persuaded by his class towards the end. The show also leaves you with some unanswered questions but worry not for they are answered in Season 2.\\n",

            "content": "A review of *Assassination Classroom, the popular shounen anime with a ridiculous concept.*\r\n*Plot: 5.5/10-* AssClass follows an episodic and arc format with episodes that either focus on a student or a specific event, and as with many episodic anime, the results are hit and miss. Episodes can range from great to okay to an absolute mess. Many of the individual episodes that focus on nothing of note to the overall story are often the most entertaining and contain the best humor. Those episodes are the ones that kept me coming back. On the other hand, the mediocre episodes, and the occasional terrible episodes, are theones that try to expand on the main plot. Sometimes the elements introduced work fairly well, but other times, the plot falls flat on its face. \\n\\n\r\n*Entertainment Value: 7.9/10-* For me, AssClass' main draw is the humor and entertainment value. While technically being a comedy, AssClass does not seem to try to be funny often enough. It does not make me laugh-out-loud more than one or twice an episode at most and yet the majority of episodes are still amusing throughout. This is best aspect of AssClass; it is simply fun to watch. It might not be engrossing, and it starts to wear out its welcome at points, but the series often kept me entertained.\\n\\n\r\nMy review might make Assassination Classroom sound like a bad anime and that is not the case; it is a fun show to watch. However, whether or not you will like AssClass depends on how enjoyable you find the essentially \"pointless\" episodic episodes, because if you apply any logic to the main plot, it falls apart. With its insane popularity in Japan and a second season on the way, you will be seeing more of Assassination Classroom in the future.\\n\r\n_Watch if you like:_ Shounen, Comedy, Lack of progression\\n\r\n*-6.5/10*\\n",

Now that you've gathered in front of me... well not me, but this text, let's get this review started.\r\nStory: 8/10\r\nThe story of Ansatsu Kyoushitsu is about a alien octopus-creature thingy that destroys the moon and is going to destroy the earth next. A bunch of students with utter-shit grades are told to assassinate him before next year, or, before graduation. I mean, literally, utter-shit grades, they're grades suck, so they're in the E-Class. A.k.a, End Class. End Class is also knownas the Assassination Classroom (WHAAT?! NAME OF DA SHOW! ILLUMINATI CONFIRMED) and well, yeah, the story is simple, yet somehow manages to entertain me.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nThe art/animation whatever the heck you wanna call it, feels somewhat different to other 2015 titles... I don't know why, it just looks different than... well other 2015 titles. I'm not saying it's bad, it's just something I'm not used to. There's a possibility they wanted it to look like that, and that's okay, but... just not used to it. That's all.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is pretty good, I mean, I usually download the opening of every single anime I watch, and, yeah, the openings were good (I preferred the first one, though.) and I never really paid much attention to the other songs that were played in the background and such. But, when I did happen to download the soundtrack, I loved almost every single song that was in it. Great soundtrack, automatic install.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 6/10\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are okay, but... they lack development. I mean, a few characters had great developments, but... other than that, the other characters need more development. I'm sure they will in the future, as I have not read the manga, but for this season, I'm going to say that they lack development. Other than that (yes, i said it again) all the characters in the show are great.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nThe series overall wasn't the most fascinating series I've ever seen in my life, but it was okay. To be honest, I don't think my current favorite anime that's in my favorite anime list will leave any time soon, cuz' they're pretty good. I mean, Monster & Code Geass mate? What can pass dat? I just need to watch more anime, I guess.",

            "content": "I\u2019ve had this mixed reaction with school throughout my life. There were times when professors I\u2019ve faced just tries to get on your nerves to make life a living hell. Then, there were times where I come across the best teacher in the world where it\u2019s worth every minute attending the course. Ansatsu Kyoushitu (Assassination Classroom) isn\u2019t just about learning something from the teacher though. If you take a knife, gun, or whatever that can be considered a killing tool to school, you\u2019d get expelled. But in this series, that takes on a rather different direction. And I have to say, it\u2019s peculiarly interesting atheart.\\n\\n\r\nBased on the manga of the same name, the series is financially successful so why not an anime adaptation? This didn\u2019t came as a surprise as a special episode titled \u2018Ansatsu Kyoushitsu (TV) Episode 0: Deai no Jikan\u2019 already debuted prior to its television premiere. With a peculiar premise about a class of students trying to literally kill their teacher, you\u2019ll probably ask yourself if this is a suitable series for you.  \\n\\n\r\nA primary introduction into the series will easily set your eyes feasted into the story. The premise of the series involves a classroom of ordinary students known as Kunugigaoka Middle School's Class 3-E. Every morning involves them greeting their not-so-ordinary teacher. Known by many as \u201cKoro-sensei\u201d, he has a big smiley face, a body full of tentacles, and the personality of an easygoing guy. A main objective involves the students actually trying to kill him because in about a year, he will blow up the Earth. Now hold on. You\u2019re probably asking yourself \u2018what\u2019? It\u2019s not as twisted as it sounds though because the series is actually quite lighthearted. When molding the term \u201cassassination\u201d into any title, you would expect bloodthirsty violence or gore shoved down our throats. However, this series takes a satirical stab at the genre and transform it into a rather amusing series action-packed comedy of every day school life. \\n\\n\r\nThe main attraction that can draw any viewer into this series is the comedy. And this is because the series itself has a personality. It\u2019s especially true for Koro-sensei as he teaches more than just academics in class. He teaches about everyday life lessons and even connects individually with characters on a personal level at times. At certain points of the story, you\u2019ll find him quite likeable and even relatable by the topics he covers in class. And of course, his expressive face is always amusing and delightful to watch. In essence, the comedy is refreshing and takes assassination to a level that can be considered more of a parody. The theme of assassination is actually deconstructed on a multitude of levels when it comes to story execution. It also crafts a bit of slice of life as some episodes feels like an adventure that takes the students to places they\u2019ve never been before.\\n\\n\r\nWhile the comedy aspect of the show can be appealing, a large part of the series involves the characters. There\u2019s actually a double edged sword to this series when it comes to characters, although for the most part, it should be considered a positive. The plus side is that there is a very diverse category of students attending 3-E. Almost all the characters have a unique personality and their involvement in the story.  The downside is that not every character/student in the class gets a prominent spotlight. Being a 2 cour show (22 episodes) lacks the necessity to draw this out so the series does what\u2019s best to get what\u2019s needed on-screen. Nagisa Shiota is the main male protagonist although he has a rather androgynous appearance. The way the series operates includes him and other students trying to kill their teacher, Koro-sensei but fails to do so every time. So in other words, the students all gets chances in some shape or form throughout the story. What I find most appealing about this is how Koro-sensei is consciously aware of their motivations but also gives encouragements to these students for trying while teaching them life lessons. Most of the characters also build relationships that are meaningful despite some obvious differences with their personalities. This is especially true for Nagisa and Karma Akabane, a notoriously troublesome boy. And on an individual level, there\u2019s also distinctive amount of characterization focused on specific characters. Yukiko, Rio, and Ritsu are just a few to name as the series expands on their roles as the story progresses. Even teachers such as Tadaomi Karasuma and Irina Jelavic has a fluid characterization with their involvement in the main story.\\n\\n\r\nFor more or less, the story flows like a slice of life with direction pointing at various locations.  It expands beyond just the classroom as the students does go occasionally on field trips. And often times, their trips takes them to places that associates with different culture. It explores a realistic side that almost blurs between the lines of fiction and reality. Furthermore, there\u2019s an interesting degree of life lesson morality with certain aspects of the show. It even discusses certain sensible topics at times that people like you and me may be aware of. Of course, we also can\u2019t forget about the academics part. As a show taking place in school life environment, there\u2019s all sorts of subjects explored such as Math, Science, Social Studies, and even Physical Education. It\u2019s like living the old days at high school again.\\n\\n\r\nI will say this series is not for everyone though. As a show about deconstructing the assassination trope, the humor can be a hit or miss for some. Rather, there\u2019s a diehard attempt to illustrate a colorful side of killing. Assassination itself is a sensible topic but when it takes place in the classroom, it can sometimes be controversial. Luckily, most of the show is lighthearted and doesn\u2019t ever venture into shock value. However, as lighthearted as it can be, the comedy will sometimes feel blend and repetitive. Also do note that this adaptation is rearranged a bit so some chapters are omitted to make the overall story feel smoother. \\n\\n\r\nAdapted from Lerche, Ansatsu Kyoushitu\u2019s artwork succeeds in capturing the fitting art style of the series. It feels like the comedic tone and lighthearted atmosphere the creators are trying to bring out. Furthermore, the character designs matches their persona in terms of adaptation. Perhaps the most prominent design features Koro-sensei. I will say that this peculiar creature never ceases to amuse me whether he is teaching in class, his facial expressive reactions, or when he attempts to dodge his death. There\u2019s also a good stylized way to coordinate the action with assassination that involves tools and strategies. Guns, swords, knives, bombs\u2026you name it. They are there in the show and used in some very creative ways. The series puts the fun into their usage as we see how clever they can be used. Oh and did I mention Irina? The students may call her bitch sensei all the time but she has the figure of a femme fatale.\\n\\n\r\nPerhaps the lesser well addressed feature of the show is the soundtrack. Make no mistake though, the show doesn\u2019t neglect that. The catchy OP/ED songs has a goofy yet effective style to give viewers an insight on what they can expect. Character voice mannerism are fitting for their roles. Koro-sensei himself has a very laid-back personality along with a voice that equally matches his character. I give praise to Jun Fukuyama for stepping into the shoes of this creature as it\u2019s never easy to voice someone that is so otherworldly. OST on most parts is familiar although not the thing that stands out the most. Overall, the style is still an eerie beauty though.\\n\\n\r\nI know what you\u2019re thinking. It\u2019s probably something along the lines of \u201cthis show seems way too crazy\u201d. And to be honest, you\u2019re not wrong. But as crazy as it seems, it\u2019s a lot of fun with assassination, school life, and a cast of characters with how they spend their daily lives. Rather than adapting romance angles or diehard drama, we get this classic shounen comedy with a very stylish way of storytelling. Each episode offers something new thanks to its themes and performances of the characters. The comedy is fresh and doesn\u2019t rely on cheap cardboard fan service to get to its point. I highly recommend giving this series a try regardless of how unorthodox the premise may seem to sound. There\u2019s a chance it could surprise you. After all, isn\u2019t life just full of surprises?\\n",

            "content": "(This has been adapted from my blog/reddit thread. Spoilers ahead!)\r\nAs I made my way through my early education, I always considered myself a pretty good student. I read my books, did my homework, and played nicely during recess. There was a big flaw that took a while for me to shake off, though: talking way too much. I would talk while the teachers were speaking, I would talk over my friends, and I would talk during assemblies when I wasn\u2019t supposed to. No matter how many reprimands or punishments I got, I couldn\u2019t seem to get it into my noggin that there are times whenyou get to speak your mind and times when you just have to shut up. I eventually learned this lesson \u2013 it took a little too long by my family\u2019s account \u2013 but my teachers never gave up on me. They stuck through my incessant ramblings, allowing me to realize the error of my ways, making me into a better person because of their hard work. Assassination Classroom performs similarly, offering an anime that still has lessons to be learned.\\n\\n\r\nSTORY\\n\\n\r\nAssassination Classroom follows the \u201cEnd Class,\u201d a group of students relegated to the bottom-of-the-barrel in their school system due to their poor grades, abysmal behavior, or any combination thereof. One day, a new \u201cteacher\u201d arrives, tasking the class with a seemingly simple objective: assassinate him before the time limit is reached or the Earth is doomed. Picking up knives and weapons instead of pens and utensils, the kids train themselves to eliminate this otherworldly creature.\\n\\n\r\nThe premise is wacky, without a doubt. Having a bunch of junior high delinquents kill their artificially composed \u201csensei\u201d is pretty imaginative, but simultaneously seems as if there isn\u2019t much to work with. To an extent, this mentality isn\u2019t too far off. Assassination Classroom leans heavily on repetition for much of the season. Specifically, the children invent an elaborate way to go about taking out their teacher that ultimately fails. This is pretty much expected given the format of the anime; killing the teacher off early doesn\u2019t make any sense because the show would end. So no matter what the kids do, the audience already knows that the outcome will never succeed. It therefore falls on the actual events to make up for the constant lack of return on the investment already given.\\n\\n\r\nSadly, the show falls short here as well. The comedy is pretty simplistic because, like the assassination attempts, it devolves into repetition quite quickly. For example, \u201cProfessor Bitch\u201d never fails to get mad at her students, the kids always overreact to Koro-sensei despite being around him for so long, and their individual quirks aren\u2019t pronounced enough to be used as laughing points. Besides the comedy, the show has the tendency to reiterate the same ideas ad nauseam. \u201cThe E-Class is super dumb\u201d and \u201cKoro-sensei is incredibly fast\u201d comprise a lot of the dialogue, often said once or twice (each) per episode. These facts are understood and established rather early, but the anime makes sure to shove in these ideas at every turn. It\u2019s ironic, because such a tactic makes it seem as if the show \u2013 which is all about \u201cgetting\u201d to these kids \u2013 doesn\u2019t trust its viewers enough to also \u201cget\u201d what it has to say. There also exists an apparent tonal issue that the anime chooses to embrace. Assassination Classroom is meant to be a fun show. The weird teacher, the dichotomy of teenagers wielding combat weapons, and interactions of the students are normally meant to be lighthearted. So when the show diverts from this formula and goes dark or dramatic, it doesn\u2019t work. While it tries to present itself as such, it instead feels forced. This is wholly apparent when, for example, the anime goes right back to its comedic roots after experiencing a life-threatening trek through a guerilla-infested hotel.\\n\\n\r\nThere are other problems the show maintains \u2013 unnecessary narration since it rehashes whatever has already been discussed, one-time villains, an unclear antagonist \u2013 but the anime does manage to stick with its own theme: becoming a better person. However, it\u2019s a bit stronger than this, because the kids of the \u201cEnd-Class\u201d aren\u2019t ordinary children. They\u2019re the ones who need the most help, who require the greatest amount of guidance to get them back on the right track. Thus, the theme changes slightly to: anyone can become a better person. We witness this idea unfold nearly every episode. One student learns about how important it is to always take proper safety precautions, another comes to understand the value of free will, and another still realizes the benefits of friendships. They get better physically and mentally, sure, but it\u2019s these small but hugely important life lessons that leave the biggest impact, and subsequently make them better people. The theme itself also comes naturally \u2013 a teacher essentially does just this, teaching his or her students the proper ways of life. So watching these worse-off children improve their persons isn\u2019t only rewarding for them and the audience, but it\u2019s completely normal, too.\\n\\n\r\nANIMATION\\n\\n\r\nThere isn\u2019t too much to say about the art style for Assassination Classroom. Interestingly, it does employ this strange tactic when it comes to its foreground characters. They all seem to \u201cpop,\u201d mostly due to the black outlines they each hold as well as the varied colors the show uses. The backgrounds aren\u2019t too involved, mostly consisting of the same locations \u2013 the classroom, the surrounding field, and the main complex are visited the most. While they aren\u2019t impressive, they do at least capture the school feel needed to make the actual events remain relevant.\\n\\n\r\nThe character designs are nice for a simple reason: they aren\u2019t extremely unique. There are students like Nagisa who have the uncommon hair color, but for the most part, the characters look like regular junior high kids. Obviously, this isn\u2019t true for people like Koro-sensei and Irina, but they\u2019re designs also fit well with who they are as people. Koro-sensei\u2019s never-ending smile, tentacles, and pattern-changing skin coincide perfectly with his craziness whereas Irina\u2019s blonde hair, blue eyes, and large bust make her the sexy woman she is. The rest of the cast is a mix of the two \u2013 normalcy combined with uniqueness \u2013 that never feels out of place.\\n\\n\r\nActual animation is roughly average in execution. Koro Sensei takes up a lot of it, with his Mach speed and other physically impossible movements, but the students as well are given opportunities to strut their stuff. In fact, the premise makes this an easy matter; the gun fighting, martial arts, and other ridiculous situations give the show more than enough chances to work with. While it\u2019s never stunning to see, the animation at least keeps up throughout the entirety of the season.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS\\n\\n\r\nThere are a lot of characters within Assassination Classroom, and for good reason. It\u2019s an entire class of students, faculty members, and other people who don\u2019t fit into those descriptions. Now, it\u2019s nigh impossible for the show to give an adequate amount of screen-time or development for every single person, so many of them are as one-dimensional as they come. One girl is known for her chubbiness, one dude is sort of a pervert, one girl likes detective-oriented manga, etc. At the minimum, the anime, despite the cast size it boasts, does try to give everyone at least some time in the spotlight.\\n\\n\r\nThis widespread dividing of resources, though, introduces another problem of its own: not enough focus. Many of the bigger names within the show don\u2019t receive nearly enough attention as they should, diminishing who they are as characters. For starters, Gakuhou, the president of the academy, is painted as evil but still a formidable educator. Yet, outside of making a few snarls or spewing some condescending words, he doesn\u2019t do much of anything in regards to the plot. Itona, the \u201cbrother\u201d of Koro-sensei, follows suit. He appears twice throughout the series, but besides having such strong connections and similarities to the teacher, nothing else is learned about him. Even Nagisa, technically the main student and contender to take down their target, doesn\u2019t see much in the way of development. He sort of floats along with everyone else, gaining a ton of experience by observing Koro-sensei and participating in the daily training regimens. That\u2019s the extent of who he is. He doesn\u2019t seem too troubled by the events surrounding him, there doesn\u2019t appear to be anything extravagant about who he is, and he doesn\u2019t really grow beyond his current state. The final confrontation actually regressed his character for a time; while brief, he forgot almost everything he had learned up to the last fight.\\n\\n\r\nThe worst offender is, surprisingly, Koro-sensei. Maybe three times at best, the show provides the audience with a miniscule glimpse into the alien\u2019s background, but nothing more. His origin remains unknown and his ultimate motivations are unclear. Furthermore, his complete infallibility prevents him from being affected by the kids he advises so much. It sounds counterintuitive, but a teacher learns just as much from his or her students as they do from their mentor, but Koro-sensei cannot personally develop because there\u2019s apparently nothing left for him to learn. \u201cApparently\u201d is used here because, again, there is no knowledge about Koro-sensei\u2019s actual person, so while there may be some kind of problems or issues Koro-sensei has or needs to face, these aren\u2019t explored.\\n\\n\r\nLooking at these paragraphs here, there doesn\u2019t seem to be anyone worth mentioning, but there are a few. Irina is investigated nicely enough, as is Yukiko, but the best character of the anime is Karma. Karma is a difficult kid to work with. He\u2019s abrasive towards authority, he refuses to try hard, and has trouble making friends with others because of his constant bullying. Early on, Koro-sensei does manage to connect with Karma, to get him to understand the worth he has as a person. He calms down and opens up a bit to others, working with instead of against them, but still going about his own business. Later, when he loses grade-wise, he comes to learn that challenging yourself, not complacency, allows you to excel beyond what you were normally capable of. The culmination of his character development is seen near the end when, presented with a tough opponent, he not only chooses to fight him for the sake of his friends but also takes it seriously, more so than he ever had in the past. He began down and out, without people to guide him, but through Koro-sensei\u2019s words of wisdom and friends who accepted him as one of their own, he slowly but surely turned out for the better. Still a little mean, but better nonetheless.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND\\n\\n\r\nThe opening themes for the show, goofy dances aside, are crafted to be fun. The lyrics are mostly filled with references to their teacher, killing, and assassinations, but the beat and instruments are very lighthearted to go along with the comedic nature of the show itself. The repetition here also doesn\u2019t work in its favor; instead of being catchy, it\u2019s annoying. However the male and female vocalists sing in harmony \u2013 for both OPs \u2013 matching the show\u2019s sense of togetherness that it portrays.\\n\\n\r\nThere is only one ending theme for Assassination Classroom. It wasn\u2019t switched out for another because it\u2019s too fantastic to forego. Contrasting with the OPs, it\u2019s slow and gentle both on the ears and the heart. The lyrics and the singing give it a sense of longing; \u201cI was waiting for,\u201d \u201cHello, shooting star again,\u201d and the \u201cah, ah\u201d provide that grateful feeling when something finally returns. The instruments don\u2019t overpower the singer, the pausing in the middle is advantageous to the ED\u2019s theme, and the single guitar lead in at the beginning invites the listener to hear even more. It\u2019s a phenomenal piece, and is definitely the highlight of the entire series.\\n\\n\r\nThe rest of the soundtrack actually has a wide range of beats and tracks to fit many separate and varying occasions. \u201cYukai na Anatsu Keikaku\u201d is very upbeat with the jazzy brass, plethora of drums, and simple beat. \u201cHaritsume ta Kuuki\u201d is both ominous and mysterious, and eventually picks up to increase tension in a positive manner. \u201cTadashi\u201d is quite ambient, almost techno in its presentation, and rather fitting for the \u201calien\u201d scenario the students find themselves in. And \u201cNiramiai\u201d continues with the stealthy and covert-operation vibe that many of the events follow. It\u2019s all appropriate and fits the overall moods of the anime nicely, but nothing is overtly astonishing or memorable.\\n\\n\r\nVoice acting for the show is somewhere around average. A special shout-out is deserved for Jun Fukuyama as Koro-sensei for his zany mannerisms and way of speaking.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT\\n\\n\r\nAs I made my way through this one, I could not get over how kiddy it all was. No amount of guns, bodacious babes, or crazy bad guys could stop me from thinking that this one was designed for a way younger crowd than it was intended for. I never really laughed when I was supposed to, the bad guys were silly rather than scary, and the drama present didn\u2019t move me like it should.\\n\\n\r\nThere weren\u2019t even any characters I really liked, save for two. Irina was there as eye-candy for me and Ritsu (who isn\u2019t even \u201creal\u201d) was adorable after her upgrades. Besides these two girls, I found the rest of the known cast to be boring or lame. Koro-sensei, too, was not entertaining; he\u2019s really fast and crazy, I get that. But his love of big boobs and constant chuckling was never fun to watch.\\n\\n\r\nAssassination Classroom has an amazing ending theme, but the praise halts there. The narrative holds way too many problems to be purposeful, the characters lack the focus necessary to make them meaningful, and the show is way too childish for its own good. Hopefully this one goes to cram school before its second season, because all its doing right now is failing.\\n\\n\r\nSUMMARY\\n\\n\r\nStory: Bad, constant lack of return, too much pointless repetition, tonal issues, but learning life lessons is both rewarding and natural\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: Fine, okay art style, nice character designs, average actual animation\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Bad, many students are glanced at, important members like Gakuhou, Nagisa, and especially Koro-sensei aren\u2019t explored enough, but some like Irina, Yukiko, and Karma are\\n\\n\r\nSound: Fine, okay first OP, okay second OP, great ED, okay soundtrack, average VA work\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Bad, too kiddy, not funny, Koro-sensei is not entertaining, and only Irina and Ritsu out of the entire cast were tolerable\\n\\n\r\nFinal Score: 3/10",

            "content": "If I were to tell you that an anime called \"AssClass\" was about a tentacle monster that shows up to a middle school and... stopped right there- you'd think that this was some nasty hentai, right?\r\nWell, let me be the first to say that this show surprised me in several ways. \r\nNo, it doesn't have surprise sex scenes.\r\nAssassination Classroom, where a group of misfit students band together to try and take down their anthropomorphic, superpowered octopus teacher. The only problem is that while he can break all the rules of physics, they can't. How do you kill a monster who threatens to destroy the Earth,and backs his promise up by obliterating the moon, Death Star style? \\n\\n\\n\r\nArtwork and Animation: 7\\n\\n\r\nAssClass, as a comedy, has a fairly typical 'cutesy' exaggerated feel to the artwork. Everything is a little larger than life, and some characters are little more than animated caricatures, but it goes along well with the overall tone of the series. It's not made to look hyper-realistic, and it plays around a lot with sight gags and some fun oversaturated/negative color asides in the vein of Jojo. \\n\r\nIt's a very colorful and vibrant looking show, with some exotic locales and a seeming obsession with using every crayon in the box to make it look lush. For a new studio like Lerche, I'll give them the thumbs up. It never got sloppy or lazily drawn (Looking at you, Pierrot.) and stayed consistent from start to finish. \\n\\n\\n\r\nSound and Voice Acting: 7\\n\\n\r\nThere are 26 recurring named and individually voiced students, so prepare for an onslaught of names to remember. Some standouts are: Koro Sensei himself, with Jun Fukuyama (Lelouch, Code Geass) behind the mic, Aya Suzuki (Mako, KLK) as Kaede, and Shizuka Itou (Akeno, HSDxD) lending her sexiness to Irina Jelavich.\\n\\n\r\nDespite the immense amount of voices that are used in the show, they don't all end up in the blender and come out a gray, Japanese sounding paste. I won't say each character is unique, because they're not, but there were several memorable voices in this that set themselves apart from the rest of the class- Koro Sensei leading the pack. \\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters and Story: 7\\n\\n\r\nWith 26 different students, an ever growing staff of teachers, a mystery monster, evil principals, some arc-based antagonists, and a cheerfully murderous AI contained in a TV,  somehow they manage to wrap all of them up into a single plot and keep the characters relevant. While some of the students get their time in the sun, a group of kids stay at the forefront- and they're who I'll focus on.\\n\\n\r\nNagisa, the ambiguously gendered main character, Karma the 'bad boy', Terasaka the ruffian, and Kaede the green haired voice of reason round out the most prominent characters. (Man, this sounds like a boy band, hope that Backstreet Boys pun before isn't lost on anyone)\\n\\n\r\nNagisa is a little blue haired runt who gets picked on a lot, but turns out to be the one with the most potential to whack Koro Sensei due to his ability to think outside the box and react quickly. His growth over the course of the show is rather symbolic of the class as a whole. Unrefined, rejected, and isolated, Nagisa and the other students begin as yet another take on the \"ragtag group who grow together to do something awesome\" trope, but pass the test for being something a little more. \\n\\n\r\nSupporting them are the teachers; the aforementioned anthropomorphic, mach 20 flying, super genius octopus Koro Sensei, the straight man, government agent, and PE teacher Karasuma, and the beautiful seductress assassin, Bitch-sensei! \\n\\n\r\nWhile this disparate group sounds like a really cheesy setup for an ensemble comedy, AssClass manages to sidestep the garbage ecchi humor (some lampshaded or shut down gags from Irina aside), overplayed wannabe 4th wall humor, and mo\u00e9 stuff in favor of a generally amusing and overall decent plot, complete with a couple of twists and likable characters. The dynamic between Karasuma and Irina, and watching the group of misfit kids bond together over trying futilely to destroy their teacher while at the same time receiving the best instruction and support of their lives was fun. \\n\\n\r\nWhile a lot of questions about Koro Sensei go unanswered, and some character's backstories not explored fully- they don't necessarily take away from the show. I never felt like I had to know everything about Koro Sensei to be able to enjoy the struggle going on. It's apparent within the universe of the show that several people know what his story is, so I'm content to wait until it's explained to me.\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8\\n\\n\r\nOften with these ensemble shows, I end up hating the characters and want them to die brutal, painful deaths- and with a name like Assassination Classroom, one would think that it's a violent murderfest- but that couldn't be farther from the truth. \\n\\n\r\nAssClass was definitely a fun watch every Friday, and every episode felt like it had something to offer, even after the novelty of \"Will they get him this time??\" wore off. How all the formative events from the beginning and middle of the show came together at the end was nice to see, and the show never broke its internal logic- but it does have some Anime Biology \u2122 going on. Who cares though? It has an octopus that can destroy the moon and fly 15,224 miles per hour.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7\\n\\n\r\nI'm happy to hand Lerche and AssClass a 7, and looking forward to what they bring with Gakkou Gurashi next season. \\n\\n\\n\r\nRecommend?\\n\\n\r\nYes- if a light hearted action/comedy about middle school kids trying to kill their teacher while learning life's lessons sounds like fun, you'd be right. It is. \\n",

            "content": "Ah, school.  The inescapable part of our lives where we spend minimum 12 years of our lives learning a wide array of subjects, facts, and topics that we most likely will never use the majority of in our professional lives.  So, with another school anime, what kind of anime would we get from something about a bunch of middle school students?  Well...how about one where the middle school students try and kill their teacher?\r\nStory (8.08/10): E class, also known as the end class in the prep school of Kunugigaoka Junior high is a place fabled in the school to be the worstclass, housing the worst students in the school, grade-wise.  Here, the students of this fabled \"failure\" are tasked with a rather...unique task, killing this yellow octopus-like...thing who according to him, has turned the moon into a permanent crescent and this coming March, will blow up the earth as well.  Oh boy...that's a situation to be in.\\n\\n\r\nAssassination classroom, or AssClass as a shorthanded was of calling the show, follows the story of the end class as they try and kill their teacher during their first semester in 9th grade.  With every few episodes or so, one or more people in the classroom attempt to assassinate their teacher known as Koro-sensei (literally unkillable teacher in translation), usually ending in failure because this teacher can fly at Mach 20, is resistant towards conventional weapons, and only a particular set of weaknesses that you learn over time.  (Basically the story of \"teacher too OP, GG, plz nerf)\\n\\n\r\nWhile the show focuses pretty heavily on the aspect of killing an alien creature so to say, a lot of the show as well talks about the idea of teaching and comparing that to the idea of assassination.  Because the show is centered around these academically challenged students, the show also emphasizes on their growth as students and a person's learning potential, which actually puts in some pretty good themes.  But don't worry, this show is plenty about trying to kill an octopus, so you don't have to worry about the actually school learning taking over the story.\\n\\n\r\nComedy as well is well done for AssClass as well.  Much of it is done in this style where you get immediate comebacks from various characters as well as that brief, awkward moment to take in what just happened, which I think makes the show relatively fresh me never boring to watch.  Mostly, I think it's in part of Lerche doing the production of this show, but the manga itself is still pretty damn funny, which brings me to my next point.\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of differences to the manga, AssClass the anime focuses its runtime on the events that for the most part, don't focus on one character.  There're a lot of chapters within AssClass that are devoted solely on one student, chapters that give more life to class E.  On account of time constraints, not all of the students that were focused on those chapters are focused in the anime, which is a slight bother that I will bring up later.\\n\\n\r\nOverall though, this adaptation was no bad in the slightest.  The manga was perfectly encapsulated in this anime and I found myself to be laughing just as much as I did when I read it.  As usual with comedy anime, depending on your taste in comedy, this show may or may not suit your liking.\\n\\n\r\nOverview\\n\r\n+ Original story\\n\r\n+ Has some nice themes about learning (using assassination)\\n\r\n+ Good comedy (this can be bad depending on your taste in comedy)\\n\r\n-  Not all students got a featured episode\\n\\n\r\nCharacters (8.33/10): Whenever you're making any comedy anime, the most important part of making memorable comedy is to have memorable characters that you can remember the personalities of to deliver those sweet, sweet jokes that make comedy so good.  Luckily, AssClass succeeds in doing this.\\n\\n\r\nUp first, is our main protagonist of the story, the hero among heroes, the one who will bust our funny bones, Koro-sensei.  You thought it was one of the E class kids?!  No, it's the thing that wants to destroy the earth that's the real hero here.  (Ok, that was a bit contradictory). As I have stated before, Koro-sensei is for the most part, the pathway for the show's comedy. Being a bit of a silly creature that sometimes makes absolutely no sense, Koro-sensei is the most memorable character of this show not only because the show revolves around trying to kill him but because you won't forget him.  Like seriously, it's going to be very hard to forget a yellow, pervy octopus that flies around at Mach 20 speed going Nufufufufu everywhere with a big toothy grin.\\n\\n\r\nAnd then we have class E.  I grouped these characters up together for a few reasons.  One, there're 30+ of them.  I'm not making 30 paragraphs to talk about them, it's too much work.  Two, it's easier to talk about these characters' purpose.  Throughout the show, you do get to know more about class E.  Their names, personalities, and for a couple, how they got put into the end class.  A lot of these characters, namely Nagisa, Kayano, Karma, and a few others are talked about a lot and for the audience, are more well known.  Inversely though, many of the class E characters don't get as well as an introduction as others do.  As a result, many are otherwise unknown or mentioned for a brief second.  Because there're 30+ students, it becomes a challenge to really know the individual characters very well mostly because for the most part, the show treats them all as one unit.  \\n\\n\r\nAs for side characters, the most noticeable ones are the other teachers of the E class, Karasuma and Irina, or, as everyone loves to call her, \"bitch-sensei\".  (If I was lying, these parentheses would be saying something else.). As far as side characters go, these two are the most used and most recognizable, being blessed with roles that have them appear much more often than a standard side character, which makes them better characters overall.  The other side characters for this show serve similar purposes in the memorable department, but mostly only serve to be an obstacle for our class E to overcome.  \\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+ Best teacher. (Nufufufufufu =w=)\\n\r\n+ Great side cast\\n\r\n+ Memorable characters\\n\r\n- Class E was treated as a whole unit rather than 30 some odd characters\\n\\n\r\nArt and sound (8.00/10 and 7.44/10) the art for AssClass was a very brightly done style using a very light gradient that made everything sort of pop.  As well as doing some standard comedic faces for characters and good animation fluidity, the art was rather stable and standard fare.  But...what really stood out for the art for me was being able to pull off the more dark and menacing scenes in the same style.  It gave a sense of eerie feeling when things went dark for a second which I thought was a nice design flourish.  \\n\\n\r\nAlso, Lerche managed to squeeze in the symbolism for various characters from the manga into the anime itself, so good on you.  \\n\\n\r\nIn terms of sound, I didn't really find the soundtrack to be all that memorable.  I would describe it as fun more than anything else, not really a masterpiece.  As a show with 2 OP tracks that had a similar feel to both of them, I wouldn't say I didn't enjoy them, but I didn't think they'd were completely stellar by any stretch of the imagination.  Ed song was tranquil but didn't stick in my head.  Though I will give props for that creepy track whenever a realization happens.  That was a nice touch.\\n\\n\r\nOverview\\n\r\n+ Bright art\\n\r\n+ Menacing scenes looked great in the artstyle\\n\r\n+ Decent soundtrack\\n\r\n-  Soundtrack to me wasn't memorable\\n\\n\r\nPersonal Enjoyment (9.09/10):  While I did have some issues with various parts of the show, I'll be honest, it didn't matter, cause this was a fun watch.  I was skeptical of the AssClass series when this started airing, but after checking out the manga (and marathon read that for 6 weeks), I can't say I wasn't pleased to read/watch this series.\\n\\n\r\nDid I like this anime?\\n\\n\r\nYes.  I think this anime was a great adaptation of the AssClass manga.  There were no shortcuts aside from the student chapters, and everything was told just how it was without any unnecessary changes.  It was great to see some of my favorite scenes in animated form.  \\n\\n\r\nWhat didn't I like about this anime?  \\n\\n\r\nWhile the manga itself didn't make note of all the kids by the period of time where the anime ends, there were still some kids that had hi lighted chapters for them, which inversely, wasn't transported to the anime.  It made the students more individual and it felt unfair to see only some not all got animated, because some character jokes and gags don't really make much sense unless you actually know the whole character.\\n\\n\r\nWould I recommend this anime?  \\n\\n\r\nIn terms of comedy, I would say it is  one of the better ones to come out in recent times.  It has a fun, 22 episode runtime, there're great and memorable characters in there, and there is a method behind the madness.  The only major issue I have is that the jokes pertaining to a certain character don't always get translated well, so some things might be hit or miss.  But apart from that little bug, I give this show. Solid...B+, for effort\\n\\n\r\nOverall Score: 8.05/10",

What if naivety holds a nobility grownups can no longer understand, what if what you sometime used to know was all you actually had to...yes, E-gumi not fully experiencing the harshness of life could be called naive, them naive or those who called them  naive, incapable.  \r\nAnsatsu Kyoushitsu is not anime which aims to cultivate one's inner world or lay forth philosophical notions for one to ponder over, Ansatsu Kyoushitsu is a fun, comical and extremely enjoyable anime with that bright side of naivety being theonly worthy moral to reap from it.\\n\\n\r\nI got surprised by how unique and at the same time trite the story was, only to realize afterwards that originality in the story, characters or plot is not where the anime wants to focus, but the manner it will\\n\r\npresent them...\\n\r\nWe have our usual Japanese high school, and a class of misfits handled by an unusual teacher.

Koro sensei...he is  yellow, of unidentified species and flawless from more or less every aspect, but most of all, he is E-class' assassination target.\\n\r\nAnsatsu Kyoushitsu doesn't have a strong story, and even though the adventure part is serious, the anime as a whole has more of a comical appeal. It won't be long before the word assassination loses the awe it initially provoked, and at the very least by episode five you will realize that the only thing you won't fully know or expect from the anime-as it doesn't have much unexpected or hidden things-is the reason why Koro sensei involved himself with E-gumi. So, basically, you will have lots of fun as the class trains and at the same time attempts to assassinate its resourceful teacher, bonding stronger in every attempt. And fun is all you will get, in case you want complexity, originality-even though Ansatsu Kyoushitsu is like no other anime I've watched-suspense, hardcore adventure and seriousness, Ansatsu will fail you.\\n\r\nAlthough, it has its incredibly vivid art to make up for it,its cheerful and rhythmic openings, the amazing ending most people who like Japanese music will end up downloading, and lastly, a limited few of notable \\n\r\nand distinguishable characters. In fact, the range of characters is not exactly wide, and aside the two main and a few supporting, it is highly unlikely that you will remember the names of the rest. \\n\r\nThe anime progresses smoothly and pleasantly, only getting dark and heavy at a part or two with minor duration. All in all, it is rare for an anime with assassination as its theme to not be influencing negatively, but lifting your mood instead. Ansatsu will not leave a vivid impact on you, however the memory of watching it will be a happy one as it is from the anime that make you smile while watching.\\n\\n\r\nMy personal opinion, is that Ansatsu does not have much room for development, all the more, it should be short and worthwhile. The second season though, will be a thing to look forward to as the one thing it has to reveal has not been revealed yet.\\n",

            "content": "Usually I do not bother myself with writing negative review (this is actually a common MAL trend as reviews are usually written by fans) as  I have more or less good understanding of why tv in question are so popular despite being bad in my eyes. But this one is a total mystery for me. \r\nIt is pretty easy to split this tv  in 3 independent \"themes\" and analyze them separately:\r\n1. Class needs to kill their teacher in order to save the world. \r\nSounds fun huh? But it was not.\r\nI expected a lot of cunning assassination schemes, clever traps, constant progress in methodsbut alas - nothing of it. After few mediocre direct attempts to kill no one in class cares about it anymore,  and story is shifted towards normal school live show + occasional pro-killer come to do the same dumb direct attempts to kill which is never gonna work by setting design (and therefore boring to watch). The lack of creativity is astonishing, I can't believe it was possible to do such a boring write-up with such potentially-reach material on hands.\\n\r\nDefinitely a weakest part of the show. If you were primary  interesting in this part - skip this show. \\n\\n\r\nScore: 2/10\\n\\n\r\n2. Class E is a class of problem children. School system is a bit evil. Classical story about making misfits into nice persons via solving their problems.\\n\\n\r\nThe show is struggle to find a right  balance between assassinations and telling sad stories of the students. Both parts feels like incomplete attempts. But at least this part is done in more or less standard fashion. The bad part of it is the teacher character - he is very one-dimensional. He doesn't feel like a real person with any depth, and the main reason for it is a comedic relief. They wanted a comedy show similar to GTO, I assume. But while Onizuka provided plenty of fun while being a solid character which you can relate to, our teaches is just a clown with nothing to back him up. To make it worse variety of jokes are very limited and after 3-4 series you watched them all and they were not fun to begin with. This is huge letdown as show relies on it very heavily.\\n\\n\r\nScore: If if take GTO as 10 than this show would be around 4/10.\\n\\n\r\n3. Main plot aka who is Mr Teacher, why he needs to destroy earth, who is behind all of this  etc.\\n\r\nProbably the best part of the show, unfortunately show is dragged into second season therefore there are no answers and overall amount of plot content is abysmal. The best way to describe this series would be - filler, slow paced, repetitive, quite boring and a bit absurdic. It really feels like you watch worst part of a good show.\\n\\n\r\nScore: N/A, all in second season.\\n\\n\\n\r\nConclusion: While I expect second season to be much better, I still believe it is not worth to struggle trough 22 episodes of filler material.\\n\r\nWith 12  episodes format it would be so-so, but 22 puts it beyond salvation. And as  it was released alongside with pretty solid tiles - I see no reason to pay any attention to it.",

            "content": "I began to watch this anime thinking it would be both entertaining and interesting. It's not that I expected that much of this anime, but I have never been this disappointed in my life. Every episode I prayed to God that the agony would finally stop, but it didn't. I guess God gives and God takes. And he took the pleasure of living by presenting this shitty anime.\r\nThe first five minutes were quite interesting, as the plot was still in development. Some tentacle guy blew up the moon and threatens to blow op the earth unless he gets to teach some drop-out high school kidsto and train them to kill him. As I'm typing this I begin to wonder why I didn't stop watching after the first five minutes. This was the whole plot btw. In the other 21 episodes nothing happens. At all. Not even fanservice. \\n\\n\r\n- Spoilers: - The ending was entire shit. It turned out he turns invincible for a day if he wants to. Also the deadly poison of which everyone would die wasn't actually poison. \\n\r\nBut the most excruciating part of the plot, the part where I actually had to pause the last episode and think for a second about what the writers were thinking, was the part where our trans-gendered main character Nagisa actually tries to kill a man. This was unbelievable, I've finally watched to the point in an assassination anime where someone gets killed, and the whole class and teacher say 'No don't do it Nagisa killing is wrong!'. Can you believe this shit? I can't even start explaining why I raged so hard.\\n\r\nNow, if there is no plot, can the characters save this anime? The answer: No. The only decent character is the 2D waifu tactical warfare robot machine from Norway, everyone else has a generic background of failing their school exams for arbitrary reasons. Also, even though they failed every exams ever, everyone in the class is actually a genius with IQ's over 130 and ace every test if they feel like it.\\n\r\nHowever, there may be a target audience for this anime. If you're a teacher, there may be some useful tips 'hidden' in every episode. If you pay attention, more than half of every episode contains a long and in-depth preach about the secret techniques of teaching and the inner workings of children's minds.\\n\r\nThe art and sound were ok I guess. Nothing special, nothing as shit as the rest of the anime.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I was very disappointed and I feel like I wasted a part of my life watching this abomination.\\n\r\nEven writing a review about it made me cry inside, but I wanted to warn everyone else out there expecting something great because of everyone rating it 9/10\\n\\n\r\nBut the question remains... is Nagisa really a guy? No one knows",

            "content": "Assassination Classroom is one the only anime that can have tentacles near middle school girls without being a hentai. It's like, this is the new challenge of the year. First this, now Splatoon. \r\nAnyway, AssClass is a 22 episode anime about a mach 20 speed octopus who threatens to destroy Earth by the end of the school year. He's now a teacher in middle school, and his class has to assassinate him before he destroys Earth. \r\nAnd people thought Pupa had a weird plot. Let's jump right into it.\r\n#jumpyreviews\r\nAfter finishing AssClass, I had very mixed feelings about it. It's not bad, but it really isn'ta great anime. I think the crazy plot AssClass has can turn off a lot of viewers, but it all depends on how they execute it. The story is divided in many arcs, where the 26 students and a fucking robot, will try to kill the teacher. The problem with this is that it's fucking predictable when it focuses on killing the teacher. When, basically, the tentacle monster is leading the show with a few other students and is also over-powered, you don't think they'll kill him off easily, huh? Considering that the show was announced to have a second season and the manga is currently still ongoing, you pretty much know what's gonna happen every time that they get really close to killing the tentacle monster, Koro Sensei, so you really end up not caring. I mean, right from the start, you can tell that they aren't gonna kill Koro Sensei at any time soon; you already know exactly what's gonna happen and it's gonna frustrate you every time they get close to killing him. How do you solve this? Making your arcs interesting and not focusing on only killing Koro Sensei, which AssClass does quite well.\\n\\n\r\nAssClass does drift apart from the actual plot, to introducing other villains and many characters. Even though, some of them aren't really as good as the rest, it was the best way to go before it got predictable as it was in the beginning. So yes, the show does pick up after a few episodes. I found the beginning to be a rough start, but it got better along the way. Even though the plot isn't really all that good, it does its best at not completely going to shit. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters are rather hard to talk about because there are so many. I won't be covering every single character. \\n\r\nKoro Sensei is pretty much the most entertaining character in the series. There are many questions about his character that still go unanswered, that will hopefully be answered in season 2, as I've heard from a lot of manga readers. His character isn't really what you would call \"great\", but it's definitely the one that keeps it interesting. \\n\\n\r\nNagisa is the biggest trap there is. He's probably the smartest out of all the students, and let me remind that there's a fucking robot as one of the students. He's smart, energetic and thinks out of the box in order to kill Koro Sensei. \\n\r\nHis character is the one that had the most potential to be great and have a great development, and don't get me wrong, it wasn't bad, but it could've been way better. By the end of the series, I didn't felt like he grew much. We don't even know much about him, he's just a badass with potential, and hopefully he will improve in season 2. \\n\\n\r\nThe other characters aren't really worth mentioning. No, they're not bad, they're just there. I'll give credit to the plot for actually being a bit original. Yes, it might sound like a bit of a stretch at first, but it all it fits pretty well, even with its few plot holes. The characters aren't really original, they all follow feel like other characters I've seen many times, and makes them feel very one-dimensional. They do try to develop some of the characters, but the only ones I can give credit for actually doing something with them are Nagisa and Karma, which is a red hair psychopath that had a great introduction, but was barely shown ever again. He does have a different point of view by the end of the show, but boy, was it predictable. I couldn't find myself caring about any of the characters, which is a bit bad for a show that has many characters. You don't have to develop all of them, but at least try to make me care for, I dunno, more than one. I'm just hoping that they flesh out some of the characters in the next season, because this one didn't do it for me.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is pretty solid and I was pretty impressed with a lot of the show had to offer with some scenes. The backgrounds sometimes looked terrible and sometimes they looked pretty decent. Nothing was outstanding, but nothing was bad, other than some of the backgrounds, especially when it takes places out doors. I should mention that this was animated by Lerche, which is pretty new to the community. The next thing that they'll be animating will be Gakkou Gurashi this Summer, which I'm actually pretty excited to watch. Hopefully they won't fuck up. \\n\\n\r\nThe character designs weren't too bad, but followed the hair color thing to keep you from getting confused on which character is which. Remember guys, if you can't remember the name, just call them by the color of the hair.\\n\r\n The outlines of the characters were quite a bit annoying and reminded me of the outlines in Attack on Titan, which annoyed me, as well. Nothing really impressed me, but it didn't left a bad taste in my mouth. \\n\\n\r\nThe cinematography was rather average, but it did impressed me with some of the action scenes. This being a shounen, I wasn't expecting it to take such a different tone in camera angels. It was a bit refreshing, but other than the fight scenes, it was pretty average. \\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack fits rather well in the show. The songs played in the perfect time to set up a tone in the show. When it wanted to be serious, it had serious music, when it wanted to be goofy, it had goofy music, and so on. The opening is a bit awkward and can get stuck in your head. The second opening is more of the same, but the 2nd Ending song was actually quite impressive and I never found myself really skipping it. The 1st Ending song is just average.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, if you feel like watching a pretty entertaining anime about killing a tentacle monster involved with no hentai (kinda), then by all means, go watch AssClass. If it doesn't seem to interest you, I suggest you at least give it a try, because you might end up liking it more than me. It has its good and it has its bad. If I had to score AssClass, I would give it a 5.5/10 or a 6/10.\\n\\n\r\nI recommend you at least give the first episode a try and I'm hoping that Lerche can handle Gakkou Gurashi rather well. Hopefully Lerche will also step their game up with AssClass in the second season, as well. \\n\\n",

            "content": "\u201cAssassination is education. The sensei of the Assassination Classroom becomes stronger as he teaches.\u201d \u2013 Koro-sensei \r\nIn Assassination Classroom (Ansatsu Kyoushitsu), education is assassination, and assassination is education, to learn is to assassinate, and to assassinate is to learn.\r\nClass 3-E is not an ordinary clich\u00e9d school classroom, instead of pencils and calculators, we get knives and guns. Yes, Assassination Classroom is not your ordinary school comedy anime. It diverges and expands through the norms, and it transforms into something of utmost originality and uniqueness.\r\n(Disclaimer: this is going to be quite a long review, so hopefully you can bare with it!?)\r\nThe setting of the show revolvesaround Class 3-E, a group of students of a prestigious school named Kunugigaoka Junior High School, and is perceived as inferior, being the lowest class of the institution. However, at the same time, Class E is also the location of the government\u2019s confidential assassination scheme on Koro-sensei, the monstrous looking octopus-like being who has threatened to destroy Earth after teaching Class 3-E for a year. Being able to move at a speed of Mach 20, Koro-sensei is almost able to do anything at will, travel anywhere and even teach his students effectively individually with his speed. His advanced capabilities and powers make assassination a difficult challenge for the students, and ultimately show the indomitability of the human spirit, the resilience of the class, and their increasingly strengthening determination of the students to strive for success after experiencing defeat and failure. \\n\\n\r\nAssassination Classroom has one of the most unique and original stories out there amongst the anime and manga industry, and is able to utilise its main theme of assassination and education to its utmost benefit, to achieve development and characterisation within its particularly large cast, and to manifest as well, many other notable themes such as the value of friendship, class and discrimination, failure and defeat, and human perseverance. \\n\r\nMost of the episodes in Assassination Classroom contain many underlying didactic and moral powerful life lessons, and these are not only in the form of motivation, but also inspiration. With Koro-sensei helping the students out in both their actual education, and in their assassination attempts, the students are able to learn many values and life-changing lessons from their \u201cteacher\u201d and \u201ctarget\u201d whilst conducting the assassination attempts as well, and as this exchange benefits both parties, the relationship between both the teacher/target and the students/assassins are able to strengthen and develop. Many of the students have their own problems, be it their personality, or their background and upbringing, through assassination and education, Koro-sensei is able to aid these students individually as well, to seek out their troubles, and to bring good into them and show them the beauty of their lives and the bonds they encompass. \\n\\n\r\nWithout a doubt, with assassination as the central theme of the show, it is this that allows immense room for the characters to learn and understand more about each other, about Koro-sensei, and ultimately, permits characters to grow both individually and together collectively. Not only do the students learn from Koro-sensei, but at the same time, Koro-sensei is also able to learn from the students, forging trust and bonds between the two in Class 3-E. \\n\\n\r\nThe show however takes a very risky step regarding its diverse and large cast with more than 20 students, and 3 teachers. With limited screen time, it is inevitable that not only some characters are unrecognizable, but also some of the characters will lack the necessary screen time to properly convey their backstories and personalities and may thus be deemed as \u201cless important\u201d or trivial. Despite this noticeable flaw with the enormous cast, it is not only each individual that compose the cast, but instead it is all of the characters collectively that the characters are able to grow as a class. Unless specific students are the central focus of an episode and in the assassination attempt, they are left forgettable and are overshadowed by the more noticeable and outstanding characters such as Nagisa and Karma. \\n\\n\r\nShiota Nagisa is the central protagonist amongst Class-E and is often a calm and friendly person. Perhaps, it is also necessary to point out that Nagisa is the best trap. He occasionally takes on the role of an observer and narrator and is cautious in every situation. He is also very meticulous and diligent to exploring every detail of Koro-sensei\u2019s himself in order to aid future assassination attempts. Although calm on the outside, some scenes showcase Nagisa\u2019s inner-assassin potential and it is his calmness that makes him unique as an assassin as he is shown having the innate ability to hide his bloodlust.\\n\\n\r\nAkabane Karma is another prominent student within Class-E and is not only one of the most intelligent, cunning and witty in the class, but also one of the smartest in the entire school. Although he has a rather sadistic personality and likes to torture his opponents, Karma has a positive mindset, and also has good morals behind his intentions. He is known for being a delinquent and troublesome violator in the school, and has lost respect for adults after being betrayed by his most trusted homeroom teacher prior arriving Class 3E. However, it is because of his inner-caring personality and moral mindset that he was placed in Class E as he rescued a senior from being bullied by students of the main building. Even though he may seem to be extremely smart and a genius in assassination, he has a tendency to be overconfident, arrogant and lazy at times, hindering his ability to develop further. However, Koro-sensei realises this and after Karma received a \u201cdefeat\u201d in their confrontation with Class A, and fell in the academic rankings, Koro-sensei made it clear to Karma that he needs to abandon his overconfident self, and accept improvement because defeat ultimately incites growth, unlocking Karma\u2019s potential as both a student and an assassin. \\n\\n\r\nIt's these simple didactic and inspiring lessons that allows us watchers to also feel sympathy for the characters and at the same time, allows us to comprehend the true meaning of defeat, perseverance and the relationships the characters share together. Although reality may be harsh and dejected, one must always work his way through and persevere in order to achieve improvement\u2013 that is the glory and advantage of mankind.\\n\\n\r\nAlthough only glimpses of Koro-sensei\u2019s past have been shown in the anime, it is this enigma of his character that allows suspense to fill the watchers\u2019 minds, and keep watching further to truly understand Koro-sensei\u2019s underlying motives behind \u201cdestroying\u201d the world after a year of teaching. Koro-sensei is extremely humble, talented, and funnily enough, quite perverted. He cares for his students, not only about their education, but also their skills in the field of assassination as well as their own personal individual lives. It\u2019s truly teachers like these that these students are able to grow so fast and so much both academically and as an assassin, and have a widened outlook on their lives. Although Class E may be ostracized from the main school and the higher-up classes, there is no discrimination in Class E itself after all, the class itself is almost like a family, with close bonds interconnected through each other being peers of another in a group of assassins. Even as the students love Koro-sensei and understand that he genuinely cares for them, they know that they have to still carry out their assassination because that is the initial reason of Koro-sensei joining the class, and also, the planet is being threatened to being destroyed.\\n\\n\r\nKarasuma, is another one of Class E\u2019s teachers, a highly skilled agent sent by the Ministry of Defense. He is strict but also aids into developing the assassination skills of the students, and eventually become bonded with the class as well despite his stoic and dense personality, and suppressing his emotions because of his profession. It is also undeniable that there is a small degree of fanservice appeal brought by bitch-sensei, Irina, but again this revolves around the whole theme of assassination and is also manifestation of her assassination skills. Nevertheless, she also grows along with the rest of the students as well as Koro-sensei and Karasuma-sensei.\\n\\n\r\nThe comedy is extremely well done. Ranging from Koro-sensei\u2019s ridiculousness and his admiration for erotic magazines, to Karma\u2019s sadistic torturing methods of sticking chilli and spicy paste into someone\u2019s nostrils, the majority of the humour derives from the main central plot of assassination, and just goes to show how immense of a theme this is and how much it can develop the show.  \\n\\n\r\nUnlike the bland special of Assassination Classroom that was animated by Brain\u2019s Base in 2013, Lerche takes Assassination Classroom to a whole new level through its distinct art style. The art style makes use of conspicuous shadows, bold borders and outlines to highlight and define each individual character. The backgrounds also look nice and are vibrant when it needs to be, and dark when it needs to be as well. The details of objects look precise through the neat and clear art. Ultimately, the anime is able to bring out the manga\u2019s great art to life, if not, even better, taking it to a new level. The animation involved in showcasing Koro-sensei\u2019s super speed and the subsequent surrounding environment looks phenomenal and very fluid, bringing Koro-sensei to life. \\n\\n\r\nSound wise, both openings \u2018Seishun Satsubatsu-ron\u2019 and \u2018Jiriki Hongan Revolution\u2019 fit the show perfectly. Being upbeat and lively, the music itself pumps you up for the episode before it starts and brightens up the atmosphere. Visually, they involve the introduction of the characters of Class E and feature the characters dancing in a very comical manner which I definitely love and find hilarious. The soundtrack is also used appropriately most of the time, using suspenseful music at suspenseful moments, sentimental tracks at the more sympathetic scenes, as well as a short electronic/techno sounding track during thrilling moments such as when Ritsu analyses the floor plan during the hotel infiltration. \\n\\n\r\nThe ending song itself \u2018Hello, shooting-star\u2019 by moumoon is a masterpiece and depicts a more emotional approach to the show with its lighthearted and sentimental tone. The visuals are stunning utilising a chalkboard and chalks to visualise the ending song with its characters. For me, every time this ending plays I never skip it, and instead, I envision what it would be like if Koro-sensei were to actually be killed, and how emotional it would truly be. \\n\\n\r\nWith a second season confirmed in production, we can expect to see more intriguing arcs, more suspenseful moments, as well as increasingly more characterisation and story development as the show unfolds itself.\\n\\n\r\nUndoubtedly, Assassination Classroom diverges from the ordinary anime, and transforms norms into a show that is original, unique and creative. Through the central plot, the show is able to merge both assassination and education to develop the cast as a whole, manifest individual growth and exhibit the interlinking bonds of the class. Not only this, but this is a show that truly allows you to learn from its many underlying didactic messages as well, both subtle and explicit. And I certainly recommend everyone to try out Assassination Classroom at some point because this is a show that has shown me both inspiration and motivation.\\n",

            "content": "Confession: I originally rated this 8/10 when it first came out nearly three years ago. I enjoyed it, but didn't love it. I thought it was clever and funny, but it didn't really stick with me. \r\nBut with the stress of university exams and life expectations, I've been rewatching a lot of old shows I'd once forgot about and I realized something about Assassination Classroom that I somehow failed to see the first time around: This show is kind of freaking perfect. \r\nSUMMARY: \r\nYou've probably heard the basic synopsis of this show a million times before, but I'll recap it real quick for you anyway.Basically, Assassination Classroom revolves around a class of third-year middle school kids who have, for all intents and purposes, been deemed the \"losers of the End Class\" as part of some social hierarchy cultivated by their prestigious school's villainous principal. These kids are mocked and demeaned by the other students, hidden away in a small shack on a mountain away from the main campus -- and if that wasn't enough, they've been tasked with learning to be assassins to kill their giant, tentacled \"teacher\" who is unconventional in every way and happens to have a top speed of Mach 20. If they don't manage to kill him in one year, he's going to blow up the earth like he blew up the moon. \\n\\n\r\nSounds weird to you? You're right -- it IS weird. But it's also hilarious, ridiculously clever, and wholly original while managing to hit all your favourite archetypes in the best possible way. \\n\\n\r\nAnd, NO. Just because there's a tentacle monster and a big-breasted English teacher does not mean this is hentai. Get your head out of the gutter. This is so far from hentai, I should take y'all to church just for thinking it. \\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS: \\n\r\nThe best part of this anime is by far the amazing cast of characters. First, we have Nagisa Shiota, our awkward, unassuming, and ridiculously adorable narrator of sorts, who has a slightly androgynous appearance that makes for hilarious gags where his best friends like to dress him up as a girl, and he has a low self-esteem without being the pitiable fool they often cast in any sort of SOL/harem anime (which this definitely isn't). He may seem adorably defenseless and sweet like a newborn puppy, but when it comes to assassination, he's a natural born pro -- and not in an unrealistic OP way where it doesn't fit with his character. He may not be the best fighter and he's definitely not the strongest, but he has a killer instinct which is masked by his utter adorableness that stuns both his classmates and the audience again and again in really cool fight scenes and assassination attempts. If you dislike Nagisa, I dislike you. It's that simple. Don't hate my baby. \\n\\n\r\nThen there's Karma Akabane, everyone's favourite sociopath. He's ruthless, intelligent, and indisputably the best in his class. Watching him direct his teammates during complicated battle strategies and assassinations is nothing short of captivating. His cleverness and ability to foresee anything is incredible, and the way he is able to remain calm and condescending in almost every situation is the perfect compliment to his sarcastic back-talk and hilarious sadistic tendencies, a lot of which tend to revolve around teasing Nagisa. (Warning: Their bromance is freaking adorable.) \\n\\n\r\nOf course, we can't forget Koro-sensei! He's big, he's yellow, he's a bit of a perv -- he also happens to be the teacher everyone wishes they had and a surprising tugger of heartstrings. I don't want to write much about him without spoiling, so let me just say that while he may initially seem like an octopus pervert meant for comic relief and plot direction, he's much more than that. A LOT more than that. \\n\\n\r\nBut here's the thing: Those three may be listed as the \"main\" characters, but they definitely aren't the only ones you'll love. The cast here is huge and hilarious and individual and fun. While I have a ridiculous love for Nagisa, Karma, and Koro-sensei, so many of the other people in Class 3-E also managed to steal my heart, like poor Prince Charming Isogai, beautiful yet nondescript class idol Kanzaki, and SFA Karasama whose main purpose is supposed to be to teach the kids assassination techniques but is really to add a swoon factor for both the audience and Professor Bitch. I could individually describe every single one of them, but I don't want this review to turn into a gushing novel so I'll spare you my inner nerd. \\n\\n\r\nLarge casts are usually a hit or miss with me. You tend to like some characters and hate others, but here, I was a hog. I wanted them all. They all had their quirks, their strengths, and their weaknesses, and the way they interacted as a class was hilarious and perfect and fun. They complimented each other and stood out from each other, and let me just say that two seasons with these rascals was nowhere near enough to satisfy me. \\n\\n\r\nOVERALL: \\n\r\nWatch this show. Seriously, watch it. I don't waste my time writing reviews for just anything -- or at all -- but this show made me so damn happy and full of giggles that I just had to share the love. So you should watch it then come befriend me so we can gush over it together.",

            "content": "My first view of AC(assassination classroom) was that the main character was too kiddy like. But after several pushes from my friends, I finally decided to give it a try. True, the main character might look girlish, weak and elementary school, he is actually very strong. \r\nThe plot is simply amazing and fulfilling all aspects that I enjoy watching. They were very detailed and the jokes/comedy moments softened the serious moments, making it even more enjoyable. \r\nThe Art is splendid, so if you are getting tired of finding anime with art like One Piece(no offense), you can try this. \r\nThe character development is also fascinating.It is neatly done and there aren't really any holes in them.\\n\r\nSo all in all, I am giving this a ten! Plus, it has a second season so I didn't have to go anime hunting that soon after the first season. \\n\r\nSo if you are not sure or on the edge, just trust me and give the first few episodes a try. You will enjoy it if you like Mystery, Action, and Fights.  Or Highschool settings.",

            "content": "My Ansatsu Kyoushitsu (TV) review...the re-post.\r\nStory\r\nOk, the plot........kill the space alien octopus within the span of one year or it will destroy planet earth...........the men.....a group of middle school losers whom were train by the antagonist itself to kill him....their mission, kill him with in one school year and if successful they will get a 10 billion yen which is roughly about $100 million . Well, the plot was really unique and quite frankly I kinda like the idea behind it. But, on a moral basis, the plot was really twisted where one can't imagine that class 3E of Kunugigaoka Junior High School were trainto develop killer instinct which come with the training of the antagonist and the teachers, so the story itself was very much crazy and not much of any sense in even if it was meant as entertainment. \\n\\n\\n\r\nMy verdict: A poor 3.\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt \\n\\n\r\nBasically I would have give it a 2 since the anime itself still follows the usual cliche of MC's having their own uniform designed, I mean really Nagisa has to be this bishonen with female features, geeez now why didn't author Matsui, Yuusei portrayed him as a cute bishojo instead of a bishonen? Also , I kinda hate Karma having his own coat color instead of wearing his school's standard grey. Then again the silver lining here is Bitch sensei were she is as hot as hell, still I'm not much impress with this anime's art even in it's manga form.....then again the live version is as worse as the anime and manga combine.\\n\\n\r\nMy verdict: A poor 3\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\\n\r\nI gonna give a high score for the opening OST which is \u201cSeishun Satsubatsuron\u201d and \"\"Jiriki Hongan Revolution\" by 3-nen E-Gumi Utatan.\\n\\n\r\nSo my verdict: An outstanding 10.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter\\n\\n\r\nI'm only gonna focus on those who made an impact into this anime, since I haven't gone with the manga yet.\\n\\n\r\nKoro-sensei, if you look at him he was really portrayed as a funny antagonist , but unlike other antagonist he's one antagonist that one would love, ok so he gonna destroy earth just like what he did with the moon, big deal. Also, what make his character special was that it wasn't something that one needs to worry about- I mean his character in general is something that one wouldn't care whether he get's killed or not. You might say that the class of 3E are more annoying than Koro sensei.\\n\\n\r\nNagisa Shiota, ok so wtf did author Matsui, Yuusei made him into a boy with female features we'll never know, what I do know was that I really dislike him also, I really hate how his character was being exaggerated an innocent boy with a very deadly killer instinct.If author Matsui, Yuusei have made him a girl then his character would have added a good femme fetal into the whole series which was too bad.\\n\\n\\n\r\nKarma Akabane, I kinda like that he plays as this quintessential talking trash guy who can deliver, but, one part of me wants to see him gets owned by bigger guys which it did, but still hated him in the few episodes of the anime where he get's to owned a profession killer who was trying to get him. However it was rather unfortunate that he didn't get to duke out with the main antagonist Akira Takaoka where in my opinion would have also give this anime a good climax.\\n\\n\r\nAkira Takaoka, ok so he is the quintessential antagonist that one would love to hate, but I kind hate it that he never went it for the kill when he faced Nagisa for the second time where his character really did fall short of what was expected of him. And I always wanted to see him duke out with Karma.\\n\\n\r\nIrina \"Bitch-sensei\" Jelavi\u0107, ok so kinda like her for being this quintessential bimbo, then again that's what she is an eye candy of this anime.\\n\\n\r\nTadaomi Karasuma, if Bitch sensei is the eye candy for this anime then that make him the quintessential guy who just looks around and manages, you know I'd wsih that he and Bitch sensei would have a serious relationship, where either he kills her or she kills him kind of thing.\\n\\n\r\nSo my verdict: a good 7.\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment\\n\\n\r\nThe enjoyment part here wasn't whether the 3e class would be able to kill Koro sensei or what, the enjoyment stems as to how the next episode would go, it might not be boring , but the experience of watching it was that it wasn't something that one would expect something to happen to Koro sensei, but what would the kids of class 3E would be up to... or what would anybody be up to to get Koro sensei for that matter.\\n\\n\r\nMy verdict: good 7.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall\\n\\n\r\nIt maybe enjoyable, but definitely not for kids ages 12 and below, since there is no moral lesson in it , just random streaks of kids form 3E who are up to something to Koro sensei, other than that , there isn't much. \\n\\n\r\nMy final verdict: a decent 4.\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "8.8/10\r\nIn my own opinion, this is one of my favourite winter anime of 2015.\r\nTo start off, the story was very intriguing. After all, it has an octopus teacher capable of destroying 70% of the moon. The fact that junior high kids were also trained to be assassins really struck a chord with me. I thought it was quite an original story, and I have never watched an anime like this. However, some characters do not develop as much as I would have liked. The creators did develop most of the important characters such as Nagisa, Karma, and a few other characters, meanwhile the rest ofthe class stayed rather stagnant in terms of developing, and we only learn one or two things about them. The villains were also well created, giving them an authentic feel. They aren't average villains who would rob a bank, but would instead create plots that would prove to be a large problem for 3-E. One problem that I saw, though, was the comedy proved to be a bit repetitive and annoying.\\n\\n\r\nThe art style was great. In terms of quality, it was very good, with clear lines and defined faces. They make some lines on a characters' face thicker, which creates an excellent effect. It was a very refreshing art style, and none of the characters looked out of place in the classroom.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack and sound effect of this anime were excellent. The music has a very unique sound to it and really helps to set the mood. Whether it be a happy moment, or an intense moment, the soundtrack was great and I personally loved the way it sounded. It added more emphasis to any scene, especially the ones that had darker moments. The sound effects sounded natural and not artificial.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter development was a bit slow, and the director only developed a few main characters. I would have liked to see Koro-sensei develop more, but he didn't really say anything about his past. At best, there were a few flashbacks, but that was it. Karasuma and Irina don't develop much as well, but seeing both of them change to adapt to the conditions that were set in the classroom was very interesting. I enjoyed seeing Nagisa and Karma develop. When you first look at Nagisa, since he was in 3-E, he was often made fun of. But throughout the anime, you slowly start to see him develop into more and more of an assassin. Karma's development became really evident in the second half of the anime. I really enjoyed seeing his character change, and personally, he is my favorite character.\\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed watching this anime. I have rewatched it, and I enjoyed every second of it. I waited for Friday to come so I could watch it. However, after the 11th episode, it stopped coming out temporarily, before resuming again. \\n\r\nOverall, I really liked this anime. it was great, with an original story, great soundtrack, and a unique array of characters. I only wish that there was more developing of the story and characters.",

            "content": "While the anime came out a few years back, I have only gotten around to watching Assassination Classroom recently. I felt EXTREMELY compelled to write a review on the show after deciding to drop it.\r\nI find that a way to describe Assassination Classroom (at least, in a way I believe to be accurate), it to imagine a piece of paper that has \"GOOD CONCEPT\" written on it in black marker. Then, imagine handing that piece of paper to a toddler with a box of sharpies and telling them to go hog wild. Eventually, you cant even read the original phrase because it is just coveredin nonsense.\\n\\n\r\nGENERAL OPINION:\\n\r\nI was drawn to Assassination Classroom for its concept. The idea of a classroom of kids trying to kill their (somehow charming) alien teacher before he destroys the planet is exciting, and dare I say, unique! The design seemed okay, the characters seemed okay- nothing appeared like it was below average quality. My opinion at the start of the show followed this belief too.\\n\\n\r\nBut eventually, the scribbled-on-paper mess appeared before me. Assassination Classroom has one HELL of a plot going on... so why does almost 1/4th of the episodes not even develop it? This season is FULL of filler episodes, none really adding any progress to the students goal of killing their teacher OR even adding to character development. To me, it felt as though I had been watching for an hour when only 1 episode had gone by. Everything was so agonizingly slow (both slow to develop and slow to even unfold the events in each episode). \\n\\n\r\nI would like to mention that I do not mind shows that are slow and take time to unfold, such as Steins;Gate. BUT, unlike most shows that use this strategy, Assassination Classroom fails to even try and keep the viewer anticipating what will happen at the end of the buildup. It is honestly wasted episode time that could be spent in so many better ways.\\n\\n\r\nOPENING:\\n\r\nNot to be /that/ guy, but the first OP is one of the worst ones I have ever heard. The lyrics are quite cute, since they have all to do with the actual theme of the show, but but but the music itself just... does not flow right. It does not \"hype me up\" or get me into the \"mood\" for the show. Unless the point of it was to make me get to the show faster by skipping it, the OP could have easily been anything else and would have been better.\\n\\n\r\nSIDENOTE: \\n\r\nWhile this is not a legit critique of the show, it completely bothered me how happy the students were 99% of the time during the show. It seemed like every time they failed to kill their teacher, and were therefore one day closer to LITERALLY DYING, they all would just laugh the event off and pull a \"teehee haha sensei youre just too good! Back to math time!\". WHY are none of the actual students bothered in the slightest by this! WHY is everybody just so calm about their impending doom! okay thats all\\n\\n\r\nRATING:\\n\r\nI decided to give this show a 5 because I will recognize the fact that this show has been admired highly by most people, so there must be some appeal to it that only I am not catching onto. It was not the worst anime I have seen, but it has so far been the only anime I have decided was so bad I had to drop.   \\n\\n\r\nThanks for reading :)",

            "content": "Disclaimer : this is the second anime I watched, so I won't be objective in this review. And btw I'm french, tell me if I wrote total bullshit somewhere :p\r\n  I really enjoyed watching this anime after a friend told me to watch it, and as he told me, I cried several times.\r\n  About the writing of this show, I can't really tell if the best point is the story of the characters. Although I found it was a little long to start and introduce the characters - which I'll tell why it isn't totally a bad point - the sory kept mein suspense as much as I watched it in only 3 days, and I couldn't stop between two episodes. Furthermore, talking about this with my sister (who I told to watch it just after I finished the show) gave me chills just by understanding some pionts I didn't get at the first watching. Aboout the characters, I succeeded to remember the main names after only 3 episodes - which is for me a real miracle - and that shows how much they are endearing.\\n\\n\r\n  However, this show isn't good only thanks to its writing, but especially its animanion made with the greatest of care. Only looking at the second opening of the first season gives you a showcase of Lerche's best work. And then you see the second half of the second season and understand why I gave it 8. I didn't give a better note because, like in every series, middle-season episodes' animation is good but not outstanding.\\n\\n\r\n  Well as it's my first review I don't really know how to finish it, but all I'm going to tell you is to watch it if you didn't, and rewatch it two or three times, until you see all the easter-eggs - 'cause there are plenty of them.",

The name itself will elicit your own ideas of what this show might be but you soon find out how dead wrong you were! What makes this even more special is when you realize how easily this storytelling could have failed! You start with the basic setup of an octopus like creature blowing up the moon and now threatens to do the same to Earth. A deal is then made for him to become a teacher of aclass with failed students where he will teach them as well as train them in assassination. He comes to be known as Korosensei by the class after providing military with a special material that can hurt him only and all the kids are handed with special made weapons. Part of the deal is for Korosensei to bring no harm to the students and to postpone his Earth annihilation for a whole year. So, the show mainly centres around the students trying to kill their teacher! Once it becomes apparent that conventional methods aren\u2019t going to work, the students branch out to tactical means. And this is where each character traits, strengths, weaknesses and personality comes to fruition with everyone displaying their own ways to reach their goal. It does become predictable since you know all assassination attempts will fail until at least you reach the end but they more than make up for it. Another sub plot at full affect is the dilemmas on class 3-E due to the discrimination from the rest of the school and the principal.\\n\r\nKorosensei is a total badass whose smart, wise, funny and a pervert with an immunity to most types of killing and the power of super speed! A mysterious character whose motives aren\u2019t clear and his past is rather shady, yet he wins the audience over with his extremely likable and approachable personality and his desire to help his students! The professional yet natural way the show changes its tone are skilfully well balanced so you buy it whenever it happens. Most of this comes from Korosensei and what makes him so amazing is that he genuinely cares about these delinquents especially when nobody else does! He will mock his students with their failed attacks but then will also impart with good life lessons! This is where Korosensei and the script stand out with its inspirational speeches that has lasting impact on the kids as well as the audience! These words of wisdom touch you on an emotional level since they are usually directed towards life and future. The MC is Nagisa who\u2019s a guy! (Yeah I know) But credit to the show for actually playing that into the story later on. He gets good character development as the show progresses but he stands out for being the smart one by analysing Korosensei\u2019s behaviour and weaknesses. You also later find out his knack for assassination by playing the smart card! He\u2019s supported by somewhat psychopathic yet favourite character Karma and \u2018Forever Flat\u2019 Kaede. (You will get the reference later!) ;) Other characters also grow as episodes are dedicated to them where they have their own moment to shine as we learn more about their background on how they ended up in class 3-E. Other professional assassins make appearances though they mostly play as a companion piece. \\n\\n\\n\r\nI preferred the dub even though subs are good too mainly due to the voice acting for Korosensei. Sonny does a splendid job of channeling that calm and soothing tone which helped elevate the emotional moments as well as the gleefulness tone with his comedic moments.\\n\r\nThe sound effects especially during the action scenes were good while the OP/ED were ok. And the art design mainly leaps out with its colourful background and distinguishable character designs. \\n\\n\\n\r\nThis is a must watch that can easily be recommended to anyone despite its odd concept since its story is filled with a lot of heart. The anime also brilliantly plays with the audience by emotionally manipulating and teasing you to the inevitable end of this story where the kids must kill Korosensei or he will blow up the planet! You are just as easily conflicted about this as the students since they start with passionate intent to kill Korosensei but then form a deep bond with him and aren\u2019t sure about their next move later. Now we don\u2019t know how it will end but I can guarantee that majority of us wants Korosensei to live because he\u2019s the best damn teacher in the world! One could hope for Korosensei to change his mind or be persuaded by his class towards the end. The show also leaves you with some unanswered questions but worry not for they are answered in Season 2.\\n",

            "content": "A review of *Assassination Classroom, the popular shounen anime with a ridiculous concept.*\r\n*Plot: 5.5/10-* AssClass follows an episodic and arc format with episodes that either focus on a student or a specific event, and as with many episodic anime, the results are hit and miss. Episodes can range from great to okay to an absolute mess. Many of the individual episodes that focus on nothing of note to the overall story are often the most entertaining and contain the best humor. Those episodes are the ones that kept me coming back. On the other hand, the mediocre episodes, and the occasional terrible episodes, are theones that try to expand on the main plot. Sometimes the elements introduced work fairly well, but other times, the plot falls flat on its face. \\n\\n\r\n*Entertainment Value: 7.9/10-* For me, AssClass' main draw is the humor and entertainment value. While technically being a comedy, AssClass does not seem to try to be funny often enough. It does not make me laugh-out-loud more than one or twice an episode at most and yet the majority of episodes are still amusing throughout. This is best aspect of AssClass; it is simply fun to watch. It might not be engrossing, and it starts to wear out its welcome at points, but the series often kept me entertained.\\n\\n\r\nMy review might make Assassination Classroom sound like a bad anime and that is not the case; it is a fun show to watch. However, whether or not you will like AssClass depends on how enjoyable you find the essentially \"pointless\" episodic episodes, because if you apply any logic to the main plot, it falls apart. With its insane popularity in Japan and a second season on the way, you will be seeing more of Assassination Classroom in the future.\\n\r\n_Watch if you like:_ Shounen, Comedy, Lack of progression\\n\r\n*-6.5/10*\\n",

Now that you've gathered in front of me... well not me, but this text, let's get this review started.\r\nStory: 8/10\r\nThe story of Ansatsu Kyoushitsu is about a alien octopus-creature thingy that destroys the moon and is going to destroy the earth next. A bunch of students with utter-shit grades are told to assassinate him before next year, or, before graduation. I mean, literally, utter-shit grades, they're grades suck, so they're in the E-Class. A.k.a, End Class. End Class is also knownas the Assassination Classroom (WHAAT?! NAME OF DA SHOW! ILLUMINATI CONFIRMED) and well, yeah, the story is simple, yet somehow manages to entertain me.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nThe art/animation whatever the heck you wanna call it, feels somewhat different to other 2015 titles... I don't know why, it just looks different than... well other 2015 titles. I'm not saying it's bad, it's just something I'm not used to. There's a possibility they wanted it to look like that, and that's okay, but... just not used to it. That's all.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is pretty good, I mean, I usually download the opening of every single anime I watch, and, yeah, the openings were good (I preferred the first one, though.) and I never really paid much attention to the other songs that were played in the background and such. But, when I did happen to download the soundtrack, I loved almost every single song that was in it. Great soundtrack, automatic install.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 6/10\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are okay, but... they lack development. I mean, a few characters had great developments, but... other than that, the other characters need more development. I'm sure they will in the future, as I have not read the manga, but for this season, I'm going to say that they lack development. Other than that (yes, i said it again) all the characters in the show are great.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nThe series overall wasn't the most fascinating series I've ever seen in my life, but it was okay. To be honest, I don't think my current favorite anime that's in my favorite anime list will leave any time soon, cuz' they're pretty good. I mean, Monster & Code Geass mate? What can pass dat? I just need to watch more anime, I guess.",

            "content": "I never quite understood what made Assassination Classroom such a popular show; was it because of the unique story? The comedy? The action? Having never seen it myself, I was in no place to make assumptions. Despite the very creative setup for the anime, it never caught my attention and thus have just now gotten around to finishing the first season. And now having seen it, I still found myself coming back to the same question: What makes Assassination Classroom so compelling? After I gave it more thought, I've now collected my thoughts on why a relatively above-average show ended up being more than thesum of its parts by the half-way point, and why it was truly a unique, important experience.\\n\\n\r\nI'll admit, I struggled to get through the first 10 or so episodes of this show. It was a very on and off deal for me, watching small sections and then leaving it for a while before coming back. Something about the anime just didn't sit right with me; the premise was interesting but none of the characters stood out or made me want to come back for more, and the light-hearted comedic tone worked against the theme of \"killing\" and \"assassination\" making the entire underlying narrative seem disjointed and unbalanced. There wasn't focus on any one character, making it difficult to understand the events of the plot through the eyes of the students. The episodic nature of the episodes made it very difficult to watch for long periods of time because of the lack of incentive to continue. Despite my complaints, I stuck to it and kept watching, wanting to find out what really made the show special. \\n\\n\r\nBut I never found it. In fact, as I kept watching, I instead found myself growing more and more interested in what was going to happen next, finally understanding the motivations and backstories behind certain characters and why they were doing the things they did. I lost track of time and how many episodes I'd been through, simply clicking through to watch the next with undeniable anticipation. I realized that there wasn't just one thing that made Assassination Classroom special, but many small things that added up to a genuinely enjoyable experience filled with important life lessons about growing up and finding your place in the world. It wasn't just a dumb comedy anime about a bunch of middle school kids trying to kill a hypersonic tentacle monster, it was a show about the importance of persistence, never giving up no matter how bad your odds, and using your weaknesses to your advantage to find strength. From the very start, I'd been looking at it in the wrong way, setting my expectations at a place they never should've been. I now see how my initial disappointment was misplaced; Assassination Classroom was an unexpected slow burn of a journey and didn't grip me like many of my top rated anime did, but boy was it one-of-a-kind.",

            "content": "Assassination Classroom is a Japanese manga series written and illustrated by Yuusei Matsui and produced by Shueisha,\r\nIt is published in the weekly magazine Weekly Shonen Jump.\r\nThe author is known for another famous Jump work, \"Majin Tantei Neuro Nougami\" which was also published in Shonen Jump from 2005 to 2009,yielding 23 volumes and an anime of 25 episodes.\r\nIt was announced anime adaptation of Assassination Classroom in Jump Super Anime Tour, which took place October 6 to November 24, 2013.\r\nThe anime began his performance on Fuji TV in January 2015 and ended by mid June of that year. The manga currently has 15 volumes.\r\nThe plot tells thestory of a group of 3E of a school called Kunugigaoka and this is where there are two aspects:\\n\r\nthe first is that this school is not a school like the others, since these students should finish school and murderers,\\n\r\nthe second part is that who they have to kill is your teacher best known as Koro-sensei, say a mix between an alien and an octopus in the early history tells us that destroyed a considerable part of the moon and that for the next year plans to destroy the Earth.\\n\r\nSo basically, these students have a double life where act or as normals students or as killers hoping to kill his teacher.\\n\r\nIf someone can kill the Koro-sensei will receive from the Government a reward of 10 million yen equivalent roughly 7 million euros.\\n\r\nThis story received an anime adaptation by Lerche studio with 22 episodes.\\n\r\nThe manga was published by Viz Media in the US. This this anime have several characters differ from each other which makes them unique. We also have new features that we see in the manga as the dash and the personality of each.\\n\\n\r\nReview: Judging by the title, Ansatsu or Assassination (short) seems to be typical of those stories as well as Future Diary\\n\r\nor Battle Royale where it seems can only be a survivor...\\n\r\nWRONG!\\n\r\nThis story is quite different from that where the only person that these students have to kill is the own teacher as this is an alien/yellow octopus worth the reward of 10 million yen.\\n\r\nBy funny enough, Assassination becomes a story a little so bizarre and confusing at the beginning where we have students\\n\r\nin the middle of a lesson using melee weapons and guns that shoot BB bullets (the only bullets in the world that take effect in Koro-sensei) instead of \"decent\" classes.\\n\r\nIt is noteworthy that being an alien / yellow octopus, Koro-sensei is able to achieve Mach 20 speed, change the face color depending on your mood or the answers that students give are right or wrong and still has his \"Definitive mode\" of defense where it is basically a ball inside a transparent sphere and has to stay that way all day.\\n\r\nThese students in anime ever make it end up in experienced killers, which has a good use of weapons both close-range and long-range, fight hand-to-hand and know how to react to a given situation.\\n\r\nI thought in the first 5 episodes the story was boring and boring one bit and thus believe that did not start in the best way\\n\r\nbut then it became so good that now I feel like see again. Is there any suspanse but more in the 6 final episodes where there is a revelation! (Spoiler-free: v)\\n\r\nI recommend this anime but also the manga because it is being edited here (in Portugal) I think it will have a large market demand.\\n\r\nAside: We also have some ecchi because their teacher is a hired assassin who has charm and things (breasts) on the site.... Nagisa is a trap btw ^^\\n\\n\r\n(sorry for my errors) :(",

            "content": "[SPOILER ALERT]\r\nAssassination Classroom, easily said to be one of the best shounen anime by far\r\nat least in my opinion.\r\nI'll simply summarize this entire anime first so beware of potential spoilers.\r\nAssassination Classroom is based around a group of Junior High students with a super creature as their teacher and with two other teachers under one classroom. The students are trained to be assassins with their goal to kill the super creature teacher, Koro-Sensei whom will destroy earth cum March of the next year.\r\nStory 10/10\r\nI gave the story a 10/10 simply because it provided all the necessary elements a shounen anime should provide. Action, drama and more.\r\nItalso included slight romance between the two teachers, although it was mild, the romance never failed to make me laugh.\\n\\n\r\nThe anime had made me laugh countless times from season 1 to season 2.\\n\\n\r\nSeason 1 was extremely fun to watch because the students had just met Koro-Sensei and their futile attempts to \"assassinate\" their teacher were hilarious. Cum the end of Season 1, I got to see the characters grow together and get along with their teacher better, developing new skills, academically and in assassination. The characters go onto many sorts of adventures together and I enjoyed watching the outcome of those adventures, each series of adventure with an unexpected outcome.\\n\\n\r\nThe students also had to take exams and fight with the super smart students who were in the main campus and when the students beat the smarter students, I could feel the joy of watching the main characters!\\n\\n\r\nThe description used to describe everything was a tad exaggerated and hyperbolic but is very relatable. An example would be the exam questions described as a battle with life threatening monsters as the students strive to not get eaten alive. The writer used many hyperbolic descriptions to describe almost everything! \\n\\n\r\nBy the time I started watching Season 2, I already grew to love the characters and know more about their assets, characteristics and skills but I realized I didn't know everything about them as the series go on about the different characters with hidden talents and secrets that they never revealed before.\\n\\n\r\nKoro-Sensei then helps to solve all his students problems as the end draws near. The students face new challenges as I, the viewer face it with them. I have grown to love the anime as much as the students have grown to love their teachers.\\n\\n\r\nThe dense Karasuma-Sensei and the seductive B*tch-Sensei never fails to make me laugh till the end.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters eventually come into an agreement to save their teacher (prevent the destruction of earth) instead of kill him because of Nagisa (a student) \\n\\n\r\nThe students then realize that his death was inevitable and had to make a choice on whether to kill or not.\\n\\n\r\nBy the end of the anime, I grew to love every single character (including supporting characters) and learnt about each of their bad points and good points which were displayed thanks to Koro-Sensei's influence. From the most hated to one of the least hated.\\n\\n\r\nThank you for bringing onto this ride with you guys. \\n\r\nThank you, Assassination Classroom....\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt 10/10\\n\\n\r\nI'd have to say that the art was beautiful. The idea of descriptive and imaginative display of scenarios to exaggerate a certain scene is just... \\n\\n\r\nThe scenery used for certain situations is also on point.\\n\r\nA dark scenery for a situation involving life and death,\\n\r\nA happy scenery for a situation involving victory,\\n\r\nA plain scenery involving personal thoughts and emotions...\\n\\n\r\nThe classroom environment also fits many situations too\\n\r\nand when a certain scenery doesn't fit, filters are added to make the scene darker, brighter etc.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound 10/10\\n\\n\r\nThe music used was definitely fitting for the different scenarios, the music adds the vibe to give us a better exaggeration of a scenario.\\n\\n\r\nThe voice acting is also very good... \\n\\n\r\nEach character has a voice that fits their personality and the voice sort of lightens up when the character becomes less frustrated for example.\\n\\n\r\nExceptions would be the dense Karasuma-Sensei who's voice never changes, very deep voice for a very dense person. A fitting voice for a fitting personality.\\n\\n\r\nThe Opening also left clear hints as to what would happen next to prepare us...\\n\\n\r\nOverall 10/10\\n\\n\r\nAl in all, I have no choice but to give this anime a 10/10.\\n\r\nI will miss you, assassination classroom...",

            "content": "Overall, it you are looking for show about a teacher that loves their students, this is for you. As well, there are few shows I can say have 'changed' my life, and this would be one of them.\r\nI initially saw this anime as just the name \"Assassination Classroom\" accompanied with a creepy smiling face. Looking at the summary, I found the premise: a class must kill their teacher before they graduate. This was only my third anime, so this premise immediately caught be, as no live-action show have something like this. But I could not have expected what this show would be.\r\nAs a quick overview,the story was mediocre, while the art and sound were solid. The characters were what made this show truly amazing, especially the comedy around them. Set in a classroom, there are ~20 characters. While most are not given substantial development, their personalities are all memorable. But it is the teacher, Koro Sensei, who adds the most to the cast, and has honestly impacted me.\\n\\n\r\nHe is just an amazingly caring teacher. Without giving any sort of spoilers, he constantly goes beyond the calling of his job, placing his students above all else (coaching sports, tutoring, ect.). His care for his students make this show. On a personal level I also need to thank this show for making me appreciate teachers I have had that have cared about me similarly to Koro Sensei.",

It's to the point where I am going 'oh yeah I forgot about him/her'. I know I shouldn't be annoyed but it ruins the entire feel of E class all coming togetherif you only know half of them.",

            "content": "Sigh... another potentially good story ruined by a lamppost like execution. And what do I mean by lamppost like execution. Basically, everything is centred around Koro-sensei in that the only reason why the other characters exist is because of Koro-sensei. However, this isn't as lampposty as other anime as Koro-sensei has a decent character and isn't hopelessly there just so others can have some air time. Now for the main review.\r\nStory 4:\r\nThe general outline of the story would've been 9, however the execution of it reduced it to 4. You'd think that having junior-high school students learning to become an assassin would be a greatidea. In fact, this somewhat reminded me of Akuma no Riddle (which wasn't great but it's a comparison). Since it's set in a school setting the writer wanted to have some school related stuff/activities, which is fine. However, it seemed like he wanted to do both assassination and normal school life and what he ended up with was neither.\\n\\n\r\nThere was literally almost no mention of any assassination techniques, nor is there much air time of any assassination related type information, as one would find in say, a cooking/sports anime. In fact this was more of a school life with an assassination theme dlc attached to it. This story feels more like GTO but much more poorly executed and much less interesting.\\n\\n\r\nAnd since this is a shounen series, when the students are presented with the prospect of possibly being allowed to actually kill someone, it's suddenly labelled as bad and they're forced to perform non-lethal takedowns. Basically just another generic, naive moralistic story that's contradictory since their entire purpose is to assassinate their teacher.\\n\\n\r\nArt 9:\\n\r\nThere's not much to complain about the art, but perhaps with the lighting on the faces a tad too bright. I didn't explicitly notice any weird frames or distorted characters so not much to complain about overall.\\n\\n\r\nSound 6:\\n\r\nIntro/outro not my type, the BGM isn't memorable and the voice acting is pretty standard stuff.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 3:\\n\r\nHere's the majority of the show's problem. We get introduced to a large cast where most of them are then given very little personality due to the lack of air time for each one. As we go further in we are introduced to another couple of characters who then continue to serve very little purpose to the overall story. \\n\\n\r\nWe get introduced to Karuma who's the cool/lazy/smart guy who's just there for convenient purposes. We get introduced to the AI who becomes a huge plot convenience outside of her introduced episode. We get introduced to Ms. Bitch who ended up being an unfunny gag and is sidelined for most of the episodes. And... there's the bunch of the other classroom students that we really have no idea about because neither their background nor determination to assassinate is explored. A bunch of other characters appear for a brief period of time to 'spice up' the anime, but in reality, it feels like they just diluted the entire story instead.\\n\\n\r\nNow for Nagisa. He's our main protagonist and was thrown into Class E for... no one really knows... with the anime complete, I still don't know how much he has developed. Supposedly he has great potential to be an assassin except he's never actually allowed to kill anyone (besides the octopus) and we don't really know how good he is since we have had very little to compare to, not to mention the lack of actually seeing him train. The majority of the time he is on, we just see him enjoying a somewhat normal school life, or having an exposition on what's happening/happened so far. \\n\\n\r\nThis story would've been much more interesting if it was focused between Koro-sensei and the school's headmaster and dropping the assassination theme all together, as we actually spend more time focusing on the students welfare/education than we do about their actual ability to assassinate.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 4:\\n\r\nThere's not really much humour, you're not inspired, you're not thrilled, you're not given the sensation of anything much overall.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 4:\\n\r\nIt tried implementing morality of killing in an assassination themed story, which makes no sense at all. They introduced several characters which have killed more than a dozen high value targets, yet it's somehow wrong for the students to do the same thing (which they are actually being trained to do). So the anime both tries to glorify assassination and denounce it at the same time, leading it to be unable to present a compelling story.",

            "content": "\u6697\u6bba\u6559\u5ba4 (Assassination Classroom) is one of the most enjoyable animes I have ever watched. Nothing in this show failed to surprise me in the slightest, even going so far to bring in plot points you have long forgotten about.\r\nThe story of Ansatsu Kyoushitsu never slows down. Whilst many animes with 22 episodes love to add filler episodes to fill up space, this anime uses these 'filler episodes' to make you learn more about the characters - and boy, is there a lot of characters to learn about.\r\nArt style is refreshing. I have not yet seen another anime with the sort of comic-book style the showresonates. Very unique, yet not overly complicated for its own good.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound - more off, the music - is what you expect in a show about assassination. It builds tension and pays off with a realistic situation - or even humorous one. The voice acting in both sub and dub are well done, but as an English speaker, I kept with the dub. It did not ruin the experience for me.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are all separate and each have their flaws and weaknesses. E Class is full of teenagers, rejected by the school they chose to be taught in, simply because they behave differently with the common agenda. The teachers of E Class, including Kuro-sensei, are teachers I wish I had whilst I was in high school. Likable and good at counseling - while keeping their own skills apart of them.\\n\r\nThe only gripe I have with the characters of this anime - and why characters are not 10/10 - is the non-E Class school children. Sure, they are despicable, however nothing else can be said about their personalities. They are not as rounded as I wanted them to be and it is a shame, considering how rounded the main characters are.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment. Holy shit, this anime made me laugh out loud so many times. It is a perfect blend of humorous tension and real life tension, all mixed into a lovely fluffy dough. Most animes seem to dump its message in the name of humor, however this anime did not, keeping its message of 'never giving up, even in the face of defeat' whilst adding humor that all age groups can laugh at. The characters are beaten down, get up, crack a one liner, and bite back. I love this show because of that.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, this is a total recommendation for anyone who wants a fun, yet relateable anime. You will not regret spending 22 episodes with E Class and, of course, Kuro-sensei.",

            "content": "(Warning! This review is for both seasons! You have been warned!)\r\nHave you ever watched that kind of anime? You know, the one in which you're not quite sure about what the hell you just watched yet somehow enjoyed it anyways? That, my friends, is my experience with Assassination Classroom. The most \"WTF!?\" Anime I've ever seen.\r\nStory: \r\nThe plot is mostly episodic. There is some plot development here and there, but for the most part, it's mostly just a set of events of this messed up class and their even more messed up teacher.\r\nAnd through what can only be called a miracle, it works.\r\nThe events thatdo happen are extremely memorable, combined with the fact this show has one good sense of humor. Seriously, there was almost no episode in which at one point I didn't burst out laughing. And when I wasn't laughing, I was crying like a baby. For as, despite it mostly being a comedy, the show handles drama extremely well.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\\n\r\nNo matter how good the plot was, it will be for nothing if the characters aren't good. Since we have a bunch of characters, I'll only focus on some of them.\\n\r\nLet's start with the main trio of Nagisa, Karma and Kaede. Nagisa is definitely intersting. He (Yes, he is a guy) is weirdly unsurprised about the fact that her teacher is a giant octopus that can talk. He's also disturbingly good at assassination. Good enough that the actual assassin on the show is unnerved by him. He Even manages to get a decent bunch of development too.\\n\r\nThat said, like many, I found Karma to be my favorite of the three. Like Nagisa, this guy isn't normal, and it's even more readily apparent with him as he almost looks like if he came from a completely different show. The guy's definitely unhinged, yet he's also surprisingly friendly and easygoing. Plus, he's just plain badass.\\n\r\nKaede probably gets the least focus out of the three, likely because she doesn't get to do anything until around halfway through season 2. I will admit the twist with her was really well done, and I'll admit I do pity that girl, especially since he does make an effort to better herself after the reveal.\\n\r\nNext up are the teachers. To start off, Koro-Sensei's basically the coolest teacher ever since Eikichi Onizuka (They're both even perverts! Though to be fair, Koro-Sensei never hits on his students) The guy's so amiable and just plain fun to be around you have to wonder why the hell they have to kill him. Spoiler: The reasons aren't pretty.\\n\r\nNaturally, we need a perfect foil to him, and no one could be more perfect for that than Karasuma. The guy straight up never smiles. In fact, the one time he does smile, it's clear it's basically a dream. In spite of this he does care for the little ones and when push comes to shove, he'll do anything them.\\n\r\nFinally is (As Nicknamed by Karma) Bitch-Sensei. Bitch is a very appropriate name for her too, as early on, she is a bitch. Still though she does better herself as the show goes on and eventually shows herself to be a completely respectable adult. Oh, and her crush on Karasuma during Season 2 was hilarious.\\n\r\nNext up are the two transfer students. First is Ritsu (I am not even going to try calling her by her actual name) who is literally and figuratively a vocaloid in a monolith with guns strapped onto it. She's orignally emotionless and, well, robotic, but then Koro-Sensei upgrades her Hardware (Literally) and she becomes a complete genki girl. She doesn't do much after her introduction, but I just needed to mention her.\\n\r\nThe second is Itona, who doesn't even formally join the cast until season 2. He has the same tentacle powers as Koro-Sensei, but he is ultimately human. He opposes the class for the entirety of the first season, but joins them later on. He sadly doesn't do much after joining the group, but I'd say the journey to get there was worth it.\\n\r\nFinally is everyone else. They're fine, but with a few exceptions, they don't get much to do. They're fun characters though, so I can't complain.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation:\\n\\n\r\nSurprisingly the show looks quite good. The animation is very fluid and fast, yet it just manages to make everything even more lively. The characters designs are also quite varied, though I swear to God Karma looks more like the principal's son than the principal's actual son.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\\n\r\nIt's alright, I guess, but nothing really stood out to me. And I have no idea what was up with the openings.\\n\\n\r\nVoice Acting:\\n\\n\r\nAs you would expect, the acting is fantastic. Jun Fukuyama as Koro-Sensei just completely steals whatever scene his in, giving so much life and joy to his character that it's ridiculous. Tomokazu Sugita is great as Karasuma, and its amazing how the guy who voices Joseph Joestar can so effortlessly play a stoic character. Of special mention is Nobuhiko Okamoto as Karma. While this wasn't his first role, it was the first I experienced, and let's just say I quickly became a fan of his. Everyone else is great too, from Mamoru Miyano, Show Hayami, Kenta Miyake and even the one and only Megumi Ogata.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: \\n\\n\r\nIf you haven't noticed it yet, I really loved this show. And honestly, I think this can serve as a very good gateway anime for newcomers. It's not flawless, but damn if it isn't entertaining.\\n\\n\r\nFinal Score: 9/10",

            "content": "Truly the best anime ever created. If you are currently a student, then this is something that you should watch. Season 1 is slightly more humorous than season 2, where things start to get real, and so it is really a nice way to enjoy the introduction of characters and see how they are developed before moving on to the core elements of the plot.\r\nStory: 10/10\r\nThe story is amazing. As I have said earlier, it is about a school, with a slight twist of assassination. However, the assassination does not get in the way of the core message about the school system. Being in alocal school in Singapore, I myself feel the pressure brought about through studies. Hence, despite the initial plot twist about assassination, the plot is nothing more than a school setting with core values that will touch your heart.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 10/10\\n\r\nI would say that the art is still good. However, those that would have already watched Kimi no na Wa, or even Tokyo Ghoul would feel that the art is not up to standard. Personally, I feel that the art matches perfectly to the joyful times of school, and so it is still pretty enjoyable.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10/10\\n\r\nOpening and ending tracks are perfect in reflecting the currently happier themes in the anime, and sounds and music played during the course of the anime will keep you riveted. A great companion to the art.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10/10\\n\r\nInteresting character developments in the first season as you get to know the characters a lot more, along with the current position that they are facing. Over the course of the anime, you will discover that there is more to it than just assassination, but being a class, united.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\r\nI have thoroughly enjoyed this anime, being a student myself. Each episode covers something new that adds an interesting twist, keeping you engaged with it all the way until you reach the end of season 2.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 10/10\\n\r\nAs I have said, this is truly a masterpiece, and to all of you students out there, this is something that you have to watch. Do not forget that there is a season 2 which moves to be more serious. Look out for my review on season 2!",

            "content": "When I first saw the preview last year, I knew that this anime was going to be great. When I watched the first episode, it exceeded my expectations. I can relate to the Class 3-E students because I struggled in school both academically and personally. The story does you part of Class 3-E, it makes you step into the students shoes.\r\nPros of watching Assassination Classroom:\r\n-Engaging story\r\n-Superb Art & Animation \r\n-Some of the characters were interesting \r\n-Unique MC (Honestly, not that many anime have a trap as the main protagonist)\r\n-Memorable OST\r\n-Great skits and outside references. \r\nCons of Watching Assassination Classroom:\r\n-Some Class 3-E students were either leftout or late in development. \\n\r\n-Some characters still need development.\\n\r\n-Koro-sensei is too OP. It makes everyone else look very weak. \\n\r\n-Steady to slow pace. The anime still has a lot of chapters from the manga to cover this upcoming season. \\n\\n\r\nTop 5 Characters from Assassination Classroom w/reviews:\\n\r\n1. Koro-Sensei: \\n\r\nKorosensei is a teacher we wished we all had. Even though he's a dangerous threat to the world, he cares deeply for his student. He uses a creative teaching style that blends assassination with academics. Korosensei does this by using his Mach 20 speed to help his students with their weakest subjects. \\n\r\n2. Nagisa Shiota:\\n\r\nArguably the unique anime MCs ever made. Who ever thought that trap would make it to the MC position. Nagisa is the center of class 3-E, he has great leadership among his classmates and guides them to success. \\n\r\n3. Karma Akabane:\\n\r\nThe most badass character in the series. This guy is a loner who likes doing things his way and always succeeds in it. He's the boss when it comes to assassination and has the most impressive skills in Class-3E. Karma is there to motivate others to become as strong as him.\\n\r\n4. Tadaomi Karasuma\\n\r\nKarasuma shows through love towards his students; that doesn't make him a bad teacher. In fact, he's P.E. teacher we wished we all had. He takes his time to train his students effectively. He's also the first line of defense when the students are in danger. Karasuma teaches his students skills for both killing Koro-Sensei and protecting themselves. You'll see Class 3-E perfect the skills that Karasuma taught them on the final five episodes. \\n\r\nThis means that Korosensei helps the student boost their academic skill while Karasuma helps them boost their stats.\\n\r\n5. Ry\u016bnosuke Chiba and Rinka Hayami (The Sniper Duo) (Tie)\\n\r\nThese two are one of the most underrated characters of the series. They're the Class 3-E's top snipers/long-range fighters. Both characters have perfect chemistry since both shares similar personality traits. \\n\r\nFun fact: Rinka has the same VA as Sekai from School Days and Chiba shares the same VA as Ryuuji from Toradora. \\n",

            "content": "Assassination Classroom isn't perfect nor close to a masterpiece.\r\nThe story starts of with Koro-sensei (Not his real name), chops the moon down to a permanent crescent. He then became a teacher at Kunugigaoka Middle School's Class 3-E, because he wanted to. The students on that section were assigned to kill this mysterious creature and they will be awarded TEN BILLION YEN. However, the mysterious creature is simply indestructible (Or is it?). By the time they graduate, Koro-sensei will destroy planet Earth (Or will he?)\r\nAlthough the story sounds engaging, don't get too engaged. Koro-sensei isn't really much of a villain on the story. He acts goodtowards his students and teaches them what is right. The reason why I only gave the story a 7/10 is because I don't see where it is going. This season didn't even give a lot of answers surrounding Koro-sensei. I guess we'll just have to wait for Season 2.\\n\\n\r\nI thought the animation is amazing. The coloring of it and the fight scenes are pretty great. For the soundtrack, it's pretty good. It has it's ups and downs. There are some soundtrack that are good while some are decent. For the opening, I prefer the second opening over the first. In fact, the second opening is probably one of my favorite openings this year (Not kidding). Am I the only one? For the ending theme, it's really good. I can feel the emotion on how far we've been on a journey with Koro-sensei.\\n\\n\r\nThere are characters worth remembering (Aside from Koro-sensei) on this story like Nagisa (the trap), Karma, Karasuma, and Bitch-sensei (And probably others that I forgot to mention). They offer humor that makes me laugh. However, I do feel like the anime adds too much cast, that I feel like someone is left out. I can only remember some of the character's names and faces while some, I only remember the face, but not the name. By the way, I am talking about the characters in Class 3-E. Not the villains/assassins that appear throughout the show. I wish the anime pulled of something that makes the entire class memorable. Another flaw is Koro-sensei alone. He has a bland characterization, but I do feel like he's just another troll of the story. I don't think he is going to blow up planet Earth.\\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed the show's story especially the end of Season 1. I have no problems with it. Though, for it's humor, it's mix. There are some that I laughed hard, while some parts of this show doesn't make me laugh. Overall,  if you're looking for a comedy/action anime, this could be it. Looking forward to Season 2.\\n\\n\r\nScore: 7.6/10",

Me neither, I suck at making puns.\\n\\n\r\nThe premise sounds silly and not meant to be taken seriously, but along the way, the anime tried to be serious, poignant and philosophical and it was out of place. The two themes didn\u2019t mix too well and it ended up half-assed. Writers, please pick one, you can't have raisins and chocolate chips in a cookie at the same time.\\n\\n\r\nArt and sounds 6.5: Fairly okay but nothing standing out that\u2019s for sure.\\n\\n\r\nPlot: 6\\n\r\nThe plot got going during the first few episodes. You would expect many wacky and hilarious situations when they try to kill him but there weren't many, and after a while you forgot that the class was supposed to kill the teacher because they were tripping on mad shrooms while taking exams and talk about how miserable their school lives were instead. I wish I could talk about how miserable MY school life was right now.\\n\\n\r\nEvery now and again there are filler episodes in which new characters are introduced, cause troubles for everyone, get their asses whooped then seemingly disappear forever. From the start to the end, you could notice some progress as they got closer to orga\u2026 erm, killing the tentacle monster; but overall the pace was slower than my grandma trying to type a word on a computer.\\n\\n\r\nThe final arc was so stupid, it built up tension out of nowhere and the resolved in some deus ex tentacle bs that was extremely anti-climactic. Also, the class sure takes their time when half of them are about to be dead, I was irritated watching the final arc, why is it even there?\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 4\\n\r\nThe class itself already has a crap ton of characters, but instead of giving them screentime and developing them, the anime introduces new characters over and over again, and in the end no one gets development at all, just some principle characteristics like love for baseball, bugs n shit. Who cares about that? Some important characters are:\\n\r\n- Korosensei, the tentacle monster himself. What the fuck is he? What the fuck he wants? Why is he so obsessed with middle school girls and boys? When is he gonna grope those  fresh underaged tits? We basically don\u2019t know shit about him, save for the fact that he\u2019s fast.\\n\r\n- The dude who has gender identity crisis, little is known about him but he\u2019s soooo maliciously innocent you\u2019d want to have his virginity at first sight but then you\u2019d hesitate because you\u2019re not into homosexuality and you\u2019re not sure if that\u2019s a dude or a girl.\\n\r\n- The sexy badass redhead who thinks he\u2019s boss and could ace exams without having to study (like me, lolz). YOU UNDERESTIMATE MAH POWAH!!! He had decent characterization and some development, and was the most memorable character imo. Still he didn\u2019t receive screentime for the majority of the time.\\n\r\n- The blonde bimbo who was supposed to help assassinate Korosensei but after one or two failed attempts, she faded off into the background as an eye candy, and didn\u2019t do jack shit most of the time since. What a Bitch.\\n\r\n- The cool Japanese CIA dude also had potential and was more prominent, but didn\u2019t get developed much. And everyone was all over him because he\u2019s supposedly cool and dangerous, but in the end he seemingly had no big impacts.\\n\r\n- The fat Japanese CIA dude gets special scrutiny because LOL he got so salty over some retarded shit like a kid beating his ass in his own game. He was so comically evil, his motive was so ludicrous I can\u2019t even take him seriously. What the fuck not even online games players are that salty over kids beating them. What is this fatass smoking?\\n\\n\r\nVERDICT: 6/10\\n\r\n- Made me laugh from time to time, but over time the comedy became redundant and repetitive.\\n\r\n- Logic was broken and so was physics but let\u2019s just admit that Korosensei himself is a huge middle finger to Newton and Einstein.\\n\r\n- AC raised more questions and mysteries than it answers, plot is half-assed and very inconsistent. Story progression was incredibly slow. Sitting through 22 episodes of this felt like forever.\\n\r\n- Characters were largely forgettable, the few in the spotlight weren\u2019t given much depth.\\n\r\n- Theme is silly but tried too hard to be serious at times to make viewers ponder about the meaning of life, all I pondered about is what the fuck is going on.\\n\r\n- Final arc was more bs than my review of the anime itself.\\n\\n\r\nI have a very mixed feeling about this anime chiefly due to its inability to stay consistent on the plot and mood, otherwise it's certainly fresh and fun to watch. To enjoy this, you\u2019d have to turn off your brain and totally ignore the \u201cserious\u201d parts, else you\u2019d just find it ridiculous.",

From the premise, I assumed it would somewhat dark and thriller-esque, but I guess I should have known it wouldn't be knowing that the teacher was a large Octopus creature with a perpetual shit-eating grin. \r\nThat said, I really enjoyed this anime. It had tons of laughs and was just really fun and light-hearted. The characters are all so loveable and have great chemistry with one another. The reason AC gets a 6.5 rating from me though is that I felt the sub-plots distracted from the main story rather than fleshing it out. Attimes it felt like the show was determined to focus on everything EXCEPT the task of the students accomplishing their mission with it's constant introduction of new characters or plot points. Maybe I just have a one-track mind, but I would have liked the story to be a little more streamlined. \\n\\n\r\nWorth watching though, as there's tons of action, and it's a surprisingly feel-good anime and the animation is quality.\\n",

At first I was skeptical as the plot seemed rather whacky and I mainly continued for the comedy factor, but after about an episode or two I was positively hooked. For those looking for a really thick and quickly developed plot, this isn't really for you. The lot can move quite slowly, but you grow to love the characters this way, and each character is perfectly thought through. It uses a school setting to add lots of comedy, and each episode made me laugh out loud. However, it can have its sad moment, that can make you cry veryhard. I still cry sometimes when rewatching it even though I've seen it so many times before. Overall, this anime was positively amazing. It was a rollercoaster of emotions, leaving you on edge in some areas, and your cheeks aching from laughter in others. I would definitely recommend this to anyone looking for stuff to watch.",

            "content": "OK, as this is my first review, everybody bear with me.\r\nMy friend actually first recommended this to me, and when I read a summary online, I was quite skeptical at first, because I thought I'd be getting myself into  some crazy thing that'd give me nightmares 20 years down the road. But I'm very glad I decided to try it I must say, this is probably one of the funniest shows I've ever seen. Period. \r\nThe basis of the story is students of the E-Class in a elite school are assigned to assassinate their new teacher, who they named Koro-Sensei, or unkillable. Koro-Sensei justblew up the moon, and if the students can't assassinate him by March, he'll blow up the earth too. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 8/10\\n\r\nThe art is pretty good. However, the artists made it pretty clear which characters are the center of attention, and which are just more side characters. Still, nothing bad and certainly better than anything I can do.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 7/10\\n\r\nThe music is pretty average. Nothing super impressive, but it does fit well with the show. \\n\r\nThe voice acting is what I find quite impressive. They managed to have over 20 characters and still somehow keep each character just a bit different and unique from the other ones. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 9/10 \\n\r\nAhh... the star of the show, the E-Class. For a show with so many characters, each one is developed very well. After the 22 episodes, it feels like you know each and every one of the characters personally, well the ones that are focused on at least, more on that later. I won't go through every character in the show because clearly, there are too many. However, I will give a mention to Nagisa, the main protagonist, and the cutest to ever walk this Earth. He starts off as a shy, almost wimpy looking character, but over the course of the story, he develops the most. Next, of course is Koro-Sensei, the tentacle wielding teacher of the E-Class that seems to be able to do just anything. Although he doesn't develop much throughout the story, he plays a key role in helping the students of the E-Class grow. And special shout out to my favorite character, Bitch-Sensei, the assassin that uses her beauty and seducing skills to overcome her targets. She just makes the show that much funnier.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I really like how different and unique each of the characters are, but  yet they are still all united by one common goal. The show does a great job of developing and showcasing each of them.\\n\\n\r\nMy only gripe is that not each character is developed evenly, and some of the side characters barely get any screen time, which is annoying.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\r\nI found it very funny, and definitely got a good workout from all the laughing I did. However, much of the humor is derived from slapstick and inappropriate topics, so it definitely isn't for everyone. Even still, the plot and characters are quite intriguing and should still be an enjoyable watch.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nUnique plot, great characters with good voice acting, and plenty to laugh at. \\n\r\nOne of my favorite anime this whole year. \\n\r\nI must say, some of the stuff said on this show should not be uttered by middle schoolers.",

            "content": "The weird part is, I can\u2019t pinpoint exactly what I enjoyed so much about this show. It wasn\u2019t like each element was outstanding; more like the whole was much greater than the sum of its parts. \r\nThe story was utterly absurd \u2013 there\u2019s no way round this. The premise of a being who has promised to destroy the world, but not before he has taught a particular middle-school class for a year? Pure nonsense. Illogical. Irrational. And yet the story took itself so seriously, treating this nonsense for all the world like it was totally reasonable. Most plot points in the anime were thought outin a realistic way (like all the possible ways to kill their teacher, how to keep his identity under wraps, compensation from the government etc.) while ignoring the fact that the entire premise completely defies logic itself. Not in a fantasy way either; this story is set in real life. It was almost like the anime itself was the straight man in a comedy duo, a very specific type of humour that I personally found hilarious. Fascinating to watch, and exciting to boot. \\n\\n\r\nAlthough you basically know how the anime\u2019s gonna end from the get go (simply because it\u2019s that type of anime), there are plenty of twists and turns to keep you entertained, along with some cool fights and a few suspenseful moments. Who knew that a bunch of kids taking midterms and finals could be so much fun to watch? I certainly didn\u2019t feel that way when I was taking mine. Something as ordinary as exams can be turned into a battle of minds. It reminded me a little of Light and L\u2019s mental battles in Death Note.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters next. Assassination Classroom has a big cast, and in just 22 episodes there\u2019s obviously not enough time to cover every character in depth. We barely see any backstory from anyone. That doesn\u2019t matter though, as these aren\u2019t your normal anime protagonists. There aren\u2019t any tragic backstories, absent parents, and they don\u2019t have the endless power of nakama or unexplainable likeableness to rely upon. They\u2019re basically a bunch of relatively normal middle-school kids. Each of them has their own little set of mannerisms, likes and dislikes. They\u2019re a group, and they grow as a group. \\n\\n\r\nThat isn\u2019t to say that they\u2019re all vanilla by any means. Nagisa, Karma, and Terasaka are all superb characters whose personalities change as they face various challenges in and out of the classroom (especially Nagisa, but that\u2019s to be expected as the MC and all). Even the one-dimensional characters were fun to watch, because they all contributed something. Each student was an important part of the class, and this made the sense of camaraderie between everyone all the more heart-warming and believable. The only character I was confused about was Kayano. She appears on the front cover and a lot in the op themes, so I expected her to have a big part, but she was one of the least developed characters in the series. She could have done with a lot more screen-time, or at the very least have been featured in some more character interactions.\\n\\n\r\nKarasuma and Irina were good characters who were both interesting themselves (or comic relief, in Irina\u2019s case), and able to act as plot devices when needed. So too the students in other classes, they spiced things up nicely during the exam arc in particular.\\n\\n\r\nBut the best character by far is Koro-sensei. He just steals the show. Respect to Jun Fukuyama for a magnificent performance as his seiyuu. Koro-sensei\u2019s incredibly volatile, switching from smug to angry to embarrassed within the blink of an eye. His sudden and frequent changes in mood keep the tone light, and keep you guessing what he\u2019ll do next. He\u2019s also a phenomenal teacher; he knows exactly what to say and when and how to say it. You could actually attribute the entire class\u2019 growth to him. Most real-life teachers dream about being able to make a difference to their students\u2019 lives the way Koro-sensei does in the anime. So many important and profound messages are hidden in this series. Don\u2019t be fooled by the comedy aspect; the lessons Koro-sensei gives apply equally in the real world, and to all different areas of life. Even if you don\u2019t like the anime as a whole, it\u2019s still worthwhile to take the lessons from it. \\n\\n\r\nThe music was catchy, lively, and although a bit too cheerful for some of the later episodes, it really did get me pumped up each time I heard it.\\n\\n\r\nThe art was unusual, lots of very strong black lines combined with bright colours. It looked great, and so did the animation. All strong positives for the show.\\n\\n\r\nWell, you can probably tell that I very much enjoyed this. I\u2019ve seen a lot of school anime, and this is definitely one of the best. It has all the components a good show needs, and the assassination aspect was unique and refreshing. It does stray quite far from the original goal in the final arc and become much more like your standard shounen, but even those parts were immensely enjoyable because it felt like they actually built on the plot and characters that had been developed the rest of the series. I couldn\u2019t wait to watch each new episode.\\n\\n\r\nI\u2019d recommend to fans of\u2026well, basically anything. Comedy\u2019s a given, but there are a lot of other things to love in this anime too. Just don\u2019t go in expecting a horror, romance, or thriller/mystery. XD\\n\\n",

The backgrounds, however, weren't that impressive, but it's forgivable, giving the fact you rarely move your eyes away from the characters.\r\n-Story (7.5/10)\r\nOK, this part is tricky, when first starting the show. The concept asa whole was and is still ridiculous and stupid, I mean, middle schoolers training to assassinate a mutated life form? Really? But it's not that bad considering the anime is a slice of life comedy (kinda), so the point is following characters who are developing along the way of the story progression, and on that part, the show did very well,\\n\\n\r\n-Characters (8/10)\\n\r\nTremendous characters are introduced, and most if not all of them are main characters in some sort, they are all developed while the story progresses, have different treats, weak and strong points, and interesting personalities, however, the main character felt weird dare I say, he was not too forced neither was he uninteresting, in fact, you might debate that other supposedly (not mainly main characters) are better in each in appearance and charm.\\n\\n\r\n-Music (6.5/10)\\n\r\nNothing too special, nor is it too bad, other than the openings and the ending, it was little close to awful, some shows have remarkable OST that keeps you immersed in the plot, but this show didn't seem to have all that interesting soundtracks that go along the theme in general,\\n\\n\r\n-Enjoyment (8.5/10)\\n\r\nEven though all weak points of this show, I still had a hell of fun watching and following the plot and characters as they developed, Humor is what interested me the most.\\n\\n\r\n-Overall, I give this 7.7/10, I expected the show to be awful, unnecessary and uninteresting, but, watching it till the end, made me question the reason I avoided watching it a long time ago, I drove in with 0 expectations, and ended up loving it, good show to say the least.",

            "content": "Assassination Classroom is a very comedic anime about students attempting to kill their unkillable octopus teacher. \r\nI loved this anime, but not many people love the idea of it. For example, my sister find the anime weird that the teacher looks like an octopus, and my friends hated the guys personality, while other friends loved it to bits and my brothers thought of it as a masterpiece.\r\nSo that should give you a feel for the type of anime it can be. I myself, as I wrote before, loved it.\r\nThe anime is beautifully animated with bright colours and beautifully detailed sceneries. And the characters are brilliant,loveable and as relateable as the plotline can allow them to be.\\n\r\nThere were moments where I was biting my tongue to keep from bursting out laughing and other times I was biting my nails at the intensity of the situation given to the characters. \\n\r\nThe story is a creative idea, but very impossible and sometimes that can be frustrating as a viewer but there's also a feeling of amusement to it. \\n\r\nOverall, I really liked this anime, it cheered me up and even holds lessons on morality and information on school life and the importance of teamwork/friendship.\\n\\n\r\nThe style was good, I myself watched it subbed but dub is available, the acting was good, the story was creative and characters memorable. \\n\\n\r\nI give it a 9/10 because I enjoyed it immensely altogether, and eagerly await whatever comes next for the anime.",

            "content": "Another manga of Matsui Yusei comes to realization, this time explicitly following the manga.\r\nEver since Majin Tentei Nougami Neuro I have been waiting for another amazing  manga from Yusei and I had my doubts about Assassination Classroom. However, reading it, and now watching the anime, it's clear that Yusei's style went through. (Something that didn't happen when making the anime for Nougami Neuro, which is a shame because the manga is amazing.)\r\nAssassination Classroom has a straight forward main story- kill the teacher. Complication comes with the characters and their development. Backstory isn't as present, nor is romance, but I don't think the anime islacking for it. Considering I read the manga, backstory will come on it's own if it's relevant to the story. \\n\\n\r\nThe art is classic Yusei style which I fell in love with while reading Nougami Neuro. It wasn't formulated and in MTNN it was filled with gruesome depictions. As such, it's great to see it come to life on the big screen with all the Yusei's quirks and humor. \\n\r\nAs for sound I personally didn't like the opening though the ending was fair. As for scene music it was barely noticeable and usually went with the mood. \\n\\n\r\nPersonally, I was amazed how they managed to not butcher Irina Jelavic (holy shmit they got her name right) and it was wonderful hearing my language in the tenth episode. It was actually comprehensible! (Unlike what I heard in BBC Sherlock but that's a whole other rant.)\\n\r\nAnd, of course, the 19th episode was amazing, using Kana Ueda cast as Yuzuki Fuwa to promote MTNN and using Katsuragi Yako's usual line. Personally, my two favorite moments. \\n\\n\r\nIf you like strange things and weirder comedy and you have nothing to do, you should watch this.",

            "content": "Why does a show that has no killing in it call itself \"Assassination classroom?\" Almost 50 episodes of training to be an \"assassin\" and noone actually gets killed, the only reason I even finished both seasons was because I was stuck in the countryside with no internet for 2weeks with a bunch of anime downloaded on my tablet, like a quarter of it being this shows 2 seasons, GOD what a mistake. Okay im gonna be taking a massive shit on this anime later in the review, but first the spoiler-free review with the story, concept n all that. Also the purpose of this reviewis to give you a different perpective on this anime.\\n\\n\r\n1. Story - as I said its fucking retarded and shoudnt call itself anything to do with assassination but ill go into that later. \\n\r\n2. Concept - makes no fuckin sense really (more about that later)\\n\r\n3. Art - This would be probably the strongest point this anime as it has an unique artstyle that sets it apart from most.\\n\r\n4. Sound - I mean I liked the last opening and overall it was decent I guess\\n\r\n5. Characters - Apart from the octopus, I quite enjoyed the big cast of this anime.\\n\r\nShould you watch it? I wouldnt unless youre really young and dont really care if the story or anything makes sense or not. Now for the meat of this review - the shit talking I guess? (Spoilers)\\n\\n\r\nSo lets start, firstly it really pisses me off that its called \"Assassination classroom\" when it doesnt deserve it. Most of the episodes are spent on these students studying and trying to get good grades to the point where a more accurate title would be \"Studying classroom\" cause its literally more deep and intense than the assassination part of this show as that is just a fun litte thing each episode that you know will never work and its often not even serious, like for example making a giant pudding. I dont understand why they keep on pushing this message that \"you have to be ready to kill and be an assassin\" and whatever cause noone gets assassinated, when theres a bad guy he just gets knocked out and taken to the cops or whatever. I said before that the studying is more deep than the assassination and that is even more true if you consider that these assassinating \"skills\" that they learn are used to get good grades on tests... yeah seriously, the assassination part feels kinda like the small little anecdotes at the end of a newspaper. Now most of you would probably argue that they did assassinate someone and that someone is \"koro-sensei\" but that is most definetly not true as he was trapped in some barrier which was gonna kill him, he didnt fight back and even asked the students to do it. Put those 3 together it is not even close to an assassination and I wouldnt consider it even a killing as he wouldve died anyway and BEGGED them to kill him. Reminds me of that kiznaiver review I wrote back in like 2016 where there was this girl running around with a knife acting all emo and telling everybody that she killed her friend or whatever when she had nothing to do with it, that friend had some disease from birth and everybody knew she was gonna die or something like that, its fucking retarded like if I had a friend that died could I claim that I also killed him, anyway my point is even with all those things, it still took them like 5 minutes to actually go through with it in what was supposed to be an \"emotional scene\" where everybody breaks down. Now some of you could argue that it doesnt have to be bloody or edgy but if the entire show is based around assassination and every episode you see some character talking about how they have to kill and acting super emo IT DOES, its so heavly pushed onto you and when they actually fight some bad guy GOTTA MAKE SURE NOT TO KILL HIM OR ANY OF HIS FRIENDS GOTTA TAKE EM TO THE COPS CAUSE WE ARE FUCKING ASSASSINS. If you wanna make a shitty show about studying and family fun dont make it about assassination or killing, this is like the ultimate clickbait of anime. Aaah I know im missing so much shit about this show considering how long and flawed it is, but its been a while since I saw it and I think this is enough for a review trust me though, its alot worse and has alot more retarded things in it.\\n\\n\r\nOverall this anime is shit because its like the clickbait of anime - it has nothing to do with assassination or killing and its extremely cringy to see this message pushed that \"we have to be ready to kill\" when you know damn well they cant do it and most of the episodes are spent on studying and its really serious in this show, like more serious than the assassination. I only gave it a semi-good rating because of the unique artstyle on the last OP...\\n\\n\r\nAlso I feel like I need to say this : I know that every question can be answered with \"kids.\" Why make the show about assassination when noone gets assassinated - kids like it, but im not here to criticize kids who dont care if the story makes sense or anything really. The high rating for this anime doesnt come from kids.",

GIRL WAS HE RIGHT BC I FREAKING LOVED THIS!! The back stories of some of the characters humanizes them and really makes you want to be on their side and shows how much Koro-sensei cares about his students. Dont even get me started on his back story bc then I'll end up giving you guys spoilers! LOL but the last 2 episodes is where the real heartstrings become pulledbecause YOU WILL CRY! Throughout this whole anime I was really into it and didnt really think it was sad at all, until the last 2 eps!!! It was really touching and moving to see how all the characters developed and how much they have grown as a group and as student/teacher relationships. I would totally recommend this anime 10/10. It is pretty amazing how well it was and how great the ending was!!",

            "content": "Assassination classroom is one of those anime\u2019s that keep you thinking about it from months on end. Personally, I loved the show, the humour can be slightly hit or miss but, in my opinion, that show is going to be enjoyable for most people who watch it, it really had something for everyone. Where assassination classroom excels is in its character development. That anime; even with its condensed time frame was amazing at showing different sides of characters, showing how they learned, got better and continued. It\u2019s a very charming show that highlights a more joyful side to the \u201ckilling game\u201d trope. It was niceto see a fun twist placed on a trope with such a negative connotation. \\n\\n\r\nSeeing characters interacting with each other through such an unorthodox method is enjoyable especially when you see relationships develop especially with Koro-sensei. Though its character development is phenomenal I do think they could have done a little better with the soundtrack to me it\u2019s kind of felt a bit left in the back ground in some scenes. It was there but it could have been fantastic same said about the closing songs. Other than that, the openings are great they really help convey the tone of the anime with a fun vibe. \\n\\n\r\nArt wise the style threw me off at first mainly because of the train of thought of \u2018A killing game where characters look like that?\u2019. Though further into the show I begun to love it. I liked the way the art style looked so simple and cute but still worked to portray the more intense scenes. The style really kept me feeling the innocence of high school life in amidst the sea of abnormality that was Koro-sensei, so I think it works well with the narrative. \\n\\n\r\nMy suggestion to most people would be to give this anime an honest go, it has amazing character development, nice art style and a beautiful over arcing narrative that really ties the story together fantastically if you can stick it out to the end.\\n",

            "content": "I watched some of this like a year ago but dropped it because the episodic formula wasn't really working for me at the time. Then I picked it up again on a whim and finished it in two days. I now completely understand why it is so popular.\r\nStory 10/10: The premise itself is pretty unique and enough to pique one's interest, but the way it unfolds is really what keeps you watching, although most of the intrigue doesn't get resolved this season. It's mostly episodic and definitely not as serious as you'd expect it to be based on the premise, apart from the very lastfew episodes, but this enables it to properly develop a lot of the characters and even if it doesn't really focus on the overarching story most of the time, it still manages to get across some quite meaningful messages about school and education and human relationships.\\n\\n\r\nArt 10/10: It took me so long to get used to the character designs, I'm not even sure why, because they look good, very colourful and nice to look at, just quite peculiar. Other than that there's nothing to complain about, the movement is smooth, the backgrounds are beautiful, and sometimes, especially in the last few episodes, some scenes look mindblowingly good.\\n\\n\r\nSound 10/10: I'm not the biggest fan of the opening or ending themes, but the voice acting is incredible, with a very large number of standout performances from the main and secondary cast alike (special shoutout to Jun Fukuyama for being amazing). The ost is pretty great, with a lot of different instruments used in a large variety of tracks to fit all sorts of situations the characters find themselves in, tracks ranging from upbeat and funny to more quiet and subdued to mysterious and ominous.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 10/10: Not all characters get equal amounts of screen-time, but the ones who get some focus are very well-developed, they all have their own stories and motivations and personalities, and are very very easy to differentiate from the others, and there is tangible character development for some through the show. Interestingly enough, although Koro-sensei is undoubtedly a main character, he remains probably the most mysterious character in the anime, as we don't really know much about him, where he came from, who he really is, what his motivations are, nothing. So I'm looking forward to seeing more of him. Apart from that, my favourite character was Karma, but I did manage to get attached to most of the prominent characters. As for the antagonists, because they do exist, well... In my humble opinion this show has some of the best and most terrifying antagonists I've ever encountered.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 9.5/10: I decided to dock half a point just because I believe this is a show that you have to be in a particular mood in to really enjoy, as the first time I watched the first few episodes I found myself bored, however when I checked it out again I ended up binge-watching the entire thing. I even went back and rewatched the first few episodes and it's quite amazing how much my perspective has  changed on them.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 10/10: I think your enjoyment of this show very much depends on your expectations and your sense of humour. I would not recommend going into this with many preconceived expectations, and I would definitely urge you to stay away if you're looking for something that takes itself seriously. However, if you're just looking for something fun and humorous with a great cast of characters, this is absolutely worth a watch.",

This is surprising able to handle that while giving us fantastic development of everyone in class 3-E and is generally a really warm show to watch. Every time the class thinks they got Koro-sensei he's usually 3 steps ahead but will always commend them for their effort and ingenuity and pushes them further and further. Just a really solid show and doesn't do anything that makes me turn my nose up at it.Ritsu best girl btw and highly recommend the dub.",

            "content": "The first season of Assassinaton Classroom is a hit. The premise, the worst students at a prestigious middle school are giving the task of killing their octopus teacher who can move at Mach 20. E-Class is severely segregated against at the main class. As Karasuma (the government black suit who's the P.E. teacher) so elegantly says in Episode 2 \"The system's given up on these kids.\"\r\nThe story's simple enough. I'll take points off for playing their most cool-and-creative assassination attempts from individual students in the first three episodes. Korosensei is an absolute joy to listen to as he teaches the kids for life.\r\nFor most part,you have a large amount of students, and while most get their focus in the first season (some won't until Season 2), you're going to be dealing with three boy-girl pairs. Nagisa and Kaede (the male and females leads), Karma and Okuda (who doesn't show up until Episode 3 and the sciency-girl), and Sugino and Kanzaki (the baseball guy and class's gamer pretty girl). (When students are group into smaller subgroups, you'll often see these six together. \\n\\n\r\nThe idea is that each character has enough substance and backstory and motivation that in most other settings they'd be the main character if Karma and Nagisa weren't upstaging them. Nagisa, himself is the epitome of the fact that an anime is only as strong as its main character. And Karma's a devilishly genius.\\n\\n\r\nI have two problems One comes from the school side. I'm not Japanese, so I'm missing some context here. I get that. The principal is determined to keep 'E Class' in their place as the lowest students in the school. However, you would think that the principal would realize that having to RIG THE SYSTEM in order to keep E Class 'Down' means the system is broken. But wouldn't having an E Class do really well reflect very highly on the school? Hey, even our WORST Students are academic gems. Now imagine what are our best can do? \\n\\n\r\nMy second problem is that nobody seems to improvise or be able to macguvyer an additional attack. For instance, in Episode 3, Karma starts getting in some great shots that are far more effective. You'd think someone would take advantage of the fact that Korosensei is exclusively focused on Karma at that point to get into their own shots.\\n\\n\r\nEPISODE 3 EXAMPLE:\\n\r\nKarma throws himself off the back end of the cliff with a gun pointed up. The goal is to put Korosensei in an impossible situation, either he lets Karma die or he moves slow enough for Karma to shoot him. Korosensei manages to avoid either option by becoming a trampoline/spider web thing. That's all fine and good, Korosensei is tied up with holding Karma up in trees. Here's where I see a problem. Nagisa is there. Nagisa is watching. Why doesn't he jump over the cliff with a knife? Karma's stuck to Korosensei at that point, can't be detached. And Korosensei can't move because of Karma.  Korosensei is a sitting duck.",

            "content": "The Video Review is up on my channel, but here is the written.\r\nStory - 7/10\r\nThe moon has been blown up, carved into a permanent crescent shape, and that same catastrophe is going to happen a year later on Earth. And it\u2019s a tentacle monster that\u2019s responsible for this. But for whatever reason, he gives humanity a chance to save themselves, that condition is, to allow him to teach at Kunugigaoka Junior High School, the class of 3-E, also known as the Dead End class. This class is considered to have no future and everyone neglects them, except for their new teacher. The government has giventhis class a task to eliminate their teacher and save the Earth. So it\u2019s a conundrum that the students have to kill this teacher of theirs in order to gain themselves 10 billion yen, aka 100 million dollars, yet he is the best teacher they ever had.\\n\\n\r\nNow obviously if the main plot is about killing their one and only teacher, you\u2019re probably already know how every episode is going to turn out. Plus there is a season 2 in the works. Each episode usually focuses on a student in particular and their own personal assassination attempt. So it\u2019s no surprise when all these assassination attempts fail, because you can\u2019t kill off the plot device, otherwise there\u2019ll be no series. The first half of the series is more of an introduction to all the characters in the show, whereas the second half has some more arcs related scenarios. You know each assassination attempt is going to fail, but what we learn from those fails are life lessons, so to speak. However the plot does have a repetitive narrative, so I loved that the last arc was something different and fresh for series, turning it from episodic to an adventure arc. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters - 7/10\\n\\n\r\nAs for our plot device we have Korosensei as named by his students. Also his name literally means un-killable. Why un-killable you say? This tentacle creature can move at Mach 20, so fast he can outrun jets and dodge 1000 of bullet barrages aimed towards him. For whatever reason he plans on destroying the Earth, and for what seems to be no reason at all he wants to teach the class of 3-E. Korosensei past is pretty much a mystery. We get to see glimpses of his past, but not enough through-out the whole series to be satisfying. Usually when a something from his past is hinted, they quickly change the subject. All we know about Korosensei is that he is a tentacle creature willing to go the lengths to help his students, but we don\u2019t know enough about himself. This bugs me, as we need to know more about him. I know there is a season 2 coming out, but seriously, we know almost nothing about him.\\n\\n\r\nNagisa Shiota is the main protagonist of the series and the narrator as well. Despite his look, by the way he is a he. Looking weak and not academically gifted, he is considered to have the most potential out of all the students in the class, and we find out later why. He plays the role as pretty much an onlooker on all the assassination attempts, watching them to see how they work and going on to explain them and he notes them down, hoping to find weaknesses for Korosensei. I like how this character is developed, because when we see him in action, we see how he gets to know his classmates and his full potential. Yet the show isn\u2019t all about him.\\n\\n\r\nThe show is about the class of 3-E. Each episode usually has a scenario focusing on a student in particular. And unfortunately no matter how much of the student is shown, they\u2019re kind of given less as the series progress. Now some of the characters get more screen time than the others, but for the most part, you kind of forget about the character after their initial appearance. It's kind of disappointing, because it seemed they really tried to make an emphasis on the characters especially by their opening listening the name of all the characters, now you\u2019re probably not going to learn all their names, because some of them barely get any screen time. So the show does have a likable cast of characters, there\u2019s just so much more that you can probably care less about. \\n\\n\r\nAnimation and Sound - 7/10, 1/10\\n\\n\r\nThe art style is unique from the common anime, however it\u2019s not something we\u2019ve seen before. It has a very similar art style to Attack on Titan, where the characters are highlighted with a thick coat of black strokes. So it\u2019s very obvious when you see that the characters are animated and they are pasted into the separate background. I do like how every character looks unique, they\u2019re all designed differently so it helps you tell them apart. I love when they go into a fantasy imaginary sequence, as I think those were animated quite well, and it really showed epic moments. But that being said, most action scenes are very anti-climactic and we don\u2019t get to see too much of them, and when we do see some of them, it\u2019s nothing special. When we see Korosensei move at Mach 20 Speed, we just basically see duplicates flashing on screen, so it\u2019s really nothing special. But I do like the art style, when they show something normal, but then replace it with an imaginary darker tone, if seen by the other characters.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is quite repetitive as they usually play the same thing over and over, and it\u2019s really nothing special with a few highlights here and there. The action soundtrack is alright, nothing special. But I did enjoy during the last arc, they played this video game esc. soundtrack and it\u2019s really catchy as hell. Now with the opening themes, I loved the opening themes, it was fun to watch and was fun to listen to, having the whole cast sing the song. The dance is cute as well, it\u2019s a really light hearted theme for the show, which fits it well. The ending song is kind of sad though for a show that\u2019s light hearted and filled with comedy. But at the same time it does fill inspirational as well, I just wasn\u2019t sure if really belonged as an ending theme for this show.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 8/10\\n\\n\r\nWhen I was watching this show, I knew that they were not going to kill the teacher unless it\u2019s the last episode, so I didn\u2019t watch it for conclusion. I did enjoy watching it for the assassination attempts they tried to pull off, and learning more about that character and how this could be applied to daily life. I really liked how each attempt was different and unique, but at the same time, if you\u2019re not into that, it could get repetitive for you. I especially enjoyed the last arc and development of Nagisa, I just wasn\u2019t satisfied with what we got from Korosensei, we didn\u2019t get enough out of his past. However I did enjoy the story and show itself and I can\u2019t wait for the second season, which has been announced for 2016.\\n\\n\r\nVerdict - 7/10\\n\\n\r\nFor the story of Assassination Classroom, I give it a 7, as the overall arching story was predictable with little development. But I did like the individual scenarios they had and also that last arc was really exciting to watch. I did think the concept was pretty cool as well. Although there is quite a few plot holes here and there.\\n\\n\r\nFor the animation and sound they both get a 7 from me. For it being the animation is nothing special, but I praise them for having unique looking, distinguishable characters. Some action scenes shined here and there, but there wasn\u2019t too many of them. I enjoyed the soundtrack for what it is, but only a few tracks shined and it was repetitive. The opening songs were fun to listen to, but the ending song sort of felt out of place.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the characters I have to give them a 7. Koro-sensei is interesting to a point, but they kept his past in the dark for so long and we haven\u2019t gotten enough out of him. I like the students of the class that got to shine, but there were many of them who were neglected. The cast is a likeable cast though, and they\u2019re all unique as well.\\n\\n\r\nFor my own personal enjoyment I give it an 8, because I really enjoyed the concept of the show, and it was fun watching each assassination attempt. I really liked the cast of characters and opening got me pumped up for what\u2019s coming up next. There were some moments when I felt like it was dragging on and it being predictable kind of had me going, how they are going fail this time.\\n\\n\r\nSo after round all the scores up I give Assassination Classroom a 7/10. Because if you watch it for the attempts and knowing what the outcome is going to be, it\u2019s a fairy enjoyable watch. It has an interesting concept with a cast of likeable characters. But the nature of the show, many characters got neglected, I can\u2019t give it exactly a higher enough score. The show has moments where it shines, but then sometimes it\u2019s just forgotten and jumps right on forward with the plot. I recommend this anime to comedy lovers, as they might find something special in the mature concept, but with light hearted comedy added towards it. Just be wary there is a second season coming out, so go into it with an open mind that you already know the outcome, so just enjoy each attempt as much as possible.",

            "content": "It's hard for many of us to remember the problems we had as high school students. I mean, sure, there are the usual problems; class drama, gossiping, crushes that went nowhere and so on. But a lot of us tend to forget the frustration that we had with grades, the idea that they're an accurate representation of the quality of a student as well as the fact that our value as individuals have been reduced to mere numbers.\r\nIn retrospect, it's kind of amazing how a lot of the things in high school that we learn mean next to nothing when we're elder. I don't recallever needing to do calculus out of high school, and I sure as hell have no use for Physics at any point after high school thus far.\\n\\n\r\nThis is what Assassination Classroom ultimately revolves around; it speaks about those \\n\r\nfrustrations that we had as high school students, and acts as a coming of age story of sorts about the characters in the show.\\n\\n\r\nThe story isn't believable in the slightest and acts as device to advance its themes and characters, which is very effective. The story instead mainly focuses on the comedic aspects between the students and Koro-sensei, while also balancing out the various character dynamics between not only Koro and the students, but even the students among one another.\\n\\n\r\nThis works extremely well, and the character interactions are a great deal of fun to watch. The contrast between the various characters and how they see studying, their love for various things and Koro-sensei is interesting and makes their characterization all the better.\\n\\n\r\nWhile there isn't as much focus on some of the side characters as I'd hope, meaning that the show is fairly unbalanced in favor of other characters, almost everyone receives development and considering that this show is a success in Japan and that a second season is on the way, it'll only get better from this point onwards.\\n\\n\r\nAnother problem is the pacing of the comedy, since a lot of the various jokes don't translate well into anime format and as such makes it rather hit and miss in its presentation. Sure, most of the jokes are still funny and I even found myself laughing very hard at some of them, but the presentation certainly could have been better.\\n\\n\r\nThe artwork is smooth and distinct and never drops in quality from episode to episode. The animation quality is pleasant and extremely colorful to look at, though the animation and the way the characters are presented in the opening theme leaves a lot to be desired.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Assassination Classroom is a very enjoyable show that unfortunately isn't as balanced as it could have been and its comedy being rather inconsistent, especially in the beginning of the show. Those who can get past that will find a likeable cast of characters, some great comedy and a very nostalgia-feeling show (if that's even a thing), so while the show isn't for everyone it certainly is something you can check out if that strikes your fancy.\\n",

Of course, that\u2019s just scraping the general outline since it doesn\u2019t stop at just that as there are countless other factors and qualities needed at specific times to get through nasty situations. However, when we talk about support from the environment, how many of us actually have it? Definitions of competitiveness, teaching and friendship have altered so drastically over time that we find ourselves often straying from the original meaning of these words. While we have a humongous amount of stories which talkabout friendship and competitive scenarios, we barely see any about the weight of teaching in one\u2019s life. Maybe because it becomes boring with all the preaching, is it?\\n\\n\r\nAssassination Classroom shoots that down greatly. All concepts have the potential to be entertaining and deliver messages if they\u2019re executed well and with proper knowledge of the subject in question, but mostly we see the same stretched out ideas being overused (though not necessarily inadequately) in media. However, this series utilizes a unique method to get across the significance of education in a student\u2019s life and most importantly, a good educator to do it well. We fall in Kunugigaoka Middle School, an elite and prestigious institution which will go to extreme lengths to maintain its prominence, so much so that they sort out the weeds among them to a separate E-Class. This class undergoes constant mistreatment from peers and teachers alike for not being able to live by the standards of Kunugigaoka and so they\u2019re given the isolated old campus building, stripped from their facilities available in the main building. Because surely, since they can\u2019t perform well in exams, they must be complete trash, right?\\n\\n\r\nTo prove that wrong we have our main character, a yellow octopus-like entity called Koro-sensei, who believes in each of these students and wants to truly develop their abilities\u2026 despite being the creature who destroyed 70% of the moon and will do the same with Earth very soon. Right\u2026 which is why this class is supposed to assassinate him but damn, isn\u2019t he the best teacher they ever had!\\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s truly entertaining and absorbing at the same time when I think about how well this show handles a dark theme like \u2018assassination done by middle school students\u2019 in a lighthearted, humorous and nurturing way. It doesn\u2019t lose sight of the message it wants to convey, whether it\u2019s pressurizing school life or mistreatment of students based on a generalized test of skills. And it does this so well, it\u2019s really compelling. Of course, that doesn\u2019t leave it without flaws since after you catch the drift of the environment portrayed, few incidents become quite predictable and clich\u00e9. This doesn\u2019t bring the show too low though since it uses decent pacing to overcome that. A point to consider is that since tastes in comedy are rather varied, it might not appeal to a certain section of people, which is completely fine since it is a subjective topic to begin with.\\n\\n\r\nSince characters tend to be the milestones for a series even after completion, it is to say it\u2019s extremely vital to have a memorable cast of characters. Fittingly, Koro-sensei sticks out the most as a character shrouded in mystery but showing great maturity and wisdom to handle a bunch of middle schoolers appropriately. That doesn\u2019t stop him from fooling around with them though since he becomes a part of E-Class himself rather than being someone who instructs the students from the sidelines. Putting that aside, if you have shots of inferiority complex injected into your bloodstream since childhood (like me), then you might find most characters, especially Nagisa, extremely likeable. The E-Class is full of different types of personalities, who ended up there because of diverse issues in their lives. In such an atmosphere, it\u2019s moderately simple to build up various memorable individuals which Assassination Classroom does accomplish to a certain extent, but not fully. This aspect of the show possesses a lot of potential, which I can only hope to be explored properly with time.\\n\\n\r\nSuitably, the art style is organic and flows well with the usual cheery experience the show plans to deliver. The normal color palette of the show uses bright hues which stand out especially when it comes to the depiction of main characters but the tone changes critically in serious situations and is highly expressive of the impact the show aims for. Designs for the characters stand out well, since not only is it true that they use \u2018unusual hair color means important\u2019 trope but take it a little further with aligning the character personalities with said color or overall design. A better gel in could have been crafted between the animated characters and the static backgrounds, since the reference changes in art styles at times but nothing enough to bother the quality the series maintains throughout.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack, although not memorable, is moderately apt with the environment. The opening captures the traces of the gleeful journey about to be experienced but doesn\u2019t leave out the subtle hints of the underlying notions. However, the ending takes flight on a lighter, more peaceful note as compared to the opening and the rest of the show but does not fail by itself since it captures the other side of overall picture, which is the memorable and precious childhood of these middle school students. This is also one of the reasons I appreciate this show\u2019s premise, since it does not let the delicate parts of human emotions sink down in the process of tackling heavier themes.\\n\\n\r\nHonestly, I had major doubts about this series and even when I started it out, I wasn\u2019t sure how properly they were going to approach sensitive themes that they planned to. But while watching, some of my critical standpoints faded because the show itself was unexpectedly engrossing and conveyed the message of a teacher\u2019s role in a person\u2019s life through a lens of greater looming thought. As I mentioned before, this might be more appealing to some people than all, but I do think that everyone can somewhat relate at least a little to the environment of the show since school has been quite a large and critical part in all of our lives. I\u2019d recommend this show as taking a dip in a more metaphorical and humorous depiction of school life, which will serve as a unique form of entertainment by itself.\\n",

            "content": "The world is in peril and the enemy just so happens to be your sensei and you have until the end of the school year to assassinate him. That might sound easy enough... right?\r\nAssassination Classroom follows a group of high school students who are tasked in assassinating a tentacle creature who destroyed the moon and that said creature just so happens to be their homeroom teacher. The students later give him the name Kuro-sensei and he is assigned to the E class of an illustrious high school. The students are given training by either a JSPF member or some other military affiliation in Japan, Mr.Karasuma. They are also assigned a language teacher Ms. Irina Jelavi\u0107, whom the students called \"Professor Bitch\". The students not only have to deal with school work but also find a way to eliminate Kuro-sensei before the school year is over. There is also a subplot about the school hierarchy being corrupted and unfair for anyone to succeed.\\n\\n\r\nThere are so many characters in this show that I can't even describe all of them and how much I enjoyed each and everyone of them. But the one that steals the entire anime is Kuro-sensei. Kuro-sensei is just the greatest. He is so awesome that I sometimes said throughout this show \"I wish I had him as my sensei\". Kuro-sensei is the best character on this show in my opinion. Also he is voiced by Sonny Strait in the dun and he was the perfect choice for this character.\\n\\n\r\nOverall Assassination Classroom is one hell of an anime. And if you are an anime only watcher the second season of this show will cover the rest of the manga so watching two seasons of this show is worth it. That aside Assassination Classroom is really entertaining and that is how I generally grade the anime's I watch. I don't like to nitpick unless I'm really going to be critical about it. But, I like to grade shows based entertainment and other factors. And Assassination Classroom is one of those shows that doesn't disappoint and I highly recommend this show if you haven't seen it and giving it an 8/10.",

Only, I don't get it, why is she wearing pants and being referred to as \"kun\"? Wait, it's a boy?!\r\n.\r\n.\r\n.\r\nI didn't say \"stop\".\r\nAssassination classroom is a rather classical, cliche story with a bizarre setting, that somehow got my attention despite my usual dislike for such overused storylines. The idea is that a terribly fast octopus monster wants to destroy the earth in a year... But for unexplained reasons insists on teaching a class of high-school kids that are trained as assassins to kill him. So he basically trainshis own killers, with the students often attempting to murder him mid-class and on various other occasions. But despite this bizarre (as said) setting, deep down it's just a typical story of a teacher bonding with his students and helping them overcome their problems.\\n\\n\r\nAaaaaand... That's it! The plot doesn't really advance apart from the graduation date (and the deadline for killing their monster teacher) drawing ever closer, and pretty much 90% of the episodes are character development fillers that you wouldn't really miss even if they weren't there. So what does draw us to this anime? Well obviously the cute trap, which as the episodes go on the the animators throw more and more to our face (probably caught on on his popularity), but that wouldn't be enough with that limited amount of fanservice, right?\\n\\n\r\nSo I'll just take an educated guess here, and say that the cliche story of a teacher bonding with his students is cliche for a reason and it is well executed here. We've all had that one time in our life when we felt the guidance from our parents was not enough and wanted the help of the people who spent 8 hours of the day watching over us (no, not these ones, the other ones). And when humor is added skillfully to the mix, even an adult can appreciate the notion.",

But now I'm really happy I finally watched this one, because it was a ride.\r\nThe story is simple. A giant yellow octopus who's name is \"Koro-Sensei\" blew up a huge portion of the moon and plans on destroying the earth soon after. Only thing is, he's been assigned to teach a classroom in japan who's notorious for having delinquents and slackers. At the start, most of these kids are prime examples of those things, but Koro Sensei is sogood at being a teacher, that he turns those kids into motivated killers, and even gets them to pass their finals!\\n\r\nAnyways, it may seem like a lot, but it's one of the most interesting anime I've seen in a while.\\n\\n\r\nSound and art here are respectable. The OP is alright and kinda gets stuck in my head. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters are amazing. My favorites being Koro Sensei, and Karma. Koro Sensei however, is one of the most motivating teachers I've ever seen. I wish he were my teacher! And quite frankly, sometimes he makes me wonder why he wants to blow up the earth, he really seems to love it.\\n\\n\r\nAnyways, the overall for this one is a must watch. It has everything that a great anime needs. Great story, interesting characters, not too much filler, and intense moments. No doubt the second season is probably much more intense. But for what it's worth, this anime is DEFINITELY worth the 10!",

            "content": "Story: As you might have guessed from the title, this anime is about assassinating the 'teacher'. Teacher being an almost un-killable alien octopus thing... Anyways, the story can be really childish and cringey at times, but I found it kinda adorable. It was really amazing how they incorporated both killing and school life so well, the author of this anime managed to somehow tie two polar opposite stuff together really well. Comedy for this show was just ok... it was mainly comebacks by the teacher or student and kind of felt dull at times. 8.0/10.0\r\nArt: The artstyle of the show was not anything exceptional, butit fit the tone of the anime really well, it's a cute with mostly bright colors.  I also liked how even though most of the characters were drawn cutesy (?), they were also sharp. Also to note, the artstyle kind of changed depending the mood of the scene, I thought that was worth noting 8.0/10.0\\n\\n\r\nSound: Not a big fan of the sound track, its really hyphy and loud.6.0/10.0 \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Even though most characters were kind of one dimensional, the sheer variety of cast made up for it. Due to their being so many characters, half way thorough the anime I was often asking myself 'huh, was he/she really in this class from the start?'. The show really tries to give as much information about every student they can, but it's just wasn't possible in 22 episodes. Personally, I never really felt attached to any character nor did I have any favorites, but I appreciated the work that was put to create them. 7.5/10.0\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: One word to describe this anime is fun. This doesn't have the best art, or story, or characters, but what it does have is how well they put it together. It's like one of those surprisingly good sports teams without a star player, but the team with great chemistry. Each element is well supported by each other, and it just makes the show really enjoyable and worthy of watching 9.2/10.0\\n\\n\r\n38.7/50 = 77.4%",

The various arcs were fun and were well-paced, keeping me engaged throughout. The recurring villain of \"redacted\" was ridiculous but it worked because the narrative knew he was ridiculous. He proved to be a pretty fun villain and contributed to an excellent last few episodes. Nagisa and Karma worked well together even if their characters weren't developed that much beyond their base traits.  Some side characters are underutilized like a certain AI machine. The drama involving the principal and his view of the perfect educationwas done well, because it was included sparingly and effectively.The unformity of the characters' motivations hurt it but I didn't mind it much because of how lighthearted the show was.\\n\r\nThe japanese voice actors were excellent in their portrayal, specifically for Nagisa, Karna, and Koro-Sensei. English dub voice actors were below average imo.  The animation was simplistic but fluid. Nothing here was great in a writing sense but there's so much fun here that I definitely recommend it.  OP themes are infectiously fun.\\n\\n\r\nOverall Rating: 6.5/10\\n\r\nEnjoyment Level: 8/10",

How could I describe this anime in a few sentences?\r\nAssassins Classroom is like the cute but quiet girl who had a crush on you in your formative years but you ignored her because she was a bit boring, only to have her pass you by as she grows into a high-quality catch.\r\nThat is Assassins Classroom. Assassins Classroom is the anime that starts off painfully slow but you just start to appreciate it as it winds down to the last episode.\r\nSTORY 8/10: \r\nThe story is a typical classroom setting with your token pervert/hentai, class clown, tough guy, nerd(s), popular guy, stud, big-boobed ditz, flat-chestedjealous girl, gender-ambiguous main character, etc and finally a character (Koro Sensei) that simultaneously serves as the major plot device.\\n\\n\r\nThere isn't much to write here other than what you probably know already. A classroom is tasked to kill a super-powerful mysterious lifeform before he blows up Earth in a year, and if they actually kill him they get 100 billion yen. The shows premise develops around this desperate desire to kill the teacher.\\n\\n\r\nThis class also happens to be the worst class in the school. As such, it is ridiculed by the other classes, although none of the students here are particularly losers. The school they attend just happens to be one of the most prestigious schools in the nation.\\n\\n\r\nART 10/10:\\n\\n\r\nThe art is definitely the best aspect of this show. This show does not spare any effort or expense on looking good. This is truly 201X anime here. There are a lot of school shading, glitch and visual effects. Even the opening scene is rendered lovingly. One can immediately tell that the producers placed a great deal of importance in making sure the anime LOOKS good.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND 8/10: \\n\\n\r\nJust like the art, the sound is fantastic. I'm not a huge fan of anime music or sound. I normally pass through the intro/outro but Assassins Classroom is definitely better than average.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER 6/10:\\n\\n\r\nI thought the character development was admittedly poor overall.Aside from Karma, Nagisa and maybe that green haired girl I didn't really care for any of the other students. This may change in the later seasons but I wish that they developed the other characters more. Perhaps, they don't NEED to and it is actually better they focused on a few notable ones.\\n\\n\r\nI do like Bitch-sensei, Karasuma, and of course love Koro-sensei. I did feel that Karasuma was a bit one dimensional though. He is basically the typical straight man in a comedy show while Bitch-Sensei is admittedly more complicated than she comes off. That is just a testiment to her VA and the character writing.\\n\\n\r\nI found myself being drawn to Koro-sensei as a teacher. They really wrote his role well and accurately portrayed him as a teacher who genuinely cares for his students.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT 6/10:\\n\\n\r\nThis is where I am torn. I can definitely acknowledge that Assassins Classroom is a very good, even great anime that deserves praise. However, it just starts off really slow. I can't put my finger on it, but I think its because it relies on respectable storytelling and substance (good art, music, etc) that there aren't cheap tricks thrown in early to keep the viewer interested. I had to force myself to watch through the first half because while I enjoyed it, I wasn't CAPTIVATED by it like some lower-quality animes.\\n\\n\r\nMaybe I've been trained by terrible Isekei harems that throw some cheap fan service to wake me up, or some super violent horror animes that stress me out. Assassins Classroom does not rely on those things to be good.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL 8/10:\\n\\n\r\nAssassins Classroom is a very good anime that suffers from slow pacing early on. If one can be patient, they will learn to appreciate it for what it is.",

            "content": "Koro-Sensei. The loveable squid space squid who managed to not only successfully teach the lowest class of the school (Class 3-E) but almost every single character in the anime. Having 'destroyed' 70% of the moon the military try to eliminate him but don't have the power to do so. Kuro-Sensei makes a rather unusual request to teach a class of students with appalling grades who are underachieving. The government surprisingly accepts the demand in which the government then task the students to eliminate him with tools from the army. Kuro-Sensei making this a game give the students 365 days to complete the task knowing fullwell they are trying to kill him. With failure being no option the students try their best to kill their teacher before the given date to receive a huge cash reward. Failure will lead to the end of the world. However with the speed of Mach Twenty the students find it a rather difficult task. Quite an unfair advantage huh? \\n\\n\r\nDespite the unfair advantage this anime will not fail to bore you. Having being a action packed animation with plenty of emotional moments and giggles along the way. This anime is great at keeping the combination of action, comedy and drama all in one episode. Having known that this character is very op you will eventually get into the animation and how the show works. Stick around long enough to see one heck of an amazing anime. Can be killed or will the world end? \\n\\n\r\nWhat makes this show amazing is how Koro-Sensei is very kind and respective despite wanting to destroy the world. Besides this he wants to make the class feel good about themselves and wants them to achieve what they have been told they can't do. \\n\\n\r\nWithout spoiling this anime for you this could be one of the most best animes if not the best anime I've ever seen! \\n\\n\r\nIf you give some of your time to this anime you will have an amazing journey with Class 3-E and feel a mixture of emotions even after the anime has finished. \\n\\n\r\n\"Outstanding\" \\n\r\n10/10 \\n\r\nTokuwu. \\n\\n\r\nI hope you guys enjoyed my first review :) Be sure to follow me for more anime reviews!",

            "content": "I'll be placing this {{ALERT: SPOILER INCOMING}} at the start of the spoiler and this {{SPOILER TERMINATED}} at the end of it.\r\nStory - 8\r\nThe story is definitely out-of-the-box with the idea of killing your teacher (and not in the frustrated tests way). \"Koro-sensei\", a name given to the weird creature by Kaede Kayano, is the class teacher of a failure class named \"3-E\", the E meaning End, and it's students designated to kill their teacher before March 13th. Sounds interesting doesn't it? Read on, it gets better. This teacher not only has extendable tentacles but also a dangerous speed of Mach 20! Despite hisover-powered status, he has several weak points to compensate. During most of the season, the students are studying with their teacher to ace the exams and training with a government agent, Karasuma Tadaomi, to assassinate their mentor alongside. There's a few fanservice moments thrown here and there, as expected of a shounen anime. The story does sometimes go off course but when it's on the tracks, it becomes really fun with a ton of comedy sprinkled on top! The fillers, that I just mentioned, aren't very useless as they contribute to the story in one way or the other. The story proves to be extremely handy to the students of Class E as each one of them come to know that they're very special and talented in one way or the other. Taking all points in mind, I gave it a good ol' 8\\n\\n\r\nArt - 9\\n\r\nNot really much to say about this but as much as I LOVE the animation, scenes can get pretty gross (not too gross, just mildly). Otherwise, all the wavelength (couldn't make a good detailed description without spoiling :P) scenes were pretty well made with showing the facial expression clearly along with the blackness that surrounded it. The action scenes were well detailed and is much praised.\\n\\n\r\nSound - 10\\n\r\nI really liked both openings regardless of the majority. The openings showed the state of na\u00efveness that the entire class were in with all the happy tunes and of course, the DANCE. Sometimes, OST wouldn't be required but it didn't bother me much because the OSTs were just as good as the openings! Coming to the constant ending song, I REALLY EFFING LOVE IT! It's like it takes all the energy of the episode and just disperses it gently through the air.  \\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 9\\n\r\nThere is a plethora of different personalities gathered in this 47 episode bundle of joy. Every character is different from each other but if not, only 1 or 2 share the same character. Some characters are pretty extreme, for example, Akabane Karma's personality is an extremely troublesome boy's one but there's a really good twist to it that I wont bother to put out, while on the other hand, Terasaka Ryouma is a pretty inflexible guy who sticks to his ideals only. These personalities don't stay around all the time because if they did, character development would be 0 and the rating for Character would be 5. Not only do students have such a variety but so do the teachers. {{ALERT: SPOILER INCOMING}} Irina Jelavich, dubbed as \"Ms. Bitch\"/\"Bitch-sensei\" by the entire class, was an arrogant woman who always used seductive tactics to eliminate her targets. At first appearance, she was all of that but then realised she were to settle and adjust with this class. Slowly, she starts to like and care for her students more and more. Karasuma has the same gradual change {{SPOILER TERMINATED}}.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 8\\n\r\nThe comedy scenes in almost every episode lightens the atmosphere and intensity of this assassination classroom of theirs. I would give the Enjoyment sector a 10 but there were several cheesy and cliched parts in this season, as compared to the second one. The fight scenes were really good but then again, the cliched fight explainer was there so that doesn't benefit the score much...if it weren't for the animation and OST! During such scenes, there's always a good OST to go along with it and the animation is, once again, praiseworthy. Not only are the fight scenes great but so are the times when Koro-sensei gives irl life advice. There is always this one perfect OST that is present at that time\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8\\n\r\nI rated it 8 overall because I think if I compare it with it's way better sequel, giving the first season a 9* would be too biased and felt that I should be a bit more honest with it.\\n\r\n(*= 9 is one the basis of finding the mean; [{8+9+10+9+8}/5= 8.8 and rounds off to 9])\\n\r\nThank you so much for finishing my review! I'm very glad that you did!",

Bref, we have a teacher who grows the respective skills of his students through his own \"assassination\" by his own students. If you keep this in mind, you will have a great time with the series and you will understand its uniqueness. Its fun, clever, action packed, mildly psychological, has them feeeeels and is an easy watch. When I think about it, I really think I would of enjoyed the series a tad less if I binged it...1 episode per week was perfect for this type of stuff.\\n\\n\r\nI always loved how the the show constantly tries to stay in a realm of reality, which is super refreshing because it always translates this to improbable problems being solved by improbable solutions and strategies. \\n\\n\r\nThe show surprises you, you also start by thinking that getting to know the full class will not be possible, a bit like something I felt watching Another, but you end up being involved in the character development of practically everyone. I specially found Nagisa interesting as he was haunting but immensely gentle, the creators were absolutely brilliant with him. Gold star! \\n\\n\r\nOverall the anime stands out, isn't boring, tickles the brain and is definitely worth a watch.\\n\\n",

Putting it on hold had been the worst decision I could have made. \r\nThe story is interesting \u2013\u00a0it's absurd, yes, and at times absolutely ridiculous, but that's the style of story you came for if you saw a yellow octopus in a robe and still decided to watch the show. The humor is pretty good, it had me rolling my eyes and laughing a lot. \r\nI enjoyed the art style immensely,especially the vibrant colors that you don't get to see that much in anime. Nagisa's eyes were particularly pretty \u2013 as was his ridiculous main character hair. \\n\\n\r\nThe music is one of the show's strongest points, from the OP/ED to the actual score. I loved every single piece. \\n\\n\r\nWhat I also liked is that every character is a character - and in a classroom of some twenty kids, that's hard to achieve, but the show manages to make most of them very memorable. I also loved the fact that the show brought up some very heavy topics and discussed them, such as gender identity, parental and peer pressure, even mental illness. I loved it. \\n\\n\r\nAnd I bawled like a child when it ended.",

            "content": "Ansatsu Kyoushitsu\r\nThis eccentric and rebellious anime was personally judged by myself too soon to be unworthy of watching. Why is that? I am a fairly realistic guy that enjoys watching more mature anime that provide moral lessons to their stories. Well, it turns out that this anime is far more mature than the visuals of a giant yellow blob monster teaching a classroom of children. Ridiculous, right?\r\nWhat astonished me the most with this anime is that although yes, it adds a bizarre element that promotes assassinating one of the school staff, but it also reveals insightful moral stories to events that happen. Therefore, not onlydoes the professor teach the students a lesson, but also the viewer as well. \\n\\n\r\nThe children in the story are essentially part of the worst class on campus. The rejects. They failed in school due to their own personal reasons, and therefore were shunned from the remainder of the students on campus by placing their class in a secluded environment far from the main campus. When the children do show up for auditorium gatherings, they are laughed at by their peers and the staff. Sad story, yeah? Not really when you see what the E-class or End class are actually doing on a day-by-day life. \\n\\n\r\nIt's fun, invigorating, and provides the students with a purpose to study hard and really make the best out of life.\\n\\n\r\nOnto the ratings:\\n\r\nStory - 10 - The purpose is incredibly clear-cut. Assassinate the teacher and save the world. This element is so often pursued that it would be hard to give it a lower score. The teacher must die.\\n\r\nGraphics - 8 - Very nice and colourful artwork. Nothing incredibly insane, but overall really nice work. \\n\r\nCreativity - 10 - I am adding a new category. From ammunition to the assassination attempts and laughs, this story does a great job of being eccentric. \\n\r\nSoundtrack - 8 - Intense music at the right moments.\\n\r\nCharacter personas - 7 - A different personality is given to most students, but their backgrounds aren't exactly covered. We don't know why all of them ended up in E-class, and it's always nice to have that relationship with a character built up.\\n\r\nCharacter voicing - 9 - The monster does an awesome job with exemplifying his part, as well as other characters do really well.\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 9 - Great lessons. Bizarre, but grounded idea. The children must save the world.\\n\r\nRecommended - Absolutely. Season 2 also came out, so I will watch that.",

            "content": "- English Review (Translated version)\r\nI have conflicting feelings with \"Ansatsu Kyoushitsu\". On the one hand I think it's a really interesting anime, worthy of a good view by every good anime fan. It's funny (VERY funny) and original, apart from having a great technical section, both in the artistic and in the musical part. The point is that I also think that it is a little worse on certain things, or at least falls short of its virtues, in terms of two key elements: storyline/plot structure and characters. And of course, this is important, because it ends up tarnishing the final result and the generalsensations a little.\\n\\n\r\nI think it is indisputable that the strength of \"Ansatsu\" is his great and peculiar sense of humour. There's not a episode in which there's not a single scene that makes you laugh. And yes, humour is very personal, but it is also an objective quality and in this case it is beyond any doubt. The fun is assured. Luckily it is not just \"laughter\" and we also find ourselves with a good load of values, principles and ideals, as in any self-respecting shonen, but going a little beyond the simple and overused \"companionship \" and \" the importance of friendship \". They also make an appearance, but they don't just stand there.\\n\\n\r\nAs I said, the technical section stands out very much. Visually it is a real delight on screen and the level of animation and drawing is very, very high. Perhaps, to say the least, the weakest point lies in the original design of the characters (with the obvious exception of Koro-sensei), but the overall quality of the art is very good. The musical section is not left behind and the soundtrack is varied, original and fits like a glove in every moment. It features songs that range from more eclectic sounds to epic tones, as well as quieter cuts and cheerful nature. But always bordering on a high level and leaving us some of those melodies that remain in your head. Perhaps one of the best and most complete anime BSO I've ever heard.\\n\\n\r\nAs a counterpoint, not everything is perfect in \"Ansatsu Kyoushitsu\". The supposed main plot is diluted with the passage of the episodes between school tests and the day to day life of the students. This would not be bad (I am a great fan of the \"slice of life\" genre) if the writers had struck a balance between the two: the \"serious\" story and the more mundane plots. This has not been the case, and this is something that can be noticed. They give too many expectations to a part of the argument which they then do not develop enough on the basis of that (fictitious) importance. I understand that there is a second season to change this, but well, this is a review of the first and I must judge by what I have seen and not by what I may see later.\\n\\n\r\nAnother aspect that could be improved is the characters. Koro-sensei is a great character, original, funny, with nuances. Even the other two teachers (Karasuma and Irina) seem to me interesting in that they are relatively topical in their personalities. The fact is that the students in general seems flat, simple, even irrelevant individually. As a group (\"class 3E\") I think they are a great idea and a curious concept, but I think that most students are quite insipid on their own. What's more, most of them have a significance of close to zero in the story, they have no depth or influence whatsoever. And this is not because there are a lot of characters. \"Shokugeki no Souma\" (to name one mainly humorous series) also does this, and yet most of the characters are well-defined, developed and easily recognizable. The fact is that neither the protagonist (who also repels me with this ambiguity about his genre) nor famous characters like Karma (fuck, my preferences definitely have nothing to do with the \"generals\") seem to me to go beyond the four usual clich\u00e9s.\\n\\n\r\nTo conclude, I would like to mention a few minor aspects, but they are of superlative ingenuity and originality. For example, Koro-sensei's weaknesses, which are taught numbered throughout the episodes. The academy's promotional videos by Kunudon, a few laughs. And a lot of references to popular culture in general and Japanese culture in particular (Nintendo and its 3DS, Naruto...).\\n\\n\\n\r\n- Spanish Review (Original and faithful version)\\n\\n\r\nTengo sentimientos contrapuestos con \"Ansatsu Kyoushitsu\". Por una parte pienso que es un anime verdaderamente interesante, merecedor de un visionado por todo buen aficionado que se precie. Es divertida (MUY divertida) y original, aparte de contar con un gran apartado t\u00e9cnico, tanto en la parte art\u00edstica como en la musical. \u00bfMuchas virtudes, no? El caso es que tambi\u00e9n considero que flojea un poco en ciertas cosas, o al menos se queda corta en comparaci\u00f3n con sus virtudes, en cuanto a dos elementos clave: trama/estructura argumental y personajes. Y claro, esto es algo a tener en cuenta, porque termina empa\u00f1ando un poco el resultado final y las sensaciones generales.\\n\\n\r\nCreo que es indiscutible que el punto fuerte de \"Ansatsu\" es su gran y peculiar sentido del humor. No hay ni un solo cap\u00edtulo en el que no haya alguna escena que haga re\u00edr. Y s\u00ed, el humor es muy personal, pero tambi\u00e9n es una cualidad objetiva y en este caso est\u00e1 fuera de toda duda. La diversi\u00f3n est\u00e1 asegurada. Por suerte no es solo \"risas\" y tambi\u00e9n nos encontramos un buen cargamento de valores, principios e ideales, como en todo shonen que se precie, pero yendo un poco m\u00e1s all\u00e1 de los simples y manidos \"compa\u00f1erismo\" y \"la importancia de la amistad\". Que tambi\u00e9n hacen acto de presencia, pero no se queda solo ah\u00ed.\\n\\n\r\nComo dec\u00eda, el apartado t\u00e9cnico destaca sobremanera. A nivel visual es una aut\u00e9ntica delicia en pantalla y el nivel de la animaci\u00f3n y el dibujo es muy, muy alto. Quiz\u00e1, por comentar algo negativo, el punto m\u00e1s flojo radique en la originalidad de dise\u00f1o de los personajes (exceptuando, obviamente, a Koro-sensei), pero lo que es la calidad general del arte es muy buena. El apartado musical no se queda atr\u00e1s y la banda sonora es variada, original y encaja como un guante en cada instante. Cuenta con canciones que se mueven desde sonidos m\u00e1s ecl\u00e9cticos a tonos \u00e9picos, al margen de cortes m\u00e1s tranquilos y de naturaleza alegre. Pero siempre rayando a un gran nivel y dej\u00e1ndonos algunas melod\u00edas de esas que permanecen en tu cabeza. Quiz\u00e1 una de las mejores y m\u00e1s completas BSO de anime que he o\u00eddo.\\n\\n\r\nComo contrapunto, no todo es color de rosa en \"Ansatsu Kyoushitsu\". La supuesta trama principal se diluye con el paso de los cap\u00edtulos entre pruebas escolares y el d\u00eda a d\u00eda del alumnado. Esto no estar\u00eda mal (yo mismo soy un gran aficionado al g\u00e9nero \"slice of life\") si los guionistas hubieran conseguido un equilibrio entre ambas cosas: la historia \"seria\" y las tramas m\u00e1s mundanas. No ha sido as\u00ed y esto es algo que se nota. Le dan demasiadas expectativas a una parte del argumento que luego no desarrollan lo suficiente en base a esa (ficticia) importancia. Entiendo que hay una segunda temporada donde cambiar esto, pero bueno, esto es una review de la primera y debo juzgar en base a lo que he visto y no en base a lo que quiz\u00e1 pueda ver m\u00e1s adelante.\\n\\n\r\nOtro aspecto mejorable son los personajes. Koro-sensei es un gran personaje, original, divertido, con matices. Incluso los otros dos profesores (Karasuma e Irina) me parecen interesantes dentro de ser relativamente t\u00f3picos en sus personalidades. El caso es que el alumnado en general me parece plano, simpl\u00f3n y, si me apuras, irrelevante de forma individual. Como conjunto (clase 3E) me parecen una gran idea y un concepto curioso, pero creo que la mayor\u00eda de alumnos por s\u00ed mismos son bastante insulsos. Es m\u00e1s, la mayor\u00eda tienen una importancia en la historia rozando el cero, no tienen ning\u00fan tipo de profundidad ni la suficiente influencia. Y esto no es porque haya una gran cantidad de personajes. En \"Shokugeki no Souma\" (por nombrar una serie principalmente humor\u00edstica) tambi\u00e9n ocurre esto y sin embargo la mayor\u00eda de personajes est\u00e1n bien delimitados, desarrollados y resultan f\u00e1cilmente reconocibles. Es que ni el protagonista (del que adem\u00e1s me repele esa ambig\u00fcedad al respecto de su g\u00e9nero) ni personajes con fama como Karma (joder, definitivamente mis preferencias no tienen nada que ver con las \"generales\") me parecen que vayan m\u00e1s all\u00e1 de los cuatro t\u00f3picos de siempre.\\n\\n\r\nPara terminar quer\u00eda mencionar alg\u00fan que otro aspecto m\u00e1s menor, pero que son de un ingenio y originalidad superlativos. Por ejemplo, los puntos d\u00e9biles de Koro-sensei, que se van ense\u00f1ando numerados a lo largo de los cap\u00edtulos. O los v\u00eddeos promocionales de la academia a cargo de Kunudon, unas risas. Y un mont\u00f3n de referencias a la cultura popular friki en general y japonesa en particular (Nintendo y su 3DS, Naruto...).",

Out of all the characters in many anime, to be honest. He is brilliant, complex, witty, flawed, soft, evil, goofy...But believably so. Is he a hero? An anti-hero? Assassination Classroom doesn't spell it out for you so easily. Koro-sensei's character is very fleshed out, and it makes the rest of the show work. Not to say that all other characters are terrible in comparison...\r\nAnd not to say that the premise of the show itself isn't bad. It's actually quite unique.In the first few episodes it seems kind of simple, immature, non-cerebral even. But as the episodes evolve, you start wondering how these kids really are going to pull off killing this unkillable thing. And if they do figure out a way, if they would even want to. And it's pretty damn funny, especially Koro-Sensei's little quirks. *And* it does get more cerebral if you stick around for the second half of Season 1 and all of Season 2 (This review is for both seasons by the way). I actually recommended this to someone who doesnt usually watch anime, cause I felt like they would appreciate it. That says a lot.",

What anime doesn't have that sort of idea at least once.. Even when it's not a comedy. \r\nOnce the story began to climax and the real stuff stared to happen that'swhen I found myself the most intrigues as humour is always a good time but the story line is honestly, what usually keeps you hooked. For me, the last few episodes were it's saving grace as I throughly enjoyed it, but you need the patience to get though all the goofy stuff first before you get the the good parts. \\n\\n\r\nThere's some plot holes and unfulfilled things that weren't yet closed off, but I'm reluctant to know that there is a second season so hopefully in that, it clears some things up.",

            "content": "Assassination Classroom is without a doubt my personal favourite anime of all time. While its second season is superior to the first, season one is an absolute enjoyable romp from beginning to end. This one is going to be extensive.\r\nSet in Kunikigokoa Junior High (Spelling probably off) class 3E. A group of struggling students are presented with a brand new teacher at the beginning of their first semester of their final year. This teacher is responsible for having all of the worlds governments on high alert after managing to destroy an entire half of the moon. This teacher has decided he want's to teach thestudents of class 3E in their final year with the final ultimatum. \\n\\n\r\nKill me before your graduation, or Earth will suffer the same fate as the moon, if not worse.\\n\\n\r\nNot easy when your teacher is a giant octopus like creature that is immune to traditional gun shots and can travel the speed of Mach 20! Even harder when he is the best teacher you could ask for!\\n\\n\r\nWhile the title of the show may come across as a more dark and mature anime, this is not the case at all. Assassination Classroom is a colourful, wacky and fun filled show with plenty of humour and silliness. Unlike your traditional Moe style high school show however, Assassination Classroom manages to set itself apart from the rest with a class of roughly 30 students who all get decent screen time across the series as well as plenty to find likeable about all of them, for different reasons. Each episode is rather episodic in nature with the students trying to find different ways to kill off their teacher. While this can become tiresome for some, Assassination Classroom kept me engaged with the different plot threats and revelations that occur throughout the season. One of the main draws is seeing exactly how the students are able to develop and learn from their mistakes. How each student has a weakness and intends to strengthen them as time goes on. The show may seem like all fun and games, but it can take deep and dark turns when it needs to which is in sharp contrast to its regular episodes, but they are dont well and do not feel out of place, instead complimenting the story and helping the characters grow.\\n\\n\r\nWhat struck me the most about Assassination Classroom was the type of show that is was. Compared to other slice of life, school life shows on the market today, few of them take me back to my school life. Assassination Classroom presents school life in a really down-to-earth way that is really engaging and surprising considering the over-arching plot of the show. More-so in the second season does this become apparent due to the nearing of graduation, presenting that one question that all of us must go through in our lives,\\n\\n\r\nWhat the hell to do with ourselves once school life is over?\\n\\n\r\nOverall, the story for Assassination Classroom is awesome. The show is not for everyone, no show is. But the story suits the show, surprises in many ways and is very enjoyable to watch. \\n\\n\r\nThe art and sound in the show are simply great. Starting with the art. Each scene within Assassination Classroom is colourful and stands out. Its detailed where it needs to be, its simple where it needs to be. The style of the art is very appealing with a sleek modern anime aesthetic to it. Backgrounds are very nice to look at. One weakness in the art has to do with some character designs. Upon close inspection of the background students on the main campus, a lot of them are re-using assets from the main cast of 30-odd students and slightly remixing them and mixing and matching them. While it is not completely obvious, it does detract a little. \\n\\n\r\nThe sound in Assassination Classroom is very good and fits perfectly. The first OP Seishun Satsubatsuron sung by,  3-nen E-gumi Utatan (Class 3-E Song Unit). The group is comprised of the japanese voice actors for, \\n\r\nNagisa Shiota \\n\r\nKaede Kayano\\n\r\nKarma Akabane\\n\r\nHiroto Maehara\\n\\n\r\nIf you didnt know the type of show this will be before hand, this opening will definitely tell you. This opening is filled with colourful illustrations of all the characters and their class registration numbers, quick cuts of different scenes upcoming and the all too famous dance off that get the most hardcore Assassination Classroom fans singing along (to the best of their ability lol) and attempting the dance too. \\n\\n\r\nOpening 2 Jiriki Hongan Revolution also sung by 3-nen E-gumi Utatan (Class 3-E Song Unit) while not being as catchy or iconic as the first opening is still a great OP with an enjoyable song, great visuals and fantastic animation. \\n\\n\r\nThe ending theme Hello, shooting-star by Moumoon is an utterly fantastical piece perfectly befitting the ending animation. Definitely an ending theme to not skip and keep tagged on your music playlist. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters in Assassination Classroom are simply brilliant, the teacher Kuro-Sensei is an absolute JOY to watch whether subbed or dubbed (Will get to that in a bit). Kuro-Sensei is always has that comedic element to him because of his character and the situation he is in. He is able to perform super-human feats and become flustered over the most simple of things. Easily one of the best of the show. \\n\\n\r\nMain Character Nagisa Shiota is a great protagonist. Nagisa is obviously troubled from episode 1. It is clear that he is a kid and sensible young lad. However he remains rather ambiguous throughout the first season. Instead, Nagisa acts as our guide to the world of Assassination Classroom, he keeps tabs on Kuro-Sensei's weaknesses and provides much needed explanations when required. He is not all of this though, throughout the second half, Nagisa is able to develop into a more fleshed out character with different skills s=to set himself apart from the rest of the class, with his character blossoming in the second season later on. \\n\\n\r\nThe rest of the class are all thoroughly enjoyable. Each new student tends to get an episode centred around them as they enter the class, fleshing them out from the original class mates. While not everyone gets the most screen time or solo episodes, the majority are memorable and most, if not all are likeable or have redeeming qualities, something which is ridiculously difficult to do with a cast of this size.  \\n\\n\r\nOverall. Assassination Classroom is simply a MUST watch. While the second season is better, without the groundwork and foundation layed down by season 1, season 2 wouldn't nearly be as impactful. The show takes many surprising turns throughout its 2 season life and one in the second season which i GUARANTEE you will not see coming. The story is fun and enjoyable and knows when it needs to get serious. This is adventure not to be missed \\n\r\n9/10\\n",

            "content": "First thing's first.\r\nI wish that Koro-sensei was my teacher back at school. \r\nHe is what I call an awesome character. \r\nIn general this anime was pretty good. Not amazing and not something that I would, or could watch twice, but still pretty good.\r\nStory: 8\r\nI love this concept! A smiley-octopus-thing responsible for blowing up half the moon? High schoolers who need to kill him before he destroys the earth when he is also their teacher, teaching them how to kill him? Who even thinks of these things, because I applaud  Y\u016bsei Matsui for doing so. This is genius. \r\nThe execution of this however, is adifferent story. Nagisa, the progtag, is a pretty good one, so luckily that doesn't stuff things up. What does, however, are the filler-like episodes. Sometimes I really just wanted the actual story to progress. Knowing what happens in the manga, I would have really loved to see this in the anime. So far, we only get that Korosensi is unkillable. I mean, this had pretty much been established within the first episode alone. I just know there is so much more in store for this anime, so in their second season, they better make it happen!\\n\\n\r\nArt: 7-ish?\\n\r\nS'all right. Wasn't the best of course, and the animation and action scenes can always improve. Even - dare I say it -  Koro-sensei's design can be seen as a pretty lazy. I know, I know, that's probably the appeal, but that's just me being picky. In fact, if Koro-sensei didn't look like that smiley face, he wouldn't really be 'Koro-sensei'.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 7\\n\r\nOut of the entire series I only didn't like one character: that machine who travels by smartphone who I forget the name of because she was kinda just annoying. \\n\r\nI did like the main characters, namely Koro-sensei, Nagisa, and side character, Karma, otherwise I don't know the other characters well enough to really care about them. Besides from the fact that they are all young juniors, they do not have much substance. I do understand, however, that there are a lot of them, and going through all their stories (if they had any) wouldn't really work with only 22 episodes. Some characters are quite forgettable (probably because they always fail to kill Koro-sensei) and come off rather bland and cliche. Additionally, we don't really see much character development from probably any one of these characters. I might say except for Karama, because he learns that Koro-sensei is unkillable and cares for all his students, and that maybe he shouldn't be so arrogant. But then again, it's not like he isn't the same sadistic boy that stepped into the school grounds in episode 3. Nagisa remains quiet, clever and 'innocent' and Koro-sensei remains that goofy weird teacher that cares about his students and alas, is still unkillable. I guess that one guy who looks like a bully changes. I forget his name because he isn't that memorable anyway. \\n\r\nBut in saying all of this, their little character growth isn't a bad thing, because their personalities make up for it anyway.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7\\n\r\nI really liked the start of the anime, not so much the end, just because I didn't really like all the characters that much. I know there is heaps of potential in it's second season, and this time we will actually see so much development from these characters. Much excite.\\n",

            "content": "Alright, let's go murder some teacher. Oh wait... Do you mean that teacher who pierced through the moon and made that moon in a forever crescent shape? Well then, let me think and prepare for that.\r\nIn Assassination Classroom (or Ansatsu Kyoushitsu), class 3-E consists of students who will get the lowest form of education and probably even fail in life. Those students also have no sheer hope in anywhere of their lives as the upper students above their class will always be 'better' than them. However, class 3-E gets a new teacher that will turn their class around this year, and you guess it: it'sKoro-Sensei, the teacher who pierced through that moon.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 8\\n\\n\r\nJust as it was stated in the previous paragraph, Assassination Classroom is your stereotypical classroom, with weapons and tentacles and a hot substitute teacher. NO, IT IS NOT THAT TYPE OF ANIME. Putting that yelling aside, the students in class 3-E has one mission, and that is to kill Koro-Sensei. However, let's just say that the teacher is very smart, fast, and the best teacher that those students have.\\n\\n\r\nOver the course of this anime, students will be able to go through their school year, learning while attempting to kill their teacher. Not much plot is going on (until to the half-way of the anime) in their school year. And yes there will be sports, tests, (summer) vacation, and school trips going on. And the best part of this anime is when the students learn something from the school year which they can apply it to the success of their lives and activities (or another step to try and kill the teacher).\\n\\n\r\nArt and Sound: 9\\n\\n\r\nWhen watching Assassination Classroom, the arts and sounds REALLY set the stage for what-ever activity or event the students do over the course of their school year. Let it be in a thoughtful attempt to kill Koro-Sensei, or let it be in a dead end pathway where the students has to decide and compromise, or let it be a student getting the spotlight and being bad-ass about it. You get the idea, the arts and sounds really enhance the meaning of the story and characters and especially characters who got a decent amount of screen time in the anime.\\n\\n\r\nThe opening and closing of the anime was really good also. The opening gives out a pumping action for viewers to enjoy another episode of it (or to dance with it). Though the opening may ruin the mood when at times the story progresses in a suspenseful way; the opening sets a happy mood in every episode, regardless of where the anime is going. For the closing, it brings a rather calm melody to end an episode. In my opinion, the closing was indeed the best for this anime because it really gives out this vibe of accomplishment and memories the students had went through over the course of the anime. In fact, check it out before you watch it. It's \"Hello, shooting-star\" by moumoon. (Don't worry, it has very little spoilers).\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 8\\n\\n\r\nThough a lot of characters come in over the course of the anime; there isn't much character development happening in the story. Yes there are students who learn from their teachers, but there are way too many students to hear their story fully over the course of 22 episodes. However, it is the many students that makes you feel like you were one of the student. And that is another reason why this anime is great: it puts its viewers into the perspective of either being in one of the student (Nagisa mostly) or being in the scenes of where those students are. It is as if you can emphasize them as the anime progresses.\\n\\n\r\nFor the sake of a review, I am not going to introduce all those students or the characters that came into the story.\\n\\n\r\nKoro Sensei: I pretty much explained a lot about it, except Koro-Sensei looks like a yellow octopus (or squid) who dresses like a scholar.\\n\\n\r\nNagisa: The main student of the anime who can read the environment of the scene. The viewers (us) are mostly in his point of view.\\n\\n\r\nKarasuma and Karma: Not much to say about them (to avoid spoilers). But let's just say, they are both badasses in their own way.\\n\\n\r\nIrina: That hot substitute teacher if you guys were wondering.....\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9\\n\\n\r\nI really enjoyed the experience that Assassination Classroom give out. It is full of actions, plot-twists (especially when Koro-Sensei is involve), comedy, badass, and suspenseful. There are times when Koro-Sensei teach the students (and us perhaps) something that they and I never thought or experience before. There are also times when Koro-Sensei is not as always the best, or as perfect than I presumed. In general, the anime gives me and viewers a fair share of laughter and motivation (and maybe some traits of being a badass).\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9\\n\\n\r\nAssassination Classroom is really cool, funny badass for a classroom setting. I recommend anyone who likes to see epic moments and take part of being a student (in the viewer's perspective of course). Though this is my first review  and I watched subs only; I still think it is worth watching. So watch it as you can get to experience how great of a teacher Koro-Sensei is and the potentials that class 3-E has.",

            "content": "When one reads a summary as ridiculous as the one that Ansatsu Kyoushitsu has, you know it's either going to be brilliant or awful. For me it didn't fall squarely into either, but definitely encompassed more of the former.\r\nFor an anime that has 'Assassination' in its name, the anime actually touches really little on actual assassination- the so-called tips that are given the students here and there are more general life tips on growing up, and there was very little real action- this is the reason why I'm not giving AK a higher score. AK, save for one or two scenes involving our protag Nagisaand his good buddy Karma, is sorely lacking in the kind of thrilling battle scenes that would give it an extra edge. It's a pity, too, because while the fight scenes involving each of these characters literally lasted less than a minute, they were more than enough to get me all hyped- and given how bloodshed and gore is pretty much omnipotent in anime nowadays, that should clue you in into the potential that AK had! (Fingers crossed for the second season, though)\\n\\n\r\nBy the second or third episode I was privately thinking that AK parallels Great Teacher Onizuka A LOT- an observation I see some others here have made. AK does all the feels right without being overly cliche or mushy about it- lessons imparted and character development are 10/10. Karma is the kind of crazy kid that half of fandom will swoon over, and Nagisa goes from being curiously androgynous to actually being...cool. Who would've thought.\\n\\n\r\nTangentially, I should note that since the class' goal is technically to kill their teacher, AK is full of the kind of dark humour that I'm totally down for, but might not be others' cup of tea. That aside, the supposed 'antagonist' or so called indomitable teacher is a right goofball so you'll get plenty of laughs from him as well. There's also the inevitable bikini humour/dash of big boobs which I abhor but have been resigned to accepting as a characteristic of modern anime, though thankfully that's kept to a minimum.\\n\\n\r\ntl;dr had great fun with AK these two days and looking forward to a second season; if you're looking for a non-romantic/coming of age comedy to indulge in this is for you!\\n",

I'm a sucker for anime that teach you life lessons and are in some ways inspiring in the sense of bettering yourself as a person. I certainly didn't expect to get that from this anime. The supposed bad guy in this anime is the yellow octopus creature who is the teacher of a classroom of misfits whose objective is to assassinate said bad guy. Yet, from all the episodes, he really doesn't seem like a bad guy. In fact, toa certain extent you start feeling like you don;t want him to be assassinated at all because he's such an awesome octopus.\\n\\n\r\nThis first season is all about introducing the important characters of the series. It explores their personalities and what they excel at, so that we can get connections and chemistry with these characters. No doubt so that later on we feel it when something tragic happens. This anime is also light-humored so you will get some little laughs in as it progresses. It doesn't try too hard to be good so I really like this anime, so I give it an overall 9.",

It shows different teaching styles and  how students can grow under those teachings.\r\nEven though the students of E class are the worst in the whole school, they all have their own personalities and talents. And their teacher is the best of all.\r\nThe best part of the anime is how the students go about tryingto assassinate their homeroom teacher (octopus??) while still taking classes from him.

Yes, I know it sounds weird, but the alien (Known by Koro-Sensei or Unkillable-Teacher) is a surprisingly good plot point. The children, are given weapons, and must destroy/kill the teacher. The reason for this, is that he claims to have blown up the moon. The setup is pretty interesting. The characters all feel unique, and it's quite honestly one of the most humorous shows I've seen of all time. For instance, Episode 8 starts out with this \"Korosensei\" singing a song of how tomake his face on earth (Including dropping a giant bean in Tokyo and flying at Mach 20 across the sky). This humor also brings the series along quite well, and it's quite funny at times. There are some tense and serious moments, especially towards the end, but it was overall one of the best anime I've seen in a while.",

Now we have that out of the way lets get started. \r\nThe premise of Assassination Classroom is simple. Asian Dad of the year becomes principal of an elite school and decides to push all the worst students into a special class E. Class E is used by Asian Dads and moms everywhere to scare and motivate their kids to work and study hard. However suddenly the moon gets destroyed and the person(thing?) responsible ends up becoming the teacher for Class E. Class E now getsan additional mission apart from clawing their way out of Class E and that is to assassinate their teacher before end of year else their teacher will destroy the whole world. \\n\\n\r\nThat premise should be enough to convince most of you to watch the show. If for some reason, you arent convinced then its no use. If someone is convinced but want to read on while the video buffers in the background, read on. \\n\\n\r\nThe biggest strength of Assassination Classroom is the teacher, Koro Sensei. He is an Octopus thing who can move at mach 20 speed and is insanely powerful. In a surprising twist, Koro-sensei is also the dream teacher none of us ever had (NOTE: not talking about the sex fetish we all had) He understands his students, takes note of individual abilities, takes time to customize his training for each student and is always available to cheer them up. As the show progresses, Koro-sensei shows incredible enthusiasm as the students' efforts to assassinate him. Apart from Koro-sensei however the rest of the characters are quite weak. The MC is an androgynous male who is as original as a wet tissue. The anime makes an effort to build the characters and make them unique by having them have diverse interests and reasons for coming to class E but they just isnt enough time to build each character up sufficiently. MC for me is weak and I do not think I will ever like him. Season 2 needs more Rio Nakamura, Karma, Toka Yada and Terasaka and less of Nagisa and Kayano. \\n\\n\r\nThe animation is smooth and well done. No compaints there. The music is really good with my favorite being Track 17 called Ritsu. The first OP is catchy. \\n\\n\r\nIn terms of enjoyment, each episode is enjoyable and seeing the students come up with plans to try and take down not only Koro-sensei but the other challenges they face is always fun. Heck, watching Koro-sensei react to things around him for 20 straight mins would be a blast. \\n\\n\r\nOverall 8/10. Onto season 2.",

Simply because I enjoyed watching it, every episode has me interested.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: Its a nice break from typical fighting anime. The more you watch the more you get hooked. Learning about the characters was the one thing anime i've watched hasn't done correct.",

            "content": "On my pious quest to find a suitable dub other than Black Lagoon or Suzumiya Haruhi no Yuuutsu I stumbled across Ansatsu Kyoushitsu. And quite frankly, I'm glad I did. I started to watch the show subbed but was recommended to switch over after about 3-4 episodes in. I'm glad I decided to finally watch the show, and I'm glad I listened to my colleague on the topic of English voice casting.\r\n~Story~\r\nAssassination Classroom by far is one of the most unique plots in any anime that I have personally watched, (that make sense). The premise isn't special but the array of circumstances is clear, byepisode one you know what the goal of the show is and you know if you're going to love it or hate it.\\n\r\nA squid monster who can move, (and fly) at supersonic mach 20 speeds has destroyed 75% of the moon leaving it a permanent crescent. In one year he states that he will destroy the Earth in it's entirety.  However, he has made a deal with the World's governments after they had failed assassinating him multiple times. This deal is that he teaches a class of 'failure' students and 'rebels' in class E (End Class). The students are equipt to assassinate him with special weapons that will only work on this monster, it will prove a challenge in the episodes to come to defeat this being. The World's government sends in multiple other assassins and 'teachers' doing this series, all prove to fail. In saying this, the show itself is drenched in satirical comedy and hilarious anime references, one of the funniest anime I have ever had the enjoyment of watching.\\n\\n\r\n~Art~\\n\r\nI was personally shocked at the performance of Studio Lerche's amazing work on Ansatsu Kyoushitsu. The variety of colors, the glowing, almost Madhouse looking designs. If Studio Lerche was applying for a job, this would be at the top of their resume.\\n\\n\r\n~Sound~\\n\r\nAny show that has an opening that can get you excited for it's next episode is definitely worth noting. When I think of these some come to mind, Higurashi no naku koro ni and kai, Neon Genesis Evangelion, Full Metal Panic, the list goes on for openings that get me pumped for the show. In no way am I comparing tracks from this show to other shows but rather in a static format, relatable.\\n\r\nAssassination Classroom's first OP, everything from the extreme ADHD art to the sound is amazing, and the ending also takes the cake for one of the most chill endings in anime.\\n\r\nI highly recommend the dub, or switching between sub and dub to see which one you prefer. Remember it's about enjoying the show, not what others think of you personally for choosing to watch a dub. Don't be that guy.\\n\\n\r\n~Character~\\n\r\nWhat happens when you take 27-28 Jr High students, give them guns, and tell them to fight a squid monster who is going to destroy the Earth in a year?! Have fun.\\n\r\nThe character development in Ansatsu Kyoushitsu is astounding and deserves full praise for it's use of a bait and switch tactics with a twist \"what the f***?\". This squid monster you will find here cares for his students more than anything, and would literally die for them, (ironic). Their well-being and future is on the top of his priority list. Yet, still, he wishes to destroy the Earth by the end of their second term, this is the twist.\\n\r\nWe see regular students develop into killers, but they learn in the most ethical and moral ways possible, personally by their teacher.\\n\\n\r\n~Enjoyment~\\n\r\nAssassination Classroom is a fun ride, and I'm definitely getting my hands on season 2!\\n\\n\r\n~Overall~\\n\r\nBuy it, buy it, buy it.\\n\r\nAssassination Classroom is worth your hard earned cash, and since season 2 has a higher overall rating, buy that in advance.\\n\r\nYou're in for a good time boys and girls.\\n",

It has about the same episodes in total and if you had to choose one, I would say choose Assassination Classroom.\r\nIt was funnier and has many more interesting characters in it. The openings are also better and you are more dragged into this anime by the opening, because the opening is so friendly and happy. \r\nI really enjoyed the first season of Assassination Classroom and am currently watching the second season. I like the idea of annihilating a teacher, because he says he will destroy the world next March after destroying the moon. This annihilation is notmeant to work with normal weapons, but with special anti-teacher weapons. For example a rubber knife and special anti-teacher bullets.\\n\\n\r\nI also like the character of Korosensei, because he is perverted, likes sweets stuff and he is not a human. Watch this anime, because there are not that many animes which consist of 50 episodes and are good.",

            "content": "STORY - 7\r\nART - 9\r\nSOUND - 8\r\nCHARACTER - 7\r\nENJOYMENT - 8\r\nAssassination Classroom is a weird premise combining that of both students and assassins to deliver a unique story. And to make it even more strange, they were given a task to kill their teacher who is an undefeatable foe... and friend?\r\nThis is a lighthearted anime of a bizarre classroom full of bizarre students being taught by a bizarre teacher. Yes, it's a peculiar concept but that alone is what made the anime appealing to me when I first stumbled upon it. The setting of a classroom with the addition of a seemingly immortal octopus-resembling teacherby the name of Koro-sensei turned the familiar place into a zone of assassins. Forging the themes of education and assassination brought in a set of lessons that highlighted some of the many characters. The majority of the students felt like background characters, getting a bit of dialogues occasionally but the ones that got a spotlight spoke volumes about what the show can provide. It's not highly psychological and it fits the story perfectly well, a fun entertainment basically. Koro-sensei is the iconic figure who is well-rounded in terms of his comedic personality and gives his students the best of what he can offer, even though he's a target for them. This made the student-teacher relationship a unique dynamic. Other teachers also comes with their own ideas of education, teaching the students all sorts of things to prepare them for what's to come, both in assassination and the dilemma of being a discriminated class. Speaking about class, what I find lacking was the school part as a bigger aspect of this show. It was shown that the class was prejudiced against but the attempts to show this issue appeared to be contrived or forceful. Simply, the slice-of-life plus assassination aspect was more enjoyable, with the multitude of assassination attempts, interactions and bonds between the characters, and the developments of a small few.\\n\\n\r\nAnother stronger aspect was the visual imagery of this oddly entertaining anime. The art style does take time to get used to, and once you settled in, the colorful gradients with the thick outlines for the characters gave a strong, striking appearance. Maybe because of the fact that the underlying theme was assassination, the art felt like a juxtaposition, a contrasting nature to that of the darkness or redness that you might expect. Not to say that there weren't any of those because it's an assassination anime anyways so it also came with fights too. Lerche portrayed the darker side with the use of sharp dedication in the characters and optical symbolisms such as snakes to represent the killer instincts. In more action-packed scenes, the animation helped in expressing a few things. Such examples would be the camera shakes that came with the unbeatable speed of Koro-sensei, yet again showing his apparent invulnerability. Or the amplified expressions in the characters who faced against the polishing assassination students. For the soundtracks, nothing really stood out though there were instances where they raised the atmosphere of some scenes. The only one that stood out well at first glance was the ending song, Hello, shooting-star. It's warm and soothing to the ears, and the chalkboard art that comes with the ending felt nostalgic to me as a high-schooler.\\n\\n\r\nSchool is a place where most of us will go through, and it can be quite stressful at a lot of times even to the most relaxed person out there. Assassination Classroom brings in a fun aura to the well-known classroom setting, having an ambience that is spirit-lifting. There were quite a bit of questions, answers, and improvements that were left in the first season, but overall, it was an anime that nicely incorporated assassination and education in an extraordinary fashion.",

The characters are well-drawn and move fluidly. The characters themselves though are mostly lacking in personality, relying on single traits. That is until you get to what I like to call the big four; Nagisa, Karma, Kaede and the big guy himself, Koro-sensei.\r\nThe soundtrack is, like theBakemonogatari soundtrack, full of catchy tunes that won't leave your head too soon.\\n\\n\r\nThe cleverest thing this show achieves is its subversion of battle shonen tropes. Big training scenes? Just have our guys and girls studying. The battle scene against rivals? an exam. The rivals/big bads themselves? students from an elite class.\\n\\n\r\nFor all people tired of the usual shonen series, as well as people just looking for a good watch, this is worth a try.",

I know I see something like this all the time where you bring people close together to become something there good at, or choose a straighter path, almost every anime film has that. Koro sensei has a will to do after a persons death and that was to teach class 3-E. and along with the story, some kids are jerks and dumb at first. but then, of course, everyone is bonding together like they're brother and sisters and wish they could hangout forever and hope time never ends. Still...I like the story because this is something I've never seen inquite a while because..well...you never seen a alien tentacle man teaching a class right? \\n\\n\r\nNow the Art.....WHO THE HELL CARES ABOUT THE ART!? I seen some reviews how \"art\" isn't the way they want it, but, c'mon man, this is 2017, this anime is 1080p high quality definition here, everything is colorful and the artist definitely tried their best. Don't make them put out more detailed on the art, nobody ever really pay attentions or wants to see that, just the story is what their after. ;) \\n\\n\r\nSound: No problem there, I think everything sounded perfectly :)\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: Karam. Karma is beautiful when he blushed O,o <3\\n\r\nAlright, its not only about Karma. Every character were great, they all had improved something and did things they didn't know they could do. Especially Nagisa who thought he was weak and cpuldnt do anything, but he actually has talent, everyone does really. Also you all gotta admit that the acting is absolutely over the TOP! In my opinion, I think Japanese voice actors put more heart and soul into their acting.....\\n\\n\r\nSPOILER SPOLIER SPOLIER!!!!! Skip this paragraph if you want to continue reading this review\\n\\n\r\nIf you know what I mean, after Nagisa did the most heart breaking thing to his sensei and other holding him, the fatal crying moment where everyone lets out their tears, not even the tough guys were able to hold it, and trust me, you are definitely not a man if you force yourself NOT to cry, seriously though, it feels good to cry and let out your emotion, this anime definitely delivered that emotion and I couldn't hold it on anymore! The actors were spectacular on that scene! Thats kinda why I believe that the Japanese voice actors are better than most different voice actors, now i'm saying Japanese people are better at voice acting, but it's just my opinion everyone ^.^\\n\\n\r\nSPOILERS ARE OVER!!! I REPEAT, SPOILERS ARE OVER!!!\\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed every minute it! Koro sensei is SO funny and the everyone too, probably typical Japanese comedy, but Koro sensei's \"No emotion face\" (Like this--> (*--* ) Just kills me XD\\n\\n\r\nOverall I enjoyed it, the anime brought the Feels, the comedy, and the story just as it was told! \\n\\n\r\n10/10",

Unfortunately, it seemed quite a rehash of similar animes in the genre, this time with the premise of an \"unkillable\" teacher that looks like an octopus. Since I finished the whole show, I must admit that it was quite enjoyable, although I needed to get to terms with one major plot hole.\r\nWhich was as follows:\r\nIt seems odd that the main characters's only concern is whether they will do well in school or gym, when they are possibly faced with extinction of the whole humanrace. Yes, they \"funnily\" tiedy to kill their teacher every opportunity they got, and knowing it was futile, they probably gave up on really doing anything to harm the creature. However, the psychological despair that knowing you are the reason earth will get destroyed is never portrayed. Somehow, doing good with your grades is more important than saving earth from destruction. I guess that's part of the \"comedy\" studio Lerche was trying to portray.\\n\\n\r\nThe most enjoyable part of the show was character development. I did feel somewhat for the individual characters's struggle (not related to killing their teacher though) and how they were overcoming this. It's just disappointing that they were completely oblivious of what the consequences of them not killing their teaching would be. Only a few characters were willing to do what it takes, but those were portrayed as evil. Why worry about earth if you can worry about your grades, right?",

I was expecting the chemistry of \"Danganronpa\": a somewhat gory anime of students having to kill eachtoher for freedom. However, I got neither of these, but I was quite pleased that I didn't. \r\nThis anime doesn't fit the summary, in my opinion, so if you want to turn away because the summary doesn't appeal to you, then I suggest you don't. If you like humor, group missions, fight scenes, battles (whether hand-to-hand or just midterms) and the whole school package, thenI suggest you stick around. The best part of this entire anime is character. \\n\\n\r\nWhen I watched the first few episodes, it didn't hold my interest for very long and I was on verge of quitting it, but I have OCD about leaving shows unfinished, so I went back and forced myself to keep watching. However, by the time I watched episode 12, I wasn't forcing myself anymore: I was truly enjoying it. \\n\\n\r\nThe selling point for this anime is the characters. They have great chemistry and it's great to watch them interact, not to mention the fact that they're all really skilled but also flawed, so you can cheer them on like real people. Sometimes it takes the cliche side of things, but I can assure you that there'll be some surprises. Some characters may blend into the background, but the ones upfront will never let your attention waver. \\n\\n\r\nThere's humor, enough action to keep me from getting bored, a little hint of romance thrown in for romance addicts like me (if you don't like romance, don't worry about it, it barely even lasts for ten seconds in the first season), some great teamwork and characters, and a good plot line with not too many holes. If you're looking for something to watch casually, this could be your next show.",

            "content": "School drama, plot to save the world, assassins, what more could you ask for in an anime. \r\nAssassination Classroom is a unique combination of several genres under the guise of a goofy, cheery school life anime. \r\nThe anime\u2019s story is pretty fun to watch as it evolves over the 2 seasons. We are watching the students grow as people, but we also see them grow as assassins as they learn of how to possibly kill their teacher at any open chance they get. It\u2019s a great mix between very well directed action scenes/animation and typical high school activities and issues the students deal with overthe course of a year. At around 50 episodes over 2 seasons, the pacing works well, although there are a few filler episodes, they all leave you feeling good at the end. It\u2019s enthralling and captivating but at the same time a pure joy of a watch. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters, besides the teacher, consists of all the students in the class and a teaching assistant provided by the government to teach the kids how to be assassins.  Although there are around 20 or so students, the anime does a good job of giving them all unique personalities and making it easy to distinguish between them. They also work together to almost seem like one big character. They grow personally and as a class and school anime\u2019s don\u2019t get better than this. \\n\\n\r\nThere are a few standouts in the class and they help propel the plot and bring in some of the most climactic and thrilling episodes. They all become characters you stand behind and want to succeed, you even end up liking Koro-Sensei despite the fact he plans on destroying the world. \\n\\n\r\nThe art is bright and fits the setting and mood well. There are darker moments and the art definitely helps to amplify it. The animation is sharp and spot on, it all feels clean and pristine from front to back. \\n\\n\r\nThe voice acting in the subbed version is great and the soundtrack to the show is amazing as well. \\n\\n\r\nAssassination Classroom is a complete package that doesn\u2019t drag along and doesn\u2019t feel like a chore to watch. It\u2019s an amazing story and written and directed superbly. I consider this a must watch and one that you won\u2019t regret once you start.",

I have this mixed reaction with school throughout my life.80% concept of education\u2019s system is what I can relate to.There were times where I have to face scary,strict,demanding and mood swing teachers living my life like hell. But in this case of the story,I have find the teacher(main character) phenomenal and extraordinary. I come across with the best teacher in the world.Ansatsu Kyoushitu (Assassination Classroom) isn\u2019t just about learning something from the teacher though. If you take a knife, gun, or whatever that can be considered a killing tool to school,you\u2019d get expelled. But in this series, that takes on a rather different direction. And I have to say, it\u2019s oddly interesting at heart.\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion, I highly recommend this anime series to students and for the people and otaku\u2019s out there who likes a slice of life story yet just phenomenal.There is also a manga for this if you want to watch the full story of it.Everything is just surprising.After all, isn\u2019t life just full of surprises?

            "content": "There are many reasons why I enjoyed this series, and being able to watch it with my 9-year-old daughter with both of us having a good time is at the top of the list. There are not many series that provide that, since they are either not appropriate for kids that age or they are boring for an adult like me. This is one of those rare exceptions.\r\nIf I told you that the basic premise of the series is that a classroom of students are \"assigned\" with the task to kill their teacher, who is an alien that promised to destroy the earth by theend of the school year if the class does not achieve the objective, you would think that this is an action anime. This is far from the truth. This series is much more about the relationship between a teacher that really cares for his students' development and personal growth, and about findings success when the odds are stacked against you. \\n\\n\r\nThere is quite a bit of humor in this series, some of it is high quality, some of it a little silly (it's a shonen after all, what do you expect?). The art is good without being the best out there. But the other area in which this series shines is in its characters. They dis a really great job with providing us with various options from students in the class that get the spotlight shined on them. That way, each one of us can have his / her favorite. From the quiet and cerebral Nagisa, to the Machiavellian Karma, to the bully Ryouma, there are plenty of options to choose from. On top of that, there are some intriguing characters as teachers.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, this is a fun series to watch. It may not be the highest quality anime out there, but if you are looking for some pure unadulterated fun, you should look no further. And as I mentioned at the start, if you are looking for a show to watch as a family, this is it!",

            "content": "Story: 8/10 \r\nThe plot is simple and very easy to follow, but there\u2019s never a dull moment. The theme could have been dark and dreary (a point gracefully pointed out in the first opening song), but it\u2019s instead lighthearted and funny, which is a huge advantage for plot progression. The story manages to advance and remain mostly comedic, which makes sitting down and watching it feel neither like a chore nor like a total emersion in brain cell destruction. Lastly, it is inarguably an incredibly original idea that I have yet seen to be attempted by any other series\u2014HOWEVER, I will say that if you\u2019relooking for anything down-to-earth or serious, this doesn\u2019t fit the bill (unless you\u2019re willing to suffer through a good 19 episodes of comedy). Really, if you start to think too much, you also start to realize how weird even the semi-dramatic scenes (and full-blown dramatic ones that appear later in the series) are, and it takes you out of the moment.\\n\r\nArt: 9/10\\n\r\nThe art style closely resembles that of Attack on Titan, with thick outlines, distinctive eye styles, various nose shapes, and assorted hair types (with, admittedly, many more unrealistic yet anime-esque colors of hair that help to reflect the difference in genre between the two series). \\n\r\nNote: [Upon a bit of further research, I found out that, in conflict with my prediction, the two were animation through completely different studios\u2014Wit Studio (AoT) and Lerche (AC)] \\n\r\nCharacter: 10/10\t\\n\r\nThe character development, to my surprise, is taken pretty seriously.  Even Koro-sensei, who is meant to be the most mysterious character, has specific personality traits and weaknesses easily discovered by Nagisa\u2019s diligent note-taking.\\n\r\nSound: 8/10\\n\r\nI give the sound 8/10. I actually picked up on the OST this time, realizing that I would have to include it in this review\u2014but considering that this series was given 22 episodes instead of your average 12, it was neither extremely notable nor really bad. I suppose I couldn\u2019t expect it to have an exceptional soundtrack given that it\u2019s a comedy anime--but I think it could\u2019ve been better, because though certain sounds did reoccur, there was no characteristic background music, just generic music.  I will say that I appreciated the difference between the opening of the first 11 episodes and the last 11.\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9/10\\n\r\nAs I mentioned above, it is a pretty light-hearted series, and there wasn\u2019t a point where I got bored of watching. That being said, given that this was mainly comedic anime, while there were times I did laugh, it wasn\u2019t frequently, which is what separates this anime from one I would give a perfect score.\\n\r\nOverall: 9/10\\n\r\nWould watch again. Looking forward to Season 2.\\n",

My overall experience with the anime was good i watched the dub and thought the voice actor for Koro-sensei did a really damn good job the voice for karma and so on the musicwas decent nothing too special. The intro however was really catchy every time i think about the anime the introduction music just comes into mind. The art is pretty good as well pretty decent character designs nothing too amazing but im not the artist so i cannot say garbage about it. Animation was good, story was fun and interesting enough to get me invested and to actually share a little laugh. Characters were pretty good the anime is more so focused on the class itself rather than 1 main character overall i just really enjoyed this anime and id recommend it.",

The supposed main character isn't very main and screen time is distributed, making the story a lot more about the class as a whole instead of following a small group to carry the plot. Actually, I suppose Koro Sensei is the main character in that he appears in practically every scene.\r\nMmmm... I'm not entirely sure why it was interesting to watch though... Makes you wonder what surprises will happen next I suppose. Or rather, it makes you wantto see what happens and how the characters come into play.\\n\\n\r\nA few nitpicks I suppose: Even when suspending disbelief about the basically invincible being that can do almost whatever the plot requires, travelling at whatever speed he's using in the classroom should cause papers and hair to fly, which bothered me for about 12 episodes before letting it go. It does make an effort to make ridiculous feats believable though. Also, If the moon were to have part of it blown up, it will not remain crescent. Also unresolved plot lines.\\n\\n\r\nOveral, it was fun. 7/10",

            "content": "At school, you may have some boring teachers, and you may sleep through their lessons; then, you may also have some teachers you actually like, and you're actually engaged in their lessons. For example, the teacher for assassination class is - Wait, assassination?! Since when does a school teach their students about assassination?! Well, if you're in Class 3-E of Kunugigaoka Junior High School, you would know the answer to that question. I don't remember exactly when it was that I first found out about Assassination Classroom, nor do I remember when was it that I decided that I was going to watch it; allI can say is that it was very enjoyable.\\n\\n\r\nLadies and gentlemen, tentacles all over, here is my review for Assassination Classroom.\\n\\n\r\nAssassination Classroom begins with a large portion of the moon being destroyed, turning it into a permanent crescent. (That's right, folks, full moons are now a thing of the past!) The one responsible for this catastrophe is a giant, yellow, octopus-like.... thing. Oh, you know how I mentioned what happened to the moon? Yeah, apparently, Earth's next, but first, the octopus thing, eventually named Koro-sensei, wants to teach Class 3-E at Kunugigaoka Junior High for a year! As a result, the students of Class 3-E are given an assignment; they have to assassinate Koro-sensei before graduation, with the prize for doing so being 10 billion yen! Of course, with that big of a bounty on his head, it's obvious that Koro-sensei is no easy target; he can move at Mach 20 speed, which makes it easy for him to dodge all of their attacks. It's not just that that's getting in their way (although Nagisa Shiota does take notes on his weaknesses); it's also how Koro-sensei is the best teacher they have ever had. Much emphasis on ever is used here, considered how badly Class E is normally treated.\\n\\n\r\nYeah, the story of Assassination Classroom can be quite interesting. It has a bit of a comedy/slice-of-life feel mixed with all of the students' attempts to assassinate their teacher, and it mixes in a bit of the academics, as well. What makes the story of Assassination Classroom interesting, however, is its characters. This anime is full of interesting characters, with not even one dull one. Saying that Koro-sensei is a great teacher is a great understatement; despite how he plots to destroy the Earth the way he did the moon, he puts his students first. He doesn't just teach them school subjects; he teaches them about life and goes above and beyond to help them with their problems. Koro-sensei isn't the only interesting character, though. A majority of the Class E students are likable, especially Karma, Nagisa, Kayano, and Ritsu. If there's any character in this anime I don't like, it's any student besides those in Class E; I just hated how poorly Class E is treated by others. They may be the lowest class, but the LEAST you could do is be at least a LITTLE bit nice to them!\\n\\n\r\nThe animation in AssClass (am I the only one who is amused by this abbreviation?), done by Lerche, was very well-done. It really stands out in the action scenes; with the fluid animation in the action scenes, you can really feel yourself getting into it. I alternated between watching this in Japanese (with English subs) and English (dubbed, of course), and I have to say that both versions have good voice acting. I also liked both opening themes, \"Seishun Satsubatsu-ron\" and \"Jiriki Hongan Revolution\"; they were very upbeat. While the ending theme, \"Hello, shooting star\", was also great, sometimes, I didn't feel it didn't really fit this anime.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Assassination Classroom is a very good anime. If you like anime that focus on teachers trying to teach their students (some other examples being Negima and Denpa Kyoushi), I think I'd automatically recommend this one. There are quite some interesting and funny things happening in the assassination classroom, where the students are assassins and their target is their teacher!",

            "content": "Story: Japanese for Assassination Classroom, we all know the story. An alien apparently blew up the moon somehow, and then he comes to Earth announcing he will destroy it, too. However, he offers the government a challenge. He will teach a class in Japan, and in the process, they can figure out how to kill him, and they have until their graduation to save the planet. The government offers called 3-E one million yen if one of them or all can get the job done. When you see this anime on this site first, you can see that it's a comedy. Based on the plotas a whole, what more would you expect from this show? Though the story is pretty over the top, the plot as a whole is done extremely well. I'm only saying that because everything you would predict does not happen unless you have read the manga before. I did not, so this surprised me on how interesting it really was. 10/10 kudos for the story.\\n\\n\r\nArt: The art is pretty neat for a shonen. It gives Assassination Classroom its own style. Also, I am very surprised on how well they make Koro-sensei while he's moving at the speed of light in the classroom while helping his students. It returns to the classic 2D animation that bring people to watching animation in the first place. With most companies trying to go the 3D animation route, people are forgetting about what you can do with 2D animation. Nothing seems to fail with the animation here. I'm in love with it. 10/10.\\n\\n\r\nSound: The openings to this show always get me going. They immediately tell you what this show is going to be like, but as soon as you get the endings, it's like a calming down back into reality, which is also done very well. Personally, I'm not a fan of the openings due to I wouldn't listen the shit out of them, but I'm in love with how calm the endings are. The soundtrack inside the anime is pretty good as well. It's simple, but it plays each scene perfectly. 9/10 for this one.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: There is actually no character that has been ever misplaced in this show at all. In a show like Assassination Classroom, you would expect only a few of the students to play a major role. That is somewhat the case, but each student does play a part and have his or her own personality to the point that they could be related towards the viewers. Though Koro-sensei is a god character, and we've seen too many of those before, he's a different type of god character. He says that he'll destroy the world, but he doesn't sound like that at all. In fact, he will do anything to protect the students he's teaching. He's like the father these kids never really had, and he would never let anything hurt them. If anything, he teaches them how to become stronger besides learning the ways of the assassins, and that's important for kids in our generation. My two favorite characters have to be Nagisa and Karma. Nagisa is basically the leader without knowing he's the leader. He's not the boring protagonist either. Though he's studious, he actually feels emotion, and we pity him for being in the lowest class because we know he doesn't deserve to be there. Karma is kinda a sociopath, but at the same time, he does care about Nagisa as his best friend. He's cocky, but he learns that cockiness leads to sloppy work. Though he's a jerk, he's a smart, caring jerk, and honestly, he's a sexy beast, and I love him. Even the side characters were done very well (God bless Bitch-sensei). Perfect 10/10.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: This show had to be the funniest show I have ever seen in my entire life. I bet it was funnier in English sub because I watched the broadcast dub version, but the show is still pretty damn good nonetheless. Every episode has at least a handful of good jokes. I also enjoyed watching the characters go on their journeys whether they have the same goals or not. This show just does everything right, and I never thought I would find something like that in forever. 10/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall: For anime fans all around, this show is a must watch. If you don't watch this show, what are you doing with your life? If you're worried that the dub sucks, it actually doesn't. There is no misplaced voice at all. Even Nagisa sounds accurate. Koro-sensei is not annoying sounding, which is a plus. Overall, I'd give this show a rounded up 10/10.",

            "content": "the title itself is honestly catchy but not in the positive way... \r\nAssassination classroom? What comes to the mind of the viewers? Something like students killing their teacher for some reasons? It sounded like a bad-ass example for youngsters... \r\nBUT HOLD-UP!! the trend might be that way... Junior high school students (they are only 14-16 y/o!!) were given a grave task to kill their very own homeroom teacher just to save the world and for the price of 10 billion yen!! but the story was beyond that... What made me like this anime (as well as the manga) was how the teacher had motivated hisstudents to fight against the inferiority complex that the school itself had been trying to shove into themselves. It was an amazing feat for a teacher to see soul-deep all of his students and treated them equally like his own kids. Despite the fact of his past life, he had been able  to set the correct path for them and these kids were able follow that path accordingly. The students had surpassed the challenges of being both as assassins and leftover students and at the end, they were able to smile and thank fate for giving them such man who never gave them up and even raised them up from the mud of the society. \\n\\n\r\nAssassination Classroom is an amazing story which featured how people who once lost their ways might still correct the paths of others to avoid the same mistakes and how students were still able to look back to those memories with smiling face and acknowledgement of the person who understood them more than enough. \\n\\n\r\n\"Whether a fish lives in a clear stream or a water ditch, so long as it is continues swimming forward, it will grow beautifully.\" -Korosensei-",

            "content": "So Assassination classroom. Definitely a weird concept. I got recommended this series through a friend. His words to describe it was \" A class tries to kill their insanely fast octopus teacher.\" The weirdness alone is what drew me in, and I am glad that I did. So this series is weakest point is definitely the story. However that is not necessarily a bad thing. One piece does not have much of a story either. It focuses on adventure and the characters going through situations. Similar premise here. What drives this anime is the solely character development. Which I love. It is interesting to seethe characters react to the situations presented to them. You really grow found of the characters, and you actually care about them when the great plot twists come into play. Which those twists make complete sense even if they do make you mad and or sad. The story actually does make sense, and from what I can tell no plotholes. The animation is also pretty good as well. Though I have not really watched to many of this studios work. I do love their series they made called Oh! Samurai Girls. They also made Danganronpa if you like that series. Overall this is just a solid series. This series is just a good series that makes you smile. I loved it.",

Each episode was started with that catchy opening song, Even now I still remember the tune.\r\n     Seeing how the failing students improve with the skills taught by Korosensei, change my view on teachers(well some of them) I would love to live in their world and be a student of Korosensei's Assassination Classroom.

            "content": "When written out on a piece of paper, the plot to Assassination Classroom sounds like some half-baked plot a kid with anger issues would start out with.  Basing a show around killing a teacher would be very easy to mess up, one slip and you go from the funny into the cruel and disturbed.  Assassination Classroom walks this precipice with a grace that just gets smoother and faster the farther you get into it.  The first episode is rocky, but the show quickly figures out what it wants to do, and it takes it from 0 to 100 real fast.\r\nEvery character hasa chance to shine.  My one worry with this anime was that a few characters would be handpicked out, and the rest of the class would be used purely for background movement.  But no, somehow every single person you see is fleshed out to be believable.  And this is all done without any filler episodes, or any sacrifice to the pacing of the plot.\\n\\n\r\nThe only minor complaint I have is that the art and music really didnt pop out too much.  The openings were great, and didnt get old, however they werent very deep.  The art style is a typical anime art style, without much deviance from the norm.  However each character was distinct, and no-one looked too far fetched.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all I loved Assassination Classroom.  It was just witty enough to get a laugh, just fast enough to never get boring, just enthralling enough to keep me hooked, and all thats piled ontop of a great story, with genuinely likable characters.  I can say Im genuinely exicted to watch Season 2",

            "content": "Assassination Classroom is not fot everyone. Its concept is weird and it kind of makes you question whether you should watch it or not at first. However, once you get used to the concept, it actually becomes pretty balanced.\r\nStory-wise, it's a pretty chill anime that offers you that one bit of relaxation. You don't have to waste brain power to understand what's going on. You don't have to pause it all the time just because you have to read that one line you missed. It's also pretty funny; the humor is simple but effective. There are gags that play many times without getting boring. That'swhat happens at the beginning. After a certain point, Assassination Classroom becomes way more interesting and you'll find yourself invested in it. Action, deep meanings, great humor, anger, you'll feel it all. You can see that there's a big backstory that just hasn't been revealed yet and that makes it all the more great.\\n\\n\r\nRegarding the characters, they're all exceptionally unique. Yuusei Matsui managed to create ~35 different characters that still feel so different from each other. The students' designs (apart from the protagonists) are not too unique, but they aren't bland either. You can distinguish them all easily and you'll also like them all. Their personalities are loveable and fairly realistic. Korosensei himself is a really interesting character, just like the protagonist students and the rest of class E's teachers. The best part about them is that there's an harmony between them. They all have their own quirks and talents and they blend in so well to the point that they make a great team. The character development is fair, some get more, some do not, but it's always enough to make you like them all.\\n\\n\r\nThe art and the animation is not really exceptional. It's pretty ok, actually. It doesn't stand out, but it doesn't disappoint or disturb you. On the other side, the music is nice. It fits the anime and it does manage to give you the chills at certain scenes. It just does.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, it's a pretty great anime which you'll enjoy whether you're here for the deep story or the morals or the humor.",

You've despised him or her so much that you've wanted him or her to get out of your way.\r\nBut you've probably never thought of actually killing your educator. That is not the case in Ansatsu Kyoushitsuor or Assassination Classroom and this certainly raises interest for the show.\r\nYou have reason to believe that such a one-sided story line - as it might seem in the beginning - will start to get boring. But that is not the case! The plot evolves in a way that keeps the viewer interested by adding a lot of new plotelements, let it be new characters, new locations, new plans. It should be especially noted that the story of Assassination Classroom is unique. Just like the students learn from Koro-Sensei, us viewers also profit from the wisdom of the teacher - sometimes without even realising it ourselves.\\n\r\nBeautiful art and music support the anime in any possible way. Its music suits the single scenes superbly and creates the desired atmosphere.\\n\r\nCharacter development. Having a class with approximately 30 pupils and an additional part of other characters, one would strongly suggest that developing each character is difficult and will thus be a weak point of the anime. But again, that is not the case. The show manages to involve most of the characters and gives them a valuable development, often accompanied by wise words of Koro-Sensei. It does indeed focus on the main characters but obviously, there has to be some focus on the main cast.\\n\\n\r\nAssassination Classroom is a show to be loved, a show to be cherished. This and its sequel are must-watch for any anime fan out there.",

Well there was a teacher who was like that.\r\nAssassination classroom is one of those generic shounen anime that you've been watching over and over... or so you thought. One of the main thing you could notice, is the diversity of cast and the management of all the characters, not that many shounen anime could emphasise on almost all of the characters within the show, it usually is the main characters getting the most screentime while the side characters that were introduced in the first few episodes get cast aside, but that's not the case for assassination classroom.\\n\\n\r\nWhat ruined a potentially perfect shounen anime is how the 'plot armor' revolves around the teacher, well sure, he's supposed to be almost invincible, but there are just so many nonsensical stuff going on that it's hard to say if the students could actually have a slight chance of even scratching him.\\n\\n\r\nIn the end, it's all about entertainment, what better way to spend your time than to watch an action-packed straightforward show?\\n\\n\r\nJust don't try to use the techniques shown in the show, they're absolutely real...",

It follows a class of students that must kill their octopus-like teacher, Koro-Sensei, by the end of the year, or he will destroy the entire Earth. The show follows the class' adventures with their teacher, through assassination, school, and even field trips. By the end of the show, you'll be wondering if they should kill their teacher, even if he will destroy the world if they don't.\r\nThe story is extremely lighthearted and action-packed for most of the show (Although near the end it takes a dark turn). Although it isa story about students trying to kill their teacher that would destroy the Earth, it still manages to have a cheerful and carefree tone to it. The art itself is nothing amazing, but well suited to an action-comedy anime such as Ansatsu Kyoushitsu. Character development is simply amazing: Although the show focuses on an entire class, each classmate has their own in-depth backstory and personality, all which are learned as the show goes on. It was an all-around enjoyable show, something worth watching.\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion, I'd definitely recommend watching Ansatsu Kyoushitsu. It perfectly fleshes out all the characters, and manages to have a lighthearted theme. The story is simple yet complicated, as if it were a series of delicate strings woven together.",

            "content": "Ansatsu Kyoushitsu - also known as Assassination Classroom is an anime that differs from your average anime where the genre school is tagged to it. In fact I may even refer to this as one of the rare masterpieces of storytelling that I came across on my journey through anime and manga. There is no particular condition which the viewer needs to fulfill first in order to enjoy this anime since it discusses so many different aspects of life sometimes in a smart and funny way while simultaneously being able to send the more serious messages which contain wisdom to the audience. \r\nTo give anoverview about what is to be expected when you enter the lessons of Koro Sensei you better not have zoo-phobia or the like because you'll be astonished once the lesson starts. An octopus like creature is too much to handle for anyone who haven't seen too much science fiction lately. This being not enough our octopus is actually the main protagonist around whom everything revolves for the most part. Quite the strange setup you tell yourself - but you know what ? This exact situation where a monster is called the teacher leads into some very amusing events throughout the show. Furthermore the main goal of the students of 'class-e' is to kill their teacher so that they may prevent the earth from total destruction. \\n\\n\r\nNow the title 'Koro Sensei' already refers to the relationship these students of class-e have with their teacher whom they casually are able to call their sensei. On the surface it probably appears like there is some kind of oppression going on coming from that yellow smiling octopus but soon enough the viewer is able to understand that this distinctive smile is nothing but the true and pure outcome of a person as compassionate as this monster called Koro Sensei. To get a better grasp of who he really is one shouldn't forget about his moving speed that is said to be around mach 20 or 6860m/s. Meaning he's able to cover the distance from Germany to USA in about 20 minutes. \\n\\n\r\nEven though there is an overall plot the anime still could be considered episodic but that is based on your own opinion. The main point to consider however is that each episode focuses on one of the characters that are present which leads to a sufficient character development. If you enjoy comedy anime in general then you absolutely will be pleased while watching this especially when it comes to the face expressions of koro sensei which I enjoyed the most. On the other hand the plot doesn't only revolve around class-e but also involves other classes from the same school which are all together opposed to class-e because it's considered as a place where only the 'losers' end up and the mysterious chairman also has a hand in this while the government cooperates together with the children from class-e to achieve their main goal of killing Koro Sensei.  \\n\\n\r\nI'll conclude this review by saying that I humbly would recommend this anime to anyone since there is something in this that everyone will find interesting regardless of his own taste. You will have a complete new understanding about the term 'assassination' afterwards and it's even possible to have a new way of understanding to life as a whole after watching this anime because for me it was a refreshing experience and the lighthearted moments combined together with the explanations of what really is important. I was overly certain about not having wasted my time much rather I got the impression that I've 'killed' my free time doing something quite entertaining.",

I'd like to take this moment to congratulate the author for this genius idea.....\r\nStory: I love the idea. The concept is humorous and I think the way class 1E or the \"End Class\" is portrayed is interesting(still annoying though how everyone else is all...y'know ill leave it at that for this part). \r\nArt/Sound: I mean its a 2015 anime, of course the quality is gonnabe good.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: hmm I guess they are all average, well except from Koro-sensei of course. Maybe they need personalities that stand out a little more...maybe that'll ruin the show...sorry this is my first ever review...\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: I love the punchlines like SOOO much. Like something stupid happens the \"ARE YOU SERIOUS?!?\" or \"ARE YOU KIDDING ME?!?!\". Just personal preference.

The story is beautifully written with serious aspects thrown within the comedic adventure. The story allows younger viewers to enjoy the show while also giving more insight to those older viewers with background knowledge about certain jokes.\r\nThe design of the animation is incredibly smooth and it was very difficult to find anything flawed with it. Although most anime features bright colours and tones, during certain scenes, darker variations of colours create the effect the story wants to portray perfectly.\r\nSince the anime features a large variation of characters, it's very difficultto get to know them all. Some are introduced very thoroughly, explaining their motives and reasoning in the plot, however most are excluded. Although the viewer may recognize a character for their previously stated backstory, the characters aren't worthy of having their names remembered.\\n\r\nThe audio and sound produce through this anime keeps the viewer on edge. The right soundtrack adds to the emotion of each scene.\\n\r\nAssassination classroom is a beautiful story. The sound and art assist the  brilliancy. As a viewer who recently fished the second season, I completely recommend this Ansatsu Kyoushitsu.",

            "content": "Hello fellow Anime funs (pardon for my English later on)\r\nI know for some of you note worth of \"10\" will be too high for this anime but for me myself I found it so good, so emotional, so well designed that I had to make a rating of a 10 out of 10 since I have no objections about anything from story to enjoyment. As far as I recall I have not been on such an emotional train long time. Probably since I've watched \"Steins;Gate\" which I will give rate of 10 out of 10 too. I have to say I was not expecting muchfrom this anime itself. Bunch of kids are learning at school and it's done by large yellow octopus but everything has changed after a few episodes later. I've been sucked to this anime so well that I have watched both seasons in one day. \\n\\n\r\nNow lets start from the Story which is not as complexed as you can imagine. Group of kids are learning in class \"E\" which is by far called as the worse of all classes. Even the building itself is suited on the top of the hill. Whole plot will be around killing large yellow \"sensei\" but the killing itself is not that easy as you may say, since the teacher is kind of immortal as long as you do not vaporize him entirely or cut straight through his heart. There is also a reward for anyone (or for whole class) which consists of 10 billions yen. Everything would be sort of easy for those kids to kill this teacher since they are trained well in termse of killing because they are attending to \"assassination class\" but things are getting much more difficult because of growing love between them and \"Koro-sensei\". That;s all here let's move to Art.\\n\\n\r\nWell I love all kinds of anime and every one has it's own magical looks that's why I am putting here 10 out of 10.\\n\\n\r\nSound :\\n\r\nAs far as I hate almost every intro and outro songs in Anime I can't tell the same about soundtrack inside of Ansatsu Kyoushitsu which is great. It's tensed where it should be and it's calm or even heart-moving in places where it should be. I have to admit there is some well designed music when someone reaches to the last episodes of 2nd season so you can google something on youtube to hear them out. They are outstanding.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters :\\n\r\nI won't be telling about everyone himself because It will took heck a long time to do. The class is a group who consists of poor and wealthy kids which their notes nor attitude where not that good as they should be that's why they have landed on the \"E\" class. Every character got his own back-story whether they had tough childhood by beeing borned in slums or beeing pushed way to hard by his parents and they ended in \"worst\" class \"E\".\\n\r\nThey all for sure growing up since episode 1 till the very end of episode 24/25 (so far 24 episode is the last one) of season 2. Give them a try and you will see that those characters are designed very well.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment :\\n\r\nI've told you I've watched whole anime in one day and I did not even make a single break. I think that tells everything about enjoyment \\n\\n\r\nOverall I could not say anything bad about it because it was pleasure for me to watch this and I have to say I do not watch the best once (in my opinion) twice. 10 out of 10 is way to low. I would give 100 out of 10 if I could. If you love anime as I do then just hop in and enjoy it and who knows maybe you will end it by crying in the last episode :).\\n\\n\r\nThanks to FUNimation Entertainment, Fuji TV, DAX Production, Dentsu, Lerche, for creating this masterpiece. \\n",

            "content": "I watched this anime at a time when I wanted to watch something that was just mindless fun. The main question is, did this Anime deliver? \r\nStory: 7\r\nThe premise of this story is just plain ridiculous, which is one of the main reasons I chose to watch it. My initials thoughts were that the show would get old pretty quick, and that each episode would just be assassination attempt after assassination attempt all ending in failure. Thankfully the show was variant enough throughout, with unique assassination attempts, conflicts with rival classes, and other twists and obstacles, which I felt was enough that it did notget too stale at any given time. Being a more episodic series, the quality of the episodes range from good to mediocre throughout the series, without any sort of consistency. The last arc of this season I especially found bland and completely drawn out longer then necessary. Thankfully even the more bland episodes have some good to great comedy bits sprinkled in to make the experience a bit more enjoyable.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 7\\n\\n\r\nBeing about a classroom, the show has a rather big cast of characters to deal with, meaning some unfortunately would not get much time or development throughout the show. What's sad is that only a handful of the 20+ students are developed well enough with only a couple actually being memorable (Karma being the biggest standout). The teachers by contrast are handled very well, with Karasuma being a great straight man and Bitch Sensai being very decent comedy relief. The most important character to the show, Koro Sensei, provides very good comic relief, an interesting outlook on teaching and an mysterious background behind his motivations, which all work to make him the best character of the show (no real surprising there since the main selling point is him). The antagonists are mostly mediocre, with the Principal of the school being the clear standout for the best due to his ruthlessness and especially cold personality.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound and Animation: 6 & 7.5\\n\\n\r\nNone of the OP's really stood out to me, same with the music throughout the series, which is not to say that they were bad, just not that memorable. Wish I had more to say here about that, but I don't. The animation is good with decent character designs, especially Koro Sensei. The action is very well animated also, with very good gunplay and close quarters combat sequences, which I felt were very fluid and impactful, which I find some Animes have trouble with. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment and Overal Score: 7\\n\\n\r\nThe show had some good action and good comedy sprinkled throughout, enough to satisfy my fix for mindless fun, so it at the very least accomplished its goal. However, the shows lack of consistency, mostly weak villains and an underused big cast really hurt its score overall. If your looking to have a good time and wanna just turn off your brain and watch some over the top, humorous, straight up ridiculous anime, I'd say give this one a watch. \\n",

            "content": "Before watching the anime, i had read one or two chapters of the manga and heard about the story from a friend. From those i thought i already had some idea about how it was going to be and i was increbly anxious to watch it. \r\nThe story. I have to admit i was somewhat disappointed when i first watched it. From reading reviews and people commenting about it, i was sure it was supposed to be a pretty badass story. It did sound like THE story...on paper. \r\nOn the animation, though, it was portrayed in a fairly silly way, the comedy and sarcasm overlappedthe scary action filled story. That\u2019s my only complaint in this point, but notice that this \u201clittle\u201d detail ended up ruining a big part of my experience. Regardless, I have to say the idea was an original and the application was quite good. Specially the slow-cooked relationship between teacher and students made it more enjoyable and relatable \\n\\n\r\nThe art. I wasn\u2019t used to this drawing style on the characters part. The thick lines were a bit of a problem for me, but that goes with taste. Although it did match with the teacher\u2019s animation.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters. As mentioned on the story topic, I loved the slow development of the relationships in the classroom, as well as their own individual personality development. There was a good mix of different temperaments in the classroom. Also for the teacher, who was getting closer and closer to the kids, even though he was supposed to be the bad guy.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment and overall. I had a fun time watching this, specially on the first and last episodes were the climax reached its highest point. It was nice seeing how the students got attached to sensei and vice versa, and how they were trying so hard to get away for him to live afterwards. \\n\\n",

            "content": "I haven't been watching anime for very long. I must be coming up to 5 months. In this short amount of time, I've been able to observe many different trends, formalities and gimmicks and one of those is School life. In around 50% of the anime that I have watched, the main protagonist has had to balance the interesting life with the less-so-interesting school life. Don't get me wrong, I understand why the writers do it. I understand why most characters are teenagers regardless of the context and I'm sure you do to. With that, I have never considered myself one for the 'slice oflife' genre. When I watched Toradora, I considered it 'dipping my toe in the pool' and although I liked it, along with Clannad, its not really something I'm hyped over.\\n\\n\r\nYou may be thinking to yourself - \"Whats slice of life got to do with it? This is about a classroom of assassins trying to kill their superhuman teacher.\" - and while you may be right, there is more to it than that. Assassination Classroom is unique in the sense that it does what others have done before but with such harmony that it becomes greater than the sum of its inspirations.\\n\\n\r\nWhen I write a review I try to match the tone of the anime I'm writing about, unless I have something extreme to say, with that said,\\n\r\nYou can take of the scuba gear now, we won't be going any deeper.\\n\\n\\n\r\nStory -\\n\\n\r\nAssassination Classroom (AC) is a story about a classroom of exiled delinquents who are charged with trying to kill the mutated M&M that decided he wanted to be a teacher in-between destroying the solar system. When I first read the synopsis I thought - This is gonna be one big gimmick-fest isn't it? - I was wrong. The teacher, who later becomes called Kuro-sensei has great chemistry with his class and as a result, we get a mix of 'slice of life', madness, comedy and all around positivity.\\n\\n\r\nOn top of this, the weapons that the class are given can only hurt Kuro-sensei, which may seem insignificant but it opens so many doors for utter chaos which pays off nicely.\\n\\n\r\nOne thing I will say is how easily everyone (including the government guys) forgot that their teacher was planning on destroying the earth. It seemed like the plot forgot itself and took a more developmental approach to everyone's relationships. This also resulted in school focus, which was OK if only because exams were portrayed in a gladiatorial sense where they were taking out the things from Evangelion which represented exam questions.\\n\\n\r\nArt and Sound -\\n\\n\r\nThere isn't much to say to be honest. Art and Sound is only as good or bad as the story its for. Luckily for it, the story was amazing. I will say that the Art was on-point. The portrayal of Kuro-sensei was amusing and worked very well.\\n\r\nSound wise, the sound track was pretty memorable, I may even put one or two on a playlist. They complimented the anime well... that's as much as I can give you.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - \\n\\n\r\nAS is officially the first anime to acknowledge my inability to determine whether or not a character is a boy. Top marks. -heh-\\n\\n\r\nAnyway, one thing that I can flaw MAL for is its labeling of character roles. They are either mains or supporting. Don't let it fool you, everyone is a main. In this season, nearly everyone in the class is given equal time in the spotlight, nobody is the best at everything and all responsibilities are shared.\\n\\n\r\nIndependently, all characters are different... Really different. To go through them all would be torture to read so, I'll just tell you that they are each worth your time and are all memorable and unique.\\n\\n\r\nKuro-Sensei is a lot easier to talk about. His end goals completely contradict his personality and while it is kept to the side lines, he and the class form a tight bond. Kuro-Sensei is probably one of my favorite characters in anime, he is so smart yet so clueless. So evil yet so selfless. So cocky get so considerate. Its very hard to make a character everything but I don't think it could have been done any better in this case.\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment -\\n\\n\r\nTo say that I enjoyed this anime would be an understatement. I loved this show. The only thing I can really scrutinize it for was the fact that it forgot about the whole 'assassination' part of 'Assassination Classroom' for a little while.\\n\\n\\n\r\nConclusion -\\n\\n\r\nI loved this anime... Loved it, loved it, loved it. I imagine that the next season is going to be even better. Knowing that the second season wraps it all up, stories will be told, attempts will be made and bonds will be broken. I can only hope that it ends well (I write my reviews season by season so I'm gonna go find out... bye).",

            "content": "\"Ansatsu Kyoushitsu\" or better known as \"Assassination Classroom\" is one of the best shounen series in this decade. It starts with the quirky episode about killing an overpowered character then slowly takes the audience to the feels train wishing you to go back to school and relive those youthful days. Technicality wise, the animation, music, script, comedy, and action are topnotch. The show touched a sensitive part of the educator in me when I realized that a weird yellow octopus on a doctorate toga can make any teacher put to shame. Now, I think a new education development model can be formulated based on thisanime.\\n\\n\r\nThis is a show every otaku must watch. No Fillers and set on middle school since of high school which plagued shoujo dramas for ages. I give it a 10/10 rating.",

It could have been made very darkand bloody as Akame ga Kill or Danganronpa, but it's actually very funny and light. The plot is very interesting, because it's the first time I saw a school anime where the students had to kill their teacher and it's a very original concept which has been pretty well developped. What makes this series very amazing is the fact that it stays nice during the whole 24 episodes while most of the series have somedisappointing epiosdes or arcs. The characters are the best part of this anime, because we can follow the evolution of every member of the 3-E class. Each classmate has its own personnality, strengths and weaknesses and they are all very different one frome each other, which reflects the tremendous work of the autor Yusei Matsui. In addition, the antagonists, the teachers and the side characters are extremely complete and have an individual character to each. The soudtrack is good and the animation is excellent also. That'S why I rated it 9 on 10.",

            "content": "Ansatsu Kyoushitsu or Assassination Classroom, a peculiar name for an anime which proved to be equally peculiar and yet highly entertaining. Assassination classroom tells the story of a group of students who have the daunting task of killing their teacher who happens to be an octopus like creature who is powerful enough to destroy earth. \r\n                             Even if it sounds ridiculous, the anime is something which is great. The story progresses at a reasonably fast rate andyet doesn't lose even a minuscule ammount of the narrative elements a story should have. It is almost a vicious delight to watch Korosensei(the octopus like creature), dodge bullets and knives all the while teaching his class of students. Students who have been deemed unfit for regular schooling, students who possess extraordinary skills which make them perfect candidates for killing their teacher. The story is well written and holds both, action and life lessons. In almost every episode, we learn something new about a character, be it a student or Korosensei himself. The progression rate of the story is impressive, it does have a tense undertone, as there is a deadline for the students who want to kill korosensei, but, the story somehow throws the spotlight on how good of a teacher korosensei actually is. As far as characters go, korosensei is an enigmatic one and is supported by equally interesting charactes. Nagisa Shiota, who happens to be a lead character, perfectly fits the cap of an unlikely hero. The characters of Karma Akabane and Kaede Kayano are also well written. There is a huge amount of character development all throughout the series. Nagisa, a boy who is often tease for his androgynous appearance, quickly develops into a person who is the most talented at Assassination. Also intriguing are the characters of Karasuma, a government employee, and Irina Jelavic, an assassin, both of these people teach different things to the class while trying to kill korosensei themselves but by the time this season ends, it is evident that they have grown to respect and even admire korosensei as a teacher.\\n\r\n                                         Ansatsu Kyoushitsu is an anime which is both enjoyable and fun, along with being a story of growth and understanding. The series shows how each of the students grow also throwing great focus on the class working together to come up with ways to kill korosensei. The anime is higly enjoyable, portraying a lot of complex emotions in a simple manner. I highly reccommend this to any and every perso who has had an enigmatic and encouraging teacher in his or her life. Overall, it is truckloads of fun and doesn't feel boring even for a little amount of time.",

            "content": "\"Assassination Classroom\" is my favorite anime ever. However, that opinion may change as time goes on so if something replaces this as my favorite I will edit this and change that statement.\r\nStory: While this premise is not very deep, it is unique and works well with this type of series which is a comedy and does allow for the ongoing mystery which is set up. since there are no rating things for a script, I will put my statement of it here. Some jokes fall flat but the majority at the very least got a chuckle. 9/10\r\nArt: The character designs are unique and Korosensei's design,in particular, adds to the absurdity of the situation which helps in making it clear that this is a comedy. The background looks well made and the eyes of the characters look unique. Color choice also looks nice and the oversaturation shows that this is a comedy. The one flaw is that when characters are talking, it is mostly static with just lip flaps. However, that is most anime so it does not matter too much. 10/10\\n\r\nSound: The voice actors do there job great even in the dub and the sound effects are good. The soundtrack sounds bland but when it wants to hit you in the feels, it really works. 9/10\\n\r\nCharacter: The entire cast is unique with there own personalities. the development of the characters makes sense and really makes you care about everyone in class 3-E. It was my favorite part of this entire show. they also work off of each other to make you laugh. My personal favorite character was Karma. His blood thirst and ego are hilarious and his character arc was really well done. 10/10\\n\r\nEnjoyment: I think it is the best anime ever. The way the characters work off of each other in comedic fashion made me laugh a lot and I could relate to some of the characters. It was just a fun time overall. 10/10\\n\r\nOverall: I would be lying if I said I wasn't biased but it is still a fun comedy with lots of character development. Overall. 10/10",

It should have lasted 13 eps at most.\r\nArt\r\nIts there. Nothing great about it as there are no beautiful cuts. It's what I expect from a more recent anime release.\r\nSound\r\nSame idea for the art. It's expected, but there is nothing significant as no real music cuts were fantastic.\r\nCharacter\r\nEach and every character bothers me. Maybe it's just me, but they are all annoying in they're own way. Also the alien guy is the most confusing character imaginable. He will destroya world, but first he has to teach??? Like how is this logical, I get there was a promise, but how can a promise lead you to teach kids and destroy the world they live in after.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment\\n\r\nThere was none from me \\n\\n\r\nOverall\\n\r\nIf you enjoy seeing how many ways they can think of failed ways to kill and alien by all means watch the show. I am sure most people watched since they want to know how he dies, if he does at all, but honestly I rather just google search it to see the creative way of his death, if there is one.",

            "content": "Assassination Classroom (AC) is a show about a class of F-grade misfits who are one day given the task of assassinating their new homeroom teacher. And if that\u2019s not strange enough, their teacher, Koro-sensei, is actually a seemingly untouchable, tentacled creature who threatens to destroy Earth should they fail in their assassination.\r\nBut more than a high-octane thrill ride featuring elaborate assassination attempts and exciting fight scenes, AC is an unexpectedly touching show about growth.\u00a0This particular group of young adults have been looked down on all of their lives, by their parents, peers, and teachers. They have repeatedly been told that they will not amount toanything just because their grades are mediocre. Who can\u2019t relate to that on some level? Who hasn\u2019t felt that crushing sense of shame when made to feel like a loser by the people you look up to most? I can certainly relate to that, having attended a grades-focused, well-to-do academy myself. Middling (though hard-working) B grade students like me were always overlooked in favour of the A+ students, who were showered with accolades, praise, and opportunities that I could only dream of. So the treatment of the E-class absolutely struck a chord with me and I expect it will you, too, should you identify with any of what I just wrote.\\n\\n\r\nBut under Koro-sensei\u2019s tutelage these students were able to shine. He didn\u2019t take a one-size-fits-all approach to education, but gave each student advice specifically tailored to them, taking into account their experiences, personalities, strengths, and weaknesses. And rather than cramming their heads with facts, Koro-sensei would attempt to engage his students as well as teach them useful life skills, such as conversations skills, the joy of reading, and not succumbing to peer pressure. And even when the students didn\u2019t succeed, with their exams or their assassination attempts, he never branded them as being failures, but continued to encourage and support them. It was so uplifting to see the students grow in ability and confidence as the show progressed. It demonstrated just how much of a positive effect having somebody believe in and encourage you can have on your life.\\n\\n\r\nBut in addition to being touching, AC was hella funny. Because of Koro-sensei\u2019s varied and astounding abilities, it had an anything goes vibe and often featured ridiculous and unlikely scenarios, such as using porn mags to lure Koro-sensei into a trap as part of an assassination attempt. AC was also pretty self-aware, often breaking the fourth wall for a laugh. In that way it felt a lot like another one of Jump\u2019s babies, Gintama.\\n\\n\r\nAC had a large cast, which included the 3-E class, their adversaries, their contemporaries, and their teachers. The standout characters were Koro-sensei, who I have already gushed about, and Nagisa. Nagisa was the character who exhibited the most growth throughout the show. It was satisfying to see him go from being the class punchbag to the one who everybody looked up to. But instead of letting this go to his head, Nagisa remained humble and was quietly confident and self-assured. He made a nice change from many other (Jump and otherwise) male protags, whose abilities make them arrogant, loud, and annoying.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, AC didn\u2019t really benefit from having so large a cast of characters, as most of the E-class were pretty forgettable. And there wasn\u2019t a female character who especially stood out to me. Irina-sensei made a living off of her sex appeal, Kayano was obsessed with her flat chest, and Hara was mocked for being chubby. The women were little more than the total sum of their body parts, which was a shame.\\n\\n\r\nAC was fairly good-looking and had catchy opening and ending themes. Its art style and sound design weren\u2019t especially outstanding or unique, but they definitely get a passing grade.\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion, AC was unexpectedly touching and a lot of fun. It had a few lovable and memorable characters and looked and sounded good. I\u2019d recommend AC if you\u2019re a fan of Gintama and/or Sakamoto desu ga? as both are equally silly and the latter also features a seemingly untouchable character who, despite the best schemes of those around him, excels in every situation.",

            "content": "Disclaimer at every review I am writting: don't mind my perfect english\r\n'cause english is not ma mothertongue yall.\r\nThis review includes the second season as well, but the score I am giving here is the score I think it's fair for this season!\r\nI think that this review would be refreshing for some people because we always need to read through an entire book when it comes to MAL reviews. But what most people are looking for is an opinion if they should watch or leaf the anime for good.\r\nMy review is spoilerfree. \r\nYou find a discription and - even a trailer - of this anime, sodon't look forward to any discription of the plot here.\\n\\n\r\nI don't recommend the anime if:\\n\r\n- you are an obsessed person who bashes on every anime ever\\n\r\nbecause he thinks that his objectivity is a bless to the entire anime world. This is not an anime for you.\\n\r\n- you have seen so many animes by now and you think your taste is Gordon Ramsey taste.\\n\r\n...I recognize that all my arguments for this group goes to the same direction, so I end it here, but you get my point.\\n\\n\r\nWhy I loved it:\\n\r\n- I hate cliches and I remember that the first episodes were so cringy I had doubts but those cliches turned into a lovely realtionship between different characters which is why I enjoyed it afterwards and it will be summed up like a beautiful masterpiece in the end of season two.\\n\r\n- What I personally loved about the anime was, that we had our main characters but our secondary characters did get screentime and personalities. If you know some anime cliches you know, that secondary characters normally do not have an outstanding style or different hair colouration. But here, like I said, it is not the case, which was refreshing.\\n\r\n- I loved how the mood and realtionship changed between charachters. It was so well made, I had tears in my eyes because I had feelings with all of them. Because I want to be spoilerfree, I can't go into detail with this. If you are curious you can leave me a message. \\n\r\n- It was sometimes funny, I cracked \\n\\n\r\nWhy I recommend it to you:\\n\r\n- It is a new concept. Original. Refreshing. Funny. Sad. Tragic. Cringey. Filled with cliches but good at the same time\\n\r\n- A little bit of Slice of Life, topics like discrimination were mentioned and how unfair it is\\n\\n\r\nOverall, my last words:\\n\r\n- Normally, when I would go in my Gordon Ramsay Rampage mood, I wouldn't hype this anime, because I know it had some weak points (cliches and cringeness) but sometimes a human can get a personal connecting with a thing which makes it more enjoyeable and loveable. \\n\r\nRight now I am rewatching the anime again because I have this connecting. \\n\r\n- Even if this anime might be \"not as good as\" some high quality animes (basically animes like Death Note), I want to score it high, because I think it deserved it. I don't need to explain it with complicated calculations or book like reviews. I liked it, I enjoyed it and when you ask me, give this anime a try but watch more than just the first season.\\n\\n\r\nI give this season a 7\\n\r\nthe second season did get a 10.",

            "content": "Assassination. Ah yes, ansatsu. How can you possibly resist? Just the sound of it makes your blood race. The ring of it resonant in your mind, once you hear it you never ever forget. And \u201cthat\u201d I\u2019m referring to, is, of course, nuhuhu\u2026. None other than Nagisa\u2019s cross-dress. Yes, What got me in this particular anime is not the premise nor its title. It is Nagisa. Just look at that cute face, innocent smile, hairstyle..how.HOW.JUST HOW?? \r\nCan you make junior high students hold guns. Damn you author\r\nOk let\u2019s get serious. When I started, it makes no damn sense. A few episodes in, still no dice.Watched till episode 7 just meh. I seriously considered dropping by the end of ep7, it\u2019s nothing more than your romcom. Very episodic and story doesn\u2019t even relate, you even got washout bulleys picking from behind and the cast is way too big gives off Negima-vibe (and you know how inferior anime is to the original manga) About all that is good is the non generic, even first of its kind teacher. I could be watching Death Note and HunterXHunter (\u201911 edition) or Kaze Koi which I\u2019m currently holding off for this failed ass joke.\\n\r\n But if you manage to sit through first seven eps, you\u2019re in for some good nurunurunuru* The anime is 22 eps with one goal of students killing their teacher but to no avail. Why? What calls for this setup? Dunno. Why\u2019s the funny creature acting as a teacher? You won\u2019t get any answers not even if you finish the 22\u2019s. the show is a comedy despite its title and its at times serious undertone, it can be funny when it tries but can have you waste 24 mins when they slack off. My fav character of this anime is Nagisa he\u2019s a girl, she\u2019s a boy, I like that kid. Also I developed  interest in the teacher who always smiles no matter the situation even when it\u2019s rape. He, the target makes a good instructor and a fast transportation vehicle also a fun smile buddy. His life is threatened constantly with every preceding attempt more vicious than the last yet he enjoys it. He gives advice to those that are after his life, he purposely takes the bait and falls into traps however he makes it out alive. I respect this show for being a harem yet not having girls act as sluts. I give it a round of applause for fitting its dark undertones into a comedy. I have made much critique about this anime but I like it at the end and I will even give reasons to watch it. I have questioned how this scored 8.21 average, now I know after witnessing a good picture of Nagisa crossdressing. Just beware PARENT DISCRETION IS NOT RECOMMENDED AND DO NOT WATCH BEHIND A LOCKED DOOR EITHER.\\n\\n\r\nDo watch if:\\n\r\n1.\tYou support 2nd amendment\\n\r\n2.\tYou want to see Aizen w/o his hollow army but still has ongoing tensions with Ichigo\\n\r\n3.\tYou are curious where 8 tails jinchuriki went after Sasuke chased him out of his village\\n\r\n4.\tYou look for a good tentacle porn without actually touching its boundary\\n",

There were all the typical students with their typical dramas and woes.  Then came the typical drama of falling in love with the enemy and internal conflicts that persist throughout the series.  The whole thing became very predictable.  There wasn't much substance to hold my interestbut I powered through to the end.  I know a show is good when it ends and I instantly feel that I'm going to miss the characters or need to find the prequel or even fan-fiction.  This was not the case for Ansatsu Kyoushitsu.  The only feels I had for this show was \"meh.\"",

            "content": "At first I didn't want to watch Assassination Classroom because I thought it would be too goofy for my taste. However I got into an altercation with my economics professor in college and, I was pissed. After that I was in the mood for a high school anime and, this anime came up. I started watching and, I could not stop watching. Before I knew it I finished the show in about 10 hours which blew my mind. I decide to rewatch it and, it was just as good as I thought it was.\r\nThe story of Assassination Classroom follows class #-E the Outcasts of KunugigaokaMiddle School, the class is filled with delinquents and, students who weren't up to the standard of the school. Then one day the moon gets destroyed and, is in a crescent shape permanently. the creature that did this threatens to do the same with the earth but, first he asks to become the teacher of this class. The government agrees to pay the students if they can kill him. However the creature who looks like an octopus humanoid emoji hybrid turns out to be the best thing in their lives.\\n\\n\r\nThe story of this show was absolutely whack and, could have gone wrong in so many ways but, the execution was brilliant. The story was handled brilliantly, it was relatable because who didn't want to kill a high-school teacher at some point in their lives. Also, the creature who is given the name Koro-Sensei is the best teacher ever, I can only wish to have had a teacher like him when I was in high school. The story also executes the theme of the group that is outcast to perfection especially during a group assembly where our main char caters are treated like garbage. To add on to this the story isn't rushed and, is given time to progress and, develop. This approach allows for future plot points to be set up and, characters to develop. The school element of the anime was one of its best features and, the illustration of the pressure students are under was so surreal yet relatable especially the episodes where they were doing exams and, a baseball episode. This show also blends comedy and, drama better than any other anime I have ever seen. There are also two school trips which took place in the city and, on an island that gave some of the best television I've seen all year. I also loved how the show was self aware and, took risks that I haven't seen in other anime. \\n\\n\r\nI have never heard of Lerche studios therefore I had no idea what to expect from the animation aspect of the show. The visuals of the show were absolutely beautiful and I believe that this is the most vibrant anime that I have ever seen. The action sequences of the show were almost of cinematic quality particularly the final assassination attempt on Koro-Sensei this season, if you look up edge of your intensity this sequence would be there it was absolutely phenomenal. There is also a very dramatic fist fight between one of our main characters Nagisa Shiota against an ex military guy who is probably the biggest jackass in anime history. The only character that I hate more that that guy is Joffery from Game of Thrones but the way that fight was handled was brilliant. The character designs were absolutely beautiful. Each character having a distinguished look and, that separates them from any other anime I've ever seen.\\n\\n\r\nThe musical sore of the show was probably one of its best features as its instrumental themes were perfect. each enhancing the tone of the show in a horror, dramatic or comedic way. The first opening of the show was a head scratcher because the opening scene was intense, dark and creepy then transforms into an action film and then the goofiest opening ever but, it gets you pumped to watch an anime. The second opening was similar to the first fun, full of energy and hyper with bright colourful visuals that were beautiful to look at. The ending of the show hello shooting star was a mesmerising song as it was calm and, peaceful.\\n\\n\r\nThe show takes an interesting approach with its characters as it attempts to give each character in class 3E development. Our main character is Koro-Sensei as he essentially drives the plot of the anime, he is a great character in every single way, both funny, bad ass and, relatable. Our next main character is Nagisa Shiota a boy who looks like a girl, at the beginning is is like the punching bag of the class but he grows into the biggest badass in the class thanks to one of the coolest characters in the show. The only other character that feels like a main character is Karma Akabane who starts of as this psycho type students but across the series becomes more relatable and humane but retains his smart ass mentality. Other characters such as professor Bitch an mr Karasuma were cool and their interactions are fantastic. Ritsu an AI who gets an entire episode dedicated to her developing a likable personality, Terasaka who undergoes the largest development in the show and, every other student ranging from science geek to pervert to anything else under the sun but most importantly assassin. the main campus students treat our protagonists like shit and, this is a part of a messed up system created by the principal of the school. Seeing the struggle the students of 3E went through was reminiscent of the current world as some people are put down so others can succeed. To be perfectly honest I would have loved to be a part of this class, it would have been the ultimate adventure.\\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed this show from start to finish. I loved the comedy and, drama. The characters and, story  were relatable and an absolute joy to watch. The music and action sequences were great and, this anime holds a special place in my heart as it gave me joy during a time of depression.",

It provides a unique dark setting that's actually not gory or visibly disturbing (although some characters are likely uncomfortable with it). It also has minimal fanservice (but some at all which is actually visibly pleasing, especially going along well with the art style and occasionally seeming unexpected as a nice surprise for those who enjoy it) and a quirky cast, not to mention a fairly interesting twist on a \"slice of life\" situation. Overall, it's somehow very positive and peppy while being kinda dark, but thepositive outweighs the negative (considering it's fictional, of course) and so far, there's not a bittersweet feel to it (I haven't seen the ending yet, though).",

            "content": "I have completed Ansatsu Kyoushitsu also known as Assassination Classroom. This show is about a hyper fast hyper intelligent octopus looking superbeing who has destroyed a large portion of the moon. This upright, smiling, yellow looking monster then threatens to destroy the earth given a year's time. Since he is so fast, no government in the world is able to kill him. Now, this cheery cephalopod, after toying with the nations of the world, has some odd requests. He requests to teach a class of 9th grade kids who are the worst in their school. There as the monster, that the kids then named Koro-Sensei,teaches, the government assigns the kids to kill their teacher. The reward? 10 million yen. The kids then begin their assassin training to kill their teacher.\\n\r\nThis concept seems weird at first, bunch of kids trying to kill a planet killing monster, but also being taught by said monster? Although, the execution is top notch and thats what matters. There are quite a bit of characters in this series, and its consistent with them too even though about 8 or 9 are really important. You can see them all from the beginning. Its one of those anime that despite having a large cast, they do it well as to make them not distracting. The character designs are simple and elegant, except for Koro-Sensei, and their personalities match to them. I especially like the teacher's personas the best. Koro-Sensei's character was very entertaining and carried the show for me. The cartoonish actions of his strange body and his easy-going, reliable personality made him a fan favorite. It makes me forget that the goal of the show was to kill him. I believe that the art is below average for the show unfortunately though. There are some very good parts where the animation really shines. The music is fine if anything, the OP's and ED's are terrible in my opinion. Despite it flaws, I still like this show a lot. I give Assassination Classroom, a 9 out of 10. With anyone who knows anime to watch it. This has been your spoiler free but not really review on Ansatsu Kyoushitsu aka Assassination Classroom.",

It's mostly school-life with occasional action scenes. I personally do not like this anime, but I can understand why others might. If you like school-life and action you'll like it. I don't care that much for school-life. It is also really repetitive. It's less so in the second season, but if you can't stand repeating formulas of starting the school day, accepting a challenge from the A class or teacher, challenge begins, action scene, E class comesout in some way, show principle scheming another plan or berating his son, repeat, then don't even bother with this anime. And while it's not like this in every single episode, it happens way too often for my taste. Also some really fucking stupid twists occur in the second season. One in particular made me stop watching. Overall though, I can't fairly assess it, especially since I haven't finished, but this is simply a warning for people who wouldn't like this so they don't waste their fucking time waiting for themselves to start liking it.",

But the first 10 episodes of this were actually prety good. The jokes were funny and it was pretty amusing. But as the season progressed I felt myself having to grind for the last episodes.\r\nStory: 6\r\nThe story to this didn`t make much sense but it was alright. It worked for what they wantedto do with it. It was kind of ridiculous but the entire show was ridiculous so I guess it fits.\r\nArt 7 and Sound 4: \r\nThis is a newer anime so the animationlooks good in this, nothing ground breaking though. I judge sound on voice actors and the music. I hated the voice actor for the main character, it just didnt fit and was annoying.  Plus the intros were absolutely aweful, I like anime`s with nice intros but i couldn`t stand these.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nThe characters in this both ruin and make this anime. On one hand the teacher is awesome. He`s super funny and may even be one of my favorite characters. But on the other the main character is garbage. The voice actor didn`t fit for this character and it was a very generic character. But all of the supporting classmates were pretty good. Honestly any of the supporting characters would have made a better main character.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 5\\n\r\nOverall I would recommend you at least try this anime. The first ten episodes are actually pretty good and you`ll definitely get some good chuckles in. You may even like the whole anime. It just felt like it was missing something (like a good main character).",

            "content": "When I first heard about Assassination Classroom, a close friend of mine said he watched. After that I searched it up and saw a yellow octopus and immediately thought that this was a dark and creepy series. Being a person who heavily enjoyed My Hero Academia this series was recommended to me. So I decided to give this anime a chance and after completing season 1 here's what I think.\r\nStory:8/10\r\nIntriguing and unpredictable. Like I said earlier I thought this series was gonna be dark and violent(hence the title's name)but it turns out I was wrong. This series focuses more on its lighthearted tone and aboutbeing fun, and in some cases it makes it better this way. Where it truly shines is when Koro-Sensei is teaching his students as he bonds well with them and being the best teacher they ever had. This leads to unpredictable moments as it makes you ask, \"How will they kill someone that's not only unkillable but loveable.\" Where the story gets disappointing is actually its dark assassin side which is underwhelming cuz you would expect it to shine here.\\n\\n\r\nArt:9/10\\n\r\nColorful and great. The character designs were given effort here and what liked was how everyone was given their own unique look that helps us recognize them. The visuals are bright and full of rich coloring that adds to the series' light tone. A huge highlight here was how heavily detailed the setting's backgrounds were making them look realistic , examples would be the school's building and beaches. As far as animation goes there were times when it felt crisp and clear(The openings)but it also looked a lil too standard at times. The biggest standout here were Koro-Sensei's facial expressions which were heavily used for comic relief and worked to perfection.\\n\\n\r\nSound:8/10\\n\r\nVery good here. I was actually slightly disappointed in the music here, there's not a specific track that stood out to me. Usually most anime openings sound great to me but unfortunately that wasn't the case here. My favorite track would have to be the ending theme as it was very fitting and had a nice sound to it, but its not something that I would wanna listen to on my spare time. The dubbing was very solid, the star here is w/o Sonny Strait as Koro-Sensei. He nailed his comedic moments and you can tell that he has lots of fun in performing the role.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:7/10\\n\r\nGood job here for a good sized cast. In terms of entertainment this cast is top notched, they're all so fun, enjoyable, and rarely do they give you boring scenes. Koro-Sensei is honestly one of the most enjoyable characters in anime and to think an octopus like creature who's the villain that incredibly likeable sounds kinda weird. However him as character isn't great yet cuz we weren't given enough insight nor his motives to why he wants to blow up the Earth. There are some students that are given depth and insight such as Nagisa and Karma, but there are others that don't and it feels underwhelming. I found Itona and Shiro to be fascinating characters but they weren't given enough screen time to TRULY standout.\\n\\n\r\nFinal Verdict\\n\\n\r\nSeason 1 of Assassination Classroom was very good and enjoyable. I definitely get the My Hero Academia feel to it as its setting heavily centers inside the school. It comes across a lighthearted show that likes to make its audience laugh and have fun with. As for its flaws since its story isn't completed yet its next season can hopefully fix this. Its next season is also its last and I'm looking forward to how it concludes.",

            "content": "Assassination Classroom is a great anime, another anime in which I get to obsessively fangirl over Jun Fukuyama and his voice as he voices the lead Koro-Sensei. Breaking it down:\r\nStory: The story was really good for this anime. It was the kind of story that we can all relate to in some way or the other and it was able to really resonate with me on a personal level, Koro-Sensei's quest to help better his students and get them out of the E-Class mindset. Unfortun ately there were parts that felt like the story was beginning to drag, and some of the episodes felt thesame, in the sense of attempt assassination, fail, life lesson, rinse and repeat. This only happened in the first part of the anime, whilst they were revealing characters, and it was a good way to do it, so an 8/10 for story.\\n\\n\r\nArt: I think that the art was quite well done in this series. It had awesome fight scenes that were well-choreographed, as well as smooth animation throughout its entirety, as opposed to some that are great only in, or every time besides the action scenes. 8/10 for art.\\n\\n\r\nSound: I think that the OST was quite good for this season of the anime, and the ED was good as well. I greatly disliked the choice of OPs though, so I'm only giving it an 8/10.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: I think the characters in this anime are very in-depth and fleshed out really well. There are few continuity issues with characters' personalities and this anime has spawned some of my favourite characters in anime. The exploration of backstory was done quite well, and it did not feel forced or out of place. The voice-acting was also quite welldone. 9/10 for characters.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: As I have previously stated, I really enjoyed a lot of the things about this series, and of course Jun Fukuyama is the lead! It doesn't get much better than that, along with everything else I listed, so this definitely deserves a 9/10 for my enjoyment.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: Taking everything into account, and ruling out my incessant fangirling, I still believe that this anime deserves a 9/10, probably an 8.5/10 to be more accurate, but I'll round it up since this anime is really enjoyable and I got quite attached to the 3D characters and background soundtracks, I highly recommend this anime.",

            "content": "I don\u00b4t know how I have not seen this anime before.\r\nWell built characters, comedy and action abound in this anime where the goal is to kill your teacher. I found the original issue of killing your teacher so you do not destroy the land and reward you with millions of yen.\r\nThis anime is a great example of the great education that Japan has since teachers there care about the future of their students. At present, I think education has fallen a lot. In my first year of FP I have witnessed the misconduct that some teachers have with students, not empathic and that there aremore professional and competent people who deserve the position more than them. I myself lived as an English teacher called us fools, the class to pellets and even our tutor had to talk to her to solve the discrepancies we had with the teacher (which did not work).\\n\\n\r\nI think the teachers should see this anime to better understand the students because, Koro-sensei helps them, gives them advice and lessons wise and cares for them. Koro-sensei is the perfect teacher, the ideal teacher that every student should have.\\n\\n\r\nAs the series progresses, students evolve, face their fears and decisions which will not be easy. And the series, never bores you.\\n\\n\r\nThe action scenes are very good, at all times you want to know what is that mystery that surrounds Koro-sensei, who he is and why he wants to destroy the earth. His story is tragic and that ending, THAT FINAL ... I cried.\\n\\n\r\nThe only fault I've seen is that very few comedy scenes have made me laugh and some characters have had more prominence than others. Even so, the anime is fun and very entertaining.\\n\\n\r\nUndoubtedly, this is an anime that everyone should see.\\n\\n\r\nNote: 8\\n\\n\r\nHave you seen the anime? What did you think?\\n\\n\r\nI invite you to follow me on my blog to create more content ^^\\n\\n\r\nhttp://sbernacalvo.blogspot.com.es/\\n\\n\r\nUntil next time! ^_^\\n\\n\r\nSONY",

But there is no real big change.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 1/10\\n\r\nSorry for all the people who watched it I really couldn't enjoy the anime and it took ages for me to finally finish it.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 4/10\\n\r\nGod, the jokes are so horrible, If anything goes bad the teacher jumps in asap to help them. Apart from the art there is not really anything that is good here, Boring, slow paced, Nothing actually happens and feels more like a ''feels good anime for kids''\\n",

It seems silly and weird, but there is just so much to it that makes me love it, I'm so happy and enjoyed this season.\r\nArt:It's great, especially at showing the sensei's movements and actions.

It teaches cliche life lessons that you would see on a PBS kids show. their was even a point were the MC says \"just be yourself\" and even shows a kid saying no to drugs. If you are a child you might enjoy this show as it makes assassins look \"cool\". But when they compare tests to monsters that can only be slain by studying and working hard and \"doing your best\" I felt like I was watching an educationalvideo. This show has a serious setting but ignores all the serious aspects. these children don't seem to understand the situation they are in. and if they did they would HATE their teacher as he is threatening to kill them and their family's. All they care about are their grades and wanting to be liked. its almost as if they don't know what assassins do or know what killing or death is. If they were to kill their teacher they would be filled with regret since they are so attached to him. Not to mention that these CHILDREN are being taught that killing is OK. what is this the Congo? Sorry I know I already used that joke. these children are gonna serial killers in a few years.",

Here is my two cents on: Assassination Classroom Season 1!\r\nThe story is simple, an odd yellow octopus thing that can move at MACH 20 blows up 75% of the moon, and vows to do the same to the Earth next March. No government or agency can touch him, they have given up. Oh, and he wants to teach the lowest class, E-Class students at a middle school. The students have to work with assassins to learn and then kill him by the end of the schoolyear, March. \\n\\n\r\nThe art is clean, action sequences look good.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound is spot on, and the voice acting is quite superb.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters have some depth, but this is a mostly lighthearted anime.\\n\\n\r\nThe enjoyment however is where this shines. Assassination classroom is simply fun to watch. You will be addicted to the almost childish nature of Kuro-Sensei, and the kids are equally fun to watch, especially when you can relate.\\n\\n\r\nRATING: WATCH THIS ANIME FOR SURE\\n\\n\\n",

The arc where taking a difficult written exam becomes really big drama-fueled mind games and students use creative methods to cheat on it, I've always felt that was a really underrated part of the show.\r\nI feel Assassination Classroom is largely only similar to that on paper. This is mostly a comedy and while there is some test-driven drama, it's not very common, so I don't feel it was an accurate recommendation.\r\nHowever, it wasn't a completely terrible show. Though I found the comedy hit-and-miss, there were moments where I laughed,as well as a few other moments I enjoyed. There were a couple particularly likable characters as well.\\n\\n\r\nFor me personally, though, the laughs weren't frequent enough and the plot too thin for me to score this very high. Despite its bizarre concept it's a pretty mediocre anime and left me feeling neither here nor there, which can be categorized as a waste of time.",

Next is the story. I found the story original and compelling. It also brought up several issues that caused me to think about my own life as well as the fate of the world as a whole. Another thing I liked about the story is how it doesn't just jump in and gives you everything, but slowly introduces new facts and shows hoe the students have to deal with it. Which leads me into my nexttopic, character (development). This anime has some of the best character development I've seen in a while touching everything from Self value, parental expectations, hard work, social life, and even classification and separation. I loved watched each individual student grow as they faced challenges in both their every day school and home lives, but also in their \"secret mission\". I would recommend this anime to ANYONE who loves action anime, school life anime, or anime that can be related to. I myself was able to relate to a part of each individual students challenges",

He even encourages them, and find all their hidden strength in each person and take it all out in the best way. Awesome.\r\n+ The ending song. It works so well. I'm glad they didn't change it for 22 episodes.\r\n+ This show will give you interesting lines and teach you how to navigate yourself and make your talent shine at its best while still being yourself. (some are kind of \"you don't say\", though)\r\n+ You will never forget this iconic yellow octopus teacher, ever.\r\nWhat Idon't like about it:\\n\r\n- Have you ever find a scenario in movie where you feel like there's no way it will work unless the author want it to work? Something like an escape route that feel forced to exist, or a plan which obviously more risky but they ended up succeeding for no real reason. Yeah, you will find it here too, quite often.\\n\r\n- That outrageous school system is approved? Well, let's just assume all the parents, society and government in this world is just made of paper who will only say and act just to bring background story under the author's intention. Should be more interesting if the society is opposing this school.\\n\r\n- Occasional exaggerated metaphor. Oh, I can't spoil anything here. But really, sometimes the metaphors are just 'meh'. I'm not even sure if it's for comedy or serious thing. \\n\r\n- Another disappointing detail: That half-destroyed moon. Isn't that going to make changes to earth in one way or another? No? So apparently, it's just for show. A waste of idea.\\n\\n\r\nWhat I feel indifferent about:\\n\r\n- Art is okayish.\\n\r\n- Plot is nothing exceptional.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nIt's pretty fun to watch. The story is mediocre, nothing stands out. What's really interesting is the relationship between the teacher and his students, and of course, his teachings. Nice waste of time.",

            "content": "This review applies for both seasons of the show.\r\nAssassination Classroom is a good choice if you're looking for a comedy that is hopelessly optimistic, while you're also holding interest for a school setting that actually manages to portray a classroom properly. However, it is a bad choice for you if you dislike its style of comedy, and if you think that you would dislike a series that tries to have serious moments while resetting all possible negative consequences right afterwards.\r\nThe series aspires to be both a comedy and a show about the care and affection a teacher has for his class and the affection theclass has in return for its teacher. By making them kill him and holding the planet as ransom if they don't comply. I love you, kids. However, due to the fact that it tries to be a comedy that can make you laugh at any time while also trying to have a lesson to draw at the conclusion of each arc it created sort of a predictable format for each of its arcs. Even worse, due to its premise inciting in a direction that has to feature some sort of action somehow, in order to portray action and stay true to the premise, occasionally the series has to go to a really dark place or an unseen twist and fix it immediately after in order for it to stay a cheerful comedy. \\n\\n\r\nAs a result of all of this, this is the structure of almost every arc in this anime: Create a dangerous situation OR a heavy malicious twist from a character or characters that were meant to be on the class' side. Solve the situations while strengthening the class-teacher bond, while displaying the teacher in a strong light. Then turn every character from evil to neutral or neutral to good after the entire conflict or arc is over, except for like two characters which feel like edgy saturday morning cartoon villains. And then hit with the conclusion from which the class or the persons in the conflict draw some conclusion, always optimistic.\\n\\n\r\nThis is kind of my biggest gripe with the series. That it tries too hard to maintain things in the same status quo through and through, and only positive consequences are accepted in the aftermath of each arc. For a shorter series it would've been fine, especially if it took itself less seriously than Assassination Classroom, but when the structure's format becomes so prevalent, this does take away a lot from it. Because look, none of their actions have any negative consequences and things are too positive, hence a lot of the drive of the action is just removed whenever it is about to happen. And this makes the series predictable, which in turn kills my involvement and some of the comedy, since a lot of it is character driven. The characters start to feel more like means to tell gags than actual portrayals of people and... this makes the show feel very artificial after one point for me.\\n\\n\r\nI'm not saying it's always consistently in this structure or having this effect constantly. It occasionally breaks out of this structure just for some more comedic episodes and each arc has some varying levels of success, where the action and how it is solved makes sense while the lesson hits the right spot. But a lot of the time, the inbalance between the negative consequences and positive consequences takes a lot from its meaning and my investment in it. \\n\\n\r\nIf it weren't for the structure and the unsatisfyingly tame conclusions to some conflicts, this series could've been a lot better, because it does do a lot of things right. \\n\\n\r\nThe story of the anime focuses on displaying the bond between a teacher and its students, someone who puts genuine heart into helping his pupils improve. Despite the fact that they have to kill him, he's the most helpful person they've had in their life in regards to their academic studies. The story is not very complex in regards to what it does. As I've said the series has a structure, it pretty much follows that structure all up to its end. it will try to develop the relationship of the students and deliver a lesson each arc and mini-arc. Don't expect something any more complex than that.\\n\\n\r\nThe comedy is mostly character driven and it plays it off of all the characters contextually, taking advantage of the multitude of characters to create some feasable non-intrusive jokes. I mean, the occasional \"oh wow the teacher is a pervert\" or \"girls without clothes, am I right guys?\" doesn't bode with me because of the frequency of these jokes, but otherwise, the series does amuse me most of the time. It built its comedic bits well and I do applaud it for that. Most of its humor is contextual, and most of the jokes are jokes told by characters at the expense of other characters. Which is something to be expected in a classroom dynamic. The sense of humor is mostly contextual, based on character interactions. Depending on who is the butt of the joke, you might be amused by it, you might be not. It all depends on the context.\\n\\n\r\nI appreciate how the class was built, each character having one or two traits to distinguish them in personality or appearance. Not all of them are particularly memorable and charming, some of them have enough traits just to be able to be distinguished, and some of them have more development and focus put on them. While this must not sound particularly good, since every character gets some moment or other and they all have some degree of screentime, it was enough to flesh out a functional classroom, where you understand the groups and subgroups of the class and you understand which characters of the class are the popular kids of the class and which are the unpopular more ordinary kids. You understand the hierarchy of the class, who has which place in the class and who they are. It's natural to have more focus on certain characters that contribute more to the class while letting the less involved abstain. Think back to your time in school and the class you've been part of. I'm sure you can remember a bunch of things about the kids that got the spotlight of the class and only one or two traits about the kids that didn't get much of it. It's the same thing here. While they don't all get constant attention, they all feel like they have a place in the class they're a part of.\\n\\n\r\nThe action of the series was surprisingly decent. There are some fights that involved some degree of planning, with a couple of possibly expected twists because assassination requires the element of surprise, but that played exactly into what would be generally expected. However there were a couple of moments where the fights didn't go an obvious route in their execution, and the best example is the inner conflict of the class. You see for the most part the class is complaisant with each other, not having too much of a conflicting mindset about their actions with one another, but there is this one episode where they will. This creates two sides in the class who decided to solve the conflict by fighting each other in a capture the flag paintball match as a mock assassination competition. When the fight reached its peak something interesting did happen. Rather than fight in a manner of winning or losing the fight, the characters decided to fight in a way that would prove their point to the other person. It was a really high point in the series and a genuinely nice action piece to observe. Usually, the action is just decent, occasionally strategic, usually banking on an element of surprise, even possibly to the extent of an asspull, but that's to be expected given the class' goal of eliminating its teacher and the length of the series.\\n\\n\r\nThe artstyle of the series is usually solid, but it has these weird moments when everything is way too bright. Like, the characters look like they're under such a bright light, if they look directly into it they would at least be temporarily blinded. The general color balance is fine otherwise, it just has some weird moments when this is the case. It doesn't really work out considering the overall design of the series is very bright colored already. I don't have any complaints in the sound department, or any immediate compliments. I didn't particularly enjoy any of the openings or endings, but there were a few songs I've enjoyed off the OST.\\n\\n\r\nSo, if you're interested in Assassination Classroom, accept it as a very optimistic comedy that always aspires to be meaningful. Don't expect the story to not be without its share of tragedies and sad moments, but know that by the end of each day, the series will stay as optimistic as it can. If you're not looking for a comedy, the school setting turns you off or the attitude and structure of the series sounds like a big gripe, I don't advice watching this series. It is a show that tries to not take itself seriously when telling a joke, just in time for it to get serious in order to lecture you. But I'd like to note something. Not once did I really talk about how the show has created a tentacle monster that is going to destroy the world. Because this creature was portrayed as a teacher that wants to help its students. That is its most prominent role and nothing else. If you think that a gigantic yellow emoticon with tentacles being so easy for someone to be accepted as just a teacher is competent or incompetent for a series, you might want to reconsider watching or not watching this series.",

            "content": "I did not finish this show, but I can't imagine much changes as it moves forward.\r\nAssassination Classroom is a series that tries to do a whole lot. If a series like this wishes to have a strong connection with its audience, it must succeed at most of what it does, because any individual thing that it succeeds in happens so sparsely that it cannot carry the rest of the series alone. AssClass just sort of drops the ball on execution. While the series has solid presentation and is generally funny, it is also clogged up with junk that doesn't mean a whole lot to theaudience. \\n\\n\r\n[Story]\\n\r\nThe basic premise itself is great! This alien guy blows up the moon, and threatens to blow up the earth in one year's time. He is so fast that he can't be killed, but makes a deal with the government to work as a teacher for a certain class so that he can be supervised and a secret to society. This class is a group of misfit toys, the bottom of the barrel in their school. But Korosensei (the alien) happens to be a great teacher who strives to really help the kids succeed. Both in academics, and in trying to kill him. There are many themes available to touch on, and the show does take advantage of this. There is...\\n\\n\r\n- The action of the assassination attempts.\\n\r\n- Learning background and helping individual members of the class.\\n\r\n- The class' role and adversity as a section of the whole school.\\n\r\n- The backstory of Korosensei.\\n\r\n- The humor of the characters and situation at large.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, these mostly start to fall flat. For instance, the assassination attempts lack agency because there is never any consequence. Korosensei is both invincible and does not enforce consequences on his attackers. The individual characters are very flat, not much beyond pure tropes. A large component of the series is just doing character studies where Korosensei helps the students be more comfortable with themselves, but the characters are weak enough that the audience does not really care. The school has a morbid, inaccurate portrayal of morality in a class-based-system, which makes the adversity of class 3E feel totally fabricated. Korosensei's backstory seems compelling but is really only teased at. The humor in the show is decent, but at the same time it is mostly the same gag -- Korosensei is fast and can do random things in the blink of an eye.  \\n\\n\r\nSo really, though a bunch is happening, it devolved into something like a student/assassin-of-the-week show, with no end, growth, or substance in sight. Many things could be done to fix this, and it isn't to the point where I believe AssClass S2 couldn't be saved, but it isn't worth continuing for me.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\n[Art & Sound]\\n\r\nThe presentation in the series is good and hardly ever flubs. It has an interesting style of drawing characters, where their outlines make them seem like stickers... but in a good way. There is really nothing bad to say about the art, but I guess there is nothing amazing about it either. Sound design is standard but good.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\n[Character]\\n\r\nKorosensei is the lead, and really the only character. He is entertaining, and potentially has a compelling backstory that will be revealed in an organic way. That's great. But every other character so far is just straight out of Tropesville and very bland. Just look at the 'main character', Nagisa. I've never seen so much of a blatant self-insert. This character literally does nothing. Beyond that, Nagisa's look is neither typical male nor typical female, allowing her to work as a surrogate for a wider fraction of the potential audience. Come on, why do you need this in the show. This is just one character, but is really an example for what the show tries to do. It just shotguns these weak woe-is-me characters at the audience, and hopes that a few of them can stick the landing. Do better, anime.\\n\\n\\n\r\n[Enjoyment]\\n\r\nThe series is generally funny, by virtue of Korosensei and him alone. But this is sort of offset by the rest of the junk going on that isn't really possible for the audience to connect with.\\n\\n\\n\r\n[Rating]\\n\r\nStory: 3\\n\r\nArt: 8\\n\r\nSound: 7\\n\r\nCharacter: 2\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 5\\n\r\nOverall: 5",

After watching 19 episodes, I can gladly say that I didn't enjoy them and decided to drop as a whole. This is because the reasoning behind the plot that was just too ridiculous for me. Of course, I am aware that it is a fictional plot and refreshing for the audience. However, looking at how junior high school kids able to surpassed their adult counterparts with the help of omnipotent Sensei remain ludicrous for me . Perhaps, the anime didn't suit my interest but I believe that people looking for a refreshinganime with a new concept can opt to watch few episodes and decide for themselves whether to continue or not.",

El monstruo afirma que dentro de un a\u00f1o, la Tierra tambi\u00e9n ser\u00e1 destruida por \u00e9l, pero ofrece a la humanidad una oportunidad para evitar ese destino. \u00c9ste mismo comienza a trabajar como maestro en la clase 3-E de la secundaria Kunugigaoka, cuyos estudiantes tienen el objetivo de asesinarlo. \\n\\n\r\nLa historia se ve rid\u00edcula y algo que s\u00f3lo lo pensar\u00eda un ni\u00f1o de 5 a\u00f1os, \u00bfc\u00f3mo un profesor que destruy\u00f3 la luna y que dice que destruir\u00e1 la tierra va a dar clase a unos adolescentes gandules que deben asesinarlo?
