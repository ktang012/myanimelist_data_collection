            "content": "I'll start off by saying that if you're a fan of the series Baccano, Kyousogiga, or both, then you're going to love this show.\r\nThis series, in my own humble opinion, is basically perfection. \r\nIt took only one episode for me to completely fall in love. \r\nAllow me to explain to you exactly what it is I feel about this series. \r\nKekkai Sensen is directed by Rie Matsumoto, who I personally see as a genius. Her directing style is extremely distinct and very unique. She has a wide range of creative camera angles along with her brilliant tactics into making something engaging or exciting. If youwant an example of her work, watch Kyousogiga. That show is fantastic as well and I highly suggest watching it.\\n\r\nAnd although her directing style is super energetic, she somehow manages to make it so the show is easy to follow, despite all of what's going on at once.  \\n\\n\r\nWhen it comes to it's story, Kekkai Sensen makes great use of the world it has created. Countless things could happen in this twisted version of New York City. I won't tell you about anything that happens in the series, because honestly I went into it blind, and I wish for you to do the same. \\n\\n\r\nThe art is most likely the weakest point in the series, if we aren't counting camera angles as an artistic value. The only reason why is because the animation isn't exactly up-to-par with all of the other shows airing this season, yet it still manages to at times create it's own special atmosphere which continues to engage me in it's marvelous universe. \\n\\n\r\nThe Sound and Characters are both fantastic aspects to this series, and I emphasize the character importance because they're easily the best part of the show. I can't even tell you how fun it is to watch these people interact and work together. All of their personalities are non-generic and the director takes advantage of it's wide variety. Not to mention, there are actually about 5 or so voice actors who play main characters in Gintama! How much more fun can a series get when it comes to it's characters? (Shinpachi, Hijikata, Sarutobi, Katsura and Kagura, from what I remember.) \\n\\n\r\nMy enjoyment is an easy 10. This show is a marvel. Never in so long have I seen a new series be so eccentric and unique. \\n\r\nIt's truly a gem, and I hope that other people can realize this as well. \\n\r\nI apologize if my review was lacking, since I'm more of a creative writer, not a critic. So my vocabulary and descriptions tend to be less varied when it comes to writing reviews... \\n\r\nEither way, please, give the show a chance! You won't regret it!\\n\\n\r\n(OH, I MUSTN'T FORGET. THIS SERIES LITERALLY HAS ONE OF THE BEST ENDING SONGS/VIDEOS OF ALL TIME. GO LOOK UP IT'S ED, I PROMISE YOU WILL LOVE IT. THE OPENING IS FANTASTIC TOO.)",

            "content": "For those who have long awaited for a reboot for Trigun... you are going to have to wait a little longer. Until then you can watch Yasuhiro Nightow's other manga get adapted in what I am sure is going to be the best anime of the season that feels like the spiritual successor of Trigun. Kekkai sensen aka Blood Blockade Battlefront.\r\nstory and character 8/10: the story itself is not very complex. it can be simply put as an organization of super-powered people fighting against disorder in New York which has now turned into supernatural zone between the underworld and the real world that has beenrenamed Jerusalums Lot. What makes the story so good however is the execution. the way it goes about episode by episode is definitely not textbook \"Monster of the week\" type predictable battles where they have to simply find some weakness that was only apparent to the main character. There really is a lot of variety to this show as there are many important antagonists that shaped the way that Jeruselums lot functions. Its story telling style is a lot like Baccano or Durarara where there isn't really a main character and more of a main cast of characters to tell the story it presents. The characters in the story at the moment have not fully developed at the moment of writing so ill hold off on that till the end of the show. the character designs are unique and well done as are the plethora of background \"beyondians\". The show uses naming conventions that are similar to Trigun that seem so stupid for characters that they somehow end up being cool and memorable like Zap Renfro or steven starphase. Overall the entire cast is solid.\\n\\n\r\nArt and sound : 10/10: The artwork and animation in this show is too impressive to put to words. studio Bones went all out to really capture the setting of new york overrun by supernatural beings with such great detail while also giving all of their effort the extremely well animated and over the top action scenes. this is partly due to the director of Kyousou Giga, Rie Matsumoto using extremely interesting and stylistic camera angle choices and overlays to better convey a scene or simply keeping things interesting even when its simply characters doing some exposition. On the topic of sound I am currently waiting for the whole soundtrack to be released as I haven't heard a ost this good that incorporates jazz music since Kids on the slope. The musical composer Taisei Iwasaki is just starting out with making music for kekkai sensen so he is one to keep an eye out for in the future, the Implementation of the music in the anime is also well done as there are never times when the music feels out of place. there are no complaints on the voice acting however there is a small issue at hand with this series when it comes to audio. This show almost demands an english dub simply because of the setting they are in and that during certain moments of exposition it is almost impossible to keep track of everything all at once in an episode in one go requiring multiple re-watches to get all of it and naturally hearing it in a dubbed version would alleviate this problem.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9/10: This show has the artistic flair and character writing to shine and each element of the show embodies the theme of what made New York City an ideal melting pot of cultures and ideas from a diverse cast of characters to many different genres of music (with jazz being the most used) to the diverse population of monsters and super-humans and diverse stories they tell. this show is a definite must-watch this season\\n",

            "content": "Sometimes, I don't get anime fans. If you've paid attention to the sales charts, you'll see that Blood Blockade Battlefront's current sales numbers are going toe-to-toe with Shirobako aka the most acclaimed and important anime series in recent times, and that just baffles me. I mean Kyoani\u2019s own beautiful anime with believable character motivations, depth to its story, and (most importantly of all) actual challenges the characters have to overcome came out in the same season around the same time, and yet it just sold decently - which is below the studio\u2019s usual standards. Okay fine, maybe this anime has a swanky soundtrack. Maybe it'sbeing directed by one of the most dynamic TV directors in the current market. Maybe it has a character named Zapp Renfro. Maybe it had one of the most unique and eye-catching premises to come from the market in years. But BBB on the whole is just not the least bit good, and I don't understand why anyone is trying to convince me otherwise.\\n\\n\r\nThe series is based on a manga written by Yasuhiro Nightow, who you may know as the writer of Trigun - a series that's kinda sexist when you think about it. Okay, it\u2019s not on the level of Bakuman or even Rurouni Kenshin, but Vash is still a really f*cking stupid main character. But you know, as much as he grinds my gears whilst shouting his \u201cLove & Peace\u201d bullshit, at least Vash had a personal story and some important flaws, mishandled as they were, in regards to some interesting discussions about how to deal with criminals. So I was kinda expecting some similar moral quandaries in this new thing under the guise of a stylish futuristic noir setting.\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately, Nightow decided for his new work that BBB would be a generic slice-of-life story combined with Baccano\u2019s tone, and you know what that means? Let\u2019s do absolutely fuck all whilst trying to cover up that fact with lots of energy! Honestly, I\u2019m still racking my brains regarding who contributed more to BBB\u2019s problems. But make no mistake: neither the production team nor the original writer helped in making this show good. The phrase \u201cnothing interesting happens\u201d is overused in general, let alone by me, but I can\u2019t think of a better summary of the show\u2019s problems aside from it being the equivalent of eating nothing but a giant bag of M&Ms for lunch. Sounds appealing at first until you become sick not even ten minutes, and you\u2019ve still got five-sixths of the bag to go through.\\n\\n\r\nThe main character is pretty bland as well. Leonardo Watch - and you can tell that someone involved with Gungrave worked on these names because they\u2019re just as silly here as they were there - is a young boy with magical eye powers who comes to the Star Wars version of Chicago and ends up getting involved in a series of ka-razy events that leads to him getting recruited into an organization called Libra, a group of individuals much older than him that keep peace in the city through poorly stylized fight scenes against villains that are never developed beyond the concept and we\u2019ll never see again afterwards. Whilst dealing with these episodic events involving their exploits, Leo routinely converses with an anime-original girl and boy at the beginning and end of each episode, cock-teasing a larger story involving them with his connection being incredibly arbitrary.\\n\\n\r\nIn fact, Leonardo\u2019s entire existence is arbitrary. Most of his screentime is just him being strung along by other people and most of the time, he doesn\u2019t take a proactive role or solve anything on his own other than spotting the occasional enemy weakness - which makes him about as useful as Slippy Toad, so I have to wonder why he\u2019s even the main character. Which come to think of it, didn\u2019t he come to Hellsalem in order to help his sister? Actually, even I don\u2019t even remember what was up with that mcguffin anymore. Something about her being sick because of some magic bullshit? Maybe if more than five minutes (in the first episode no less) were dedicated to that plot point, I\u2019d care enough to look it up.\\n\\n\r\nBBB Writer #1: Hey, wasn\u2019t there some plot thread regarding Leo\u2019s personal life that we should at least address, BBB Writer #2?\\n\\n\r\nBBB Writer #2: Can\u2019t seem to recall that, BBB Writer #1. Now let\u2019s have the characters fight a Ninja Samurai Vampire, because that\u2019s cool right?\\n\\n\r\nEvery single scenario is ridiculously unimaginative and plays like some Hideo Kojima wannabe\u2019s fanfiction come to life rather than pieces of a larger whole. And with each episode I watched, I just kept asking myself what the point of all this nonsense was. There\u2019s one episode where Leo befriends a friendly mushroom-like fellow that\u2019s experiencing racism because that\u2019s just how it works in the city. And when Leo tries to help him, he ends up getting kidnapped (again) and forgetting said friend once the mushroom defends himself with some sort of pollen after getting beaten severely with a baseball bat on-screen. As much as I understand that racism is a subject that\u2019s still relevant after all this time, this incident is never brought up again and doesn\u2019t add to Leo\u2019s character so I\u2019m not really sure why you made me sit through that.\\n\\n\r\nAnd really, that\u2019s one of the more focused episodes of the series. A large percentage of them are incredibly gimmicky fluff that accomplishes nothing more than saying something exists before pretending it doesn\u2019t the very next week. Where are the episodic stories where the characters\u2019 way of life is questioned or where some cliche yet relevant personal philosophy is imparted upon us or where something game-changing happens in the future besides introducing another throwaway character? Now I know the anime makes it clear at the start that Hellsalem is a place where anything can happen and that you could argue that\u2019s the message of the anime, but I respond to that answer with \u201cno fucking duh\u201d. That sort of philosophy is functional as setup, but for the basis of an entire series, it\u2019s simplistically dull because anything can happen in real life too (as Donald Trump\u2019s campaign should show you, let alone the real New York). What exactly is this \u201canything can happen in Crazy Town\u201d philosophy in aid of, Blood Blockade Battlefront?\\n\\n\r\nBecause it sure isn\u2019t about anything resembling a coherent whole, I\u2019ll tell you that. Literally the only connecting thread are these twins that only meet with Leo at the beginning and end of each episode and pretty much disappear altogether until their story appears in that long-delayed finale where said delay either killed your interest or made you want to rewatch the show prior to its arrival because it\u2019s been a season since you last watched the anime and your memory is that atrocious. But why you\u2019d need to do that is a question that you\u2019re going to have to answer to me in a really understandable way, because the hints to this finale were both barely there and don\u2019t even involve Leo or the rest of the cast all that much, if at all. And the same is true for the finale itself, which without spoiling anything, is so anticlimactic and non-consequential to anything in the show, let alone the characters, that it makes you question the entire arc's importance for all the good it did.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of the characters, I might have tolerated the lackluster story and Leo's non-existent importance if they had been the least bit interesting. But if you\u2019re one of those people who think it\u2019s not utterly dumb for every character to be a badass, then you can just disregard this review right now, because I honestly don\u2019t see the appeal in a cast that doesn\u2019t have any sort of pathos whatsoever. I don\u2019t have a problem starting your story with fully developed characters since origin stories are overrated anyways, but there\u2019s a difference between someone who got the way they are through hard struggles in their life and someone who\u2019s the product of Mary Sue fanfiction. Especially when their attempts to be funny consist of jokes that have as much punch as a one-year old who hasn\u2019t eaten in days and is chained to the ground.\\n\\n\r\nAnd worst of all, they don\u2019t do anymore than Leo. There\u2019s this woman in a suit named Chain Sumeragi who is supposed to be a werewolf, but she never transforms or even fights or does really much of anything aside from jumping around and making snide remarks to Zapp - who I only remember for his name and little else. Which is something I guess, since I didn\u2019t bother to retain anyone else\u2019s names in this series apart from Klaus. Maybe if you actually made them do anything important or memorable or anything not boring, I\u2019d have a reason to do so.\\n\\n\r\nBut no, they do jack throughout the entire show. Even in the finale, they do jack, mostly existing to serve as Leo's cheerleaders and little else. And just like most fictional cheerleaders, it's incredibly hard to distinguish between them if you ignore the obvious fact that they have different designs, sexes, and voices. Literally anything said by one character could easily be said by another character without coming across as unnatural, and that's not a good thing in my book unless you just don't care about character variety. And if you don't, sorry to say this, but you have real low standards man.\\n\\n\r\nBlood Blockade Battlefront does not live up to any of the hype surrounding its pre or post-release, but I\u2019ll be fair and admit that not even Cowboy Bebop would have been able to live up to the amount of jizz that covered it before its airing alone. All of the show\u2019s good traits from Matsumoto\u2019s dynamic direction to the ending credits are outnumbered by shit ones, namely the fact that there\u2019s so much about these characters and this setting that\u2019s ripe for good storytelling, and yet it\u2019s wasted on predictable humor, shallow characterization, and pointless world-building that will become as relevant as school shootings in a decade (seriously, how the fuck can there be so many in this year alone?). Also, dear god does the action suck a big fat one. It's completely one-sided and keeps favoring stylization over interesting choreography, the finale in particular avoiding to scratch that \"action-loving\" itch of mine when it had the team take down a bunch of faceless mooks that stood perfectly still and took it from the top in-between all the horrendously boring and overly long philosophical dialogue.\\n\\n\r\nAnd it didn't even last half a minute. That's like dating a cute girl for five years without having sex and when you finally decide to do it on your honeymoon night...well let's just say that unlike this show, you have more to look forward to in the future, including getting better. But it's best not to tell your kids about the time you cried during what you claim to be the greatest period of your life.",

            "content": "While most of the reviews here have praised Kekkai Sensen, I have to say that this kind of anime requires some sort of acquired taste.\r\nIf you watched Durarara and Baccano, and (perhaps rather oddly) like me, dislike both of them for making little sense, explaining a bit of everything everywhere, and having essentially no plot, you may NOT enjoy this series. \r\nLike the 2 aforementioned animes, Kekkai Sensen features plenty of nameless characters that are absurd, scenes that you may not understand (e.g. in fights, who's doing what, and sometimes even who's who), and non-linear storylines. I won't provide an example to avoid spoiling, butlet's just say some guy who has insane fighting skills also has insane superpowers is incidentally the human race's best chess player (better than pro players) just when it's needed.\\n\\n\r\nOk enough about the characters and the plot, if there's one thing I DO enjoy about Kekkai Sensen it would be the sound. I like the opening and ending tracks, as well as the ambient music, and how it changes the atmosphere of the scenes as it goes along. This is probably the only thing that kept me watching.\\n\\n\r\nTo close, I have to say that there are plenty of people who enjoy animes like this, but if you, like me, do not enjoy multiple non-linear storylines coupled with barrages of nonsense and nameless random characters, probably you might want to look somewhere else. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 9, Art: 7, Story,Character,Enjoyment: 6.

Keep delivering pizza.\r\nKekkai Sensen is packed with such enjoyable concepts, environments and characters. Kekkai Sensen is that friend who goes out of their way to give you shits and giggles because they're such a nice person. This beautifully conceptualised post-alien invasion world gives its best kicks from Leo being so mundane that he normalises absolute chaosand death around his being every single time he's in the portrait. It's beautifully done and you'll be watching this entire anime with a smile.\\n\\n\r\nThe captions introducing the characters feels so natural. The voice acting - both the protagonists and the villains, give so much personality insight and perspective to the voiced character. This one will be so enjoyable if dubbed properly. The camera angles are varied constantly, and are so well done it sets the standard for future anime - there may now exist an anime you can rewatch and enjoy purely for cinematography. \\n\\n\r\nEvery scene is drawn from a new camera perspective and doesn't skimp on visual accuracy. The way scenes are laid out to the audience makes them learn so much about characters and plots without the characters needing to doggedly explain concepts. This creative ability means that the pacing is just on-point. \\n\\n\r\nThis is the first time I've seen an anime so good, and so confident in how good it is, that before the ending, it will wrap up all loose ends, give you a happy ending, and will still be confident you're hungry for the next episode.\\n\\n",

Something happens in the middle of the episode which resolves the aforementioned issue (most often with very little input from Leonardo) then somehow it's tied altogether at the very last few minutes of the episode and callsitself a story.\\n\\n\r\nAnd the biggest problem with this is that from episode to episode, there seems to be very little relevance linking it to the previous episode other than basically a character introduction, who, most of the time, don't seem to get any more air time or even noted at all.\\n\\n\r\nThe most important part of each episode, the last few minutes, tends to reveal that 'something' large is happening, yet since every episode is just a one-off incident, you're left wondering if this 'something' actually exists at all.\\n\\n\r\nThen there's the blood style fighting of the series which has very little explanation to it other than that it seems to be more like the 'magic system' of the universe. There's also the obnoxious calling out of the attack names that seems to be just added in because the author thought it would sound really cool and attract any six year old that so happens to be watching. And this series seems to be aiming towards them with its overall idea of its 'episodic character and conflict introduction to resolution'.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt - 8\\n\r\nThere nothing really wrong with the art. It's pretty standard but suits the style of the series.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound - 8\\n\r\nThe variety of voices really help with the identification of characters and help prevents character overlap. The BGM fits well with the mafia styled theme and tends to be quite notable. I didn't really like the OP or ED, though the ED's style really fit with the overall theme.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 3\\n\r\nAnd this is another series that relies on its overly non-existent and weak protagonist in order to have an excuse for everything to happen.\\n\\n\r\nLeonardo - So basically he's more or less, like a lamppost. His input is negligible most of the time as the show relies more or less relies on other characters to mess with him which then prompts other characters to come and save him. And since he never actually does much, I'm not even sure what kind of person he is besides the generic male beta.\\n\\n\r\nThe Libra members - It seems that on episode one they're introduced as an underground organisation for maintaining balance and order and is counter to some 'evil' organisation that's also introduced on episode one. But that story quickly devolves into episodic resolutions which now entirely rely on Leonardo's mishaps. There's Zapp who just seems to be a comic relief more than anything, Klaus who's portrayed as the big boss and tries to be conveyed as someone strong and reliable but ends up being more of a 'get out of jail free' card. Then there's chain who serves very little purpose other than seemingly to just exist to shut feminists up about a lack of diversity.\\n\\n\r\nOthers - White and Black and recurring characters that seem to be placed there for any convenient story advancements. White is a girl that Leonardo so happens to meet and so happens to also be the sister of Black who is somehow related to the 'evil' organisation. White doesn't seem to do much besides being a possible love interest of Leonardo and giving expositions on White and Black's past which, at the moment, is largely unhelpful to the already murky story of the series. There are also the introduced 'character's of the week' but since they only play their role for that week their standing feels only one level higher than that of background characters.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 5\\n\r\nThe biggest let down of this series was its inability to tell a proper story. Some of the episodes had no relevance to the overall story and felt more like a filler than anything (I'm looking at you Chess episode and Mushroom episode) and having 2 filler episodes out of 7 (that I watched) is just insane. Watching this series didn't keep me on the edge, in fact it made me want them to fast forward and to just get to the point instead of watching every episode's repetitive beginning, predictable conflict resolution and very lazy ending of trying to tie all the event's into some 'greater' story.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 4\\n\r\nThe show suffers from two drastic flaws. The first is its poor story telling and the second is its continuous influx of characters and information in an already ambiguous story. It was like we started off on a good foot then tripped and fell into a dark valley and have kept falling since. The 'evil' organisation's introduction seemed to imply that we'd see a continuous conflict between Libra and them, yet after the first episode they seemed to have decided to take a vacation or something.\\n\\n\r\nSo far nothing much has happened in this series besides character introductions. Whatever 'greater' story that the author has in mind will probably end up as a deus ex machina.",

            "content": "Kekkai Sensen is an ongoing manga from Nightow Yasuhiro, you may know him as the creator of Trigun. The manga started in 2009, but it didn't receive an anime adaptation until this year. The anime was handled by Bones, a Studio that has a pretty strong track record as far as their works I've reviewed go. Will this be up to their usual standards? Let's delve into it. \r\nStory: \r\nOur story opens in Hellsalem's Lot, formerly New York formerly New Amsterdam. The old New York city was destroyed by a portal opening to another world and this one didn't even have the good grace tohave a giant squid monster. In this city, humans co-exist with all manner of strange otherworldly beings. In this city, there's a shadowy organisation called Libra dedicated to keeping the piece. Our protagonist, Leonardo Watch, encounters Libra through an odd coincidence and is given a position due to his mysterious \u201cAll-seeing eyes\u201dWhich are so strong that he doesn't even have to open his eyelids to see, apparently. The series follows several of Libra's escapades as they encounter various threats.\\n\\n\r\nThe biggest flaw of the series is the end. It's a disjointed mess with inadequate build up behind it, poorly attempting to tie up all of the ongoing plot points. The series also suffers a bit from tone problems. Most of the time it goes for a more over the top and fun type of aesthetic, but it also tries to have some real emotional moments. The emotional moments don't work well and come across as out of place because they're so heavily divorced from the tone of most of the series. They're simply too few in number with too vast of stretches betwixt them. There's also the narrative device of Leo writing a letter to his sister. Ultimately, it contributes nothing and exactly what parts of the series are included is unclear. It can't be the whole thing since there are a lot of scenes that he isn't in and where he just has no way of knowing what happened. The episodes also vary pretty widely. Some of them are fairly entertaining while others are just kind of dumb. \\n\\n\r\nOn the positive side, there are some intriguing ideas behind the series. If they had been better fleshed out, this could have been really good. The world building is pretty decent and I do like that  the series tries to show some of the alien perspectives at times. Also, let me reiterate, there are some pretty good episodes thrown in.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\\n\r\nThe characters really vary. There are some that are kind of interesting and have some depth to them, Klaus, Black, and White being the most obvious. However, most of the characters are pretty trite. Chain, Gilbert, K.K, Steven, Zed, Deldro, Dog, and a variety of other characters are just kind of there and only have a couple of very basic traits. Leo himself is kind of a boring generically nice but out of his league type of character. \\n\\n\r\nArt: \\n\\n\r\nThe art is pretty good. The character designs are nicely varied and distinctive. The action sequences are pretty strong, although they suffer a bit from overblown attacks that have to be awkwardly labelled on-screen, and there are some really nice details both in terms of the various creatures and in terms of the backgrounds. \\n\\n\r\nSound: \\n\\n\r\nThe acting is all right. It can be really over the top but, for the most part, it's perfectly serviceable. The best performance definitely comes from Koyama Rikiya. Probably because his character is more subdued and doesn't really go into the exaggerated craziness mode that, say, Nakai Kazuya's character exhibits so frequently. The music is fine. \\n\\n\r\nHo-yay: \\n\\n\r\nThere's really not any in this series. \\n\\n\r\nFinal Thoughts: \\n\\n\r\nThere was some real potential for this series. It has some good ideas and a world with a lot of potential, unfortunately, it falls pretty short with writing and characters that are quite mediocre. My final rating is going to be a 5/10. If you're looking for an exaggerated action-oriented series, Kekkai Sensen will likely be satisfactory. But if you're looking for something with more depth to it, it's probably not going to do much for you. Next week I'll take a look at Mahou Shoujo Lyrical Nanoha Vivid.",

            "content": "Ahh, Kekkai Sensen. Where to start with this one. It's such a brilliantly done show that's currently being overlooked by so many...\r\nStory- 9\r\nStarting with the story, I really want to give it a 10, but I can't. It's based around a version of New York where a portal to an alternate world opens, letting in weird sentient creatures. The show is very unspecific about the rules of who and what can leave and enter the fog covered area, as well as what exactly these creatures are. So far it's very enjoyable and seems to be building up to something great, but as I haven't readthe manga, I don't know what this build up is for. I'm expecting it to be good, but as I can't be sure, I have to give it a 9. As one popular reviewer said something to the extent of, \"I don't know where I'm going, but so far I'm enjoying the ride.\" I think that accurately sums up my feelings about it.\\n\\n\r\nArt- 10\\n\r\nAs expected of Bones, the art and animation are beautiful at every turn. Battles are a pleasure to watch, and characters have just the right expressions in the shows many comedic scenes. I don't know how they could have done better.\\n\\n\r\nSound- 10\\n\r\nNot much to say here. The sound track is very good, and I've listened to both the opening and the ending countless times. Both the opening and the ending fit the show very well, with the opening highlighting the serious side of the show, and the ending showing the fun side along with some hints as to future characters and some small ominous undertones.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter- 10\\n\r\nKekkai Sensen has many very likable characters. The two that have the most development so far are Leonardo and Zapp, so I'll focus on them. I quite like the main character, Leonardo Watch. He's a member of an organization called Libra, who specializes in fighting monsters and criminals. Most of the members of Libra use their blood as a weapon in a Deadman Wonderland style, but Leonardo has special eyes that were given to him shortly before the events of the series. These \"All Seeing Eyes of God\" allow him to see through illusions, project images to others, take control of other people's site, and more. Unlike most shonen main characters, he's neither overly weak or overly powerful. He uses his mind to think of new ways to apply his ability and fights in this way, instead of using overwhelming force like Zapp or Klaus. As for his personality, unlike most shonen main characters that are either to nice or try to be to cool, Leonardo has a more normal personality. He's nice and worries about saving others, but he can also be cool and funny, having realistic reactions to many things. One of the things that he reacts very realistically to is Zapp, another member of Libra. Zapp is one of my personal favorites, being used as comic relief half the time and an absolute badass the other half. He has a love-hate relationship with Leonardo, who he'll be murdering for pizza one second and saving the next. He's an interesting character, but the only thing that confuses me about him is why he tries to kill Klaus, the leader of Libra. We learn in episode 2 that most of the time when Zapp sees Klaus he'll try to kill him, or even that he'll attempt to put him in life-threatening situations. I only see this as use for comic relief, so it'd be nice if they expanded upon and explained this point.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment- 10\\n\r\nAs you can tell from the rest of my review, I love this show and it grew from an 8 up to a 10 over the 7 episodes that have been released. With likable characters, an interesting world, and something new happening every second to keep things interesting, it's a very fun show.\\n\\n\r\nOverall- 10\\n\r\nThis show is a 10, with everything being so incredibly well done that I find it hard to give it any other score. The show reminds me of a lot of my favorites. It reminds me of Deadman Wonderland for the previously mentioned blood weapons, Kill la Kill for its mix of action and over the top comedy (minus the fan service), and even Blue Exorcist and Hunter x Hunter for some reason I can't quite place. I'd recommend this show to anyone, and I hope it gets a bigger fan base and a second season.",

            "content": "Kekkai Sensen is one of those anime that by all means deserves to be called AOTY. However, there are a few things keeping it from being such. I'll start with the ratings of the anime that aren't 10/10's so as to let viewers know why I've rated this anime as such. Slight spoilers ensue, but nothing that really tells what happens or anything like that.\r\nArt: It's great, it's just that the animation itself is slightly lacking compared to other anime this season, as well as not meeting the demands for such a powerful story. But I digress, it's great and shows what's happening without fail,just wish it was a little better.\\n\\n\r\nPlot: Too much crammed into too little. 12 (13 if you count the recap episode) episodes is not enough for the story they're trying to tell. Nonetheless, it has still managed to be a riveting ride, and the story has managed to invoke great amounts of sympathy and whatnot. It's simply amazing how the story is told in such a whimsical manner, yet still manages to connect what seem to be meaningless moments into a bigger picture that is self-explanatory as soon as you see it.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Again, too much, too little time. There's a bunch of cast members that're introduced once, are shown to be extremely colorful and interesting with backstories that could probably get their own 12-episode spinoff (the only time where 12 episodes would be fine, as opposed to here), and almost never seen again. The main cast also suffers from this, as the spotlight seems to fall mostly on Leo and Zapp, with Klaus simply being the answer to any and all problems. The rest of the Libra department seems to stay true to their mission, which is working in the shadows, as we rarely see them do anything in the anime aside from showing up when necessary. The antagonists don't fare any better, with Black getting the most screen-time out of all of them (granted, he's the main antagonist as the story gradually shifts to make him out as such) and others such as Femt and Aligura getting most of theirs when they cause their own mischief. Characters are introduced at the show's convenience and while that isn't bad in any way, it doesn't help to know that the show will never speak of them again once the episode is over. Ultimately, this is a problem shared by many anime, one such big example being Angel Beats where a good amount of the main cast didn't get their backstories told.\\n\\n\r\nOne thing that is immediately brought to attention is how... whimsical the story is. Nothing is deeper than the surface when it comes to the why's and how's, everything simply is because it is. It's not for the sake of plot convenience, either -- it feels more like everything falls into place, and that everything will happen just because. You realize this as you see how Leo came to attain his God's Eyes, where a deity of some sort simply manifests before his family and forces them to decide who will be blinded and who will receive the eyes. You see it again as the wanton destruction of the city and the clearly massive amounts of casualties that follow are met with neither despair nor joy, but pure apathy. Sure, the people involved in the chaos are screaming for their lives, but the rest of the city, and the survivors as well, could seem to care less after all is said and done. While this is somewhat brought up in the anime as 'day-to-day occurrences' and are seen as a way to spice up the daily lives of the people, it still goes to show that destruction and death are 2 major daily occurrences in the former Big Apple, and are no longer worth paying attention to.\\n\\n\r\nFinally, I'd like to say that the world introduced to us in this anime is filled with so many inferred and unstated rules that I can't help but have question after question pop into my head as I suddenly realize things. Clearly, their world is different from ours, since they make it clear that there's been magic  and superpowers since long before the Great Collapse. There might have already been superhumans and human-like creatures such as werewolves before the Great Collapse. So, how does their history before the Great Collapse differ from ours? How has the rest of the world dealt with the loss of New York City, and how has it developed differently? How does Hellsalem's Lot, for lack of a better way to put it, work? How is it divided, how does it connect to the alternate plane of reality where the demons and such came from, etc., and while some questions are answered as the anime goes on (none of these are answered, which is why I've used them as examples), it's still one of those situations where getting an answer leaves you with even more questions.\\n\\n\r\nBut after all is said and done, what we have here is an anime adaptation of a very well-written manga, with a world of adventures packed into former New York City, and where it leads to is as good as anybody's guess. My overall score is only such due to the main problem being a lack of episodes, which in all honesty stems mostly from just wanting more and more of this anime, and the rest from what's written above. If you're a fan of zany and whimsical characters, mischievous humor, fantasy, drama, and/or episodic stories, this is an anime for you. And if you're not, it's still probably something worth checking out.\\n\\n\r\nAs an aside, I've never once seen a recap episode so beautifully done. While by nature it adds nothing to the story told so far, it still manages to be entertaining and, well, add to the story told so far. It was executed wonderfully, and I, who has refused to watch recap episodes due to thinking of them as a waste of time, was left feeling as if I'd watched a regular episode of the anime.",

            "content": "\"Every day is a knockabout of random craziness\" - Leo\r\nWell, if that's not lampshading this show, I don't know what is. \r\nPreface: \r\nKekkai Sensen was an early hit in Spring 2015, but is currently embroiled in some kind of licensing and broadcast dispute which is keeping the final episode from being aired, so as yet remains unfinished. Not like it'll change the course of the show though, because it developed a plot first starting on episode 10.\r\nArtwork and Animation: 6\r\nAnother Bones production, the art is decent, but nothing particularly outstanding. What is rather interesting is the choice of setting, and the visuals that come withit. Rather than being set in Tokyo with 90% of other anime, or a fantasy land, Kekkai Sensen is set in a during-apocalypse New York City. The character designs are fairly unique, with some unusual aliens and powers/effects, but ultimately pretty forgettable. Backgrounds are probably the most visually stunning aspect though- as the New York skyline looks very nice.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound and Voice Acting: 6\\n\\n\r\nOverall pretty meh. Nobody really stands out, but for the voice actor fiends out there, Mamoru Miyano does make an appearance as a one off villain of the week. Everyone likes to rave over the ending theme, \"Sugar Song to Bitter Step\" by Unison Square Garden, and I do have to admit it's quite catchy, but a catchy ending song an OST does not make, and the rest falls pretty flat. \\n\\n\\n\r\nThe Good:\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 8 \\n\\n\r\nKekkai Sensen does have a fun cast. Made up of a ragtag, zany bunch- it does lend itself to the oddball/motley crew comedy that the show tries so to sell. Mr Zapp is the source of many a laugh, butt monkey that he is. The majority of the main characters set themselves apart from each other- Chain is the straight man, Klaus the mischievous, and KK the angry psycho chick. Leonardo brings up the rear as the aloof goober character. \\n\r\nIn all honesty, the villains provide a lot more charisma and presence to the show, when they're even involved. \\n\\n\\n\r\nThe Ugly:\\n\\n\r\nStory: 3\\n\\n\r\nLet's face the facts. Kekkai Sensen might be fun, but there is negative plot here. It mostly takes the form of a Villain-of-the-Week\u2122 episodic plot, but here and there (meaning only twice) were there arcs of any sort. The one with Zapp was by and large the strongest point of the show, and landed right smack in the middle. I thought at this point the show was going to pick up with something interesting, but immediately launched back into VotW the next episode with something even more inane than before- a total filler episode about getting food. (Is this Code Geass Pizza Episode 3.0??) \\n\r\nThe promise of a bigger narrative is wasted potential and the series spins its wheels. It starts off well enough, protag is on a quest to help out their loved one, but this is sidelined almost inside of the first five minutes of the show. \\n\\n\r\nThe plot was really one step forward, two miles to the side, then one step back. Like that line dance everyone had to do in kindergarten through 5th grade when you were next to a partner you didn't like.\\n\\n\r\nThe wacky and strange situations that the characters find themselves in soon get pretty tiring after you realize that the villain of the week isn't going to last beyond the next 23 minutes, however. Leonardo getting captured every week and the Libra members saving his butt so he can return to his mundane existence eating burgers also gets really old. KS relies a lot on the same gags, Zapp being a butt monkey and getting the crap kicked out of him by KK/Chain/Sensei, Leo getting caught, and Klaus tearing stuff up without meaning it. Ooopsie. \\n\\n\r\nTowards the end, KS did start developing a plot with recurring characters, though. It showed some promise- it's just unfortunate they couldn't get to the point earlier (or the producers and broadcasters getting their crap together to air the last episode).\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment and Overall: 6\\n\\n\r\nKekkai Sensen was decently entertaining, but at the end of the day, it was rather unfulfilling. I'm not really a glass half empty kind of person, but KS has a hole in the bottom of the Tea jug, and most of the plot just leaked out on the floor. Call it a bad adaptation, call it creative license- the fact remains that this feels a bit incomplete, especially ironic given that the last episode is out there in limbo somewhere.\\n\\n\\n\r\nRecommend?\\n\\n\r\nIf villain of the week oddball comedy is your thing, give it a shot.",

            "content": "This looked like a really interesting anime from the cover, and from the first few episodes, I thought it was too. BUT, it was too jumbled. It had a good thing going, the only problem was how hard it was to follow. \r\nStory:\r\nI gave it a low score in this section because of how scrambled and hard to follow it was. I had a hard time understanding the powers in this show. From the blood thingys to the main character's eyes, it was all too difficult to follow. Although it didn't really have much of a plot and it might be unfair to grade iton this aspect if the anime can't even properly lay out the world's mechanics-whether it's filler based or not- then you can't really give the story aspect a good grade. Thus, if the story/world isn't good, the anime is most likely not that enjoyable. \\n\\n\r\nArt & Sound:\\n\r\nI actually liked the ending song, was pretty nice, but I'm no good at these ratings.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nThe characters were quite enjoyable. Although it was hard to follow the story and world mechanics, the relationships between these characters were pretty easy and clear. The characters were nicely made and their attributes really helped with the comedy aspect of this story. The characters were the only thing bumping the overall and enjoyment score from a 3 to a 4.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment and Overall:\\n\r\nLike mentioned before, the characters were really enjoyable. Watching the characters' reactions to the situation and each other was quite fun, but the story wasn't very entertaining. The world and how it worked was hard to understand, which took away a lot from the enjoyment factor.\\n\\n\r\nWould I recommend this anime? I really don't know. It has some good points, and the style isn't to my liking but it could be yours. If you like, say, Cowboy Bebop or Gintama, you actually might find this show more enjoyable to me, whereas I wasn't much of a fan of either and dropped both series. To add on, I didn't watch Kekkai Sensen & Beyond, so from all I know that season could be really great, but then again I don't know. So I might have to end up changing this section, but for now, Kekkai Sensen is something I might recommend depending on the person, although in most cases I would probably not recommend.\\n\\n\r\nIn Short:\\n\r\nIf you like filler anime this might be something you can consider, if you're willing to ignore the confusing details on how this odd world works. If on the other hand, you enjoy plot filled animes and care a lot about their structures, don't even think about watching this.",

            "content": "I\u2019ve never been to New York before. I heard the place has kinds of people and all sorts of opportunities. Having seen the state a bunch of times on television and in the newspapers, I\u2019ve always been wondering what really goes on over there. Then, there comes this series called Kekkai Sensen (Blood Blockade Battlefront) where we see New York in an alternate form. The catch? It\u2019s now a place for both New Yorkers and supernatural beings. Sources from the series states that a portal known as \u2018The Beyond\u2019 caused it and that there\u2019s a dimensional fog barrier preventing monsters from crawling out to otherplaces. Having just read the premise should making this series sound thought provoking. And if that wasn\u2019t enough, did I mention there\u2019s also something that threatens this interdimensional plane? \\n\\n\r\nFrom the creator of Trigun, Yasuhiro Nightow brings this new exciting series with a lot of clever gimmicks. Not only do we have this interdimensional called Hellsalem's Lot (formerly known as New York City) but there\u2019s also a lot going on behind a group of people known as the \u201cLibras\u201d. To me, this series is like a dark urban tale where each episode has its tale to tell. Kekkai Sensen is by no means just a shounen action show crafted to save the world. This is more like an urban fantasy where stories are made and legends are born.\\n\\n\r\nTo start off, the show follows more of an episodic nature. While events in the series along with its characters does form connections, each episode in itself has a tale to tell. Essentially, the first episode establishes the foundation of the series where we meet the majority of the main cast and experience what Hellsalem\u2019s Lot is about. I think there should be an emphasis put on the \u2018hell\u2019 part as the first episode is hellish all around with lots happening with overwhelming amount of bizarreness. Perhaps one of the normal people we meet at first would be Leonardo Watch. Seeming portrayed as a normal young man, he has a rare power known as the \u201cAll Seeing Eyes\u201d. These eyes grants him special abilities although at a cost of his sister\u2019s eyesight. As the main male protagonist of the series though, he also become involved with Libra, a group that deals with the many supernatural occurrences in Hellsalem\u2019s Lot. In a way, they aren\u2019t just a police unit but more of an elite group of powerful people with their own unique abilities. For instance, there\u2019s Klaus V Reinhertz, the leader of the group with his ability to fight with a large shaped cross as his weapon of choice. Zapp Renfro, a hotblooded member of the group is known to utilize his blood fighting style. Then, there\u2019s Chain Sumeragi with her ability of invisibility, Steven A. Starphase with the ability to freeze others through ferocious kicks, K.K and her elite skills to handle firearms, among others. The point is that this group of characters all stand both individually and collectively.\\n\\n\r\nAnd this is where the series shine the most. It\u2019s the characters. Kekkai Sensen is a rare breed of a show where I hardly find any character that I dislike. In fact, almost every character has a personality that can easily be adaptable with the contents of this show. Leonardo\u2019s initial role in the story also has him portray more as the paper boy with his errands. However, he does play valuable part in the story especially with his unnatural eyes. Each episode involves him being involved in some sort of event that seems to degenerate into abnormality. I have to say that the show is very clever with some of these events ranging from chasing a super-fast monkey, being held hostage by some underworld thugs, or even sharing burger with a friendly alien. There\u2019s this sensation that the show constantly brings with his adventures as we learn more about Hellsalem\u2019s Lot. Similarly, other characters participates in unique events such as Klaus\u2019 challenge in the highly dangerous Prosfair, a game that can drive a normal human mad or even an underground boxing match against unholy monsters. While all this is happening though, there are bits of foreshadowing with certain characters that tells of something going behind the scenes. Nonetheless, Kekkai Sensen\u2019s performance with each episode shows how clever it can be with its gimmicks and style that feels similar to Baccano, atmospheric like Cowboy Bebop, and unique on its own.\\n\\n\r\nThe comedy factors are also quite genuine as well so anyone looking for an ultra-deep or philosophical show is in the wrong place. Rather, take this series as more of a relaxing adventure. The comedy elements ranges with good amount of slice of life-like moments involving Zapp, Leo\u2019s misadventures when running errands, or in general anything that seems not so ordinary. And speaking of which, there\u2019s so many abnormal things happening in this show that mystery also plays certain roles. It makes the audience wonder about the foundation of Hellsalem\u2019s Lot with the history that it contains or where our characters (specifically Libra) came from in the first place. Leonardo\u2019s mysterious All Seeing Eyes is also a central element of the show that many find fascinating, fearful, and curiously endearing all at once. There\u2019s even some bits of subtle romance in the story as well. Do take note that this adaptation adds an anime original character named White so her role in the series adds something fun to think about. In particular, her relationship with Lenoardo seems to be something like an acquaintance/friendship/bonding type of connection. It\u2019s hard to describe exactly what it is but romance can easily be interpreted into their development as well. What\u2019s more is that she also has a brother who is even more mysterious than he seems. Now that adds a bit of something to think about. The show in fact often makes you think what may happen next and what you guess may or may not be correct. However, the thrill and excitement of each episode is definitely something to remember.\\n\\n\r\nThere are some pet peeves that can be found in this show at times though. The series is pretty fast paced and sometimes seems like there\u2019s too much happening at once or where you feel like you\u2019re in the middle of nowhere. Even with a breather episode here or there, the story can be hard to understand at times. Just note that certain events and characters do have connections that formulates the overlay of the story. Also, this series may or may not fit with everyone\u2019s style. The urban setting and characters sometimes can feel too gimmicky for its own good and certain likable side characters can be easily dismissed. There may also at times where the comedy feels like it\u2019s recycled a bit more than it should be. And finally, Leonardo may be one of the lesser characters that are worth remembering compared to its others despite being the main protagonist. He\u2019s not the dull type but there certainly are characters that really outshines his portrayal.\\n\\n\r\nDo I even have to say it? This is like a classic Bones series. Taking a look at the poster visual should quickly make people imply what studio will adapt a series with such artwork. Indeed, studio Bones takes charge of the show with its fantastic visuals to illustrate and deliver the style of Kekkai Sensen. The urban setting of Hellsalem should feel similar with anyone who experienced with Nightow\u2019s other works. Then, there\u2019s also the portrayal of the monsters, each crafted cleverly at its own degree. There\u2019s imagery too and metaphors that are well adapted. Most prominently, Leonardo\u2019s eyes stands out as an epitome of enigma. The way it\u2019s colored, decorated, and operates really has a feel of unorthodox. And that\u2019s just one more thing to think about regarding the artwork of the show. Character designs are skillfully made with each one that suits with their roles. The action is also pretty fluid with flashy movements and explosive camera features that will make you go awe. It has minimal fan service and really never ventures into that direction throughout the entire story. It doesn\u2019t need to anyways since Kekkai Sensen is clever on its own.  \\n\\n\r\nSmooth. Joyful. Nostalgic. These are just a few words that I can describe about Kekkai Sensen\u2019s music. The OST not only has a jazz and blue like-tune but also brings in a feel where you really can picture yourself there. The atmospheric insert songs often delivers its dynamics where it naturally sucks you in. Even the OP and ED theme songs are highly stylistic too. The OP song \u201cHello World\u201d by Bump of Chicken is a testament to the characteristics of the show. Meanwhile, we also have a very catchy ED theme that dances with the tunes. Finally, there\u2019s the character voice mannerisms. With such a colorful cast, it\u2019s hard to pick which one is the most memorable. A few to name are definitely Zapp\u2019s laidback voice, Klau\u2019s toughness, or White\u2019s curiosity. The concepts of the show often tries to drill whatever it needs to get the point across and character voices are no exception either.\\n\\n\r\nI can safely say that Kekkai Sensen is a ride to remember. Director Rie Matsumoto (known for directing Kyousogiga) skillfully adapts what it needs to deliver this unique and stylistic adaptation. There\u2019s probably more the show can do with its ideas but it has so far nailed all of what it intended to. Whether it\u2019s the dynamic cast of characters, colorful episodic adventures of Leonardo, or the mystery elements of the series itself, there\u2019s always something Kekkai Sensen can give to anyone. This is definitely a show to choose especially if you\u2019re in it for some crazy fun and experience a supernatural New Yorky vision.",

            "content": "It has been one great ride through Kekkai Sensen. This review is spoiler free because frankly saying, you won't get much out of reading synopsis or various spoiler reviews. You have to watch this anime to know it (much like any anime actually).\r\nThe context of this Anime is simple. However it is delivered in a more eccentric fashion that is somewhat hard to get into at first. Nevertheless, once you get on the ride, you won't want it to stop.\r\nStory: 7/10. The story is not out of the box from what I have experienced. Superhuman organization, evil plans, something that always pulls the protagonist intotrouble. It's all familiar. With that being said it kept pulling me in because the anime is giving me only bit by bit with each episodes, keeping me guessing. This is also the problem that is why it can't get a better score. It is not everybody's cup of tea to have to go through a series without knowing the full context of it from the first chapter.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9/10. The art is superb. Fighting scenes are smooth and satisfying. Background is detailed and the general style fit its story. Character designs are all highly detailed and good looking.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10/10. The sound is notably the BEST part of this series, and probably this Season. Everything from ambient sounds, background music to Open and Ending songs are well done, with the exception of some of the masterpiece of this season. Never have I been so eager to purchase the OST of an anime when it has just got released. All the songs are jazzy, catchy and when put into the scenes, it makes perfect compliment with the anime. I have to repeat that this is without a doubt, in my opinion the best sound design of the season, and maybe even this year.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 8/10. Character are designed fairly well. Each character is well established, with their unique (sorta) power and their own involvement in the story. There is very little character development however, besides from the relationship between the protagonist and his co-worker. That being said, some characters are still memorable and worthwhile to watch.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10. I'm not very picky about enjoyment, unless it is over the top ridiculous. This is an absolutely enjoyable anime to watch, partly for the great sound design and partly for a very well made anime. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9/10. I like this anime and I enjoyed it. However it has its flaws and lets be real here, nothing is perfect. This should have been a 8/10 but I give it a plus for its masterpiece sound design (mentioning it again).\\n\\n\r\nNote that this anime is not for everyone. Its story pacing might troubles some people.",

            "content": "Kekkai Sensen/Blood Blockade Battlefront Review \r\nStory (6/10) Fair\r\nThe story of Kekkai Sensen was fair, nothing uber complex, mind blowing or even addiction to get into in my personal opinion. But the story definitely wasn't bad. There were quite a few episodes that definitely felt like filler/episodic episodes some where good and some where just straight up irrelevant. But the overall story I though was fine.\r\nArt and Animation (10/10) Outstanding\r\nStudio Bones could not have done a better job at adapting this anime. The key animation done by Bahi JD the same dude responsible for the amazingly key animations for Space Dandy did his thing forKekkai Sensen it's outstanding and I wish the guy was in charge for everything anime's animation I was watching because it's probably the reason I even gave the show a chance, the trailer before the anime came out and episode 1 sold me and it was mostly because of the art style and animation Bones and Bahi JD brought to the table. \\n\\n\\n\r\nSound (7/10) Good\\n\\n\r\nThe sound for Kekkai Sensen was good. No BGMs that made my spin tingle or anything but the opening was catchy and the voice acting both JP and Eng Dub I thought were good. Everything sound related was all around good. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters (6/10)\\n\r\nMore Specifically (6.75/10) Fine  \\n\\n\r\nThe characters in Kekkai Sensen were fine, interesting since episode on especially how well they were introduced. Majority of the cast are all more interesting than the MC himself and I wish we got more characterization on everyone but him honestly. Overall though I felt we didn't necessarily get that much characterization from any character in the anime through out it's 12 episodes because like I said before majority of these episodes were episodic/filler episodes and if there was any character that probably got a good characterization (but still not enough for me to be satisfied) was Klaus. Zapp got a little bit, didn't care too much for the MC and would have love to see more of Zed, but the season ended so oh well.\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (6/10) Fair\\n\r\nMore Specifically (6.5/10) \\n\\n\r\nWith all the nice things I had to say about Kekkai Sensen up to this point my enjoyment is sitting at a 'fine'. The anime has a heavy focus on it's comedy aspect as one of it's key selling points and it didn't sit too well with me. The only episode that got me cackling was the episode where Zapp was stealing the MC's food but that didn't last too long either. Another thing that is an enjoyment selling point that the anime brings thanks to Bones and Bahi JD is the animation. The art style and animation on the bloodmoves and the little fighting choreography were all stunning I wish we got more that only gave of tiny bits of it and focus more on the comedy which I said didn't sit to well. The story didn't sit too well with me either and the episodic/filler episodes like I said before weren't that entertaining to me.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall (7/10) \\n\r\nMore Specifically (7.25/10)\\n\\n\r\nKekkai Sensen was a good anime but that's as much as I can get it. Episode one was hype and promising but after that it was episodic and filler episodes invested and like i said earlier those didn't sit well with me. The story I felt didn't really go anywhere, they had one episode that had to do with Vampires or something and I thought that was interesting but ultimately was ignored the next episode. I started Kekkai Sensen as soon as the subs dropped I was there day 1 ready and as far as I remember i stayed caught up weekly (I think I may have fallen behind once but was caught up majority of the time) and when that last episode took like FOREVER AND A DAY to come out I obviously put the anime 'On Hold' because I'm just not going to let it sit there in my watching section when I not really watching it. And when that final episode finally came out I didn't even feel like watching it right away because all of the disappointing things I remembered that bothered me about this anime started to rise. It was only till today after looking at my \"On Hold\" section that I decided to finish this shit off and I've heard that this last episode was worth it... it really wasn't.. But that's not taking away from the animation which I think is the saving point of this anime. With a mediocre story it kept it afloat and is probably the reason why it's still around a 7 to me but no more than that..",

            "content": "PLEASE NOTE: This review was written before any episode past episode 11 a.k.a. episode 12 a.k.a. \"Paint It Black\". If this has more episodes past this one, I won't be updating this review.\r\nKekkai Sensen, otherwise known as \"Blood Blockade Battlefront\", is an action comedy with lots of supernatural themes and elements. The show's stylish and fast-paced artwork and comedy lead you through scenes between intense supernatural fights involving anything from a man-eating car to vampires.\r\nSTORY: 6/10\r\nThe story involves our protagonist, young impersonator of Pokemon's Brock, named Leonardo Watch. He was born with special eyes that have superpowers of some sort and is accidentally thrown intothe world of the underground organization known as Libra, who fight to protect the citizens of the city they live in from disaster and ruin.\\n\\n\r\nOnly one problem: The city's bonkers. There's so many different strange creatures, no two seem alike, and a lot of them are hostile. This leads to the city being hectic, dangerous, and crime-filled. When I said that Libra is a group of people who fight evil, they're more like a secret police squad. If it doesn't involve illegal activity, they don't bat an eye at the actions of the townsfolk.\\n\\n\r\nThe story claims to have an overarching plot, but  for the most part it is one or two-part episodes while the main villains in the background have a giggle at the goings on. That's not to say all the episodes are like this, but for the most part the episode involves the group having to do something totally unrelated in order to gain a tiny bit of information which may or may not take any part in what's going on in the next episode.\\n\\n\r\nART: 7/10\\n\r\nWhen not in combat or making a joke, the animation and art style can be quite generic. Action scenes have lots of flair, lots of flash, and a lot of personality. Comedic moments reminded me of One Piece, in the way that faces could simplify, become jagged, or distort in order to further the comedy of the show. The alien beings can be very unique and strange, bringing lots of personality to the background characters or the rare side character for a one-off episode or two.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND: 6/10\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is somewhat generic, with a tad bit of flair, but to be honest it didn't really stick with me. The OP is good and the ED is decent, though I prefer to watch it more for the visuals than the song itself.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER: 6/10\\n\r\nHere's where the show, to me, feels bloated and highly flawed. The show's current episodes, up to \"Paint It Black\", are filled to the brim with character introductions. We also don't get much development from our protagonist besides the backstory that is repeated a few times within the show. I wouldn't have a problem with a show with this many characters, but to be honest it felt like I would rather have had development of our current characters instead of constant introductions to new ones just so that they don't appear again, or if they do, appear once.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT: 4/10\\n\r\nI hated \"Paint it Black\", which is as far as we have so far. To refer to this as a \"finale\", it is one of the worst I've ever seen. Along with constant character introductions that made me wish for more protagonist or main character building or plot development, and the plot itself being decent to boring, it became a bit of a chore to sit through, even though it had a decent beginning.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL: 6/10\\n\r\nA fairly average show with several things bogging it down, but occasionally nice-looking fight scenes. Once this gets more episodes, I would recommend you check it out because it will most likely continue with what we have now that all the characters are introduced, but until then you should probably avoid it.",

It is another show where people yell out their moves when the fight.\r\n2. They went through all the trouble to make such a great world and great side characters. Then they throw a whiny baby in as the main character that has \"special eyes\" and that is his only strong suit. He has a few comedic moments in the show but other than that he is a terrible character.\r\n3. The \"villain\" has no motivation other than causing havoc and the finale just leaves somuch open without another season. At this point if there was another season I would not watch it.\\n\\n\r\nNow here is what the anime got right.\\n\\n\r\n1. Art style, fantastic different take that didn't have characters with big eyes. They took a different approach and I liked the end result, Heck the main character rarely has his eyes open. \\n\\n\r\n2. Sound design. Fantastic, intro and outro songs are also really good.\\n\\n\r\n3. The side characters. They are fantastic and you will laugh a lot during the show at how the side characters play off of one another and the main character.\\n\\n",

            "content": "I'll start off by saying that if you're a fan of the series Baccano, Kyousogiga, or both, then you're going to love this show.\r\nThis series, in my own humble opinion, is basically perfection. \r\nIt took only one episode for me to completely fall in love. \r\nAllow me to explain to you exactly what it is I feel about this series. \r\nKekkai Sensen is directed by Rie Matsumoto, who I personally see as a genius. Her directing style is extremely distinct and very unique. She has a wide range of creative camera angles along with her brilliant tactics into making something engaging or exciting. If youwant an example of her work, watch Kyousogiga. That show is fantastic as well and I highly suggest watching it.\\n\r\nAnd although her directing style is super energetic, she somehow manages to make it so the show is easy to follow, despite all of what's going on at once.  \\n\\n\r\nWhen it comes to it's story, Kekkai Sensen makes great use of the world it has created. Countless things could happen in this twisted version of New York City. I won't tell you about anything that happens in the series, because honestly I went into it blind, and I wish for you to do the same. \\n\\n\r\nThe art is most likely the weakest point in the series, if we aren't counting camera angles as an artistic value. The only reason why is because the animation isn't exactly up-to-par with all of the other shows airing this season, yet it still manages to at times create it's own special atmosphere which continues to engage me in it's marvelous universe. \\n\\n\r\nThe Sound and Characters are both fantastic aspects to this series, and I emphasize the character importance because they're easily the best part of the show. I can't even tell you how fun it is to watch these people interact and work together. All of their personalities are non-generic and the director takes advantage of it's wide variety. Not to mention, there are actually about 5 or so voice actors who play main characters in Gintama! How much more fun can a series get when it comes to it's characters? (Shinpachi, Hijikata, Sarutobi, Katsura and Kagura, from what I remember.) \\n\\n\r\nMy enjoyment is an easy 10. This show is a marvel. Never in so long have I seen a new series be so eccentric and unique. \\n\r\nIt's truly a gem, and I hope that other people can realize this as well. \\n\r\nI apologize if my review was lacking, since I'm more of a creative writer, not a critic. So my vocabulary and descriptions tend to be less varied when it comes to writing reviews... \\n\r\nEither way, please, give the show a chance! You won't regret it!\\n\\n\r\n(OH, I MUSTN'T FORGET. THIS SERIES LITERALLY HAS ONE OF THE BEST ENDING SONGS/VIDEOS OF ALL TIME. GO LOOK UP IT'S ED, I PROMISE YOU WILL LOVE IT. THE OPENING IS FANTASTIC TOO.)",

            "content": "For those who have long awaited for a reboot for Trigun... you are going to have to wait a little longer. Until then you can watch Yasuhiro Nightow's other manga get adapted in what I am sure is going to be the best anime of the season that feels like the spiritual successor of Trigun. Kekkai sensen aka Blood Blockade Battlefront.\r\nstory and character 8/10: the story itself is not very complex. it can be simply put as an organization of super-powered people fighting against disorder in New York which has now turned into supernatural zone between the underworld and the real world that has beenrenamed Jerusalums Lot. What makes the story so good however is the execution. the way it goes about episode by episode is definitely not textbook \"Monster of the week\" type predictable battles where they have to simply find some weakness that was only apparent to the main character. There really is a lot of variety to this show as there are many important antagonists that shaped the way that Jeruselums lot functions. Its story telling style is a lot like Baccano or Durarara where there isn't really a main character and more of a main cast of characters to tell the story it presents. The characters in the story at the moment have not fully developed at the moment of writing so ill hold off on that till the end of the show. the character designs are unique and well done as are the plethora of background \"beyondians\". The show uses naming conventions that are similar to Trigun that seem so stupid for characters that they somehow end up being cool and memorable like Zap Renfro or steven starphase. Overall the entire cast is solid.\\n\\n\r\nArt and sound : 10/10: The artwork and animation in this show is too impressive to put to words. studio Bones went all out to really capture the setting of new york overrun by supernatural beings with such great detail while also giving all of their effort the extremely well animated and over the top action scenes. this is partly due to the director of Kyousou Giga, Rie Matsumoto using extremely interesting and stylistic camera angle choices and overlays to better convey a scene or simply keeping things interesting even when its simply characters doing some exposition. On the topic of sound I am currently waiting for the whole soundtrack to be released as I haven't heard a ost this good that incorporates jazz music since Kids on the slope. The musical composer Taisei Iwasaki is just starting out with making music for kekkai sensen so he is one to keep an eye out for in the future, the Implementation of the music in the anime is also well done as there are never times when the music feels out of place. there are no complaints on the voice acting however there is a small issue at hand with this series when it comes to audio. This show almost demands an english dub simply because of the setting they are in and that during certain moments of exposition it is almost impossible to keep track of everything all at once in an episode in one go requiring multiple re-watches to get all of it and naturally hearing it in a dubbed version would alleviate this problem.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9/10: This show has the artistic flair and character writing to shine and each element of the show embodies the theme of what made New York City an ideal melting pot of cultures and ideas from a diverse cast of characters to many different genres of music (with jazz being the most used) to the diverse population of monsters and super-humans and diverse stories they tell. this show is a definite must-watch this season\\n",

            "content": "Sometimes, I don't get anime fans. If you've paid attention to the sales charts, you'll see that Blood Blockade Battlefront's current sales numbers are going toe-to-toe with Shirobako aka the most acclaimed and important anime series in recent times, and that just baffles me. I mean Kyoani\u2019s own beautiful anime with believable character motivations, depth to its story, and (most importantly of all) actual challenges the characters have to overcome came out in the same season around the same time, and yet it just sold decently - which is below the studio\u2019s usual standards. Okay fine, maybe this anime has a swanky soundtrack. Maybe it'sbeing directed by one of the most dynamic TV directors in the current market. Maybe it has a character named Zapp Renfro. Maybe it had one of the most unique and eye-catching premises to come from the market in years. But BBB on the whole is just not the least bit good, and I don't understand why anyone is trying to convince me otherwise.\\n\\n\r\nThe series is based on a manga written by Yasuhiro Nightow, who you may know as the writer of Trigun - a series that's kinda sexist when you think about it. Okay, it\u2019s not on the level of Bakuman or even Rurouni Kenshin, but Vash is still a really f*cking stupid main character. But you know, as much as he grinds my gears whilst shouting his \u201cLove & Peace\u201d bullshit, at least Vash had a personal story and some important flaws, mishandled as they were, in regards to some interesting discussions about how to deal with criminals. So I was kinda expecting some similar moral quandaries in this new thing under the guise of a stylish futuristic noir setting.\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately, Nightow decided for his new work that BBB would be a generic slice-of-life story combined with Baccano\u2019s tone, and you know what that means? Let\u2019s do absolutely fuck all whilst trying to cover up that fact with lots of energy! Honestly, I\u2019m still racking my brains regarding who contributed more to BBB\u2019s problems. But make no mistake: neither the production team nor the original writer helped in making this show good. The phrase \u201cnothing interesting happens\u201d is overused in general, let alone by me, but I can\u2019t think of a better summary of the show\u2019s problems aside from it being the equivalent of eating nothing but a giant bag of M&Ms for lunch. Sounds appealing at first until you become sick not even ten minutes, and you\u2019ve still got five-sixths of the bag to go through.\\n\\n\r\nThe main character is pretty bland as well. Leonardo Watch - and you can tell that someone involved with Gungrave worked on these names because they\u2019re just as silly here as they were there - is a young boy with magical eye powers who comes to the Star Wars version of Chicago and ends up getting involved in a series of ka-razy events that leads to him getting recruited into an organization called Libra, a group of individuals much older than him that keep peace in the city through poorly stylized fight scenes against villains that are never developed beyond the concept and we\u2019ll never see again afterwards. Whilst dealing with these episodic events involving their exploits, Leo routinely converses with an anime-original girl and boy at the beginning and end of each episode, cock-teasing a larger story involving them with his connection being incredibly arbitrary.\\n\\n\r\nIn fact, Leonardo\u2019s entire existence is arbitrary. Most of his screentime is just him being strung along by other people and most of the time, he doesn\u2019t take a proactive role or solve anything on his own other than spotting the occasional enemy weakness - which makes him about as useful as Slippy Toad, so I have to wonder why he\u2019s even the main character. Which come to think of it, didn\u2019t he come to Hellsalem in order to help his sister? Actually, even I don\u2019t even remember what was up with that mcguffin anymore. Something about her being sick because of some magic bullshit? Maybe if more than five minutes (in the first episode no less) were dedicated to that plot point, I\u2019d care enough to look it up.\\n\\n\r\nBBB Writer #1: Hey, wasn\u2019t there some plot thread regarding Leo\u2019s personal life that we should at least address, BBB Writer #2?\\n\\n\r\nBBB Writer #2: Can\u2019t seem to recall that, BBB Writer #1. Now let\u2019s have the characters fight a Ninja Samurai Vampire, because that\u2019s cool right?\\n\\n\r\nEvery single scenario is ridiculously unimaginative and plays like some Hideo Kojima wannabe\u2019s fanfiction come to life rather than pieces of a larger whole. And with each episode I watched, I just kept asking myself what the point of all this nonsense was. There\u2019s one episode where Leo befriends a friendly mushroom-like fellow that\u2019s experiencing racism because that\u2019s just how it works in the city. And when Leo tries to help him, he ends up getting kidnapped (again) and forgetting said friend once the mushroom defends himself with some sort of pollen after getting beaten severely with a baseball bat on-screen. As much as I understand that racism is a subject that\u2019s still relevant after all this time, this incident is never brought up again and doesn\u2019t add to Leo\u2019s character so I\u2019m not really sure why you made me sit through that.\\n\\n\r\nAnd really, that\u2019s one of the more focused episodes of the series. A large percentage of them are incredibly gimmicky fluff that accomplishes nothing more than saying something exists before pretending it doesn\u2019t the very next week. Where are the episodic stories where the characters\u2019 way of life is questioned or where some cliche yet relevant personal philosophy is imparted upon us or where something game-changing happens in the future besides introducing another throwaway character? Now I know the anime makes it clear at the start that Hellsalem is a place where anything can happen and that you could argue that\u2019s the message of the anime, but I respond to that answer with \u201cno fucking duh\u201d. That sort of philosophy is functional as setup, but for the basis of an entire series, it\u2019s simplistically dull because anything can happen in real life too (as Donald Trump\u2019s campaign should show you, let alone the real New York). What exactly is this \u201canything can happen in Crazy Town\u201d philosophy in aid of, Blood Blockade Battlefront?\\n\\n\r\nBecause it sure isn\u2019t about anything resembling a coherent whole, I\u2019ll tell you that. Literally the only connecting thread are these twins that only meet with Leo at the beginning and end of each episode and pretty much disappear altogether until their story appears in that long-delayed finale where said delay either killed your interest or made you want to rewatch the show prior to its arrival because it\u2019s been a season since you last watched the anime and your memory is that atrocious. But why you\u2019d need to do that is a question that you\u2019re going to have to answer to me in a really understandable way, because the hints to this finale were both barely there and don\u2019t even involve Leo or the rest of the cast all that much, if at all. And the same is true for the finale itself, which without spoiling anything, is so anticlimactic and non-consequential to anything in the show, let alone the characters, that it makes you question the entire arc's importance for all the good it did.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of the characters, I might have tolerated the lackluster story and Leo's non-existent importance if they had been the least bit interesting. But if you\u2019re one of those people who think it\u2019s not utterly dumb for every character to be a badass, then you can just disregard this review right now, because I honestly don\u2019t see the appeal in a cast that doesn\u2019t have any sort of pathos whatsoever. I don\u2019t have a problem starting your story with fully developed characters since origin stories are overrated anyways, but there\u2019s a difference between someone who got the way they are through hard struggles in their life and someone who\u2019s the product of Mary Sue fanfiction. Especially when their attempts to be funny consist of jokes that have as much punch as a one-year old who hasn\u2019t eaten in days and is chained to the ground.\\n\\n\r\nAnd worst of all, they don\u2019t do anymore than Leo. There\u2019s this woman in a suit named Chain Sumeragi who is supposed to be a werewolf, but she never transforms or even fights or does really much of anything aside from jumping around and making snide remarks to Zapp - who I only remember for his name and little else. Which is something I guess, since I didn\u2019t bother to retain anyone else\u2019s names in this series apart from Klaus. Maybe if you actually made them do anything important or memorable or anything not boring, I\u2019d have a reason to do so.\\n\\n\r\nBut no, they do jack throughout the entire show. Even in the finale, they do jack, mostly existing to serve as Leo's cheerleaders and little else. And just like most fictional cheerleaders, it's incredibly hard to distinguish between them if you ignore the obvious fact that they have different designs, sexes, and voices. Literally anything said by one character could easily be said by another character without coming across as unnatural, and that's not a good thing in my book unless you just don't care about character variety. And if you don't, sorry to say this, but you have real low standards man.\\n\\n\r\nBlood Blockade Battlefront does not live up to any of the hype surrounding its pre or post-release, but I\u2019ll be fair and admit that not even Cowboy Bebop would have been able to live up to the amount of jizz that covered it before its airing alone. All of the show\u2019s good traits from Matsumoto\u2019s dynamic direction to the ending credits are outnumbered by shit ones, namely the fact that there\u2019s so much about these characters and this setting that\u2019s ripe for good storytelling, and yet it\u2019s wasted on predictable humor, shallow characterization, and pointless world-building that will become as relevant as school shootings in a decade (seriously, how the fuck can there be so many in this year alone?). Also, dear god does the action suck a big fat one. It's completely one-sided and keeps favoring stylization over interesting choreography, the finale in particular avoiding to scratch that \"action-loving\" itch of mine when it had the team take down a bunch of faceless mooks that stood perfectly still and took it from the top in-between all the horrendously boring and overly long philosophical dialogue.\\n\\n\r\nAnd it didn't even last half a minute. That's like dating a cute girl for five years without having sex and when you finally decide to do it on your honeymoon night...well let's just say that unlike this show, you have more to look forward to in the future, including getting better. But it's best not to tell your kids about the time you cried during what you claim to be the greatest period of your life.",

I won't provide an example to avoid spoiling, butlet's just say some guy who has insane fighting skills also has insane superpowers is incidentally the human race's best chess player (better than pro players) just when it's needed.\\n\\n\r\nOk enough about the characters and the plot, if there's one thing I DO enjoy about Kekkai Sensen it would be the sound. I like the opening and ending tracks, as well as the ambient music, and how it changes the atmosphere of the scenes as it goes along. This is probably the only thing that kept me watching.\\n\\n\r\nTo close, I have to say that there are plenty of people who enjoy animes like this, but if you, like me, do not enjoy multiple non-linear storylines coupled with barrages of nonsense and nameless random characters, probably you might want to look somewhere else. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 9, Art: 7, Story,Character,Enjoyment: 6.

Keep delivering pizza.\r\nKekkai Sensen is packed with such enjoyable concepts, environments and characters. Kekkai Sensen is that friend who goes out of their way to give you shits and giggles because they're such a nice person.

It's beautifully done and you'll be watching this entire anime with a smile.\\n\\n\r\nThe captions introducing the characters feels so natural. The voice acting - both the protagonists and the villains, give so much personality insight and perspective to the voiced character. This one will be so enjoyable if dubbed properly. The camera angles are varied constantly, and are so well done it sets the standard for future anime - there may now exist an anime you can rewatch and enjoy purely for cinematography. \\n\\n\r\nEvery scene is drawn from a new camera perspective and doesn't skimp on visual accuracy.

            "content": "Story - 2\r\nThe biggest problem with this series is its inability to tell a proper story as every episode is more or less just a 'character introduction of the week', a notable cousin of the 'monster of the week' trope.\r\nEvery episode seems to begin with Leonardo going about his daily life and then something quite random happens and he gets thrown into the middle of the ensuing chaos. Something happens in the middle of the episode which resolves the aforementioned issue (most often with very little input from Leonardo) then somehow it's tied altogether at the very last few minutes of the episode and callsitself a story.\\n\\n\r\nAnd the biggest problem with this is that from episode to episode, there seems to be very little relevance linking it to the previous episode other than basically a character introduction, who, most of the time, don't seem to get any more air time or even noted at all.\\n\\n\r\nThe most important part of each episode, the last few minutes, tends to reveal that 'something' large is happening, yet since every episode is just a one-off incident, you're left wondering if this 'something' actually exists at all.\\n\\n\r\nThen there's the blood style fighting of the series which has very little explanation to it other than that it seems to be more like the 'magic system' of the universe. There's also the obnoxious calling out of the attack names that seems to be just added in because the author thought it would sound really cool and attract any six year old that so happens to be watching. And this series seems to be aiming towards them with its overall idea of its 'episodic character and conflict introduction to resolution'.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt - 8\\n\r\nThere nothing really wrong with the art. It's pretty standard but suits the style of the series.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound - 8\\n\r\nThe variety of voices really help with the identification of characters and help prevents character overlap. The BGM fits well with the mafia styled theme and tends to be quite notable. I didn't really like the OP or ED, though the ED's style really fit with the overall theme.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 3\\n\r\nAnd this is another series that relies on its overly non-existent and weak protagonist in order to have an excuse for everything to happen.\\n\\n\r\nLeonardo - So basically he's more or less, like a lamppost. His input is negligible most of the time as the show relies more or less relies on other characters to mess with him which then prompts other characters to come and save him. And since he never actually does much, I'm not even sure what kind of person he is besides the generic male beta.\\n\\n\r\nThe Libra members - It seems that on episode one they're introduced as an underground organisation for maintaining balance and order and is counter to some 'evil' organisation that's also introduced on episode one. But that story quickly devolves into episodic resolutions which now entirely rely on Leonardo's mishaps. There's Zapp who just seems to be a comic relief more than anything, Klaus who's portrayed as the big boss and tries to be conveyed as someone strong and reliable but ends up being more of a 'get out of jail free' card. Then there's chain who serves very little purpose other than seemingly to just exist to shut feminists up about a lack of diversity.\\n\\n\r\nOthers - White and Black and recurring characters that seem to be placed there for any convenient story advancements. White is a girl that Leonardo so happens to meet and so happens to also be the sister of Black who is somehow related to the 'evil' organisation. White doesn't seem to do much besides being a possible love interest of Leonardo and giving expositions on White and Black's past which, at the moment, is largely unhelpful to the already murky story of the series. There are also the introduced 'character's of the week' but since they only play their role for that week their standing feels only one level higher than that of background characters.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 5\\n\r\nThe biggest let down of this series was its inability to tell a proper story. Some of the episodes had no relevance to the overall story and felt more like a filler than anything (I'm looking at you Chess episode and Mushroom episode) and having 2 filler episodes out of 7 (that I watched) is just insane. Watching this series didn't keep me on the edge, in fact it made me want them to fast forward and to just get to the point instead of watching every episode's repetitive beginning, predictable conflict resolution and very lazy ending of trying to tie all the event's into some 'greater' story.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 4\\n\r\nThe show suffers from two drastic flaws. The first is its poor story telling and the second is its continuous influx of characters and information in an already ambiguous story. It was like we started off on a good foot then tripped and fell into a dark valley and have kept falling since. The 'evil' organisation's introduction seemed to imply that we'd see a continuous conflict between Libra and them, yet after the first episode they seemed to have decided to take a vacation or something.\\n\\n\r\nSo far nothing much has happened in this series besides character introductions. Whatever 'greater' story that the author has in mind will probably end up as a deus ex machina.",

            "content": "Kekkai Sensen is an ongoing manga from Nightow Yasuhiro, you may know him as the creator of Trigun. The manga started in 2009, but it didn't receive an anime adaptation until this year. The anime was handled by Bones, a Studio that has a pretty strong track record as far as their works I've reviewed go. Will this be up to their usual standards? Let's delve into it. \r\nStory: \r\nOur story opens in Hellsalem's Lot, formerly New York formerly New Amsterdam. The old New York city was destroyed by a portal opening to another world and this one didn't even have the good grace tohave a giant squid monster. In this city, humans co-exist with all manner of strange otherworldly beings. In this city, there's a shadowy organisation called Libra dedicated to keeping the piece. Our protagonist, Leonardo Watch, encounters Libra through an odd coincidence and is given a position due to his mysterious \u201cAll-seeing eyes\u201dWhich are so strong that he doesn't even have to open his eyelids to see, apparently. The series follows several of Libra's escapades as they encounter various threats.\\n\\n\r\nThe biggest flaw of the series is the end. It's a disjointed mess with inadequate build up behind it, poorly attempting to tie up all of the ongoing plot points. The series also suffers a bit from tone problems. Most of the time it goes for a more over the top and fun type of aesthetic, but it also tries to have some real emotional moments. The emotional moments don't work well and come across as out of place because they're so heavily divorced from the tone of most of the series. They're simply too few in number with too vast of stretches betwixt them. There's also the narrative device of Leo writing a letter to his sister. Ultimately, it contributes nothing and exactly what parts of the series are included is unclear. It can't be the whole thing since there are a lot of scenes that he isn't in and where he just has no way of knowing what happened. The episodes also vary pretty widely. Some of them are fairly entertaining while others are just kind of dumb. \\n\\n\r\nOn the positive side, there are some intriguing ideas behind the series. If they had been better fleshed out, this could have been really good. The world building is pretty decent and I do like that  the series tries to show some of the alien perspectives at times. Also, let me reiterate, there are some pretty good episodes thrown in.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\\n\r\nThe characters really vary. There are some that are kind of interesting and have some depth to them, Klaus, Black, and White being the most obvious. However, most of the characters are pretty trite. Chain, Gilbert, K.K, Steven, Zed, Deldro, Dog, and a variety of other characters are just kind of there and only have a couple of very basic traits. Leo himself is kind of a boring generically nice but out of his league type of character. \\n\\n\r\nArt: \\n\\n\r\nThe art is pretty good. The character designs are nicely varied and distinctive. The action sequences are pretty strong, although they suffer a bit from overblown attacks that have to be awkwardly labelled on-screen, and there are some really nice details both in terms of the various creatures and in terms of the backgrounds. \\n\\n\r\nSound: \\n\\n\r\nThe acting is all right. It can be really over the top but, for the most part, it's perfectly serviceable. The best performance definitely comes from Koyama Rikiya. Probably because his character is more subdued and doesn't really go into the exaggerated craziness mode that, say, Nakai Kazuya's character exhibits so frequently. The music is fine. \\n\\n\r\nHo-yay: \\n\\n\r\nThere's really not any in this series. \\n\\n\r\nFinal Thoughts: \\n\\n\r\nThere was some real potential for this series. It has some good ideas and a world with a lot of potential, unfortunately, it falls pretty short with writing and characters that are quite mediocre. My final rating is going to be a 5/10. If you're looking for an exaggerated action-oriented series, Kekkai Sensen will likely be satisfactory. But if you're looking for something with more depth to it, it's probably not going to do much for you. Next week I'll take a look at Mahou Shoujo Lyrical Nanoha Vivid.",

            "content": "Ahh, Kekkai Sensen. Where to start with this one. It's such a brilliantly done show that's currently being overlooked by so many...\r\nStory- 9\r\nStarting with the story, I really want to give it a 10, but I can't. It's based around a version of New York where a portal to an alternate world opens, letting in weird sentient creatures. The show is very unspecific about the rules of who and what can leave and enter the fog covered area, as well as what exactly these creatures are. So far it's very enjoyable and seems to be building up to something great, but as I haven't readthe manga, I don't know what this build up is for. I'm expecting it to be good, but as I can't be sure, I have to give it a 9. As one popular reviewer said something to the extent of, \"I don't know where I'm going, but so far I'm enjoying the ride.\" I think that accurately sums up my feelings about it.\\n\\n\r\nArt- 10\\n\r\nAs expected of Bones, the art and animation are beautiful at every turn. Battles are a pleasure to watch, and characters have just the right expressions in the shows many comedic scenes. I don't know how they could have done better.\\n\\n\r\nSound- 10\\n\r\nNot much to say here. The sound track is very good, and I've listened to both the opening and the ending countless times. Both the opening and the ending fit the show very well, with the opening highlighting the serious side of the show, and the ending showing the fun side along with some hints as to future characters and some small ominous undertones.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter- 10\\n\r\nKekkai Sensen has many very likable characters. The two that have the most development so far are Leonardo and Zapp, so I'll focus on them. I quite like the main character, Leonardo Watch. He's a member of an organization called Libra, who specializes in fighting monsters and criminals. Most of the members of Libra use their blood as a weapon in a Deadman Wonderland style, but Leonardo has special eyes that were given to him shortly before the events of the series. These \"All Seeing Eyes of God\" allow him to see through illusions, project images to others, take control of other people's site, and more. Unlike most shonen main characters, he's neither overly weak or overly powerful. He uses his mind to think of new ways to apply his ability and fights in this way, instead of using overwhelming force like Zapp or Klaus. As for his personality, unlike most shonen main characters that are either to nice or try to be to cool, Leonardo has a more normal personality. He's nice and worries about saving others, but he can also be cool and funny, having realistic reactions to many things. One of the things that he reacts very realistically to is Zapp, another member of Libra. Zapp is one of my personal favorites, being used as comic relief half the time and an absolute badass the other half. He has a love-hate relationship with Leonardo, who he'll be murdering for pizza one second and saving the next. He's an interesting character, but the only thing that confuses me about him is why he tries to kill Klaus, the leader of Libra. We learn in episode 2 that most of the time when Zapp sees Klaus he'll try to kill him, or even that he'll attempt to put him in life-threatening situations. I only see this as use for comic relief, so it'd be nice if they expanded upon and explained this point.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment- 10\\n\r\nAs you can tell from the rest of my review, I love this show and it grew from an 8 up to a 10 over the 7 episodes that have been released. With likable characters, an interesting world, and something new happening every second to keep things interesting, it's a very fun show.\\n\\n\r\nOverall- 10\\n\r\nThis show is a 10, with everything being so incredibly well done that I find it hard to give it any other score. The show reminds me of a lot of my favorites. It reminds me of Deadman Wonderland for the previously mentioned blood weapons, Kill la Kill for its mix of action and over the top comedy (minus the fan service), and even Blue Exorcist and Hunter x Hunter for some reason I can't quite place. I'd recommend this show to anyone, and I hope it gets a bigger fan base and a second season.",

            "content": "Kekkai Sensen is one of those anime that by all means deserves to be called AOTY. However, there are a few things keeping it from being such. I'll start with the ratings of the anime that aren't 10/10's so as to let viewers know why I've rated this anime as such. Slight spoilers ensue, but nothing that really tells what happens or anything like that.\r\nArt: It's great, it's just that the animation itself is slightly lacking compared to other anime this season, as well as not meeting the demands for such a powerful story. But I digress, it's great and shows what's happening without fail,just wish it was a little better.\\n\\n\r\nPlot: Too much crammed into too little. 12 (13 if you count the recap episode) episodes is not enough for the story they're trying to tell. Nonetheless, it has still managed to be a riveting ride, and the story has managed to invoke great amounts of sympathy and whatnot. It's simply amazing how the story is told in such a whimsical manner, yet still manages to connect what seem to be meaningless moments into a bigger picture that is self-explanatory as soon as you see it.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Again, too much, too little time. There's a bunch of cast members that're introduced once, are shown to be extremely colorful and interesting with backstories that could probably get their own 12-episode spinoff (the only time where 12 episodes would be fine, as opposed to here), and almost never seen again. The main cast also suffers from this, as the spotlight seems to fall mostly on Leo and Zapp, with Klaus simply being the answer to any and all problems. The rest of the Libra department seems to stay true to their mission, which is working in the shadows, as we rarely see them do anything in the anime aside from showing up when necessary. The antagonists don't fare any better, with Black getting the most screen-time out of all of them (granted, he's the main antagonist as the story gradually shifts to make him out as such) and others such as Femt and Aligura getting most of theirs when they cause their own mischief. Characters are introduced at the show's convenience and while that isn't bad in any way, it doesn't help to know that the show will never speak of them again once the episode is over. Ultimately, this is a problem shared by many anime, one such big example being Angel Beats where a good amount of the main cast didn't get their backstories told.\\n\\n\r\nOne thing that is immediately brought to attention is how... whimsical the story is. Nothing is deeper than the surface when it comes to the why's and how's, everything simply is because it is. It's not for the sake of plot convenience, either -- it feels more like everything falls into place, and that everything will happen just because. You realize this as you see how Leo came to attain his God's Eyes, where a deity of some sort simply manifests before his family and forces them to decide who will be blinded and who will receive the eyes. You see it again as the wanton destruction of the city and the clearly massive amounts of casualties that follow are met with neither despair nor joy, but pure apathy. Sure, the people involved in the chaos are screaming for their lives, but the rest of the city, and the survivors as well, could seem to care less after all is said and done. While this is somewhat brought up in the anime as 'day-to-day occurrences' and are seen as a way to spice up the daily lives of the people, it still goes to show that destruction and death are 2 major daily occurrences in the former Big Apple, and are no longer worth paying attention to.\\n\\n\r\nFinally, I'd like to say that the world introduced to us in this anime is filled with so many inferred and unstated rules that I can't help but have question after question pop into my head as I suddenly realize things. Clearly, their world is different from ours, since they make it clear that there's been magic  and superpowers since long before the Great Collapse. There might have already been superhumans and human-like creatures such as werewolves before the Great Collapse. So, how does their history before the Great Collapse differ from ours? How has the rest of the world dealt with the loss of New York City, and how has it developed differently? How does Hellsalem's Lot, for lack of a better way to put it, work? How is it divided, how does it connect to the alternate plane of reality where the demons and such came from, etc., and while some questions are answered as the anime goes on (none of these are answered, which is why I've used them as examples), it's still one of those situations where getting an answer leaves you with even more questions.\\n\\n\r\nBut after all is said and done, what we have here is an anime adaptation of a very well-written manga, with a world of adventures packed into former New York City, and where it leads to is as good as anybody's guess. My overall score is only such due to the main problem being a lack of episodes, which in all honesty stems mostly from just wanting more and more of this anime, and the rest from what's written above. If you're a fan of zany and whimsical characters, mischievous humor, fantasy, drama, and/or episodic stories, this is an anime for you. And if you're not, it's still probably something worth checking out.\\n\\n\r\nAs an aside, I've never once seen a recap episode so beautifully done. While by nature it adds nothing to the story told so far, it still manages to be entertaining and, well, add to the story told so far. It was executed wonderfully, and I, who has refused to watch recap episodes due to thinking of them as a waste of time, was left feeling as if I'd watched a regular episode of the anime.",

            "content": "\"Every day is a knockabout of random craziness\" - Leo\r\nWell, if that's not lampshading this show, I don't know what is. \r\nPreface: \r\nKekkai Sensen was an early hit in Spring 2015, but is currently embroiled in some kind of licensing and broadcast dispute which is keeping the final episode from being aired, so as yet remains unfinished. Not like it'll change the course of the show though, because it developed a plot first starting on episode 10.\r\nArtwork and Animation: 6\r\nAnother Bones production, the art is decent, but nothing particularly outstanding. What is rather interesting is the choice of setting, and the visuals that come withit. Rather than being set in Tokyo with 90% of other anime, or a fantasy land, Kekkai Sensen is set in a during-apocalypse New York City. The character designs are fairly unique, with some unusual aliens and powers/effects, but ultimately pretty forgettable. Backgrounds are probably the most visually stunning aspect though- as the New York skyline looks very nice.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound and Voice Acting: 6\\n\\n\r\nOverall pretty meh. Nobody really stands out, but for the voice actor fiends out there, Mamoru Miyano does make an appearance as a one off villain of the week. Everyone likes to rave over the ending theme, \"Sugar Song to Bitter Step\" by Unison Square Garden, and I do have to admit it's quite catchy, but a catchy ending song an OST does not make, and the rest falls pretty flat. \\n\\n\\n\r\nThe Good:\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 8 \\n\\n\r\nKekkai Sensen does have a fun cast. Made up of a ragtag, zany bunch- it does lend itself to the oddball/motley crew comedy that the show tries so to sell. Mr Zapp is the source of many a laugh, butt monkey that he is. The majority of the main characters set themselves apart from each other- Chain is the straight man, Klaus the mischievous, and KK the angry psycho chick. Leonardo brings up the rear as the aloof goober character. \\n\r\nIn all honesty, the villains provide a lot more charisma and presence to the show, when they're even involved. \\n\\n\\n\r\nThe Ugly:\\n\\n\r\nStory: 3\\n\\n\r\nLet's face the facts. Kekkai Sensen might be fun, but there is negative plot here. It mostly takes the form of a Villain-of-the-Week\u2122 episodic plot, but here and there (meaning only twice) were there arcs of any sort. The one with Zapp was by and large the strongest point of the show, and landed right smack in the middle. I thought at this point the show was going to pick up with something interesting, but immediately launched back into VotW the next episode with something even more inane than before- a total filler episode about getting food. (Is this Code Geass Pizza Episode 3.0??) \\n\r\nThe promise of a bigger narrative is wasted potential and the series spins its wheels. It starts off well enough, protag is on a quest to help out their loved one, but this is sidelined almost inside of the first five minutes of the show. \\n\\n\r\nThe plot was really one step forward, two miles to the side, then one step back. Like that line dance everyone had to do in kindergarten through 5th grade when you were next to a partner you didn't like.\\n\\n\r\nThe wacky and strange situations that the characters find themselves in soon get pretty tiring after you realize that the villain of the week isn't going to last beyond the next 23 minutes, however. Leonardo getting captured every week and the Libra members saving his butt so he can return to his mundane existence eating burgers also gets really old. KS relies a lot on the same gags, Zapp being a butt monkey and getting the crap kicked out of him by KK/Chain/Sensei, Leo getting caught, and Klaus tearing stuff up without meaning it. Ooopsie. \\n\\n\r\nTowards the end, KS did start developing a plot with recurring characters, though. It showed some promise- it's just unfortunate they couldn't get to the point earlier (or the producers and broadcasters getting their crap together to air the last episode).\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment and Overall: 6\\n\\n\r\nKekkai Sensen was decently entertaining, but at the end of the day, it was rather unfulfilling. I'm not really a glass half empty kind of person, but KS has a hole in the bottom of the Tea jug, and most of the plot just leaked out on the floor. Call it a bad adaptation, call it creative license- the fact remains that this feels a bit incomplete, especially ironic given that the last episode is out there in limbo somewhere.\\n\\n\\n\r\nRecommend?\\n\\n\r\nIf villain of the week oddball comedy is your thing, give it a shot.",

It had a good thing going, the only problem was how hard it was to follow. \r\nStory:\r\nI gave it a low score in this section because of how scrambled and hard to follow it was. I had a hard time understanding the powers in this show. From the blood thingys to the main character's eyes, it was all too difficult to follow. Although it didn't really have much of a plot and it might be unfair to grade iton this aspect if the anime can't even properly lay out the world's mechanics-whether it's filler based or not- then you can't really give the story aspect a good grade. Thus, if the story/world isn't good, the anime is most likely not that enjoyable. \\n\\n\r\nArt & Sound:\\n\r\nI actually liked the ending song, was pretty nice, but I'm no good at these ratings.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nThe characters were quite enjoyable. Although it was hard to follow the story and world mechanics, the relationships between these characters were pretty easy and clear. The characters were nicely made and their attributes really helped with the comedy aspect of this story. The characters were the only thing bumping the overall and enjoyment score from a 3 to a 4.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment and Overall:\\n\r\nLike mentioned before, the characters were really enjoyable. Watching the characters' reactions to the situation and each other was quite fun, but the story wasn't very entertaining. The world and how it worked was hard to understand, which took away a lot from the enjoyment factor.\\n\\n\r\nWould I recommend this anime? I really don't know. It has some good points, and the style isn't to my liking but it could be yours. If you like, say, Cowboy Bebop or Gintama, you actually might find this show more enjoyable to me, whereas I wasn't much of a fan of either and dropped both series. To add on, I didn't watch Kekkai Sensen & Beyond, so from all I know that season could be really great, but then again I don't know. So I might have to end up changing this section, but for now, Kekkai Sensen is something I might recommend depending on the person, although in most cases I would probably not recommend.\\n\\n\r\nIn Short:\\n\r\nIf you like filler anime this might be something you can consider, if you're willing to ignore the confusing details on how this odd world works. If on the other hand, you enjoy plot filled animes and care a lot about their structures, don't even think about watching this.",

Having seen the state a bunch of times on television and in the newspapers, I\u2019ve always been wondering what really goes on over there. Then, there comes this series called Kekkai Sensen (Blood Blockade Battlefront) where we see New York in an alternate form. The catch? It\u2019s now a place for both New Yorkers and supernatural beings. Sources from the series states that a portal known as \u2018The Beyond\u2019 caused it and that there\u2019s a dimensional fog barrier preventing monsters from crawling out to otherplaces. Having just read the premise should making this series sound thought provoking. And if that wasn\u2019t enough, did I mention there\u2019s also something that threatens this interdimensional plane? \\n\\n\r\nFrom the creator of Trigun, Yasuhiro Nightow brings this new exciting series with a lot of clever gimmicks. Not only do we have this interdimensional called Hellsalem's Lot (formerly known as New York City) but there\u2019s also a lot going on behind a group of people known as the \u201cLibras\u201d. To me, this series is like a dark urban tale where each episode has its tale to tell. Kekkai Sensen is by no means just a shounen action show crafted to save the world. This is more like an urban fantasy where stories are made and legends are born.\\n\\n\r\nTo start off, the show follows more of an episodic nature. While events in the series along with its characters does form connections, each episode in itself has a tale to tell. Essentially, the first episode establishes the foundation of the series where we meet the majority of the main cast and experience what Hellsalem\u2019s Lot is about. I think there should be an emphasis put on the \u2018hell\u2019 part as the first episode is hellish all around with lots happening with overwhelming amount of bizarreness. Perhaps one of the normal people we meet at first would be Leonardo Watch. Seeming portrayed as a normal young man, he has a rare power known as the \u201cAll Seeing Eyes\u201d. These eyes grants him special abilities although at a cost of his sister\u2019s eyesight. As the main male protagonist of the series though, he also become involved with Libra, a group that deals with the many supernatural occurrences in Hellsalem\u2019s Lot. In a way, they aren\u2019t just a police unit but more of an elite group of powerful people with their own unique abilities. For instance, there\u2019s Klaus V Reinhertz, the leader of the group with his ability to fight with a large shaped cross as his weapon of choice. Zapp Renfro, a hotblooded member of the group is known to utilize his blood fighting style. Then, there\u2019s Chain Sumeragi with her ability of invisibility, Steven A. Starphase with the ability to freeze others through ferocious kicks, K.K and her elite skills to handle firearms, among others. The point is that this group of characters all stand both individually and collectively.\\n\\n\r\nAnd this is where the series shine the most. It\u2019s the characters. Kekkai Sensen is a rare breed of a show where I hardly find any character that I dislike. In fact, almost every character has a personality that can easily be adaptable with the contents of this show. Leonardo\u2019s initial role in the story also has him portray more as the paper boy with his errands. However, he does play valuable part in the story especially with his unnatural eyes. Each episode involves him being involved in some sort of event that seems to degenerate into abnormality. I have to say that the show is very clever with some of these events ranging from chasing a super-fast monkey, being held hostage by some underworld thugs, or even sharing burger with a friendly alien. There\u2019s this sensation that the show constantly brings with his adventures as we learn more about Hellsalem\u2019s Lot. Similarly, other characters participates in unique events such as Klaus\u2019 challenge in the highly dangerous Prosfair, a game that can drive a normal human mad or even an underground boxing match against unholy monsters. While all this is happening though, there are bits of foreshadowing with certain characters that tells of something going behind the scenes. Nonetheless, Kekkai Sensen\u2019s performance with each episode shows how clever it can be with its gimmicks and style that feels similar to Baccano, atmospheric like Cowboy Bebop, and unique on its own.\\n\\n\r\nThe comedy factors are also quite genuine as well so anyone looking for an ultra-deep or philosophical show is in the wrong place. Rather, take this series as more of a relaxing adventure. The comedy elements ranges with good amount of slice of life-like moments involving Zapp, Leo\u2019s misadventures when running errands, or in general anything that seems not so ordinary. And speaking of which, there\u2019s so many abnormal things happening in this show that mystery also plays certain roles. It makes the audience wonder about the foundation of Hellsalem\u2019s Lot with the history that it contains or where our characters (specifically Libra) came from in the first place. Leonardo\u2019s mysterious All Seeing Eyes is also a central element of the show that many find fascinating, fearful, and curiously endearing all at once. There\u2019s even some bits of subtle romance in the story as well. Do take note that this adaptation adds an anime original character named White so her role in the series adds something fun to think about. In particular, her relationship with Lenoardo seems to be something like an acquaintance/friendship/bonding type of connection. It\u2019s hard to describe exactly what it is but romance can easily be interpreted into their development as well. What\u2019s more is that she also has a brother who is even more mysterious than he seems. Now that adds a bit of something to think about. The show in fact often makes you think what may happen next and what you guess may or may not be correct. However, the thrill and excitement of each episode is definitely something to remember.\\n\\n\r\nThere are some pet peeves that can be found in this show at times though. The series is pretty fast paced and sometimes seems like there\u2019s too much happening at once or where you feel like you\u2019re in the middle of nowhere. Even with a breather episode here or there, the story can be hard to understand at times. Just note that certain events and characters do have connections that formulates the overlay of the story. Also, this series may or may not fit with everyone\u2019s style. The urban setting and characters sometimes can feel too gimmicky for its own good and certain likable side characters can be easily dismissed. There may also at times where the comedy feels like it\u2019s recycled a bit more than it should be. And finally, Leonardo may be one of the lesser characters that are worth remembering compared to its others despite being the main protagonist. He\u2019s not the dull type but there certainly are characters that really outshines his portrayal.\\n\\n\r\nDo I even have to say it? This is like a classic Bones series. Taking a look at the poster visual should quickly make people imply what studio will adapt a series with such artwork. Indeed, studio Bones takes charge of the show with its fantastic visuals to illustrate and deliver the style of Kekkai Sensen. The urban setting of Hellsalem should feel similar with anyone who experienced with Nightow\u2019s other works. Then, there\u2019s also the portrayal of the monsters, each crafted cleverly at its own degree. There\u2019s imagery too and metaphors that are well adapted. Most prominently, Leonardo\u2019s eyes stands out as an epitome of enigma. The way it\u2019s colored, decorated, and operates really has a feel of unorthodox. And that\u2019s just one more thing to think about regarding the artwork of the show. Character designs are skillfully made with each one that suits with their roles. The action is also pretty fluid with flashy movements and explosive camera features that will make you go awe. It has minimal fan service and really never ventures into that direction throughout the entire story. It doesn\u2019t need to anyways since Kekkai Sensen is clever on its own.  \\n\\n\r\nSmooth. Joyful. Nostalgic. These are just a few words that I can describe about Kekkai Sensen\u2019s music. The OST not only has a jazz and blue like-tune but also brings in a feel where you really can picture yourself there. The atmospheric insert songs often delivers its dynamics where it naturally sucks you in. Even the OP and ED theme songs are highly stylistic too. The OP song \u201cHello World\u201d by Bump of Chicken is a testament to the characteristics of the show. Meanwhile, we also have a very catchy ED theme that dances with the tunes. Finally, there\u2019s the character voice mannerisms. With such a colorful cast, it\u2019s hard to pick which one is the most memorable. A few to name are definitely Zapp\u2019s laidback voice, Klau\u2019s toughness, or White\u2019s curiosity. The concepts of the show often tries to drill whatever it needs to get the point across and character voices are no exception either.\\n\\n\r\nI can safely say that Kekkai Sensen is a ride to remember. Director Rie Matsumoto (known for directing Kyousogiga) skillfully adapts what it needs to deliver this unique and stylistic adaptation. There\u2019s probably more the show can do with its ideas but it has so far nailed all of what it intended to. Whether it\u2019s the dynamic cast of characters, colorful episodic adventures of Leonardo, or the mystery elements of the series itself, there\u2019s always something Kekkai Sensen can give to anyone. This is definitely a show to choose especially if you\u2019re in it for some crazy fun and experience a supernatural New Yorky vision.",

The songs of both season one and two were good and so was the artstyle. But I just didn't enjoy it that much. I think mostly that is because of how we get a ton of charcters in the show, but none of them seem to have been worked out. Whenever something new is going to happen in the story, they add new characters that never come back in the show.  \r\nOverall I'd just say that the character development was very poor for this show.It had a lot of potential but it never made me eager for the next episode.

This isn't a spoiler, but basically the character in question is a b****, for a lack of a better word. The dialogues centered around him are dumb, to say the least.\r\nI'll give youan idea of what I'm talking about. Say you have a friend who's sort of like you, except he has an amazing talent for music. This talent would be everything you've dreamed of, but you don't have it.

            "content": "It has been one great ride through Kekkai Sensen. This review is spoiler free because frankly saying, you won't get much out of reading synopsis or various spoiler reviews. You have to watch this anime to know it (much like any anime actually).\r\nThe context of this Anime is simple. However it is delivered in a more eccentric fashion that is somewhat hard to get into at first. Nevertheless, once you get on the ride, you won't want it to stop.\r\nStory: 7/10. The story is not out of the box from what I have experienced. Superhuman organization, evil plans, something that always pulls the protagonist intotrouble. It's all familiar. With that being said it kept pulling me in because the anime is giving me only bit by bit with each episodes, keeping me guessing. This is also the problem that is why it can't get a better score. It is not everybody's cup of tea to have to go through a series without knowing the full context of it from the first chapter.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9/10. The art is superb. Fighting scenes are smooth and satisfying. Background is detailed and the general style fit its story. Character designs are all highly detailed and good looking.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10/10. The sound is notably the BEST part of this series, and probably this Season. Everything from ambient sounds, background music to Open and Ending songs are well done, with the exception of some of the masterpiece of this season. Never have I been so eager to purchase the OST of an anime when it has just got released. All the songs are jazzy, catchy and when put into the scenes, it makes perfect compliment with the anime. I have to repeat that this is without a doubt, in my opinion the best sound design of the season, and maybe even this year.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 8/10. Character are designed fairly well. Each character is well established, with their unique (sorta) power and their own involvement in the story. There is very little character development however, besides from the relationship between the protagonist and his co-worker. That being said, some characters are still memorable and worthwhile to watch.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10. I'm not very picky about enjoyment, unless it is over the top ridiculous. This is an absolutely enjoyable anime to watch, partly for the great sound design and partly for a very well made anime. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9/10. I like this anime and I enjoyed it. However it has its flaws and lets be real here, nothing is perfect. This should have been a 8/10 but I give it a plus for its masterpiece sound design (mentioning it again).\\n\\n\r\nNote that this anime is not for everyone. Its story pacing might troubles some people.",

            "content": "Kekkai Sensen/Blood Blockade Battlefront Review \r\nStory (6/10) Fair\r\nThe story of Kekkai Sensen was fair, nothing uber complex, mind blowing or even addiction to get into in my personal opinion. But the story definitely wasn't bad. There were quite a few episodes that definitely felt like filler/episodic episodes some where good and some where just straight up irrelevant. But the overall story I though was fine.\r\nArt and Animation (10/10) Outstanding\r\nStudio Bones could not have done a better job at adapting this anime. The key animation done by Bahi JD the same dude responsible for the amazingly key animations for Space Dandy did his thing forKekkai Sensen it's outstanding and I wish the guy was in charge for everything anime's animation I was watching because it's probably the reason I even gave the show a chance, the trailer before the anime came out and episode 1 sold me and it was mostly because of the art style and animation Bones and Bahi JD brought to the table. \\n\\n\\n\r\nSound (7/10) Good\\n\\n\r\nThe sound for Kekkai Sensen was good. No BGMs that made my spin tingle or anything but the opening was catchy and the voice acting both JP and Eng Dub I thought were good. Everything sound related was all around good. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters (6/10)\\n\r\nMore Specifically (6.75/10) Fine  \\n\\n\r\nThe characters in Kekkai Sensen were fine, interesting since episode on especially how well they were introduced. Majority of the cast are all more interesting than the MC himself and I wish we got more characterization on everyone but him honestly. Overall though I felt we didn't necessarily get that much characterization from any character in the anime through out it's 12 episodes because like I said before majority of these episodes were episodic/filler episodes and if there was any character that probably got a good characterization (but still not enough for me to be satisfied) was Klaus. Zapp got a little bit, didn't care too much for the MC and would have love to see more of Zed, but the season ended so oh well.\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (6/10) Fair\\n\r\nMore Specifically (6.5/10) \\n\\n\r\nWith all the nice things I had to say about Kekkai Sensen up to this point my enjoyment is sitting at a 'fine'. The anime has a heavy focus on it's comedy aspect as one of it's key selling points and it didn't sit too well with me. The only episode that got me cackling was the episode where Zapp was stealing the MC's food but that didn't last too long either. Another thing that is an enjoyment selling point that the anime brings thanks to Bones and Bahi JD is the animation. The art style and animation on the bloodmoves and the little fighting choreography were all stunning I wish we got more that only gave of tiny bits of it and focus more on the comedy which I said didn't sit to well. The story didn't sit too well with me either and the episodic/filler episodes like I said before weren't that entertaining to me.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall (7/10) \\n\r\nMore Specifically (7.25/10)\\n\\n\r\nKekkai Sensen was a good anime but that's as much as I can get it. Episode one was hype and promising but after that it was episodic and filler episodes invested and like i said earlier those didn't sit well with me. The story I felt didn't really go anywhere, they had one episode that had to do with Vampires or something and I thought that was interesting but ultimately was ignored the next episode. I started Kekkai Sensen as soon as the subs dropped I was there day 1 ready and as far as I remember i stayed caught up weekly (I think I may have fallen behind once but was caught up majority of the time) and when that last episode took like FOREVER AND A DAY to come out I obviously put the anime 'On Hold' because I'm just not going to let it sit there in my watching section when I not really watching it. And when that final episode finally came out I didn't even feel like watching it right away because all of the disappointing things I remembered that bothered me about this anime started to rise. It was only till today after looking at my \"On Hold\" section that I decided to finish this shit off and I've heard that this last episode was worth it... it really wasn't.. But that's not taking away from the animation which I think is the saving point of this anime. With a mediocre story it kept it afloat and is probably the reason why it's still around a 7 to me but no more than that..",

            "content": "PLEASE NOTE: This review was written before any episode past episode 11 a.k.a. episode 12 a.k.a. \"Paint It Black\". If this has more episodes past this one, I won't be updating this review.\r\nKekkai Sensen, otherwise known as \"Blood Blockade Battlefront\", is an action comedy with lots of supernatural themes and elements. The show's stylish and fast-paced artwork and comedy lead you through scenes between intense supernatural fights involving anything from a man-eating car to vampires.\r\nSTORY: 6/10\r\nThe story involves our protagonist, young impersonator of Pokemon's Brock, named Leonardo Watch. He was born with special eyes that have superpowers of some sort and is accidentally thrown intothe world of the underground organization known as Libra, who fight to protect the citizens of the city they live in from disaster and ruin.\\n\\n\r\nOnly one problem: The city's bonkers. There's so many different strange creatures, no two seem alike, and a lot of them are hostile. This leads to the city being hectic, dangerous, and crime-filled. When I said that Libra is a group of people who fight evil, they're more like a secret police squad. If it doesn't involve illegal activity, they don't bat an eye at the actions of the townsfolk.\\n\\n\r\nThe story claims to have an overarching plot, but  for the most part it is one or two-part episodes while the main villains in the background have a giggle at the goings on. That's not to say all the episodes are like this, but for the most part the episode involves the group having to do something totally unrelated in order to gain a tiny bit of information which may or may not take any part in what's going on in the next episode.\\n\\n\r\nART: 7/10\\n\r\nWhen not in combat or making a joke, the animation and art style can be quite generic. Action scenes have lots of flair, lots of flash, and a lot of personality. Comedic moments reminded me of One Piece, in the way that faces could simplify, become jagged, or distort in order to further the comedy of the show. The alien beings can be very unique and strange, bringing lots of personality to the background characters or the rare side character for a one-off episode or two.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND: 6/10\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is somewhat generic, with a tad bit of flair, but to be honest it didn't really stick with me. The OP is good and the ED is decent, though I prefer to watch it more for the visuals than the song itself.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER: 6/10\\n\r\nHere's where the show, to me, feels bloated and highly flawed. The show's current episodes, up to \"Paint It Black\", are filled to the brim with character introductions. We also don't get much development from our protagonist besides the backstory that is repeated a few times within the show. I wouldn't have a problem with a show with this many characters, but to be honest it felt like I would rather have had development of our current characters instead of constant introductions to new ones just so that they don't appear again, or if they do, appear once.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT: 4/10\\n\r\nI hated \"Paint it Black\", which is as far as we have so far. To refer to this as a \"finale\", it is one of the worst I've ever seen. Along with constant character introductions that made me wish for more protagonist or main character building or plot development, and the plot itself being decent to boring, it became a bit of a chore to sit through, even though it had a decent beginning.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL: 6/10\\n\r\nA fairly average show with several things bogging it down, but occasionally nice-looking fight scenes. Once this gets more episodes, I would recommend you check it out because it will most likely continue with what we have now that all the characters are introduced, but until then you should probably avoid it.",

            "content": "This is my first review on MAL, let me tell you this series is extremely overrated for a few reasons. \r\n1. It is another show where people yell out their moves when the fight.\r\n2. They went through all the trouble to make such a great world and great side characters. Then they throw a whiny baby in as the main character that has \"special eyes\" and that is his only strong suit. He has a few comedic moments in the show but other than that he is a terrible character.\r\n3. The \"villain\" has no motivation other than causing havoc and the finale just leaves somuch open without another season. At this point if there was another season I would not watch it.\\n\\n\r\nNow here is what the anime got right.\\n\\n\r\n1. Art style, fantastic different take that didn't have characters with big eyes. They took a different approach and I liked the end result, Heck the main character rarely has his eyes open. \\n\\n\r\n2. Sound design. Fantastic, intro and outro songs are also really good.\\n\\n\r\n3. The side characters. They are fantastic and you will laugh a lot during the show at how the side characters play off of one another and the main character.\\n\\n",

            "content": "3 things will greatly affect your enjoyment of Kekkai Sensen. Number one is how much you crave a new story, and are tired of the same High School/harem light novel adaptations that come up every season. Number two is if you enjoy being given lots of bits of information that allow you to piece together a larger plot. Number three is if you enjoy fast paced and constantly changing camera shots and point of view changes. If you don't mind or even enjoy those types of things, you are gonna have even more of a blast with this show. \r\nStory 6- While it pains meto give a show with such good and funny writing a 6 in story, the way much of the exposition is told is all over the place, and occasionally paced very badly. Kekkai Sensen takes a very episodic approach to it's story, with no real 'major' plot happening until the last 3 episodes. In all honesty, much of Kekkai Sensen reminds of the show 'Seinfeld', in that much of it is, 'a show about nothing'. The majority of episodes are just fun world exploration/building, with the central idea being anything from fighting vampires, taking down drug dealers, underground fighting rings, and taking down Monster Trucks the size of a city block. \\n\r\nThe genius and also downfall of Kekkai Sensen's story telling is how quick and concise it is. Characters often drop quick bits of info that on their don't tell us much, but when all these bits are placed together, they make a consistent and intriguing story of this world. The problem is that there is a STAGGERING amount of information that Kekkai Sensen throws at the viewer, often intermixed with action and humor that make retaining these bits of info near impossible. Episodes 4 and 10 are good examples of both the good and the bad aspects of Kekkai Sensen's storytelling. Overall Kekkai Sensen's story is incredibly deep and shows huge amounts of promise, but the way it's presented needs to be approached a bit more carefully and equally proportioned out.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters 7: Easily my favorite aspect of Kekkai Sensen, I think a lot of people will be turned off by them because of the way their character stories are told. Kekkai Sensen rarely, if ever, does the typical flashback to show a characters past, and almost never devotes an episode to a single characters arc (Which is a good thing, because it does that in episode 11 and feels reeeaaallllyyy boring and slow). Instead the characters past is given mostly through conversation and interaction with others. In short, the characters come fully developed, and we learn that through their actions rather than through monologues. The obvious downside to this is that the guys who get little to no screen time feel really under-utilized, and that kind of becomes a problem when you have a cast as large as this shows crammed into 12 episodes. Despite this, the cast is all likable and have very defined and unique personalities/design to them, so it's never hard to tell them apart. \\n\\n\r\nArt 9: Rewatchability. Just...Rewatchability. Kekkai Sensen does what very, very few anime have ever done for me, in that I will buy the DVD's just for the animation itself. The key to that? I feel like i'm watching a live action set, with all sorts of things happening in the background. No expense was spared in this regard, as there is almost always something interesting going on in the background. Sitting in a diner? The window will show the traffic passing by. In a room full of partying people? You'll see an entire drunken skit in the background. The only negative I can give this category is that there are a few minor scenes where characters look like they were drawn in a hurry, and because of the frantic activity that takes place in most shots, scenes that have little background and few moving objects will feel strangely lifeless.\\n\r\nQuick word of warning, Kekkai Sensen uses lot's of different camera shots and frame changes. What this means is that you'll constantly be exposed to different points of view over the course of a normal conversation. This can be disorienting at times since the animation is so richly detailed that you'll constantly have your eye wandering and losing track of the conversations. I personally love this as that means I can see something new overtime I go back to watch the show, but some might not enjoy this technique very much.\\n\\n\r\nSound 10: I feel a little weird giving a category that is completely, 100% dependent on personal taste, but I have no idea what else to do. The opening and ending are just so far above and beyond what I expect from most anime. They actually evoke feelings of nostalgia, happiness, melancholy and whatever else you might interpret from it. As for the OST? just listen to 'Catch Me if You Can' and 'White Gloves (Vocal Version)\". If you listen to those two and don't like them, you won't like the soundtrack. Also I am of the opinion that your are a tone-deaf bastard :D\\n\r\nIf you prefer dubs over subs, then boy are you in luck. The dub nails the two most important parts of being a dub, getting the right voice for the right character, and not following the japanese script word for word. In short, Leo sounds like Leo, Zapp sounds like Zapp. The first episode sounds a little lackluster, but every episode afterwards is full of dynamic ranges of emotion, and the script was translated nicely into English, with some phrase changes made to better accommodate the humor.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 10: While I attempted to be impartial in my above scores, the fact of the matter is that I am hopelessly a fanboy of this show. I mentioned at the beginning of this review that one of the defendant factors is how sick you are of 'current' anime trends. That was a little vague and kind of unfair. There are a number of shows that fall under those categories that I liked (No Pet no Kanojo, Campione!), but it's undeniable that there are just SO MANY of these shows that are released each season that don't attempt to do anything but tick a list of checkboxes, and are a criminal waste of really intriguing base material in favor of cliches so damn common I'm amazed people still like them. So when a show like Kekkai Sensen comes along and gives so many of those tropes a giant middle finger, and also happens to be really good, I can;y help but feel extra grateful towards that series for taking the plunge and trying to do something different from the rest of the pack.",

            "content": "So here's an anime that I thoroughly enjoy. First review so... let the hate come. Also, this is a review for the 6 episodes I have seen, so I'll only go over what I know from those episodes only.\r\nStory\r\nThe story of Kekkai Sensen (Blood Blockade Battlefront) is a confusing one, especially considering that at the start of episode 1, we see Leo's sister with her eyes open. When later on, it's said that she is now blind. I guess it'll be revealed as the story goes on, but there really is no story. \r\nAll there really is, is just a bunch of random things thatLeo has done with his group, Libra. It feels as if the anime is going nowhere. There's nothing to hint plot advances or just anything important to plot at all.\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt/ Animation\\n\\n\r\nI like this animation. Mute colors in New York City and very colorful everywhere else. Character designs are very cool and intriguing.  There's not much I can give here really, since I am not very good at analysing things like this \\n\\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\\n\r\nThe sound/songs are great! The ED especially, it has a jazzy-dance feel, kinda like how Death Parade did. All the background songs fit perfectly and are well-placed. Take for example a perfectly timed Ode to Joy when Klaus beats Don at Prosfair. Other than that though, there's not much else I can say. It's the same as Art/Animation.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are a very nice mesh of everything that is likeable. Klaus Von Reinherz for example, is a true gentleman, but has considerable strength, and the most brutal blood technique known to man. While Zapp Renfro is a sleaze who is a master of the Big Dipper blood technique. \\n\\n\r\nHow the characters interact with each other is hilarious as well, being told from Leo's point of view shows us how the residents of Kekkai Sensen's New York are accustomed to their unusual life, while Leo is wide-eyed as to how anybody can get used to anything here. \\n\\n\r\nSlowly though, over time, it has gotten a little bit more serious and Leo is slowly adjusting to life here in New York. \\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall\\n\\n\r\nThis is a great anime to watch, though it may still not suit you, which is fine. The music is perfectly timed and blends in well with how the anime is set up. The characters are vibrant and how they interact with each other is hilarious. I'm still enjoying this anime very well and can easily say I eagerly wait for the next episode. Though the story is confusing, it does make up for it with the characters and music.",

            "content": "This Review won't contain any spoilers.\r\nKekkai Sensen was a show I was really looking forward to, it was one of those anime which took a lot from the west in it's style and setting and shows like that (for example Baccano! Bebop etc) tend to be some of my favourite shows. This show unfortunatley failed to deliver on substance, it had a lot of style, but without character depth and a coherent story line this show ultimatly fell flat.\r\nStory (3/10)\r\nNothing about the premise is bad, the story looks like it can go in interesting directions and the place it is set has a lot ofpotential, but the story falls flat in the way it is written and presented.\\n\\n\r\nThe story never felt coherent, it is always jumping around, cutting here and there which made the show feel very jarring. That unfortunately isn' the only thing wrong with how it is told, it is also badly written with little to no explanation of what's going on and why a characters is doing something, in short the plot is very convoluted . I think this lack of explanation and all the jumping around wouldn't be so bad if the story wasn't important to this show. Some of the episodic stories get along fine because it is self contained and you could just get along with enjoying the action/comedy.\\n\\n\r\nBut neither of these aspects where strong enough on their own to make this show very good and towards the end when they try and focus on the story more, it just made the show worse as it just becomes even more blatant how poorly written it was.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters (4/10)\\n\r\nThe characters to this anime all have great design, they all look bad ass with cool clothes and personalities, they are all fun to watch. My main problem is that this anime just gives them style, they are really cool, but there is no substance to them, there is little to no development and only a small amount of characterisation. This is true for all the characters unfortunately, I don't think there is an exception to this.\\n\\n\r\nFor a specific example let's take the main protagonist Leornado who was a pretty generic and uninteresting character as he didn't have much too him and he was useless for most of the series. The only thing interesting about him to me was his eyes and not his character, it was the fact that he had his mystical eyes which made him special. My point with this is that of course you can have an average Joe get powers, that in itself could be relatable but this trait defined him too much simply because he had no personality, no depth, no development there wasn't much to him at all, he is completly forgetable and the only thing significant thing is just the fact that he had special eyes.\\n\\n\r\nI feel this is the same case with the rest of the cast, they have a bit more energy and life to them than the MC, but the show didn't do anything with them. They felt stagnant and had little to them for the whole show and they were defined by only a few personality traits.\\n\\n\r\nSound/Animation (8/10, 8/10)\\n\r\nThe show has a brilliant opening and ending, in fact the ending to this anime is probably one of my favourites, I very rarely even sit through an ending let alone look forward to when it's played. The OST for the show was really good aswell, it plays a huge variety of classic and iconic songs aswell as its own orignals, and it all fitted with the scenes for the most part and I felt they did add to the experience making what was going on screen better because of the music. The sound track to me was the most well done part of the series.\\n\\n\r\nThe Animation looked very good aswell, it was one of the better animated series in the spring season. On a more general basis I wouldn't rank the animation as a amazing as I wouldn't say the animation ranks with the top animated series I have seen, but the animation was top notch and as far as I can tell pretty consistent (I am bad at noticing quality drops though).\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (4/10)\\n\r\nIt has a lot of cool and crazy action and an awesome sound track but the mess which is the plot did ruin my enjoyment of the series. This series also did have comedy moments, but I wouldn't consider many funny, i only remember laughing to the pizza scene in episode 2, the rest of the time it tried to pull comedic moments wasn't that great and I felt it took me out of the moment, especially in the last episode where the MC was supposed to be trying to save the city, yet they would pull some comedic scenes which would ruin the mood.\\n\r\nI did enjoy watching this at times but it had too many things dragging it down for me to really enjoy it, it had its moments, but they where just moments, I didn't enjoy the majority of the show.\\n\\n\r\nConclusion (5/10)\\n\r\nAs said before this is a style no substance show, it has awesome designs, settings and sound, but a messy plot with no character depth. Which is a shame as with all the style this show had I wish it could of done more with it. In my opinion I would skip this show, it just isn't worth your time, it had potential but it turned out to be mediocre.",

            "content": "Kekkai Sensen!\r\nI like to compare this show to a stereotypical American. It literally does whatever the fuck it wants.\r\nThis show is pretty outrageous with its everything. Its story is just completely out of this world, and in my honest opinion, it's pretty hard to follow. I don't mean that in a \"it's incredibly thought provoking\" way, I mean't that in a \"basically nothing makes sense\" kind of way. Read the Disqus comment section of each Kekkai Sensen episode on Kissanime, and you'll see countless comments asking \"what the fuck happened?\"\r\nWhile the overall story line itself is fairly lackluster and a chore to follow, Kekkai Sensenexcels splendidly in the portrayal of its world. I am a New Yorker (well, I live like half an hour away from the city), so I know what the city looks like. This show captured the atmosphere and design of New York City incredibly well, and it was a blast seeing the familiar sights, like Central Park and the Empire State Building. Despite the completely outrageous version of New York City, filled with these alien things and supernatural phenomenon, the show went the extra mile to make the city still feel... real... to some extent.\\n\\n\r\nKekkai Sensen captures what New York City is really all about, and that is cultural diffusion! New York City has a bit of everything from everywhere, and this show was a great over exaggeration on the diversity of New York City. This is shown to a greater extent through some of the amusing situations that the characters get themselves into, such as trying to find a suitable restaurant (NYC is filled to the brim with restaurants), as well as interacting with so many different characters, both human and non-human.\\n\\n\r\nRemember when I said Kekkai Sensen does whatever the fuck it wants to? Well that's because this show has balls. Really big ones. It makes its whole world feel real through borderline copyright infringement material. It introduces stuff like Hainz Ketchup (with basically identical bottle design), Yo! Tube (which is probably the most accurately depicted version of YouTube in anime), and other little easter eggs that always bring a smirk to my face. Kekkai Sensen is incredibly fun to watch due to its attention to the details of its world.\\n\\n\r\nAnd... that's about it. Everything else about Kekkai Sensen was ok. Besides the hard to follow story, the art and animation were definitely good, but nothing particularly special. The characters have a lot of spunk to them, and go through some development, but they don't hold the long lasting impact that I like characters to have. Leo has cool eyes, and has an amusing personality, but in the end, he's almost like a not-so-pussy version of Shinji. However, he is a unique protagonist to the Shounen genre, as he has a unique power but it doesn't feel overpowered at all compared to the rest of the cast.\\n\\n\r\nSo overall, Kekkai Sensen was fun due to its world building, humor, and attention to detail, but it is also boring when it comes to the main story line. There were many points where I was constantly checking to see how much time was left in an episode. But, there were also times when time flew by due to some of the hilarious scenarios that the characters end up getting caught in.\\n\\n\r\nTL;DR: The ED dance is literally the best part of this series.",

They animated many anime that made it to the top charts and each anime has a very individual art style while maintaining a studio Bones animationvibe which is pretty nice.\\n\\n\r\nWith that said, I\u2019ll move on to the story.\\n\\n\r\nStory 7/10\\n\\n\r\nThe anime had a very interesting first episode in my opinion. It began with a \u2018teaser\u2019 intro as I like to call it in which a short scene of the character\u2019s past/future is shown. This approach is not exactly original but genericity is never a bad thing, at least in my opinion though being original will definitely give a better impression.\\n\\n\r\nWe start off with an introduction to the world our characters are living in and an explanation to the eldritch setting the anime had. \\n\\n\r\nSupersonic monkeys, vampires, talking fishmen, and all sorts of different supernatural monsters living alongside humans\u2014this has been part of daily life in Hellsalem's Lot, formerly known as New York City, for some time now. When a gateway between Earth and the Beyond opened three years ago, New Yorkers and creatures from the other dimension alike were trapped in an impenetrable bubble and were forced to live together. Libra is a secret organization composed of eccentrics and superhumans, tasked with keeping order in the city and making sure that chaos doesn't spread to the rest of the world.\\n\\n\r\nPursuing photography as a hobby, Leonardo Watch is living a normal life with his parents and sister. But when he obtains the \"All-seeing Eyes of the Gods\" at the expense of his sister's eyesight, he goes to Hellsalem's Lot in order to help her by finding answers about the mysterious powers he received. He soon runs into Libra, and when Leo unexpectedly joins their ranks, he gets more than what he bargained for. Kekkai Sensen follows Leo's misadventures in the strangest place on Earth with his equally strange comrades\u2014as the ordinary boy unwittingly sees his life take a turn for the extraordinary.\\n\\n\r\nWith that, we are immersed in what seemed like an episodic pantomime. However, the anime soon redeemed itself by more or less explaining the current situation our hero is in through details and explanations in a series of episodic episodes featuring new creatures and cool fight scenes with an array of well animated scenes each episode despite the contrasting dark urban setting.\\n\\n\r\nI actually really love the dark urban look the anime had, it brings in a sort of gothic look and blends well with the unique, unearthly design the setting in the anime had.\\n\\n\r\nEach episode we get introduced to a new character and develop with the few main characters along the way with each episode throwing us hints and new questions that keeps us craving for more.\\n\\n\r\nWe were first introduced to Leo\u2019s comrades-to-be, a run down of Leo\u2019s current situation resonating with why he wanted to join his \u2018comrades\u2019 and a slight snippet of his backstory while being contemporaneous with explaining the setting the anime was in and what the organisation (Libra) does.\\n\\n\r\nThe explanations were conveyed in an episodic manner as I said above and each episodes features a new enemy and/or a new supporting character that may or may not be important in future episodes. A few characters had secrets that would be uncovered in later episodes making them interesting.\\n\\n\r\nThe main reason why this anime is bad is because the storyline is poorly blended together. The anime started off episodic providing snippets of explanations to the general situation to build towards the main plot but ended up getting clusterfucked at the end.\\n\\n\r\nThe anime also featured a form of mild-romance where two characters understood and liked each other but it got clusterfucked with the main plot at the end when the \u2018potential waifu and best girl\u2019, White or Mary did something unimaginable. There was so much room for a romantic development but sadly the two only managed to get to a close friend stage...\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 9/10\\n\\n\r\nI loved every character here in all honestly. Let\u2019s start off with poster boy Leo\\n\\n\r\nLeonardo Watch: To be honest, I watched BBB because the Leo looks freaking cool like those Isekai protagonist and I was expecting to see a cool little kid that had these cool looking eyes that has some cool power and with a tough, prideful personality. Leo was none of those, he was a kid with problems he can\u2019t solve and questions he can\u2019t find the answers to. He\u2019s hopeless, wimpy, gentle and kind.\\n\r\nA very soft personality living in a hard and harsh world. This gave uniqueness to the anime and a tinge of originality. He has a deep background and despite all his problems, he is still kind and trustworthy sort of like Naruto, he is trustable and would always help a friend in need. Not to mention he possesses a powerful innate ability that is wanted by all making him develop more through getting involved in many un-welcomed situations .\\n\\n\r\nZapp Renfro: Everyone would think he\u2019s the badass when he made his first appearance, Zapp is interesting because when he\u2019s fighting he really is a complete badass but outside, he\u2019s a scheming, obnoxious, idiotic, perverted bum. He\u2019s lazy and likes to boss Leo around which makes him extremely hilarious because the other characters, the members of Libra to be exact don\u2019t seem to show much respect to him knowing his nature to be as such. He is particularly hostile towards Chain which looks cut more like a badass hot female character and seeing them quarrel is golden. Zapp\u2019s unique personality also involves him always getting into trouble and causing them making him the shrewd, unaccountable, nuisance of the group which just adds a lot of life to the anime.\\n\\n\r\nKlaus Von Reinherz: He has a very unique character design looking like a werewolf in my opinion which really fits his beastly personality.  Also, Klaus just proves another thing about this anime, it seems to like to use ridiculously long names since this is America apparently. I have no idea why the names are so long and french sounding though. Klaus is the true badass in my opinion and the real deal in the anime. He has a very well-curated personality being kind yet harsh at the same time. A very fitting personality for a leader. Klaus is very respectable and ruthless at the same time, he knows when to act on what and that just makes him Super Cool to watch!\\n\\n\r\nSteven A. Starphase & K.K. : These two seem to always be working together so I\u2019ll put them together. Steven is a very casually funny character being extremely chill with even the \u2018should be life-threatening\u2019 situations making him a very fun character to watch, he also displayed a fair share of badassery when using his ice powers. On the other hand, K.K is dressed like a complete badass with a very mature, hot and overall badass character design like Maiya Hisau from Fate/Zero she\u2019s a professional badass.\\n\\n\r\nMary McBeth (White): This is the cute girl that I thought would play a big part in the romance life of Leo. When I first met her I knew she was going to be that cute waifu. First, let me just say that White is very cute, her blonde hair and her emerald green eyes. Despite her outfit normally being plain white, it still suits her very well. Mary is a girl that resembles Leo in many aspects, she has a brother like Leo, she\u2019s \u2018weak\u2019 in the sense that she cannot protect her brother and her brother protected her by sacrificing himself like Leo and his sister however, what I liked about the anime is that despite the ending being clusterfucked for Mary when she hopelessly betrayed him and got betrayed and brutally stabbed by her \u2018own brother\u2019 the anime showed that Mary was like Leo however, Leo would never betray his friends. Leo despite being betrayed, tried to understand Mary\u2019s side and even cried for her. \\n\r\nIt was really messed up and despite the fandom hating her for her betrayal, I feel it isn\u2019t her fault, she didn\u2019t know what to do and family came first for her, she wasn\u2019t given a choice and unfortunately got fucked over in the end as well. It\u2019s saddening that such a cute girl that had such a cute personality was holding such an enormous burden and despite being a coward and betraying her friend, she ended up bravely redeeming herself by helping save the world. \\n\\n\r\nWilliam McBeth, King of Despair (Black): An extremely unique main antagonist. Kudos to Rie Kugimiya for doing such a great job voice acting and maintaining a different persona for both Mary, Will and the King of Despair.\\n\r\nWill is probably the most unique out of all. He had a very harsh background and is a very kind-hearted kid but an unfortunate incident was brought upon him. The King of Despair. That evil bastard took control of the brave and kind-hearted Will that was just protecting his sister. It was very harsh for both Mary and Will, Will especially since he wants to protect Mary but has no control and recollection of anything when the King of Despair is possessing him. I\u2019ll just call him Black. Black is unique because the anime used a split personality to portray two separate characters in one. To further identify a difference, the King of Despair would push his hair back and look very evil and murderous while Will was cute and soft spoken. The two personalities/characters are very discrete but sadly, the King of Despair is ruthless and heartless. He took advantage of Will and even betrayed his promise to Will. He left Will and Mary with no choice to be honest, a very heartless personality fit for someone as evil as himself.\\n\\n\r\nWill on the other hand is very relatable to Leo, he\u2019s kind and gentle. He wants to and did protect the person he loved but got fucked over to the max which was just saddening. He is friendly and easy going like Leo however Will is way too kind and also too gullible and easy to manipulate. I love his kindness but just doesn\u2019t work in the world he\u2019s living in...\\n\r\nIn the end, he was still saved by his sister and by Leonardo.\\n\\n\r\nAligura: A psychopathic girl with an extremely unique voice! Also she has a very unique character design wearing a mask with an eye.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound 10/10\\n\\n\r\nDo listen to the anime\u2019s exquisite choice of classical music! \\n\\n\r\nA wide assortment was included from Beethoven to some jazzy classical tunes to some hallow christly music, fantastic.\\n\\n\r\nExcept that the 2nd last episode, the ED really didn\u2019t fit well.",

I have to say they did a great job wrapping things up, sticking with the same themes of the previous eleven episodes: life and love; friendship and belonging; teamwork andcooperation, which prevail even on the darkest night since the First Collapse.\\n\\n\r\nAlso, the OP and ED is pretty sweet.

            "content": "This anime confused me to the core. It confused from the first episode and just when I was getting the hang of it, it confused me at the end as well. I had all these questions that I didn't know where to get all the answers from. For everyone's interests, I will keep this review SPOILER FREE. \r\nAll right... Let's take it from the start:\r\nYou can read the anime description to get a feel of it from the anime page, but I will tell you how I understood the plot. The anime takes place in another land, in a city called Hellsalem Lot. Formerly knownas New York City until a certain event transpired which made our world collide with another and now all sorts of creatures are trapped with humans within the borders of this city which is protected by a barrier of sorts. So for 3 years, they tried to get along and live with each other. Meanwhile, an organisation called 'Libra' is formed to punish evildoers [usually non-humans] and there is another organisation that caused evil. Think Justice and Injustice League kind of. Our main character, Leo, goes to this city to understand more his newly obtained ability \"All-seeing Eyes of the Gods\".\\n\\n\r\nFrom the plot alone the show seemed promising to me and I watched the first episode. In very few words it was about Leo going to the city, meeting the Justice League... I mean... Libra, and because they liked his ability they recruited him; along with his monkey kind-of, sort-of sidekick. I think my explanation was fairly straight forward. Here is my problem though: the anime has a problem...  Well, a few actually and they are big ones. The tone, narrative and pacing are all over the place. The narrative especially is very unfocused and left me scratching my head and scream 'Explain. For the love of GOD, explain.\" It stopped, then continued somewhere else and then went somewhere. Meanwhile, the events didn't really connect at all or had no purpose to them.\\n\r\nIt would be like me trying to write this review and midway announcing I'm going for ice cream or something, only to come back five minutes later and changing my mind to wanting a waffle and then realising I had no money to begin with so I'll just stay here and write this review [university life in a nustshell]. But man, I wanted a waffle. Kind to think of it they should still be delivering.\\n\r\n...\\n\\n\r\n...\\n\\n\r\nWhat was I talking about?\\n\\n\r\nRight...\\n\\n\r\n'Kekkai Sensen'\\n\\n\r\nIt caused me a headache to understand it. In the next few episodes, the show relaxed a little bit and we start getting to know some of the characters and to be fair there are many cool characters. They have problems as well but I will explore that in the next paragraph. So episode 2 till 7 or so were more straightforward. Following the 'villain-of-the-week' plot while we established some characterisation and context. Not a lot, but some. I thoroughly enjoyed the episode with Leo and the mushroom that ate burgers. [That's a sentence I didn't think I would say today.] While the climax was approaching though we had more and more problems arising.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters as I said before, and trust me there are a lot of them for a 12 episode show, were there. But they weren't fully fledged and the show didn't give me time to understand their motivations or if they went through a character arc. Just when you are about to understand how a character thinks, talks etc they throw you another one and some times, they never even come back. Hell, the main character goes through stuff at the end and I can't for the life of me tell you if he has changed at all.\\n\\n\r\nThere's so much stuff that wasn't explained either. For example \"What is the great collapse?\", \"What and who was the king of despair?\" \"What was the point of the organisation apart from seeing them 5 times when they did nothing of significance?\". Just uuuugh...\\n\\n\r\nThe final episode was extremely confusing. \\n\\n\r\nGood guy?\\n\r\nCheck.\\n\\n\r\nVillain? \\n\r\nCheck.\\n\\n\r\nA town ready to be destroyed?\\n\r\nCheck.\\n\\n\r\nA motivation for our main character and villain?\\n\r\n....\\n\\n\r\nOh, wait. There is none. Yes, the hero wants to stop the villain and that's motivation enough but... I never understood why the villain did what he did. What he hoped to accomplish? Was it just mayhem for the sake of mayhem? I'm okay with that but I need to know...\\n\\n\\n\r\nMaybe I didn't get it but I saw other reviews and other people were just as confused so I know I'm not the only one.\\n\\n\r\nI'm going to leave this review now as I feel way too confused to continue. Before I stop I want to say there are some good things about the show. The art and soundtrack are extremely nice. When we have the time to get to know the characters they can be fun and I enjoy just chilling and watching them do... well the same. But I feel the anime needed to take a step back and breath and let us do the same as well. A fight between hero and villain can only be awesome if their motivations are clear and I can understand what drives them. Unfortunately, I didn't get that.\\n\\n\r\nFinal thoughts: The anime has a very good soundtrack [seriously loving the ending one]. The animation is pretty and fast paced but unfortunately so is the plot. It's a confusing one and unless I am assured that the second season takes a step back, I think I'm going to skip it.\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Non spoiler review ahead. Going to be a short one. Started this series with high hopes and ended with dropping the second season (my first ever dropped series so far). \r\nThe art is amazing and a pleasure to watch especially in HD on a large screen, so is the sound, very fitting with the scenes at times. Some comedic aspects are nice, the voice acting (japanese) is amazing and of high quality and professionalism. \r\nApart from this, the story is confusing, many things are not explained, the plot is non existent. I tried to understand the series, I mean I did understand symbolism in Madoka,Evangelion, Yuuki Yuna, plots, themes, references etc, but here it just does not make sense. Why zombies appear, why do they slash them why are they in that part of the city, nothing is explained. All of this is flashed on the screen in flashy and high quality art. Maybe I didn't read the manga, but I don't want to read it to understand a series. Action scenes, again there are a few but end quickly, there is no suspense to them either. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters are drawn up nicely, surrounded by great art but that's it, they are very empty to the core. Not even the plot twist at the end is convincing, they are trying to attract sympathy in one episode for a character just because she is a bit more human as a girlfriend (wait, maybe otaku girlfriend, a woman smiling and talking nicely to you does not make it a girlfriend).\\n\\n\r\nI was very disappointing with this series, I expected something else, some sort of plot, at least to make sense near the end. Too bad the art/music and voice acting is wasted. \\n\\n\r\nI wanted to compare with Tales of Zestiria, not that spectacular plot but a lot of eye-candy during battles and static moments, but in the end it would be disrespectful for Tales of Zestiria. \\n\\n\r\nIn the Blood Blocade Battlefront it's the eye candy that is bitter for your mind and sweet for the eyes. But how the mind hurts after this one....",

            "content": "Set in a fictional version of New York, where humans and bizarre monsters live together in not-quite harmony, Kekkai Sensen is one of the most successful shonen series of late. The show follows the adventures of Leonardo Watch, a kid with the gift of super-powered eyes, as he joins Libra, a quirky team of vigilantes who... protect the city\u2026 or stop crime\u2026 or something\u2026 let\u2019s just say exposition is not this show's best suite.\r\nIf there is a thing that can be said about Kekkai Sensen is that it definitely starts with a bang. The first couple of episodes are nonsensical action-packed trips that have mostof their runtime taken by stylized special attacks sequences. The pace is kept high, the tone is always over the top, and the scenes alternate almost in a nonsequitor fashion.\\n\\n\r\nWhile this can be overbearing, it sort of works in its own totally insane way. The true problem comes when, after the first handful of episodes, the pace slows down and the storytelling becomes more straightforwardly delivered. The over the top action sequences, the humour and the rest of the nice stuff is still there, but it is just not that unique or impactful when the series starts taking itself more seriously. This is especially clear in the final couple of episodes, that serve to close a \"macro plot\" that is simply not that interesting or engaging (and to be honest, even a bit hard to fully grasp).\\n\\n\r\nAs it may already have transpired, the best thing about Kekkai Sensen are the overall aesthetics. The visual style is vaguely influenced by western comic books (especially in the design of a couple of characters), the animation is obviously hi-budget and the soundtrack is just great, mixing jazz and orchestral music in a way that truly helps giving the show a unique and interesting tone. And while all this stuff is quite nice, If I had to be completely honest I\u2019d add that there\u2019s not really much else that stands out in the show, as what we are watching is still at its core your standard combat shonen fare, except for the fact that it is delivered in a very slick and unique package. This is not all bad though, as the  short run of the show (a single 12 episodes season) doesn\u2019t really give time to this package to get old, and helps keeping the focus on the series\u2019 strong aspects.\\n\\n\r\nThere's not much else to say about Kekkai Sensen to be honest, it is at its core a product with not many pretenses, if not the one to mindlessly entertain, and it almost succeeds at its goal. The action scenes are fun, the humour not completely awful and the animation flashy and detailed. Sadly the overarching plot is way too weak, making the home stretch a bit of a slug. \\n\\n\r\nStill, not an awful show by any chance\u2026 but let\u2019s just say that I\u2019m not really looking forward to a second season.\\n\\n",

            "content": "Tenth Review - Kekkai Sensen! (or Blood Blockade Battlefront)\r\nThis was a anime that looked pretty good to begin with - a city that exists with human and monsters together. The story revolving around this one lad with these cool looking eyes. \r\nAt first it looked more like a comedy rather than a serious anime yet the more you watched it and let the story unfold you see that this is actually a well structured anime that has serious elements but also bonds together with humour in some areas. \r\nThe story in my opinion at first was a bit rough round the edges and didn't takea major step in any direction, it was about this one kid and his awesome looking eyes but it was jumping from what the story really meant, was it his sister? the monsters? the magic? what? The story didn't really let you know what it's main focus was but slowly unravelled during the series. In all though the story was good in the end and how they portrayed the series to get to the story point was good. \\n\\n\r\nThe art was my favourite in this anime, the art was magnificently done and was shown to be one of the key elements of Kekkai Sensen. When the opening picks up you can see the amount of design it took with the art and as the series goes on the art style is always tied together nicely, not one piece of scene was wasted on poor quality. If it's an anime where you love to watch them for art then this is one of them ones to watch. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters during the series become very likeable, my favourite being the 'Invisible Wolf' Chain. The backgrounds of a few of the characters ain't picked up in the anime as much as the manga however you can still see their traits and characteristics. I love how it did show us the two main character stories of the main focusing characters though so that you wasn't confused, this was nicely done. \\n\\n\r\nAll in all I actually liked Kekkai Sensen, it was a mix of ordinary meets the weird in a city where two have to coexist and live alongside each other in everyday life. It made me actually laugh in some eps when just some random rubbish will happen yet it provides you with more character development and story development in some ways. \\n\\n\r\nThis is one of my favourites and I recommend it to anyone with a likeable side to the random, funny and magical elements to an anime. \\n\\n\r\n~ Canaan",

            "content": "If you're a big fan of Durarara!! you'll definitely enjoy Kekkai Sensen, both having seemingly random episodes focusing on random characters each turn.  \r\nI'll just say this: Kekkai Sensen was definitely one of my favorite anime of 2015, being more unique than others, and other reviewers seem to agree.  Either you'll love it or hate it, since the tangled plot can annoy viewers.  Without further ado, let's get to it!!\r\nStory:5\r\nI personally despised Durarara!!, the plot was boring and the story was bland to me, and Kekkai Sensen fits the same mold yet makes the story in a much more unique way asto make me not want to make a deal with an evil demon to go blind and never be forced to see it again.  The story is interesting, at least.  It follows the whole 'everyone else on the team is way cooler while the main character is a pissbaby sitting back' but is executed in an interesting form.  The only thing really pushing the plot is the action, along with silence from the characters before the viewer is assaulted with a blast of action and whatnot.   I know you've all seen people praising the story for it's directing style, but honestly it felt very elementary in it's storytelling, with nothing relating to each other and even after significant events occurring the anime just forgets about it next episode.  Even with such heavy criticism I just spewed, I loved this anime for giving such heartwarming tales sometimes, I admittedly cried a few times, so even with the disarray you could shed a tear.  \\n\\n\r\nArt:5\\n\\n\r\nThe art was nothing to brag about, the budget seemed to be lower than others with looped animation and stills every episode.  The anime could get pretty impressive once they actually bothers, yet the choppy poorly drawn faces could get distracting.  The big scenes that would move the plot (albeit poorly) were the only moments where the viewer could actually understand how cool this anime could've been if they got more cash.  The action sequences would either work or fail, it mostly depended.  The action sequences can be confusing, since it seems to sometimes have too many things going on at once, yet the creators found every detail necessary.  Sometimes it'd make less sense than watching giant robots duking it out in a Michael Bay film, just leaving the viewer completely lost in the battle until the animators hand got tired and the duelers stop to crack a joke or stare at each other.  \\n\\n\r\nSound:9\\n\\n\r\nThe music was without a doubt the best part of the anime.  Jazz played constantly in the OST's and if I had an album of the soundtrack it'd play on repeat for most of my day.  The opening and endings are great, the opening is decent though the ending is where the real magic is.  Like literally the ending brings a sense of life to the anime and made me stick around as i binge watched the entire series because of the animation and the tone it conveyed.  The music is phenomenal, it has a soundtrack that could easily be compared with that of Cowboy Bebop and deserves a listen, especially if you're into jazz.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:4\\n\\n\r\nSadly, character development is what really kills the anime. If you had to base an anime purely from characters Kekkai Sensen would fail in an instant. Don't let others argue over it, the characters are flat, and never get more than an episode in the spotlight before thrown away forever.  The anime has a very big cast however, but each character that looks even mildly interesting gets thrown away the same episode they're introduced.  The villains are of no exception, the one introduced in the pilot seems to be such a big threat yet when you actually see him again you realize he isn't important in the slightest.  The biggest villain doesn't even get introduced in a decent way, just a hair slick.  But don't get me wrong, the characters have great designs. \\n\r\nLeo is the main character but his entire 'thing' is that he just doesn't care? He just gets thrown around with his dumb little power and everyone else does things for him, and you'd expect him to eventually learn combat or something to actually contribute but he just acts as a genderbent damsel in distress.  \\n\r\nZapp likes eating and is a playa. That's it, that's all he is; him and Leo are buds but Zapp gets a form of a backstory but it's mentioned so briefly that it makes the viewer think \"who cares?\"\\n\r\nThere's others, but Leo and Zapp are pretty much the only two to get more than an episode of development so...y'know.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:8\\n\\n\r\nEven with such crappy scores, I really enjoyed Kekkai Sensen.  I watched the entire series in one sitting, late at night, so maybe my exhaustion is making me look at the series through tired eyes, thinking anything that moved would be cool, but it was still pretty fun.  I'll admit though, I had read a description of it and thought it sounded ridiculous, yet I saw the most fluid bit of animation I saw that month from an anime and decided to try it out.  I usually despise tangled stories, since I think it's just a waste of time, but Kekkai Sensen made me excited to see how they'd try to link the stories (which they failed horribly at).\\n\\n\r\nOverall:6\\n\\n\r\nKekkai Sensen is messy.  The story is underdeveloped and all over the place. Characters are disposable in an instant.  Yet it's pretty fun if you shut off your \"anime superiority\" switch and want to just chill out with something wacky and fun.  Kekkai Sensen is pretty funny and can get emotional if you get deep into it, it'll be either a hit or miss.  Give it a try if you want to try something new, but if you didn't I wouldn't blame you.",

            "content": "It's always hard to express why Kekkai Sensen is easily a 10/10 for me, mostly because I'm aware that it's very subjective. Kekkai Sensen might as well have been made for me. But I'm always sad to see people giving this series 5s or below especially on the front page for it, and so I finally wanted to take the opportunity to write something on its behalf. I will not be breaking it down by categories like many reviews do, because I want to talk about the experience holistically and personally. \r\nI never get tired of watching Kekkai Sensen. Perhaps that's one of the bestthings I can say for it. I've watched the series, subbed and dubbed, probably over ten times. I never rewatch anything. A lot of that can come down to the outstanding voice work, the outstanding animation and, most importantly, the outstanding direction. I will follow Rie Matsumoto wherever she goes. Every thing in this show does its best to remind you that you're watching something. Leo is supposed to be the observer of everything after all, and the anime adaptation holds on to that idea. We see things through cameras frequently, and the characters even dance for us in the ED. They don't hide the stage here, and that choice allows them to up the ante stylistically until the show is bursting with cool. Kekkai Sensen is easily one of the coolest shows ever made\\n\\n\r\nNow, if you're looking for a deep story full of lore and mysteries, rife for theorizing and packed with twists, Kekkai Sensen is not for you. Stuff happens because it puts the characters in fun scenarios and allows you to learn more about them. The narrative thread of White and Black added by Matsumoto gives you just enough of a narrative to hold the vignettes together while still following the themes of family and incorporating some of the monsters (Blood Breeds and the 13 Kings specifically) already introduced by Kekkai Sensen's manga. White and Black also give a quieter sounding board for Leo, allowing his character to shine through. \\n\\n\r\nBut mostly, I want to talk about Leo, because he's the reason that I love the show so dearly. It's easy to dismiss him as another one of those shonen heroes who are nothing remarkable and yet have super cool adventures. But that's just how Leo sees himself. He sees himself as worthless, because he thinks that his kindness, curiosity, and bravery are just the stuff that everyone is made up of. Him being able to find his worth through the influence of people around him who see him as he actually is- that's a worthwhile story, no pun intended. Mob Psycho 100, another show I love, touches on this theme as well. Everybody is just as special as anybody else, whether they can fight with their blood, see into the farthest depths of reality, or even if they just have a deep love of burgers.\\n\\n\r\nYou should watch Kekkai Sensen only if you're okay not having all the answers. It's effortlessly fun while still giving you things to think about- only the things you can think about are hate, love, and family, and the way we treat each other instead of guessing plot points or anything like that. The anime focuses more on the characters, the setting, and the themes than the narrative which is what I prefer in a show anyway. Both the sub and the dub are great-if you have trouble focusing with subs, the dub really works well.\\n\\n\r\nI know this review has been a bit emotional, but I hope it has expressed just how much I adore this show and why you should give it a chance. Just let yourself have fun, be moved, be awed. They're on the stage for you, so let yourself be entertained.",

            "content": "For all the deserved and undeserved criticism it gets, Kekkai Sensen is, undeniably, one of the more unique shows to come out the past few years. And that is a good thing; a great breather from all the repeat-process shows coming out nowadays.\r\nKekkai Sensen is about a group called Libra, an underground society charged with protecting Alien-Infested New York + Some magic. Now, I don't know about you, but that sounds pretty cool.\r\nBut does it live up to its uniqueness? Its aforementioned criticism? \r\nStory (4/10)\r\nKekkai Sensen is an episodic anime; meaning, 'villain of the week' or similar stories along those lines. Some people hate it,some people love it and being a slice of life junkie, I quite enjoy these kind of stories. But being episodic, it's something I can't really review unless I take down every single episode and analyze it in detail. Instead, let's look at the main plot and it... doesn't look so good. Though the show does very well to set up the villains, clues and the threat it has on our main characters, the way it was delivered was very poor, often clouding the good about this main story with minuscule details that don't make sense, a clusterfuck of events that don't mesh together and, simply, BEING UNABLE TO EXPLAIN ANYTHING. Unless analyzed by Albert Einstein, none of what happens in this story will make any sense, which is a problem if the anime is supposed to be an action show casuals alike will enjoy without using their heads. Instead, the show is forcing the viewer to think and since, on the surface, it doesn't make much sense unless watched twice or more. Is it a good marketing strategy? Probably. Is it a way to get good ratings? Most definitely not.\\n\r\nOther than the atrocity known as the main plot, the filler episodes are seemingly enjoyable. There's not much to think about and all the nonsense that happens in these said episodes suits the atmosphere of the setting, where anything can happen and that is where Kekkai Sensen really shines.\\n\r\nAnd it should have really stuck to that.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters (10/10)\\n\r\nI rate this a perfect 10 not because the characters are smart, complex or even relatable. I rate them this way because they're, really, the most fun I've had with a big cast in my years of watching anime. Their different personalities and interaction as Libra really gives the show its flare; how they speak casually, their bond as a team and the way they communicate in combat. I don't remember any of the characters for being boring, unless you count Sonic the monkey, and even he is pretty fun sometimes. There really is no main character to speak of (If I don't mention the horrid main storyline) as each of them can be the center of the show, be it Zapp, Blitz, Klaus or even KK. These characters are products of the show's setting and not fuck-a-lot archetypes placed in other strange settings, waiting for more boobs to grope (I'm looking at you, harem industry). \\n\r\nAnd the same can be very well said for the villains. They're ecstatic, weird and overall, insane. Exactly what you'd expect from the setting. They never feel out of place and are always a joy to watch when they do something 'evil'. Other characters include Black and White from the main plot and, as I mentioned before, did very well in their set up for their clusterfuck of a conclusion.\\n\\n\r\nArt and Sound (10/10)\\n\r\nThis alone is a reason to watch it.\\n\r\nI don't know what came over the director but Rie Matsumoto just took the entirety of New York and put it on paper. Despite the alien-infestation and whatnot, the way it's presented still feels very much like New York, with overblown skyscrapers, ungodly amounts of smoke and decaying buildings. The design is no exception either, as the characters look and feel like they're part of the backgrounds and setting. They would look weird anywhere else but they fit just right where they are. The animation? Amazing. Exactly the kind you'd expect from Bones, known for shows like FMA:B and Soul Eater. \\n\\n\r\nThe sound is something I cannot overlook. As an underground music junkie, the vocal tracks just blow me away. It's very classic jazz and soothing to the ear, most notably 'On My Own' and 'World Goes Round'. The BGM itself is fantastic, making for engaging chase/fight scenes and, sometimes, more calmer moments. \\n\r\nThe OP and ED? Addicting and that's really all I can say. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (9/10)\\n\r\nI want to think of everything bad about this show and just toss it out the window. Kekkai Sensen is, in a word, badass. This all comes from personal taste as many of the things that happen in this series is awfully well presented filler and really, it needs nothing more than that. \\n\\n\r\nOverall (7/10) \\n\r\nWith a fun cast, amazing visuals, captivating sound and just some really badass moments, Kekkai Sensen is pretty damn good, with the main plot keeping it from being great. It's a series that, while off-putting at points, is well worth the fun and excitement.\\n\\n\r\nIf you despise filler-induced shows with a passion or are looking for a more complex and smart action story, you high horse intellectual, you, then I cannot recommend this show. \\n\\n\r\nTo everyone else? Go nuts! Just make sure to turn off your brain before watching.\\n\\n",

Meandering from side story to side story in a way usually reserved for slice of life or select mystery series, it is a show that I notice goes two ways: people are either confused ashell...salem's lot (I couldn't resist, I'm sorry!) or enjoying the hell out of all the chaos.\\n\\n\r\n(It's quick-paced and throws information around like a whirlwind, so for maximum comprehension, make sure you pause when you need to and just let the madness take over!)\\n\\n\r\nSTORY/WRITING - 8\\n\r\nImagine this anime as a cool-looking, stylish guy with really nice sunglasses(?) who still jumps into puddles and kicks up leaves and smiles like a real dork when he tells those \"lol wtf\" jokes that manage to get you to crack a smile. That's Kekkai Sensen. He tells really random, wild stories. And he's one hell of a fun guy to dance with.\\n\\n\r\nART/ANIMATION - 8\\n\r\nAnimation is good; art is good. Let's skip to something more fun: stylisation! Kekkai Sensen knows when and how to utilise different art styles to both comedic and cinematic effect. How it manages text on-screen is really fun, too! Fun and loud and intentionally overdone!\\n\\n\r\nSOUND/MUSIC - 10\\n\r\nMix modern funk with 1930s swing and accompany it with the jazzy voice of a French-American woman singing in a speakeasy where the audience is littered with flappers from the 1920s and a couple dancing a jive. Give her some 2000s contemporary blues to sing. Let the gangs of the West Side Story and the cast of Footloose finger-snap their way into the speakeasy, followed by some classic rockers riffing passionately on their electric guitars. Oh, and don't forget the orchestra playing a haunting, ocean-like serenade and the really high cows playing with squeaker toys.\\n\\n\r\nThat's what Iwasaki Taisei-san's soundtrack is. Frankly, quite amazing. Give it a listen, ya? Plus the OP and ED are really great. The ED is especially fantastic and enthusiastic. Dance vibes all around!\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS - rounded up 8.5\\n\r\nWhen a story is average, it is up to the characters to carry the show. And they do. They flourish under numerable bursts of manzai (funny man/straight man) comedy, simultaneously giving more craziness to the chaos that is Hellsalem's Lot while very subtly throwing in lines of character development.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT - rounded down 9.5\\n\r\nIt's so much fun. Chaotic fun. And it's rather refreshing, as I've been watching a lot of more serious anime lately.\\n\\n\r\nAdditional Ratings: COMEDY - 9 | DIRECTING/DIRECTION - 10 | PACING OVERALL - 7.5 | PACING WITHIN EPISODES - 8.5 | CINEMATOGRAPHY - 8",

            "content": "I can say now with confidence that Studio Bones is the best animation studio in Japan. They have consistently created some of the greatest animated series to ever grace the anime industry. The resume of the studio is a storied one, ranging from Fullmetal Alchemist to Ouran Highschool Host Club to Darker than Black to so many other amazing shows. Yet amidst all of this, one anime was criminally underappreciated. 2015's Blood Blockade Battlefront, or Kekkai Sensen, is an explosive, beautiful, and at times hilarious romp through one of the coolest fictional takes on New York City I've ever seen. From Yasuhiro Nightow, the writerof Trigun, and director Rie Matsumoto comes an exciting adventure through the strangest city in the world.\\n\\n\r\nKekkai Sensen hooked me right from the very beginning with our main character narrating a letter to his sister, as we are treated to a stunning montage of what is clear to be the climax of this 12 episode series. A wide array of colorful and sleek characters are seen dismembering ghoul after ghoul across a vast and expansive metropolis under the night sky, all the while our hero scales a tall staircase approaching what he hopes to be direction needed to stop the chaos and save the day. The main title flashes on the screen with dazzling effect and we are brought back to the beginning of the story.\\n\\n\r\nThe protagonist Leo is a refreshing take on his character type. He lacks any sort of lethal skills in combat and he's overly humble, but he isn't afraid to speak on behalf of those who are oppressed and the narrative never spends too much time forcing him to be a stronger person, rather it lets him become a hero in his own way. Klaus V Reinherz, Leo's boss, is the kind, gentlemanly but undeniably formidable friend who helps Leo to realize his potential. He sees how torn up Leo is over what has happened to him and his family and wants to help him become stronger by \"welcoming him into the family\" in a way. In that sense, Zapp Renfro, Leo's punkish co-worker, is like a brother figure to Leo, having been asked to protect him so no one uses Leo's abilities for evil.  The rest of the cast excels too. From blond, one-eyed gunslingers, to ice power wielding superheroes, to eccentric vampire hunters, every character in Kekkai Sensen is memorable and badass.\\n\\n\r\nThe series starts out fairly episodic, with each episode working to develop the world and introduce the members of Libra. The show does a great job of presenting each character's abilities just within the opening montage. They introduce so many characters over the 12 episodes that you worry how well all the characters can gel together, but the story is so well directed that it feels like I'm watching the Avengers. Every character gets to enter the spotlight whether it be to dispense wisdom on our hero or take part in an operation to bring down a high-level threat. For the most part, the series is a collection of standalone adventures, but with an underlying narrative spliced. What makes that even better is that it splices in that through-line narrative without it feeling forced. What I mean is that some shows with only 12 episodes and an episodic structure will devote so much time to the through-line plot that the side stories seem pointless or just underdeveloped. Thankfully, Kekkai Sensen doesn't have that problem. But how does it balance all this chaos?\\n\\n\r\nThe answer: Beautifully. Director Rie Matsumoto is a genius. Unbeknownst to me until just recently, the characters Mary and William Macbeth, and the entire throughline plot were all original creations made for the anime alone. The second to last episode is dedicated to Mary and William's backstories, and it works as a fitting primer to the incredible finale that follows. While the first 11 episodes are a typical 24 minutes, the last episode is 48 minutes, and the added run time helped to close the narrative in a perfect way. However, while the story is told very well, there are some things that might go right over your head if you aren't paying close enough attention. There were times during the finale where I couldn't quite understand what certain characters' plans were, or how certain elements of the world worked. What's worse is that when the show was first airing, the final episode was postponed because of its extra length, so rather than airing at the end of the spring 2015 season, it aired at the end of the Summer 2015 season a whole THREE months later. Needless to say, I was confused about what was happening. All in all, Kekkai Sensen put all of its chips on a pretty conclusive anime-only finale that despite a bit of confusion will leave viewers satisfied with the whole journey.\\n\\n\r\nThe world of Kekkai Sensen portrays a foggy, dirty, but at the same time lively city that captures the feeling of New York City well while injecting its own sci-fi fantasy charm into it. the gothic style of many of the skyscrapers and the bright colors that pop out through the foggy gray streets help make Hellsalem's Lot one of my favorite fictional cities, right up there with the towns and villages from Ghibli movies. In addition to this, the character designs by Toshihiro Kawamoto are on par with his other designs from Cowboy Bebop and Noragami (And yes you read that correctly, this is the same designer). The fight scenes are wonderfully coordinated and the architectural destruction is just as fun to look at here as it is in all of Bones other shows. Visually, the show hits all the right notes. But the sights are just one half. The sounds are just as good.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is composed by Taisei Iwasaki, who seems to have made his anime soundtrack debut with this show. His style of music resembles that of Yoko Kanno (Cowboy Bebop). That is to say, it is diverse. The music combines beautiful orchestral pieces, with some pop, rock, jazz, and even some strange, but undeniably memorable songs intended for moments of comic relief. It is a well-rounded soundtrack that compliments the journey well.\\n\\n\r\nA lot can be said about this show, probably because it went criminally underappreciated. Perhaps I couldn't appreciate it when I first saw it, but every time I watch it, I love it more and more. To put it simply, Kekkai Sensen, AKA Blood Blockade Battlefront, is one of the greatest action anime in years. You owe it to yourself to watch it.",

            "content": "If you ever feel like watching a simple shounen battle anime with lots of over-the-top action and not as much an over-the-top plot, I would recommend Kekkai Sensen. It is truly a fun anime to watch whenever you feel like relaxing after a long day of the boss complaining about your work being incomplete.\r\nStory \u2013 7/10\r\nKekkai Sensen has a simple plot which doesn\u2019t try to accomplish much. Depending on your personal preference, that can either be a good or a bad thing. Three years before the current storyline a supernatural occurrence happened in the bustling metropolis of New York, merging the Otherworld and NewYork into a single city. This is the origin of the wacky city, Hellsalem\u2019s Lot. Our protagonists are members of the secret organisation Libra who catch criminals to keep the balance between the human\u2019s and \u2018monster\u2019. Personally I love the way Kekkai Sensen was written as a single episode usually revolves around the core group of Libra trying to catch some sort of supernatural criminal. By having a different plot every episode you never know what to expect from the writing department as the criminals \u2013 not the antagonists mind you \u2013 are extremely colourful, personality wise and design wise. This aspect made the show a joy to watch, as we could see the different members of Libra in action and the chemistry between the characters. The only thing I can complain about plot wise, are the last three episodes with a combined plot. The pacing was awful and I couldn\u2019t care enough about the generic antagonist.\\n\\n\r\nArt \u2013 8/10\\n\\n\r\nWith studio Bones in charge of the anime we can expect two things: Consistent animation quality and some gorgeous sakuga. One of the nicest things about Kekkai Sensen is the setpieces. Hellsalem\u2019s Lot is a diverse and colourful city filled with interesting characters and vibrant streets. The amount of detail given to the smallest of details in the city is what truly made the city beautiful. Not to mention the action scenes were downright awesome with the insane amount of particle effects whenever abilities were used. Made me feel like I was busy watching a Marvel/DC superhero movie than an anime.\\n\\n\r\nSound \u2013 9/10\\n\\n\r\nBy far the best aspect of Kekkai Sensen, the music in the anime was fantastic. The opening and ending were both incredibly catchy and I actually watched them both every single episode. The usage of fast passed Jazz was an excellent choice for the anime as it helped to create a laid back and generally fun atmosphere. It also helped with the pacing of the fights as the characters fought in synchronization with the soundtrack. I watched the series in Japanese and the voice acting was really good. Some of my favourite voice actors appear in the anime such as the voice of Zapp.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter \u2013 7/10\\n\\n\r\nEven though the anime had a new plot every episode, most of these episodes didn\u2019t revolve around character development and instead on a central theme, which is kind-of sad because I would have loved to learn more about the members of Libra. Weirdly enough the protagonist \u2013 Leonardo Watch \u2013 happened to be a character I really enjoyed. Within the context of the story he was an excellent choice for the protagonist as he is just a normal guy who happened to end up in the craziest and wackiest city on the planet. We as a audience can feel for the poor guy as he reacts to situation the same way the majority of us would react if we were in his shoes. Another character I really enjoyed was Klaus von Reinhertz, the cool, calculated, suave gentleman who had some great comedic moments as his cool personality worked in contrast to the majority of the cast. Other than these two the rest of Libra were interesting in their own rights if but a little underdeveloped. As I mentioned before, I found the antagonist a boring and useless character thrown in at the last minute in order to make the plot appear more put together.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment \u2013 8/10\\n\\n\r\nThe first nine episodes are insanely fun to watch. It has everything I love about the shounen genre and does it well. It moves at a fast pace and genuinely makes me smile, even though the last three episodes feel like an entirely different than the episodes which came before them.\\n\\n\r\nOverall \u2013 7/10\\n\\n\r\nKekkai Sensen is a average but fun show. It\u2019s not the type of show  a ignorant elitist would watch but for the majority of anime watchers \u2013 and myself \u2013 Kekkai Sensen is a damn fun watch. It has a simple plot, fun characters, great visuals and a fantastic soundtrack which makes the show extremely enjoyable.  What more could you ask for in such a fun shounen?\\n\\n\r\nThanks for taking the time to read my review!",

            "content": "Kekkai Sensen is a thrill ride from start to finish, throwing its viewers into a confusing mess of conflicts, monsters, and the awesome heroes trying to keep the city (somewhat) safe. With a sizable cast of eccentric characters and a wide array of conflicts and subplots, there is endless excitement to be had.\r\nWhere Kekkai Sensen really shines is its captivating setting and unstructured plot. Incredible effort was put into developing Hellsalem's Lot, the dystopian metropolis that was once New York City before a mysterious portal opened up, connecting our universe to another and allowing monsters to flood the city. Not all of these monsters areunfriendly, however; most of them have assimilated into society and coexist with humans. Kekkai Sensen puts you on a tour of the city, showing you countless human and monster pedestrians and their bizarre lifestyles. \\n\\n\r\nThe confusing, loosely structured plot  has been criticized by many viewers, but I think it is one of Kekkai Sensen's greatest strengths. This isn't a linear story of one boy fighting the villain and saving the day. It's the story of an apocalyptic city and all of the calamity going on inside of it, and the stronger powers keeping this calamity loosely in check. There is Libra, the league of vigilantes trying to keep violent monsters at bay, there are large-scale criminal organizations, there is an ambiguous militaristic police force threatening to shut Libra down, and a few powerful individuals trying to take down the whole planet. It only makes sense that Kekkai Sensen is a chaotic mesh of storylines that our main character, Leonardo, gets caught up in. More than anything else, this anime is FUN. It is loaded with action, interesting characters, and plenty of mysteries to keep you watching.\\n\\n\r\nLibra itself features a strong cast of lovable characters. Klaus, the almost comically masculine leader who can fight harder and think faster than any other human. Zapp, the lanky, aloof wannabe tough guy who begrudgingly takes Leonardo under his wing. KK, the mysterious woman who is deeply dedicated to her son and fights with electrified bullets. All of the major characters in Kekkai Sensen are well-developed and unique, and each has their own demons to battle. Watching Leonardo join Libra, you can feel his excitement and nervousness as he enters a world full of powerful characters and the complex ties they have within Hellsalem's Lot.\\n\\n\r\nThen the anime twins show up. The super-crazy battle arena of an anime suddenly turns into an ultra-generic melodrama about some emotional 15 year-olds. All of the subplots that left you craving information are dropped entirely, Leonardo's status as a goofy kid trying to make a difference is gone, and suddenly all we're supposed to care about is the feelings of some sappy kids who lost their parents. The series essentially forgets everything that it achieved for 10 episodes and completely redefines the storyline to focus on a moody teenage girl, while every conflict is instantly resolved with the power of friendship. After watching 10 episodes of Libra causing thousands (they openly admit to this) of casualties in their effort to keep the city safe - rightly so, they blow up some buildings but prevent giant monsters from going on city-wide rampages - it becomes a bit difficult to feel sympathetic for the  little girl who wishes she had super powers, and her emo brother who is too noble to save himself. I just watched Klaus murder 500 innocent people when he threw a giant monster into a skyscraper, now I'm expected to feel sorry for a little girl who doesn't feel adequate?\\n\\n\r\nBetter yet, the entire story conveniently becomes centered on these moody teens, and saving the world becomes a matter of inspiring them (with a super cheesy \"i believe in my friends!!!\" monologue) to stop being self-pitying twats long enough for the world to not end simply because they're too mopey to lift a finger. \\n\\n\r\nI may be a bit too strongly opinionated, but Kekkai Sensen's evolution from Baccano-esque thrill ride to super cliche shonen crap left a bitter aftertaste. While I still think this show has immense potential to continue on as a great series, my interest will drop significantly if it doesn't go back to its strengths and start exploring the amazing world it has set up. There is so much potential for this series to really dig into any of the subplots it touched on throughout the first 10 episodes, like \"Angel Scale\" the mysterious super-drug, the seemingly corrupt police force patrolling the city, the source of the \"blood powers\" wielded by the members of Libra and the experiments that gave Klaus his incredible power, or Ulchelko the crime-boss chess wizard and the other powerful bosses of the alterworld. Anything to get more screen time in the awesome city of Hellsalem's Lot, watching Libra clown around and take down bad guys while digging into the underworld of terrible powers fueling the chaos withing the city.\\n\\n\r\nI give Kekkai Sensen a 6/10 for having an awesome story with a completely unsatisfying ending. I sincerely hope that this series gets a second season, and that it taps into the huge potential of its setting rather than make a story revolving around romantic teenagers. There are a lot of loose ends that could easily make for a few season's worth of content on their own.",

Since it's set in New York the setting is very urban, and since I'm from a very urban area it was very refreshing and cool setting to have.  The music is amazing as well.  It has a very R&B and jazzy feel to it which I absolutely loved.  The character designs are beautiful, I love the design of Leonardo's eyes.  The powers the characters have are very cool as well.  I highly recommend this animeit is one of my favorites. :D",

            "content": "(This review has been adapted from my blog/reddit thread. Spoilers ahead!)\r\nIn Kekkai Sensen, a character goes by the name of White. She reminds me of my own sister since she also has a heart condition. Nothing serious, but it\u2019s a condition she has had to deal with all her life.\r\nI remember one night when my sister went out to eat with her friends. She came home eventually; nothing out of the ordinary. Except, before heading off to bed, my sister let my father know of a pain in her chest.\r\nMy father hesitated not, rushing her immediately to the hospital. So fast, in fact, that Idid not realize where they went to until they got back. It turned out that my sister just had some heartburn, but it was still a scary moment for our family. I can only imagine how harrowing it was for her.\\n\\n\r\nI admire my sister for always dancing, always traveling, always living, despite her condition. Her heart may be weak, but it\u2019s stronger in ways that I will never truly understand. Kekkai Sensen has heart, too. Not as strong a heart as my sister\u2019s, but, as she proves, a weak heart isn\u2019t the end of the world.\\n\\n\r\nSTORY\\n\\n\r\nKekkai Sensen follows a teenage boy named Leonardo Watch. He arrives in Hellsalem\u2019s Lot, a city filled with monsters, demons, and creatures that live (somewhat) peacefully alongside humans. A rather peculiar event (normal for Hellsalem\u2019s Lot) grants Leonardo the chance to join Libra, a secretive group of elite fighters that protect said peace. At least, as best as they can.\\n\\n\r\nThe anime seems fantastical, and, in practice, it is. Seeing a bunch of aliens fighting each other in an arena, an onion boy vying for hamburgers, or a pair of duelists playing an absurdly advanced game of chess can only appear in fantasy.\\n\\n\r\nDespite the fantasy roots of the events within Kekkai Sensen, they feel rather realistic in their presentation. Those aliens are gambling on the fighters. The onion boy leads a lonely life. And the chess game, for all of its rules and difficulties, is still nothing more than a battle of the minds. It\u2019s not fantasy or science-fiction or random. The anime takes its surrealism and underpins it with unbridled realism.\\n\\n\r\n\u201cRealistic fantasy\u201d is another way to put it.\\n\\n\r\nThis realism is achieved through a lot of world-building. Acronyms and concepts are given quick, succinct definitions. The melting pot of characters creates bridges that introduce new ideas in a natural fashion. The episodic narrative portrays multiple areas and aspects of Hellsalem\u2019s Lot.\\n\\n\r\nThe episodic narrative is particularly interesting due to its two-fold approach. First, it gives the anime a slice-of-life feel, making the oft comedic material of the show feel right at home. Second, and most important, it grants Kekkai Sensen the chance to \u201creset.\u201d By going episodic, the anime always gets the chance to try something new from what it did before. This onslaught of hodgepodge material, that never seem to be related to one another, reflects Hellsalem\u2019s Lot beautifully.\\n\\n\r\nNow, in reality (meta joke intended), the anime puts emphasis on its overarching narrative which features its titular twins Black and White. Interestingly, it is not Leonardo\u2019s quest to restore his sister\u2019s eyesight that is most important \u2013 that quest is very rarely referenced beyond the first episode. No, it is Black and White\u2019s tale of love and loss that means the most.\\n\\n\r\nSadly, a couple of problems exist in the structure. For starters, it\u2019s all a bit too obscure. For a large majority of the anime, little is given of the twins, what they are doing, and how their involvement plays into the bigger picture. The anime makes up for this quite a bit when it dedicates an entire episode to their upbringing, but, even then, the main events and details surrounding their involvement are still superficial.\\n\\n\r\nThe biggest problem, not mentioned as such but mentioned all the same, is how it detracts from the main goal: Leonardo\u2019s quest. Leonardo\u2019s whole purpose of trekking to Hellsalem\u2019s Lot, of joining Libra, of going through trials he has never experienced before, was to help his sister. More specifically, to restore her eyesight that he indirectly caused her to lose.\\n\\n\r\nThe slice-of-life episodes already did next to nothing in this regard \u2013 indeed, being abducted by a psychopath and delivering pizzas does not yield (relevant) profitable results. But when the overarching narrative continues to ignore the original motivation, the main reason why this tale is being told to begin with, it makes Kekkai Sensen come off as unfocused. Distracted by the monsters and oddities it contains.\\n\\n\r\nDespite the distraction, the narrative as a whole has a theme that persists through both the episodic and overarching content. It\u2019s not explored, so it\u2019s not exactly deep. But it is an idea that most people can relate to: life is unpredictable.\\n\\n\r\nPeople usually have a plan for themselves. Who they want to be, where they want to go, and what they want to do. But life is a road filled with people and events which create potholes and forks and detours. In Hellsalem\u2019s Lot, it is often taken to an extreme: getting visited by a god or having to evade a zombie apocalypse certainly create cracks in that road. But, as has been discussed, the anime is \u201crealistic fantasy.\u201d Missing out on lunch, resonating with a film, or losing loved ones are experiences that, while ranging in severity, are relatable while still skewing that road.\\n\\n\r\nBut it\u2019s not the unpredictable nature of life that matters most. It\u2019s how one responds to those events that does. Never giving up, being there for another, and having hope. Taking it all in stride or sulking in defeat. Believing. These responses can be applied to those previous examples as well as throughout the whole season. Because each event is unpredictable, each event demands a response. And it is these responses that dictate where one goes down that ever-present road.\\n\\n\r\nThus Kekkai Sensen delivers its message: Life is unpredictable \u2013 that\u2019s the reality \u2013 but thinking one\u2019s response does not matter is just pure fantasy.\\n\\n\r\nANIMATION\\n\\n\r\nPerhaps Kekkai Sensen\u2019s strongest part is, surprisingly, its art and animation.\\n\\n\r\nOn an animation level, the anime does not (openly) cut corners. Almost every episode has some fight or brawl or massive movement that keeps Hellsalem\u2019s Lot lively. A huge, metal contraption careening through the streets. A master with missing limbs battling a so-called Blood Breed who similarly lost body parts. A vampire getting sealed by the veterans of Libra.\\n\\n\r\nThese examples are some of the more grandiose. Normally, the anime still holds up, characters acting appropriately with hair, facial, and nuanced movements. Crowds of moving people breathe life into the city. And background objects, such as a Ferris wheel or an airplane, make even the static scenes partially dynamic.\\n\\n\r\nOn an artistic level, Kekkai Sensen performs even better. Of course, lighting plays a huge role in the visuals. Blue, orange, and red lights accentuate the abilities and moods of the characters and the situations respectively. The norm, however, has Hellsalem\u2019s Lot draped in a dreary atmosphere. Cloudy skies, fogged locations, and gray lighting keep the crazy city, like its inhabitants, in a morally ambiguous spot. This dread contrasted with the more colorful parts is an added bonus.\\n\\n\r\nBut the anime really shines in two subcategories of the art: the details and the cinematography. Despite Kekkai Sensen purposefully constraining itself to a single setting, the amount of areas that are visited are vast. A hospital, the Libra headquarters, a side street. The inside of a diner, an abandoned crypt, a grass-filled plain. Another dimension, atop floating debris, a highway traversing part of the city. The city alone looks detailed and crisp, but when every background and location has the same attention to detail, that sense of realism is ramped up that much further.\\n\\n\r\nThe best, though, is the cinematography. Kekkai Sensen likes to play with perspective, rotation, and closeness, creating shot after shot of coolness. Seeing through Leonardo\u2019s eyes or a top-down view of the headquarters from the inside or a wide shot of Zapp versus his opponent make the anime a visual treat to watch.\\n\\n\r\nFinally, due to the nature of the anime, the character designs (for the actual cast as well as the background characters) are each creative and fun. Leonardo wears goggles for driving that also hint at what rests beneath his oft-shut eyes. Zapp\u2019s all-white outfit and darker skin forms a dichotomy that matches his mean-yet-caring personality. And while Klaus\u2019s red sideburns and fangs highlight the ferocious beast he can be, his glasses and suit create an air of importance that befit the gentleman.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS\\n\\n\r\nKekkai Sensen\u2019s cast is filled with people who are each a character.\\n\\n\r\nThat reads like a redundant statement, but that\u2019s what they are: characters. To clarify, they are not characters. They do not have complex conflicts. They do not have multiple sides to their personality. And they do not even have fully fleshed-out backstories. They are each a character, but they are by no means a character.\\n\\n\r\nUsing examples makes this observation easier to see. Chain is a woman and a member of Libra. More importantly, she is a werewolf, granting her dexterity and quickness. Such skills she uses to tease Zapp, tricking him and literally standing on top of him, taking immense pleasure in doing so.\\n\\n\r\nThat\u2019s it. How she came to be a werewolf, whether or not her teasing hints at other feelings for Zapp, and what she thinks about herself and the situation does not get explored. She exists solely as a cute character who makes the audience laugh at her mistreatment of her friend.\\n\\n\r\nThis same process can be applied to almost every character.\\n\\n\r\nZapp is a jokester who is more caring than he first appears to be.\\n\\n\r\nKlaus is a lion-like leader who is cordial, determined, and powerful.\\n\\n\r\nZed is a fish man who is respectful to everyone around him.\\n\\n\r\nAbrams is a master vampire hunter who reduces the luck of those around him.\\n\\n\r\nGilbert the bandaged butler with wicked driving skills, K.K. the sniper (despite her eyepatch) who also has a crush on Klaus, and Dog the man-and-blood-beast hybrid.\\n\\n\r\nThe cast are a bunch of characters, and that\u2019s perfectly all right. Not only are there way too many to develop individually, but also it makes sense within the context of the anime. Hellsalem\u2019s Lot is this hodgepodge of weirdos, so having the main cast be made up of a werewolf, a fish man, and a butler continues the motif already started by Kekkai Sensen.\\n\\n\r\nInterestingly, due to the nature of the narrative, Leonardo is the same. He is a regular, kind kid who just so happens to wield the All-Seeing Eyes of God (as the anime ordains them). To be fair, he gets a bit more than the rest of Libra. The story molds him into a brave, confident kid who has clearly grown beyond being the weak, scared kid he was at the beginning. But, to reiterate, the narrative does not focus on his main goal of helping his sister. Meaning, such bravery and confidence does not mean a whole lot when the bigger picture is looked at.\\n\\n\r\nThe question, then, becomes a simple one: Who is not just a character but instead a character?\\n\\n\r\nThe narrative makes this clear once more: Black and White are arguably the main characters of the anime and thus are actual characters.\\n\\n\r\nTheir names alone provide a lot of symbolism. They are twins, Black a boy and White a girl. Black grew up with psychic powers rivaling the best of them, and White grew up without psychic powers, a \u201cfailure\u201d in her lineage. Ironically, Black tended to be weak-willed, a crybaby of sorts, whereas White tended to be mature for her age.\\n\\n\r\nBut they grow up together. They get bullied, they look out for each other, and they come to the conclusion that they cannot live without one another. Not in a physical sense but in a philosophical sense.\\n\\n\r\nAll of these details are given quite later on. (Episode eleven to be exact.) Preceding them are a different Black and White. Black seems possessed by a dark entity, masquerading as the boy in order to enact some evil scheme he has been concocting behind the scenes. White finds herself in the hospital, dealing with a heart condition that keeps her confined and irritable.\\n\\n\r\nThe reason for their turn of fates is pieced together through more flashback. During the calamity that spawned Hellsalem\u2019s Lot, Black and White are visited by the King of Despair. Black sacrifices himself, letting the spirit take his body on the condition that he does not harm White. Despite his valor, White dies. (It\u2019s a bit unclear how.) Her parents, who likewise are near their doom, use the last of their powers to \u201cresurrect\u201d White, turning her heart (and, by extension, her whole body) into a piece of the barrier protecting the city.\\n\\n\r\nAs such, Black and White\u2019s motivations come forth. Black (who is really the King of Despair) needs Leonardo\u2019s godly eyes to fulfill his plan. And White, unable to live without her brother, becomes friends with Leonardo in order to get his eyes in order to save Black. (The condition to set her brother free.)\\n\\n\r\nWhat\u2019s cool is that this series of events is designed to mirror Leonardo\u2019s. Leonardo and his sister were visited by an all-powerful entity, she sacrificed herself for him, and Leonardo seeks to help her out in whatever way he can. Sadly, this parallel means little since little is done with it, but it\u2019s interesting nonetheless.\\n\\n\r\nOf course, everything goes wrong. White does indeed betray Leonardo, Black later \u201ckills\u201d White, and a second calamity is about to occur. But thanks to Leonardo and some deus ex machina, White comes back to sacrifice herself, removing the King of Despair from Black and reestablishing the barrier.\\n\\n\r\nSo Black and White are characters. They have a beginning, a middle, and an end. That is, they go through an entire arc over the course of the season. The next step is what these arcs did for them. I.e., how did they develop over the course of the anime?\\n\\n\r\nIn White\u2019s case, some development is seen. She protects Black after failing to do so multiple times before \u2013 the anime has a nice parallel with this saving scene and the one from her childhood. She also opened up to Leonardo, a person other than her brother. She does betray him, but she at least admits the mistake she made (even if that immediate turnaround is a little silly).\\n\\n\r\nIn Black\u2019s case, it\u2019s a bit more complicated. His action to sacrifice himself for his sister demonstrates that he, however slightly, overcame the cowardice he had when he was younger. But the crux of his character focuses on the demon possessing him.\\n\\n\r\nTo put it differently, he does not have a conflict that he deals with personally over the course of the season. Black worries about White and befriends Leonardo, but the events that unfold do not seem to directly affect or influence him. Instead, they focus mostly on the King of Despair being this evil, nonchalant antagonist.\\n\\n\r\nHis final conversation with White echoes the same sentiment they had all along: a world without her is not a world worth living in. That line makes sense for his character, but, since he never seems to fight for her, never seems to do whatever he can while possessed by the King of Despair, his echoing rings hollow.\\n\\n\r\nSo while Black and White are characters, they are not particularly impressive. Still, the other lovable troupe of characters help to make Kekkai Sensen the strange anime that it set out to be.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND\\n\\n\r\nIf Kekkai Sensen is remembered for anything, it will be its ending track. The ED is, in short, a big bundle of fun. Bass strings, hard guitar, and nice vocal work come together to create a dance number that gets one grooving. The changing tempo, the other instruments, and even just the name of the song \u2013 \u201cSugar Song to Bitter Step\u201d \u2013 make the entire piece a joy to listen to. It\u2019s one half cool, one half smiles, and wholly awesome.\\n\\n\r\nThe opening track is as well done, if not better than, the ED. It starts off quick yet reserved, the low tone and soft-speaking singer continuing for a portion of the piece. By the halfway mark, the instruments and the vocalist pick up, the track becoming more frantic and passionate in tone. As the end approaches, the OP builds and builds on itself until a triumph is reached. It\u2019s an empowering song that follows the flow of Kekkai Sensen, making it just as welcome of an addition as the ED is.\\n\\n\r\nThe rest of the original soundtrack is not as strong as the OP and the ED, but its wide range of tunes cannot be denied. Many of the tracks are jazzy, like \u201cSidewinder\u201d and \u201cCatch Me If You Can.\u201d Others are eerier, like \u201cVictim\u201d and \u201cPresage.\u201d Others are more rock-n-roll, like \u201cCall You Later\u201d and \u201cTraffic Man.\u201d Some go cultural, like \u201cOblivion\u201d and \u201cAt The Gates.\u201d Others are mellow, like \u201cKeep On The Sunny Side\u201d and \u201cEarly Train.\u201d Others are melancholic, like \u201cA Funeral\u201d and \u201cOn My Own.\u201d Others are simply fun, like \u201cToy Blues\u201d and \u201cBCCGS.\u201d\\n\\n\r\nAll of this to get at a single idea: like the story and the characters, the music is a hodgepodge of different beats, tones, and compositions, creating an amalgamation of sound that not only fits the anime but also is pleasant to hear outside of it.\\n\\n\r\nAlso, a shout-out to the reverberating sound-effect whenever Leonardo used his eyes. It gave his power a powerful feeling, the blueness and otherworldly vision notwithstanding.\\n\\n\r\nThe only miss in the sound department is the voice acting. To be fair, it\u2019s more a mix than a miss, but it\u2019s certainly a step down from the rest of the music. On the one hand, Daisuke Sakaguchi as Leonardo does a nice job, using a voice that works for the growing-up boy. On the other hand, Rie Kugimiya as Black uses a voice that is a tad bit too effeminate. Everyone else falls somewhere in-between.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT\\n\\n\r\nFor those that do not know, this anime has a slightly strange history. Here\u2019s the short of it: The last episode got delayed. And delayed. And delayed. To the point that questioning if the season would ever officially end became a joke itself.\\n\\n\r\nGranted my timing is even worse when I see that I am completing this anime literally more than a year after I started it. Regardless, getting to go from the second-to-last episode to the last one, while knowing that so many people waited months, made me feel oddly privileged.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the final episode itself, it was okay, neither momentous nor horrendous. It certainly had scale, considering that the city was about to blow up again. But I can\u2019t say it\u2019s one of my favorites.\\n\\n\r\nFor me, my favorite episode happens to be the eighth one for a single moment.\\n\\n\r\nAllow me to explain. Much of the episode revolved around Zapp being a lazy, promiscuous, and incompetent dude. So, of course, he gets tasked by his master to take care of this egg enemy: Attack each of its eyes simultaneously lest he risk a limb or two. But, as was shown, there is no way he can do it because he\u2019s, well, Zapp.\\n\\n\r\nCue Chain receiving a phone call from her lady friend that Zapp tried to flirt with earlier in the episode. Said lady friend essentially wants to get in Zapp\u2019s pants. Upon hearing such news, Zapp channels his inner focus. A hawk screeches, a water droplet falls, and the sun peeks out over the Earth\u2019s horizon.\\n\\n\r\nZapp succeeds with ease, his reddened crotch on the infrared scanner indicating his motivator. Only the phone call was fake, a ruse to spur him forward. And all the while Zapp has his goofy, big belly from his numerous days of debauchery.\\n\\n\r\nI remember pausing the episode from laughing so much at this wonderful and clever joke. I even went so far as to mark it down in my notes for this review later on. That\u2019s how much I liked it.\\n\\n\r\nThat joke was the high for me. Of course, there were some lows. The material on Black and White (the last quarter or so of the season), while more in-depth compared to everything else, was not as fun or engaging. I wish Dog had more of a role in the show. I would have liked to see the potential romance between Leonardo and White progress further than it did.\\n\\n\r\nNot everything else was a low, though. The cast was fun and the comedy made me laugh. Chain\u2019s interactions with Zapp always made me smile. There were cool moments like when they fought the Blood Breeds in the underground or Leonardo being an awesome friend with the hamburger kid.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I liked the show. Not a whole bunch, but it was definitely entertaining.\\n\\n\r\nKekkai Sensen ends up better than expected. It does a lot right with its art and its music. It falters slightly with its story and its characters. And it can be both fun and frustrating to watch. Its heart was in the right place, but the execution just wasn\u2019t quite there.\\n\\n\r\nSUMMARY\\n\\n\r\nStory: Fine, \u201crealistic fantasy\u201d sets the stage, with an obscure and distracting subplot getting in the way of its theme on life\u2019s unpredictability\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: Great, wonderful art, above-average actual animation, and nice character designs\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Fine, the majority of the characters are just characters, and Leonardo, White, and Black are not impressive but they at least go beyond their superficial traits\\n\\n\r\nSound: Good, good OP, good ED, good OST, okay VA performances\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Fine, silly cast, clever jokes, and a mix of fun and frustrating material\\n\\n\r\nFinal Score: 6/10",

            "content": "Kekkai sensen is a rather weird anime to write a review about. Its an anime that makes little sense from start to end, but its one of those anime that makes you *feel* something. The sensation is rather hard to explain.\r\nLets start with the story. It makes no sense, and although there is *some* effort on the part of the directors to make some semblance of what is going on, even at the very end, you have no real clue what is going on. The story essentially centers around a the boy protagonist, Leo. He just magically receives a magic pair of eyeballs out ofnowhere and for no reason. Furthermore, the eyesight of his disabled sister had to be taken in order for him to receive such powers.\\n\\n\r\nNever, anywhere in the story is this phenomenon explained. Furthermore, the story diverges a lot. There really does not seem to be a central line of progression, or perhaps there was just too much story to unpack in just 12 episodes.\\n\\n\r\nThe story for me, just doesn't do it. Its all the other stuff that makes this anime fun to watch.\\n\\n\r\nThe art and sound, are what you'd expect from a studio like Bones. Its damn near perfect although I do feel that there is a tad too much music in this one. I guess what they are trying to capture is the feeling of New York with rap songs and classic jazz bar songs. One could say that it does indeed add to the environment of the situation Leo finds himself is. Like the music, its both interesting and at the same time totally chaotic. The battle scenes are fluid, and beautifully drawn. One gets a real feeling that this is a hand crafted anime, unlike some of the modern CGI heavy battle scenes that you see today.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are neat. You definitely are rooting for Leo, and the other characters do get *some* background to them. But the development of these characters are not properly paced. The magic system is also kinda \"just there\". Again, a lot of things make little sense, but there is some interesting dialogue, and funny things do indeed happen. There are some scenes that really make you consider things, by being mysterious, but since the plot is rather confusing, you don't always understand their significance.\\n\\n\r\nI'd say that this is an enjoyable anime. You do root for the characters involved and you really enjoy the battle scenes. It makes no sense though, so not a 9 for me. I'd say this is a solid 8, due to the good art, music and overall direction.",

If you don't agree with what I'm saying, then that's great, I just hope you just respect what I'm to say.\r\nHow I really, REALLY, wanted this show to be my favorite. There's so much that should be up my alley and for the most part is! Amazing animation, kickin' soundtrack, fantastic environment, and highly enjoyable characters. \r\nYet the story was such a mess, didn't know what to be or knew where to go. Some episodes it wants to be a completely world building story, next a completely character driven, and then in the blink of aneye there is a great enemy ready to destroy the world.\\n\\n\r\n This show doesn't have a tone problem, but more like a mix of a pacing problem and a focus problem. It doesn't know how to even out it's focus on all the things I just listed, instead using a whole episode or two to go all out and explain it instead of balancing the info to build up to the climax while attracting the viewer's intrigue by equally mixing character development and the fleshing out of their world building. \\n\\n\r\nI don't think that having more than 12 episodes would've helped the series with it's problems, as now a second season already exists. I just feel it has some fat here and there it just needs to trim while needing to readjust it's focus on other areas.\\n\\n\r\nNo offense to those who like it, but I can say for myself and some others that the vampire plot was either disappointing or poorly set up to begin with. Though there's a second season out now, meaning more episodes to flesh out the vampires to someone's argument, it holds no merit in this case as this season is being judged and graded separately. It must take responsibility for handling it the way it did, which though not awful, could've been done a lot better as well.\\n\\n\r\nI have yet to see Season 2 while currently writing this, and I can only hope it fixed the problems I have with it's first season, giving more of a gateway to gush about it instead.\\n\\n",

I watched it late 2015 and ever since then I've fallen in love with its world and characters. Studio Bones did an amazing job at adapting this series with its fantastic animation and nice pacing for the most part. \r\nThe soundtrack for this series is amazing too, even if you didn't enjoy this series you gotta admit it has an amazing OST. And the ending theme, Sugar Song to Bitter step is very iconic and recognizable to all anime fans!! \r\nThis series does have 2 animeoriginal characters which is the best use of adding anime original characters that I have seen yet. It makes the story flow much better! Props to the team who added them in! \\n\\n\r\nIf you liked Baccano or Bungo Stray Dogs give this one a watch for sure!! The vibes are very similar to both of those series.\\n\\n\r\n10/10 from me.",

In the end, you might asked yourself, 'why did this particular thing happened? What does it do to affect the plot?' A lot of unanswerable question yet the show is still fascinatingly interesting and wonderful. \r\nWith a likable Main Character that had the eye of the all seeing god, he was the center of the attention. \r\nTo all the fangirls out there, you might called the caring relationship between the people in the agency and Leonardo Bromance. Well, not technically, unless you started putting peopleon ships and sailing them(haha). \\n\r\nTo all the fanboys(is that a word?) out there, you will be capitivated by the awesome action scenes and the deep bond between the main character and the agency. \\n\\n\r\nToo bad that the season 2 of Kekkai Sensen isn'g coming out any time soon. There are always those anime that are like 'We are going to make an awesome season 1 and not do a season 2'...Just what is wrong with the anime world?\\n\\n\r\nThis anime will definitely be worth your time if you enjoy action, comedy, supernatural anime! There aren't a lot of romance in this anime in case you are wondering but that only make the anime even more fascinating without weak girl popping up everywhere randomly. I mean, we all blame the girl when she got kidnapped and resulted in the awesome Main Character falling in dangers, right? \\n\r\nPlus, romance will only make this already awesome to the max anime become annoying and below average.\\n\\n\r\nWell, peace out and DO try this anime! I promise it will be worth your time!",

            "content": "New York City is overrun by monsters!\r\nThe statement itself seems quite quirky. However when put into context, it truly is just another day within the world of Kekkai Sensen. A world so vast, so mysterious, so telling, and downright awesome, that the depth of its possibility seems endless. That's, enough of my praise. Let's get down to business.\r\nStory: 9\r\nKekkai Sensen introduces a very enticing, extraordinary, and complex story. It gives little detail upon where we are in our current situations. It leaves, gaps, holes, and mysteries to be solved. Not to mention the unbelievably fast pacing that the anime showcases. Despite the claim that allof these should be setbacks, Kekkai Sensen successfully mingles every aspect into a fantastically, smooth story. In doing so, Kekkai Sensen separates itself from the other animes within its genre, becoming something truly interesting and fresh.\\n\r\nArt: 7\\n\r\nThe art of Kekkai Sensen is most definitely the weakest link. The art is quite mediocre at some points and just doesn't stand to par with the other aspects of the anime.\\n\r\nSound: 9\\n\r\nSuch a good soundtrack. The soundtrack really impressed me and added a lot to the overall feeling of the anime. Each soundtrack fulfilled its purpose wonderfully, even adding its own spice at many points within the anime. Not to mention the ending for this show. The ending for Kekkai Sensen really fits the tone of the anime and is simply cool. Just like the smooth, jazzy, lightheartedness that Kekkai Sensen can take on, the ending really highlights what makes the anime so interesting.\\n\r\nCharacters: 10\\n\r\nAlmost character in Kekkai Sensen is undoubtedly underdeveloped. Once again, this aspect perfectly fits into the image that Kekkai Sensen wants to take on. Kekkai Sensen is a show that likes to be mysterious. It likes to always have a few tricks left to entertain the audience. Most of all, Kekkai Sensen loves to be different. \\n\r\nKekkai Sensen also encompasses the all important rule of change. What makes a character great is change. Leonardo Watch's addition to Libra and how he changes is very interesting to watch. His initial personality is changed by the end (though still fundamentally there) and his beliefs are highlighted by his choices. \\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10\\n\r\nIf you have read this far, the enjoyment aspect must be no surprise. The story is undeniably interesting, the humor is absolutely amazing, and the characters are very fun to watch. The anime's unique spice of jazz and New York create a unique identity that can be associated with Kekkai Sensen.  With all of the eccentricity that Kekkai Sensen brings, you most certainly will not get bored.\\n\r\nOverall : A -\\n\r\nThe mean of the scores is 9.0. That is indeed an A minus. Kekkai Sensen's ability to create an identity for itself, provide characters that are interesting, and prove its depth of story, make it one of the better anime of its season. Its flaws lie in the animation and mysterious identity that leaves many character's dry for development.",

            "content": "Okay, Kekkai Sensen. Let me just say that if you like your superpowered urban fantasy or Baccano and/or Durarara, you may like this series.\r\nStory:7\r\nThe story revolves our main character, Leonard Watch who moves to Hellsalem's Lot a monster filled New York, in an effort to find out about the mysterious power he has been given. While this, at the start, is his main goal, I don't believe he finds out by the end of the season which makes sense as the anime is only a partial adaptation of a longer manga series. However, there is a larger, plot that goes on in the background ofeach episode that doesn't receive complete focus until closer to the end. Otherwise it's a bit episodic in nature, but believe the short, episodic stories are quite interesting. One episode had me sad about a mushroom. Warning however, at times it can be a bit confusing.\\n\\n\r\nArt:7\\n\r\nThe art is pretty good in this show. It's not Your Lie In April beautiful ,but it doesn't need to be. It uses just the right style for both comedic and dramatic moments and the character design is fitting. The visuals for the opening and ending are nice as well.\\n\\n\r\nSound:10\\n\r\nJesus Christ the music is great in this anime! They have some really good background music with a lot of variety that really helps with the scenes. As for the Opening and Ending themes..... THEY FIT THE SHOW SO PERFECTLY! The opening feels like it could be the main character singing about himself while the ending perfectly encapsulates the more lighthearted, comedic side of the series. Also, my God is the ending theme catchy.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:7\\n\r\nI personally liked the characters. However, to my dismay there wasn't enough time in its run to give more characterization to all of the members of Libra. I'll admit, fleshing them all out wasn't really important to the most important plot and the characters that did receive focus proved to be rather interesting.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:9\\n\r\nI finished this series in a day. This is rare for me, even for shows that have less than twelve episodes. This was suggested to me by my sister and it proved to be rather good. I'm glad I took the time to watch it and I think others will enjoy it too.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: Tally up the scores and you get a..... 8!\\n\\n",

            "content": "I wasn't entirely sure what I was getting into when I first started watching Blood Blockade Battlefront (Kekkai Sensen), but I fell in love with this very unique and charming series almost instantaneously. This show has just about everything; a genuinely likable and sympathetic protagonist, a diverse cast of lovable oddballs, a beautifully detailed and colorful world and an over-the-top antagonist who doesn't pull any punches. It's an urban fantasy well worth your time.\r\nThe show centers on Leo Watch, a 19 year old kid who moves to Hellsalem's Lot; HL used to be New York City until a strange cataclysm known as the \"Beyond\" completelyaltered it. Now, ordinary human beings live alongside demons, aliens and all manner of other dimensional entities. Imagine the comic book \"Fables\" but with a great deal more chaos going on. Leo joins Libra, a group of superhumans who keep Hellsalem's Lot safe from threats both human and supernatural.\\n\\n\r\nThe reason why I fell in love with this show largely falls on its world. As great as the characters are, the world they live in feels genuine and developed in a way that many anime settings simply aren't. Hellsalem's Lot used to be NYC, and as someone who has visited NYC many times (I've practically lived there) it really nails the feeling of being a very small fish in a massive pond. You'll see all kinds of inventive character designs on the streets of this fantastical metropolis; mere bystanders look like they could be the protagonist of an entirely different story (pretty true to life if you ask me). \\n\\n\r\nLeo and his allies in Libra are all enjoyable to watch interact with one another. They're a gang of lovable weirdos charged with defending a city that is constantly tearing itself apart in one way or another. Picture the X-Men or the Avengers but with way more comedic infighting and awkwardness going on.\\n\\n\r\nI won't talk about the main storyline, but it's rather deep considering how much of the show is over-the-top insanity most of the time. This show tugged on my heartstrings and I'll bet it will do the same to you.\\n\\n\r\nAlso, this show features one of my favorite ending themes in any anime ever; \"Sugar Song to Bitter Step\" by Unison Square Garden. Insanely catchy and enjoyable, I've had people who couldn't care less about anime listen to it and they almost all agree; it's a damn entertaining tune. The opening \"Hello, World!\" by Bump of Chicken is more emotional; there's a sweetness there that becomes more tragic in hindsight.\\n\\n\r\nI could go on for hours talking about why I love this show and why you should watch it if you haven't. Honestly, though, it's down to you; if you're looking for a beautifully animated, inventive show that's a feast for the eyes, you'll like it. If you're looking for an enjoyable cast of characters trying to keep order in an anarchic alien NYC, you'll like it. If you want a show that will make you smile from ear to ear and weep within a relatively short time, you'll like it. I'll see you in Hellsalem's Lot.",

            "content": "For a show that had so much potential, Kekkai Sensen is fairly forgettable. Its conclusion is riddled with issues, made worse by the fact that it was delayed several weeks. However, that's not to say that the series isn't somewhat enjoyable.\r\nThe first seven episodes of Kekkai Sensen are standalone stories, introducing different aspects of the show's universe. I say \"introducing\" because nothing is properly developed. After watching these seven episodes I can't say that I know anything about how Hellsalem's Lot works, what Libra's place in the city is, nor the extent of the powers of each character. Nevertheless, these episodes are entertaining enough, withplenty of action and comedy to carry the show. The characters aren't developed either, but they are still enjoyable to watch.\\n\\n\r\nThe problems really come to light after episode seven. For the rest of the series, there is a double episode on Zapp followed by the multi-episode finale. The Zapp episodes provide some insight into his life, but most of it is shallow and used for comedy. After that, we're at the finale without knowing much about the world of Kekkai Sensen or its characters. This makes it very difficult to understand or even care about what's at stake. The finale drags on with the tone changing constantly, making everything feel jarring. \\n\\n\r\nThere are many ways that Kekkai Sensen could have addressed these problems. The simplest would be expanding to a 26 episode series allowing time to develop characters. Another idea would be to use those early episodes to focus more on character development, taking away some of the time spent on comedy. Or, they could have begun the ongoing story leading up to the finale earlier. Either way, what the series ended up doing was falling short of all of these ideas.\\n\\n\r\nNevertheless, I still would recommend that fans of action comedies should give this anime a go, at least for the first nine episodes. The action is entertaining and there are plenty of jokes throughout. Visually it is nice to see the unique designs of monsters and the animations for the characters' fighting moves. The OP and ED is also pretty fantastic. However, I wouldn't recommend that anyone bother with the final three episodes as they are a waste of time.\\n\\n\r\nI'd give the first nine episodes a 7/10, while the last three would be a 3/10.",

            "content": "Ah kekkai sensen, the show with the sexiest and catchiest ending I have ever seen. Like really just watching those characters partying in the ending song, all their cool outfits and amazing designs, oozing with style is already enough to put a big smile on my face. Hell I would argue this is show is worth it for that alone\r\nIn regards to other aspects my endorsement for that show is not as precedent though. The show does contain an intriguing premise, a very unique setting, a strange world where creatures for another dimension coexist with human beings, and where the abnormal can happen at anygiven moment. Like really there was such a great amount of effort to make every location, through restaurants, to cemeteries, to illegal brawl clubs to feel distinct and cool that I got to hand it to them, hellsalem lott is a very fun setting that I am excited to see again in a sequel.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is not that special, we have your usual attornment journey for our protagonist, that is trying to find more and luckily to fix a mistake he made in his past, in search of that he joins a special group called libra, that ensures the safe coexistence between mankind, and other species in the city. From there on the plot is fairly episodic, mostly containing self-contained encounters of this group, while slowly building to the climax of the series. While most of the episodic stories where rushed to no end, making it kind of hard to care for some of what was going, the fun and widely variable physical encounters, always helped to maintain things flesh and entertaining.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are also a colorful bunch of different stereotypes and quirks, such simple characterization worked because their interesting interactions, all the character\u2019s personalities, bounced of each other, in creative and dynamic ways. I cannot say anyone besides Leonardo, and the two primary antagonists got much in terms development or fleshing out, but I was satisfied with what I got out of them, they are simply loveable bunch of idiots I never got tired of seeing on screen.\\n\r\nHad you realized where usually are the points where I gave the most praise above? It is both in character design, and to make every location seem memorable, and from that alone you can figure out the aesthetics are the primary appeal of the show, the memorable locations, the unique and cool as fuck designs most characters contain, the incredible fight choreography, and animation specially during fight scenes. The animators went all out to make this project, and that really pays off. It is not as impressive of some of studio bones, other works like mob psycho 100, and the directing never was so out there in really interesting ways, like in the director, matsumoto rie, previous work kyousougiga. But this was still a sight to behold at all moments. A perfectly fitting soundtrack also helps to complement all of that.\\n\r\nIn terms of theming I am at a loss when it comes to kekkai sensen. Was it supposed to explore regret, finding ways to forgive yourself, find your own value in life despite past events, in Leonardo character arc? If so I never got the impression much was done in terms of that, he eventually finds people that can appreciate him for what he is, and even learns to accept their praise, and they give him the courage of finally facing his mistakes, in the form of writing to his sister. But not much in the series actually builds to that. The king of despair, and his predicament of learning to let go of the thing he cares the most, is linked to that, the interaction between black and white is the obvious parallel. If developed further this could be really interesting, so I guess I will have to wait for the sequel to have a deeper knowledge on that\\n\\n\r\nLuckily in the middle of this rambling mess you can find out this is a show for you. I enjoyed every second of it, being a big fan of director, matsumoto rie style. But there are some very noticeable shortcomings. It sure as hell does not have much in terms of a coherent story, or an overall thematic significance, it works mostly for the rule of cool and action. But the ed is as masterful as you can imagine so at least give that a watch.\\n",

            "content": "This anime is fairly good, there's monsters, superpowers, fantasy creatures of all kinds and pretty much action. The comedy is half-arsed and this doesn't deserve to have the comedy tag just because some characters are walking retards and act like idiots. The drama is overdone, spending entire episodes sometimes to explain a backstory that no one should really care about instead of giving us a fast summary.\r\nNow, the thing that I hated the most is the mc, his personality is kind of annoying and he's a freaking pushover just like the rest of these people. This is why japanese people can't write proper half-serious stuff.Anything that isn't plain out horror and tragedy tagged would usually always have mc's that are idiots with sh*t for brains and flowery views on the world. \\n\\n\r\nThis guy is a wimp with no real powers except for good sight(being able to see things normal people can't) and being able to manipulate what people see(mind you, not huge illusions but rather single-person specific illusions that only they see). Even the powers he has isn't utilized properly since he's clearly not interested in learning to fight in any way whatsoever despite pretty much living in a hell where you can die at a second's notice, like many other japanese protagonists, he just goes with the flow and keeps on being an useless prick, even in season 2 random punks with no skill beat him up easily as he acts like a total amateur and can't do anything but stand there. \\n\\n\r\nHe can't bear to kill people(surprise, surprise, he's the type who'd choose a stun gun instead of a sword or gun when his life is on the line), he's way too kind to everyone and meek to the point of being a doormat for people to step on. When he gets assaulted by people privately, he just takes a beating because he claims that he doesn't like using his powers for himself. He beats himself up over some bullsh*t past where his sister sacrificed her vision for him out of her own volition, so he feels like it's his fault despite having no guilt at all in the whole matter. Hell, his character is stupid to a flaw. When he's offered increased wages, which isn't more than right considering the extreme danger and the work he does for them, he denies and says he just wants the basic wages even when he needs/wants to send money back to his sister and he needs money to live, especially as his apartments keeps on getting blown into the air, he spends most of his time living in the office of their organization. But of course he can't accept the amount of money he should be getting! I mean, is he retarded or something?\\n\\n\r\nHe's honestly a very boring and pretty frustrating, even obnoxious character. He's a \"normal\" person with exaggerated, extreme \"courage\",\"self-sacrifice spirit\" and \"kindness\" thrown into that hellish place. It's just stupid. He can only be protected by everyone, or he'd die instantly. Even when he should be able to handle himself if he learned some proper abilities, but since he never showed the initiative or motivation to get stronger or use his powers, it's all for naught. It's so damn mushy. Mind you, this \"japanese shounen protagonist personality\" wouldn't be an issue in a normal manga/novel/anime. The issue is that fighting is kind of the whole thing here. If you don't fight, you die. If you don't strive to get better, you should die. Everyone is killing everyone and it's supposed to be a brutal world. A mc like that DOESN'T WORK in an environment like this. Leave that type of crap for the romcom and slice-of-life stuff. Not saying he has to be a brutal monster, even if that would be hilarious and kind of awesome/fresh for a japanese work, but at the very least he should be cold-hearted enough to pull the trigger and kill people when needed, to not get pushed around and whine about every single little detail. He's already devoid of care when it comes to seeing dead people(he doesn't even wince when people get blown to bits or hundreds/thousands of people are dead in front of him), why force things and make him so kind etc? \\n\\n\r\nYou know what I thought when I saw this was a story about a mc with super vision and special eyes? Yeah, I thought he would become a gun user. Especially a sniper+pistol user, that'd be awesome. Now that'd be a mc I can get behind, a super-powered fantasy sniper rifle and handgun combo. Using his eyes to find flaws and critical points and shooting them like a sniper god. I mean, wouldn't that be a kind of obvious use of his otherwise fairly non-combat eyes, especially since he's not the athletic and muscular type who can go close-combat? So many possibilities, he could even use his eyes to temporarily blind others/show them illusions and then in that opening shoot. But of course he won't do so, because he might as well not have his eyes, he's not using them properly at all, not even once did I see him firing a gun, not even at first when he was given one. It feels like an useless gimmick. This author is clearly not that good at writing an interesting and awesome story. This story would easily shoot up to the heavens if the mc was more awesome and used his eyes like a badass.\\n\\n\r\nSo enough about the fact that the mc is a dimwit. The other people in this story are often kind of boring as well, especially since a lot of time is spent on the backgrounds on characters that hardly matter and less time is spent on those we actually want to know about. I wanted to know more about the background of the boss, the werewolf girl etc, but we don't know who they are or even truly what they are. Nothing much is explained here, so I can't feel attached to any of the characters, although I honestly liked that fanged werewolf-like boss the most, not that I was that fond of his overly simple personality and straightforwardness. Some people are there only for comedic relief, such as the white-haired, tanned guy who is nothing but a retard that can't wait to show off how foolish he is and how much he can overreact.\\n\\n\r\nSorry, me rating this 5/10 is because it wasn't THAT bad, it was mediocre. It's worth watching if you don't have anything much left to watch, it's sure to kill several hours of your life with nothing exceptional yet something that doesn't bore you to death unlike some stuff out there that you'd rather drop than keep on watching. I have to say that after several episodes of season 2 though, I dropped it. It had the same premise, the same type of story, the same type of jokes and events etc, only filled even more with how worthless the mc is and more half-arsed drama. It takes a turn for the worse and is only worth a 3/10 at season 2. The mc hasn't matured and nothing seems to really happen. Truly bland. Even if you watch this stuff, don't watch season 2, it's got nothing to offer. Pretend the show ended at season 1, which I guess it kind of did since they summed up the entire manga with season one and went on to the sequel manga with season 2. I seem to have read that the plot diverges a lot from the manga and there seems to be way more story in the manga, so maybe the manga is much better than this anime version.",

            "content": "(Disclaimer: I will cover both seasons of Kekkai Sensen in this review, but I won't go into spoilers at all, except for maybe in the characters section.)\r\nI had fun with Kekkai Sensen. It may have taken me weeks to finish 24 episodes and an ova (the second one pending), but I had a good time. However, I can't ignore the fact that it really polarized me overall. Sure, I enjoyed it, but there were a lot of times where I literally groaned and struggled through seemingly another pointless episode. These downs were what made me take nearly a month and a half to actually finishKekkai Sensen, even though I'll say that it was a pretty good show.\\n\\n\r\nYou can't talk about Kekkai Sensen without talking about how beautifully and fluidly it was animated and how banging the soundtrack was, especially season one's. For the animation, the fight scenes are undoubtedly some of the best in anime, the way that each character has their own fighting style and applications create for some impressive sequences. Even if the character models weren't drawn immaculately all the time, you could always count on the animation of each episode to impress.\\n\r\nBefore I go down the rabbit hole that is the soundtrack, I want to make a minor note about the voice acting, especially the dub being fantastic. It was always an epic moment when characters like Steven or Klaus went in for their final moves and suddenly started spewing their the names of their finisher in another language. Anyway, just wanted to show some appreciation for great voice acting.\\n\r\nNow, the soundtrack. I don't how I'm going to say more than, \"It's so good.\" To be honest, it may be one of the best soundtracks in anime, if only for the fact that it's so varied and fitting to its setting. Every insert song or instrumental piece fits into the jazzy, urban atmosphere that Hellsalem's Lot exudes. However, nothing in the first 23 episodes could prepare me for getting blindsided in the feels by the best song to come from the soundtrack. Honestly, if I was more fickle, I'd raise my score for Kekkai Sensen by 5 to 10 points for Tortoise Knight alone, but instead of talking more about it, I'll just link it here:\\n\\n\r\nFavorite Character: Mary Macbeth (White)\\n\\n\r\nI mean, let's be honest, the only character challenging her for this spot is Chain. The thing about White though, is that she really provided Leo with interesting interaction outside of his work with Libra, which was a nice break from the chaos of Hellsalem's Lot. The first season really needed White to help provide you with more of a personal connection with Leo, who honestly, I thought was pretty useless most of the time. But around White, you couldn't help but cheer for him to get the girl, because\\ their interactions were so damn cute.\\n\\n\r\nThis is the part where, I take a turn from my radiantly positive attitude. I mentioned earlier that I was extremely polarized by Kekkai Sensen. Most of that polarization is from the episodic nature, I think. It's so hard to binge out Kekkai Sensen, because it feels like there's no thread tying the world together. Instead, every episode is a single story, making the good episodes feel really fulfilling, but making the bad ones excruciating. I don't think this issue was helped by the fact that I wasn't interested in Zapp very much, and he dominated many of season one's episodes, which set the tone for me to watch the series. In fact, I can't say that I loved many of the simple, one-off episodes that dominate the series. There were a few that I really enjoyed, like Gilbert and Chain's episodes in season 2, the hospital episode, and the Aligula episode in season 1. There are a couple more that I at least was pleased with, but these few were the standout one-offs to me. I think a lot of the episodes that didn't impress me simply didn't have a good focal character, which made me bored of them from the beginning. A lot of this may be just my taste, but I feel if someone doesn't like all the characters, you're going to struggle through certain episodes.\\n\\n\r\nKekkai Sensen's greatest strength is loosely tied to my complaints too. See? Polarizing. Anyway, Kekkai Sensen's greatest strength lies in its world. Enter Hellsalem's Lot, perhaps the greatest world in anime. What makes Hellsalem's Lot so special? It's simple: the city is it's own character. Kekkai Sensen simply wouldn't be the same without the craziness of the city that they never fail to show us with each episode. We think we've seen the most unbelievable thing the city can throw at us, then it turns around and throws something else at us. The thing is, the city provides us with a sort of continuity that we take for granted after living in the city with the characters for a little while. It becomes the norm for us too, which is what makes it so special. All these crazy one-off episodes are basically created at complete freedom, because of how much room to maneuver the setting provides the writers. Honestly, it's really impressive. I think the fact that each and every citizen, alien or human, is drawn really helps immerse us even more in the world. We see the weirdness, instead of get told how weird Hellsalem's Lot is.\\n\\n\r\nI find it hard to actually criticize Kekkai Sensen, because I realize how well it pulled me into the setting now that I've written all of this. I think all it would take to love Kekkai Sensen is more of an overarching reason to the story. It gets touched on here and there, but mostly gets ignored. I guess Michella doesn't really matter that much, after all. I kid, but it would be nice to see some progression to the plot behind Leo's eyes and her blindness. I'm probably asking for Kekkai Sensen to become something that it isn't though, so I'll be happy to be a fan of what it is, rather than what I think it should be.",

            "content": "This review doesn't contain spoilers, and will cover my thoughts for both seasons of Blood Blockade Battlefront as my opinions on each season are basically the same.\r\nBlood Blockade Battlefront is a simple but really entertaining series that has some great animation, great action, a great cast, and a healthy dose of humor. There is an overarching story, but it is simple and straightforward. The series is very episodic and more character driven. The main character is the only one with a significant character arc, but all of the main and supporting characters have at least one episode dedicated to fleshing out their characters. This ishardly the most complex cast of characters you will see, but most have some depth. All the characters are funny, relatable, cool, bad ass, likeable, and work off each other so well that I didn't mind their relative simplicity. Despite its general simplicity there are a small handful emotional moments/episodes that work pretty well for the most part.\\n\r\nThe word I could use to describe this series best would be fun. It takes itself just seriously enough for you to like and invest in these characters for the few emotional parts, but not so seriously that it conflicts with the show's mostly light hearted tone. The show keeps a nice balance of humor, action, emotion to keep the series from feeling to repetitive. Blood Blockade Battlefront also has some pretty good music too.\\n\\n\r\nThis series is by Studio BONES so if you have seen Cowboy Bebop, My Hero Academia, Fullmetal Alchemist, Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood, Soul Eater, Sword of the Stranger, Mob Psycho 100, Space Dandy or any other of their numerous work, you know that Blood Blockade Battlefront will have some pretty damn good action and animation. \\n\\n\r\nIn terms of negatives some of the side characters don't get much development, but like I said earlier, I did not really mind. The only other problem I had was the pacing. I cannot really go into specifics without going into spoilers, but the main plot is concentrated more in one season than the other.\\n\\n\r\nIf you are looking for an action series with lots of depth, you can do a lot better than Blood Blockade Battlefront. However, if you are in the mood for a more light hearted action series that has plenty of humor, great animation, a really solid cast, some effective emotion, and plenty of variety I could not recommend Blood Blockade Battlefront highly enough.\\n\r\nSide note: this series is also from the creator of Trigun, an older anime that is really good that you might also enjoy if you liked this series and vice versa.",

            "content": "Kekkai Sensen, a very complicated, hard to understand, but very unique and nice anime series!\r\nStory: 3\r\nLets start with the story. The story itself was.... well... how should I put it? It was more like I just didn't get it. 90% of the time, I was just trying to understand what was happening, since there wasn't much explanation given plus there was just a lot of randomness. Since it was all very hard to follow, I also had a hard time feeling connected to the characters of the series. Nonetheless, I found the concept and how it was executed very unique and I had never watcheda series like this before.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 10\\n\r\nThe art in this series was amazing. They put so much attention to details, from the buildings to the lighting, it was all executed perfectly. I also really liked their color choices. It gave you straight away a good idea of the kind of setting the story played at. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 8\\n\r\nI also really liked the soundtracks in this series. Just like the art-style, it really suited the setting of this series, which was New York-ish, so I thought it was a good idea to use western style music. The soundtracks also portrayed well the \"mood\" of the town. If I were to explain what I mean by this, is that in the town were everything happens, the everyday chaos has become \"normal\" and no one seems to be amazed by it anymore. Just like that, the soundtracks are actually quite chill, compared to the all the chaotic things that happen in this series, which I though was very fitting.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 7\\n\r\nI thought the characters in this series were alright. I liked their character designs and overall, the series had a great cast of voice actors. However, they weren't very special in general and I didn't feel really attached to them, especially to the side characters. This could also be because of the chaotic story and because you don't get any background stories, except a little bit from the main protagonist and the main antagonist. I did like the main character though. I liked how his character wasn't over the top and how he could stay calm in every situation, again fitting well with the concept of the series. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 6\\n\r\nI did really like the concept of this series. I found it very unique and enjoyable. However, I think it could've been executed much better, if they made it less chaotic and a bit easier to understand for the audience. Like I said before, I was most of the time just trying the understand what was happening and I think at some point I just gave up on trying to understand. Nonetheless, I still enjoyed watching it because of its unique concept, the mix between cheerfulness and chaos and western style setting.\\n\\n\r\nSo overall, I give this series a 7. I would recommend it, if you're looking for something unique to watch and would like to see something out of the box. As I said, the art is great, so much that I got amazed by it a couple of times and I also got surprised pleasantly multiple times by their choice of music. However, I have to warn you, there isn't much to understand in this series, so if you decide to watch it, don't try too hard to get it and just enjoy ;)",

            "content": "Firstly, I'd like to address the type of storytelling used, as it can be a hook for some, and an instant turnoff for others. The series is being told in a very disjointed manner that has jumps in the pacing throughout. Many events that would take multiple episodes in most shows will play through in a few scenes, which gives the entire series a very manic pacing and overall feel. This is very possibly done on purpose, and if so, it's done with good style.\r\nThe actual narrative is somewhat unique, and takes a big turn at some point going in a direction most people probablywouldn't expect. Some loose ends are left untied, and the viewer is left with far more questions than answers, but the ride is plenty fun. World building seems at first to be taking place, but is very quickly shut down before you can get any real understanding from it. I would still give the story 7/10 for being unique, interesting, and somewhat emotional.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOkay, let's tackle the sound and art in the series. I watched this series in dub, so I'll be talking mostly about the dub here. All of the VAs for the main characters seemed to fit the roles very well, and the voice acting was nicely done. From an objective standpoint, I can say that there wasn't quite as much energy or emotion in a lot of the voice acting as there could have been, but it still works out alright. Lots of VAs that you'll likely be familiar with such as J Michael Tatum.\\n\\n\r\nBoth the opening and ending themes capture the feel of the show well, and I personally found them enjoyable. The animation in both was very well done, and the opening comes out especially visually pleasing. The animation for the series as a whole was pretty average, having some nice fight scenes here and there, but also using still frames in scenes where budget required. The artistic style however was very nice, and remained solid through the entire series. Art I'd give 8/10 mainly for the style, and sound 8/10 for its lack of any noticeable flaws, and an A-list VA cast.\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe characters I'll only touch on very quickly. They were all very interesting, but they weren't as fleshed out as they could've been. Some character were very 2-dimensional with obvious motives, others were more complex but never given a chance to shine. Overall the characters were well done for how fast paced the show became, and for that I'd give the show 7/10 for characters.\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe overall enjoyment in the series comes more from style of the show, and how all the elements really mesh together. There's no easy way to describe why this show is as enjoyable as it is, but in the simplest word, it's fun. This show reminded me of why I loved Soul Eater, and if you enjoyed Soul Eater too, Blood Blockade Battlefront is a must see. The manic pace and atmosphere in this show play off of each other until you can't help but give in to its wacky nature. The entire thing feels like a roller coaster.\\n\\n\r\nIf there's one qualm I have with it, it's the last episode. The final episode is extra length, slower pace, and goes in a much different direction than I had expected. Don't get your hopes up for the finale to be the best part of the show, it's not. Still, there wasn't a single scene in this show that I didn't like, so I'll give 10/10 for the enjoyment.\\n\\n\r\nOverall this show gets 8/10 from an objective standpoint, and from a personal standpoint I'd give it a 9/10.\\n\r\nIf you liked the pacing in Baccano or Durarara, you'll enjoy this show. If you like the style in Soul Eater, you'll love this show. If you're not sure, give the first episode a try, it encapsulates the feel of the series nicely.\\n\\n\r\nIf you read all of that, thanks for your time. I hope this review was helpful.",

            "content": "\"Welcome to my review\"\r\nWords that I never imagined my self typing due to the absurdity of the statement (how do you welcome someone into a review? Its like saying welcome to my article, its just stupid.) and the fact of well, I don't write reviews. \r\nNow if you would excuse my shortcomings I am by no means the end all be all of reviews and do not intend to write myself off as that, I am simply here to provide input to help you decide whether to watch this anime or not.\r\nSimply put Kekkai Sensen is all over the place. The story is disjointed andcharacters seem to drop in and out with focuses going from one place to another providing no sense of structure until it decide to throw over arching plot at you when it sees fit. Now this might present itself as a problem to some who don't enjoy this kind of story telling. IN fact some might go as far as to call it lazy writing, and deem it un watchable. Understandable but the beauty of the show is the fact that is it is all over the place. You see the problem with this site is either you are one of the two extremes. You give something a 10/10 or a 5/10 because around here there is no damn in between. Even reviews that write and anime as 7/10 or 8/10 might as well be 5/10 or 10/10 because they write the damn review praising the anime or pointing out so many flaws you'd think they have a personal vendetta against the damn thing. (not that pointing out flaws makes an anime bad its just you don't speak much on the behalf of the good things.)\\n\\n\r\nSo in my hypocrisy to shorten things up and tie them in a pretty unruly, unkempt bow, Kekkai Sensen is a enjoyable anime, plain and simple. Watch it and then decide whether you like it or not. Ultimately none of us who write reviews can speak for anyone else, so don't even pay attention to them, if you think  an anime is interesting than fucking watch it. Since when do you need a person to hold your hand and tell you what to watch?? \\n\\n",

            "content": "Some anime are able to create an atmosphere of pure fun and excitement where we feel like we're in laughing, crying, and dancing along with the characters themselves. Kekkai Sensen is exactly this. \r\nSTORY: 7\r\nThe story...how do I explain this? Kekkai Sensen is an example of a disjointed story where it focuses more on the characters and interactions themselves, slowly building the story itself. Anyone who has seen Gintama or Durarara!! will be understand more about where I'm going. \r\n\"A breach between Earth and the netherworlds has opened up over the city of New York, trapping New Yorkers and creatures from other dimensions in animpenetrable bubble. They've lived together for years, in a world of crazy crime sci-fi sensibilities. Now someone is threatening to sever the bubble, and a group of stylish superhumans is working to keep it from happening.\" (MyAnimeList)\\n\\n\r\nIt seems all simple at first but the characters are where the story really shines.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER: 10\\n\r\nEvery single character in this show is lovable. Every single one. \\n\\n\r\nLeonardo Watch is our protagonist, a young photographer from Holland who comes to New York City to earn money for his little sister. Although he has a humble and fun personality, we find out more about his character as the story progresses. His sister had lost her eyesight due to a trade Leonardo made, giving him the \"All-Seeing Eyes of God\" which give him ocular powers and the ability to see through things normal humans would not necessarily see.  He feels guilty about this throughout the anime and tries to do his best to prove himself by joining an organization called Libra.\\n\\n\r\nKlaus Von Reinherz is the leader of Libra. He has a lot of charisma and always brings the best out of everyone. Klaus serves to be Leo's mentor and guide.\\n\\n\r\nZap Renfro is a part of Libra and is an eccentric, womanizing, badass. He is always hyper, hungry, and wants women. Zap's got a lot of personality and the chemistry with him and the other characters is a pleasure to watch.\\n\\n\r\nWhite/Mary Macbeth is a young girl who Leo meets in New York City. At first, she seems to serve as a girl who Leo has a crush on but she becomes very important as it goes on. Especially when her brother, Black/Will Macbeth is introduced. \\n\\n\r\nART: 9\\n\r\nIt's beautiful. New York City is animated very well and the lighting in each scene is perfect. The character designs are very classy and I especially love the way Leo's, White's, and Black's eyes are animated. They are bright and it really grabs your attention.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND: 10\\n\r\nI can't remember the last time I gave a 10 for music but Kekkai Sensen NAILS it. The music ranges from very jazzy music to a great \"What a Wonderful World\" rendition. The music matches the characters and the setting so well, increasing the enjoyment of fun scenes but also the tragic scenes. The opening, \"Hello, World!\" is so great, highlighting the big atmosphere of the anime and the Leonardo's character. The ending, IS AMAZING! \"Sugar Song to the Bitter Step\" captures the fun and carefree nature of the show perfectly. The dancing, the partying, and the mellow moments are masterfully directed on top of colorful animation. \\n\\n\r\nThe voice-actors for both the sub and the dub were excellent. Daisuke Sakaguchi and Aaron Dismuke did a wonderful job with Leo's voice. I rarely watch anime in dub as well but I had no issues of going back and forth with Kekkai Sensen. People who are familiar with Gintama character will be happy to hear that almost half the cast is voiced by Gintama voice actors! Kazuya Nakai voices Zap and really gets all his energy perfectly on screen. He also voices Zoro from One Piece so fans will be able to see his more self-centered and eccentric self. Overall, the music and the voice-acting were great!\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10\\n\r\nThe characters and the music made this show for me. \"Sugar Song to the Bitter Step\" has become one of my favorite songs of all time and the characters leave a strong impression on you. I was fortunate to watch this anime after Episode 12 had released so for the viewers who had to wait for 3 months for it might not have liked it as much or maybe liked it more. This anime is all about having a fun time but the darker moments present some great philosophical questions as well. \\n\\n\r\nIf there's anything more I would want, I would like to have some more fight scenes but we saw some great ones regardless. Additionally...I WANT A SEASON 2!!!!!!!!!\\n\\n\r\nCheck this anime out guys! You will not be disappointed!\\n\\n\\n\\n",
