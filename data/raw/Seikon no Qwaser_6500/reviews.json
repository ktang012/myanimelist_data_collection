            "content": "What would you do if you had the power to control an element, and power it up through breast milk?\r\nI'd be scared of babies.\r\nAnyhow, Seikon no Qwaser is... a unique concept. I first did not want to watch it due to the overwhelming amount of boobs. Really. Then I heard that it had a second season. I gave it a second try and found it amusing.\r\nSince the plot summary is already written in the anime info, I won't bother including a long one.\r\nAlexander BlahBlahvich, aka Sasha comes to this school to find this relic. He clashes at first with two female students, Mafuyu and Tomowhatevertheirnamesare. Turns out they're special. And now Sasha has to protect em by sucking girls' breast milk, or 'Soma' to empower his control of iron. Other Qwasers, like him, control a metal element (and I whip up my periodic table), well whatever, you'll just understand if you are good in chemistry. An example would be Katja-sama and her wonderful copper. There's a catch though. They all want that relic as well.\\n\r\nThe story is normal. And what do I mean by normal? I mean that there is a main character and his mascots searching for something, and bad guys want it too. That's all there is to it, really. Just prepare yourselves for some plot twists and awesome wtf moments where Sasha just beats the shit out of stuff after sucking on breasts. Isn't it just normal?\\n\\n\r\nThe characters of this anime are your unoriginal harem characters. Tsundere Mafuyu, airhead Tomo, quietly obedient Teresa. And then comes Sasha (Alexander). How cute, a tsundere shotacon. Not much creativity in the character department, and as always, the female tsundere will have feelings for the male protagonist. Other characters make the show more fun to it. Who could ignore lovely Miyuri? And you should definitely bow down to Katja if you like  BDSM. I'll shut up now. Did I mention that Sasha has a horrible past? Hence his name Sasha the Martyr. Maybe.\\n\r\nIt's nice to see Sasha's development throughout the anime. I mean, he turns /nice/. And Mafuyu? A bit more honest than before. Otherwise, there is nothing else to include. Maybe the fact that Tomo can cook a bit at the end of the anime.\\n\\n\r\nThe background music was boring. I could remember the only 5 tracks it has (I'm guessing here). Once you hear one, you can tell what's going to come next. There's one for breastfeeding time, two battle themes, bah. It's fitting but not good enough.\\n\r\nVoice acting is good. If you watch it, you can tell. Problem is the Russian they put in and the way Mafuyu pronounces Alexander. Damn she makes it sound painful. I was glad when she started calling him Sasha. Another flaw with VA however, is the moaning noises. Please, make it stooooop. Does sucking breasts really create such ecstasy that you cannot keep your mouth shut? Well maybe it's different when the Qwasers do it. I wouldn't know.\\n\r\nOP and ED were fitting. Had a slight, how do you call it, 'church' feel to it. The first ending was so eargasmic. All those lovely voice actresses singing one song. /applause. Nothing special after the first ED. Beats the rest.\\n\\n\r\nArt? What art? These things are just women with large blobs attached to their chest. I'm referring to the majority of the characters, of course. \\n\r\nOkay, fine, the art is good. Only parts when you can wince is when there are naked breasts. An overload of them. When I see Tomo, it's like a walking pair of fleshy blobs. And then I see nothing else.\\n\r\nHuh? Of course I watched the uncensored version. I didn't understand it when it was censored. So watch the uncensored one; makes more sense.\\n\\n\r\nPfuuuu, enjoyment. I enjoyed this anime. This actually made me feel like chemistry lessons were useful. I also liked the characters, especially Sasha and that tomboy with titanium powers.\\n\\n\r\nFinal verdict? Watch it if you want to. 24 episodes of boobs is a lot, and I watched them in 3 days. or something. \\n\r\nShort version:\\n\r\nArt was good, story was okay, sound was bleh, except for voice acting, character was bleh. Overall: GOOD.\\n\\n\r\nOff to watch the second season.\\n\\n\r\n\"Tremble!\"",

            "content": "Hey this is my first review.I'll try to be forthcoming as humanly possible with this show.Thirdly this review is premature with only 2 episodes in which have aired.\r\nStory- Essentially we have a silver haired character named Alexander who needs a certain form of sustenance in order to gain the energy needed for his metaphysical unravelling of the iron atom.Now what would that be, wait for it breast milk....Well isn't that the most enthralling and original concept to have surfaced in an anime.There is the local grocery store in which you can buy milk....or you can suck on a taciturn girl with gargantuan tits.Now to moveon. Alexander can morph iron at a mollecular level but he needs the milk. He finds himself at an Eastern Orthodox School on the fringes of being in conflict with a secret society.. This has been done before even though there might be an accumulative amount of symbolism(hence the scar).Where is Robert Langdon when you need him......?\\n\\n\r\nArt-Not exactly captivating or filled with guile. Even though the outlines around the girls and the luminous colours do accentuate a darker background.We also have the shounen art doctrine....chunky blocks that are suppose to suffice as hair.\\n\\n\r\nSound-The song is placating to an extent in trying to precipitate a contrite vibe in making you feel sorry for the characters past.For the most part the sound acclimates to its surroundings. With a dosage of fighting music and jaded features of techno alongside it.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter-You have an arcane male lead who has a horrendous past in Alexander. The first female lead is the typical bombastic and  or wind bag namely Oribe and then of course the reticent cohort Yamanobe who's been anointed as Alexanders personal dairy farm.Last but not least we have the dull minor villians and the minor characters who might play dress up at a gothic convention. Not everyone in Eastern Europe dresses like a surceased vitamin D drained goth.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment-Nonplussed for the most part. There's nothing to be ebullient or happy about in watching this.\\n\\n\r\nOverall- Devoid of intellect, stifling the romanticism of Eastern europe with its gaudy fashion and vacuous concepts and characters.\\n\\n",

            "content": "My review is based on what i grabbed watching 3/4 of episode 1. I couldn't bear continuing nor finishing episode 1.\r\nTo start of, i watched this series knowing what to expect. I'm just curios and disbelieved with the plot summary and wanted to know just how much of it is true, and how bad can an anime be.\r\nComing back to this anime, i graded this anime as 1/10 because it is that bad. For those looking for non-ecchi anime, this is NOT for you.For those looking for ecchi anime this is also NOT for you.  So who is the intended audience then?\r\n1. People whowants to know how bad it is.\\n\r\n2. People wanted to see girls stripped of their dignity and getting  molested by a gray-haired young man who finds nothing wrong doing it because it gives him power.\\n\\n\r\nI've never been a fan of ecchi anime, but at least i watched enough random 1-2 episodes or to-love-ru and other ecchi animes to be able to know what they are. This is totally different, this anime is more like hentai, it put female dignity to other nothingness and let a gray-haired man (signifies old man?) sucks their oversized boobs on national television. Even porn or hentai puts female of higher standards, they still see her as a female. This anime doesn't.\\n\\n\r\nBeing a 2010 anime, this anime is decently well animated with less than decent sound.  So why 4 and 6 for those category? The art is decent at best, but nothing stands out, nothing original. Ironically, what pulls down the art in this anime, are the tits of the girls of this series. To me, F-sized cup girls is more disgusting than beautiful. Too much of anything is never good. For the sound department, the only reason of why i gave it a 6 is , 5 because of the casts of the seiyuus and 1 for the script/music. I do not get how on earth, they get this seiyuus to dub this anime. Its like asking heath ledger to play 40 years old virgin.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment, as mentioned above, I'm more disgusted than not watching this so enjoyment is 1/10 without a doubt. I've watched mars of destruction and i know how bad it is. This anime, its just as bad or worst. The plot is horrendous but the idea of looking at girls pried being put down to the level that is of a cow just doesn't feel like for a man in the right mind like me. You know those commercials that drinking milk is good for your health, its like watching those but instead of drinking the milk from proper packages, you suck it directly from the cow.\\n\\n\r\nThis series is SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO bad, unless its intentional like mars of destruction is, the director has got to be an idiot. My only hope for this anime is that it doesn't destroy hirano aya's carrier. I really liked her but if her carrier is ruined because of this i'll be pissed as hell.",

            "content": "I couldn\u2019t enjoy the flow of the show, because it was so thoroughly distracting. The show couldn\u2019t make you keep a straight face, because every time you were serious for a battle, you just had to see some twit suckling a nipple. Everything that the producers and writers and developers of the last 30 years have tried to hide, was totally shit on. All the stupid coincidences of leaves blocking certain areas or objects closer to the screen that block a body \u2013 even the steam aspect of those ecchi genres made them what they were: ecchi! Quite honestly, that\u2019s the way it was supposedto stay. If you wanted anything more, you could\u2019ve gone to watch some porn somewhere! But this anime was completely outrageous. \\n\\n\r\nStory:\\n\r\nThe story was unique, but so poorly played out and depicted, that it brings it all down to mediocre. The unique part being breast milk as a catalyst for power. True, not every show should follow in the EXACT footsteps of the last, but they could have at least stuck to the traditional way of dealing with ecchi shows. I AM a guy, but that doesn\u2019t mean I was looking for porn when watching anime. The whole loli goth thing was attractive enough of an idea, but it was misconstrued with the clash of so many unneeded characters. The whole story can all be summed up in two words: FAN SERVICE.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nThe art was good. It is by no means a great animated show, but it isn\u2019t horrible. It\u2019s essentially average animation for an anime. Everything was well enough depicted, and the nudity was ON PAR with most hentai. Anime should rarely be on par with hentai, which is why this is such a huge issue. There are more nipple shots in this show then there are black men in Lisa Lampanelli at any given moment. \\n\\n\r\nSounds:\\n\r\nNow admittedly, the soundtrack wasn\u2019t bad. The opening wasn\u2019t bad. The ending was ok. That\u2019s about all there was. The rest of the soundtrack was forgettable. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nThis was probably the worst category of them all. You cant get passed the characters self reflections who ask themselves moral questions, only to realize that it didn\u2019t really matter, because it goes right back to the norm (nipple sucking) the next episode. More than that, the dumb bimbo with huge tits isnt even needed, because there is really no point to having her. True, she does play a big role at the end, but the point is that she didn\u2019t HAVE to be dumb as shit. She could\u2019ve been a regular girl. Even a smart girl. And it wouldn\u2019t have mattered. And that\u2019s what urks me. I think that every character should be placed and have a personality/attitude that\u2019s relevant to the entire story. IF the story has a character who could easily be the exact opposite (personality/looks wise) and the story would still work perfectly, then it\u2019s a wasted character, and its value/existence in the show is useless. Another character that pisses me off is the main character himself: Alexander (or Sasha for short for some reason\u2026).  Though the majority of his pictures make him look like a hard badass, how he\u2019s played throughout the show is disgusting. \\n\r\nThe spoiler runs till the next topic, btw.\\n\\n\r\n*SPOILER*\\n\r\nI know I shouldn\u2019t add a spoiler, but the one part that almost made me drop the series was when he lost his memory and thought he was a girl. I\u2019m not bothered by a cross dressing anime character, but Sasha, being the badass that he is supposed to be, started to turn into a cross dressing feminine b*tch who  just made me want to leave the series alone and never even look at the name of the show again.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nI couldn\u2019t enjoy it. There were so many babes with huge boobs that I couldn\u2019t really pay attention to the story. The only possible enjoyment I got from watching this was the fan service. And that\u2019s what the entire story is. Fan service. Nothing more, nothing less. Actually, a little more. I don\u2019t consider nipple sucking fan service, I consider it hentai. So yeah. \\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nOverall, the story could\u2019ve been a lot better. It should\u2019ve played out in a more conservative manner, and it would\u2019ve been better received, and probably could\u2019ve been better sponsored for a second season. But, because of the flashy nature of the show, it was a load of dog shit. The story eventually lost out to the fan service, and by the end, you weren\u2019t looking forward to the next mystery. You were looking forward to the next fight, and by that, I mean you were looking forward to the next time you saw someone suck a boob.\\n",

            "content": "After 5 days I finally did it. I finished the worst show I have ever seen in my life\u2026 but that was to be expected since I watched it for the sole purpose of proving my nerves of steel. Before watching this I didn\u2019t know what a show had to put me through, so I am forced to give it the lowest score possible and to be honest I didn\u2019t think this show would cut it. So what happened?\r\nLet\u2019s get down to business, shall we? \r\n(note: This might contain minor spoilers)\r\n________________________________________\r\nTo summarize it vaguely: This anime follows a generic shounen plotline, filled with borderline pornographicscenes, which take up a big part of the screen time. For the interested, these scenes consist of powerful human creatures, regardless of gender, literally sucking a magical energy-drink-like fluid, called \u201csoma\u201d, out of a female virgin\u2019s breast. These creatures, called Quasars, possess the ability to control a certain type of atoms to a molecular level, unique to each individual quasar, but without having consumed quality \u201csoma\u201d, they can\u2019t use their powers and thus are as useless as the rest of the normal humans in this show.\\n\r\nLet\u2019s start with the characters:\\n\r\n________________________________________\\n\r\nHell, Alexander Nikolaevich (\u201cSasha\u201d) _ 13 year old Russian exchange student and Quasar of iron. He has a dark past, which fails to grip the viewer making him even more unlikable than he already is. For some unclear reason he gets into a mutual love relationship with the female lead Mafuyu.\\n\\n\r\nOribe, Mafuyu _ around 15 years old. She is an uninteresting character, which only serves as the love interest of our MC. Her stubbornness and misjudgment of all the important scenes made her unbearable.\\n\\n\r\nTomo Yamanobe _ around 15 years old. She has the biggest breasts in the show. She is the one Mafuyu promised to protect. I have to give props to Toyasaki Aki, her voice actress, for the voice acting of both the female Tomo and the manly quasar of gold. Her childish personality was really enjoyable, giving refreshment to the rest of the bland characters.\\n\\n\r\nEkaterina Kurae (\u201cKatja\u201d) _ (no idea about her age) She is a masochistic loli and was for me the only enjoyable character in the cast. The show started off promising torturous scenes, which she embodied perfectly. Sadly enough the show didn\u2019t deliver those as it progressed, giving Katja even less screen time and making it even less enjoyable than it already was.\\n\\n\r\n(those are the only characters worth mentioning)\\n\r\n________________________________________\\n\r\nThe story revolves around our Russian exchange student called \u201cSasha\u201d. He is a quasar and has a job to do in Japan. On my first watch (and I\u2019ll be damned if it isn\u2019t the last) it was unclear what his goal was exactly, since you easily lost focus every now and then because of the seemingly scheduled soma feast, our important characters had to go through every episode.\\n\\n\r\nIn the first 12 episodes you get introduced to the protagonists and their friends with some backstories here and there. The show starts off depicting a torturous murder on a young girl. Regardless of the presentation, I somewhat liked this kind of tone but soon enough it was clear this was going to be bad take on a shounen series with tons of fan service. In the next episodes you see \u201cseemingly pointless fighting\u201d, which turns out to be the master plan of the evil guys, to prepare our Sasha to be sacrificed for some reason (because that always works out...). \\n\\n\r\nSurprisingly enough there was a good episode in this mess.(I will now take a detour to describe the only good moment in the show) \\n\r\nI have to give credit to episode 6 of the series, since it was the only episode in the series where I said: \u201cwow they did something right\u201d. Our gang of friends has to play maids for the rich girl, Tsujidou, Miyuri, so they can get a key for some villa to find something. While fooling around they get raided by a group of hired Russian soldiers who were ordered to find some sort of magical egg. At that point our main cast was consisting of tied up attractive underage girls and a boy who were lustfully glared upon by pleasure seeking soldiers. Everyone who hasn\u2019t lived under a rock will surely know what is about to happen. Surprisingly enough the rich girl decides to sacrifice herself and offers to strip for the soldiers, so her beloved friends can get out safe. In an earlier dialogue the loli of the cast, stated that she is like jewelry, once you get bored of it or it loses its worth you throw it away. This is how she indirectly described her relationship with the rich girl, who is obsessed with wealth, as something temporary depending on how long she can last as her \u201clittle princess\u201d. The stripping scene was accompanied by a melancholic piano which made you care for the first and last time about any character in this show. The loli ends up wanting to strip too and takes sip of soma while at it, so she can brutally massacre the soldiers and satisfy the viewers, in the meantime developed, cathartic thirst. The episode ends with the commander of the soldier group committing suicide and blowing the whole place up. Miraculously, our cast of characters survives. After this the show went downhill, dropping the themes and atmosphere developed earlier. But let\u2019s get to the second half of the show.\\n\\n\r\nEpisode 13 and 14 are to be labeled as pure fan service (although eps 14 was somewhat unique and slightly fun to watch with the rich girl being a superhero or what not BUT this will get too long if I start talking about another episode in detail. In short: \u201cboob lasers\u201d and \u201creminded me a bit of Gurren Lagann\u201d).\\n\\n\r\nIn the remaining episodes 15-24 the story goes really fast to reach the finish line. Introducing more Characters no one cares about with some of them ending up getting killed, and letting characters die who were established in the first half (no one from the main cast though). Our MC, Sasha, is now powered up and ready to fight the end boss. With the help of his friends, and the big breasts of Mafuyu, he somehow succeeds, defying all the established power levels in the story this far. The Last fight doesn\u2019t make sense at all; victory isn\u2019t achieved by any masterful strategic battle plan to defeat the superior enemy, but by the inability of the final antagonist to instakill the whole cast (as we have seen him do in other scenes), because of\u2026 reasons\u2026? I don\u2019t know, I get really angry when bad guys mess up for no reason at all and give the good guys an easy win\u2026\\n\\n\r\nAfter the final fight most of the new characters, which didn\u2019t end up dying, just disappear and don\u2019t matter anymore, but hey I guess that\u2019s what happens when you defeat the end boss. In my opinion, the Hydrogen and Carbon Quasar combo should be able to annihilate everything, but they only get one fight, which ends up being pointless.\\n\\n\r\nIn the last Eps Sasha has to leave because his job is done, letting us watch him and Mafuyu being together for the last time. This would be a heartwarming episode, but only if we actually cared for them or simply understood why those two got into a relationship in first place.\\n\r\n________________________________________\\n\r\nThe quality of the show is on relatively low standards, considering it\u2019s a 2010 show. It looks and is animated even worse than older shows like Studio Deen\u2019s Fate/Stay Night. All the character designs look like uninspired textbook shounen characters. Most of the fights are portrayed in a way which does not require good animation nor choreography, and if it does\u2026 then we have Deen-like movements. \\n\\n\r\nMusic was used to make scenes emotional, but as stated before the generic dark backstories don\u2019t sell well. You end up not even caring if someone gets hurt or has his loved ones getting killed in front of his eyes. In other words: nothing noteworthy.\\n\r\n________________________________________\\n\r\nEnjoyment was nearly inexistent for me. The constant slap to the face of boobs, panties and lewd scenes made it unwatchable, even forcing me to pause and tab away for some minutes\u2026 or hours. It\u2019s clear as day that this show was made with the clear aim to make it appeal to certain demographics, such as horny 13 year olds or hard core ecchi fans. I don\u2019t belong to any of those and thus this show was a big miss for me in the end (as expected). If the show was presented in a more mature way, or just kept its tone and atmosphere from the first episode I would have enjoyed it a bit. But then again I wouldn\u2019t have watched it in the first place. It\u2019s like saying \u201cif the show was better it wouldn\u2019t be bad\u201d so it doesn\u2019t matter in the end.\\n\r\nFor the interested in numbers:\\n\r\nCharacters: 4/10\\n\r\nStory: 2/10\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 1/10\\n\r\nOverall: 1/10\\n\\n\r\n(Art and sound didnt leave any impression which could influence the overall quality/enjoement and were thus neglected)\\n\r\n________________________________________\\n\r\nIf you think you can jerk off to minors sucking each other\u2019s breasts in borderline pornographic presentation and scenes, then this show is for you. If not then be happy to leave.\\n",

            "content": "I can assure you this. You will see boobs, boobs being sucked, boobs in varies of sizes. I have never seen this much of boobies in a Series that's actually Good!\r\nYES! It's a good Anime Series!\r\nWhen I first heard of this series, I thought: \"What weirdo would wanna watch guys sucking women breasts to gain their superpowers!?\"\r\nAnd yea, I'm one of those weridos.\r\nEither you like Ecchi, or you don't. So either you will enjoy this series, or get totally turned off by how absurd it can be at times, that you will not watch it.\r\nEither way, I'll do my best to describe this series inmy Review for you who are interested. Check the Overall (Summary) at the bottom if you wish a faster review.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 9\\n\r\nThe story is actually good! It's not the first you would think is good when how people gain their powers to fight in this series, is to suck women breasts for their so called \"Soma\".\\n\\n\r\nSo yea. It's about Qwasers. A human race whom can gain supernatural powers. Controlling Elements such as Iron, Fire, Space, Oxygen, Wind, all Elements can be controlled, and each Qwaser can controll One Element and each one have different abilities with their Element. To gain these powers, they suck women breasts for their Life Energy called Soma. Without it, they are weak and cannot control their element.\\n\r\nIt's easy to spoil stuff in this series, since small parts play part in something bigger. So I will only explain what's it about.\\n\\n\r\nWe follow mainly 2 girls and 1 specific Qwaser.\\n\r\nTomo Yamanobe, Mafuyu Oribe and the Qwaser Aleksander Nikolaevich \"Sasha\" Hell. They are both Bad and Good Qwasers, resulting in huge battles and conflicts.\\n\r\nA lot of conflicts between the Qwasers, Evil Qwasers are Dominate, want more power and control. And these girls are in the middle of it. Small parts off a bigger event is revealed through the episodes, the more you watch, the more you will want to continue. It never gets boring. The only thing you can predict in this Series that you will see boobs. Which I think, can never go wrong.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9\\n\\n\r\nIt's beautifully animated. Not a to Originally Look though, but this never goes wrong. Smooth, good variations, I like this style since it's a more realistic look. Example, Eyes in manga are supposed to be big. Yes, these are big. But I dislike Huge ones like in Clannad or Kanon.\\n\r\nBoobs looks nice as well. You could think I am \"overtalking\" the boobs section. But it's one of the main things in this series and you will see naked boobs in EVERY Episode. No kidding. Still A very watchable Great Series. I Promise you that.\\n\r\nOnly thing that bothers me, which is the same with all Series. Huge Boobies. They are girls with Natural looking boobies here, but the ones with the huge boobs are just unnatural and I have never liked it. Big boobs is one thing. Huge boobs is another. Cup size is off the charts. Though, this is a personal opinion. If you like it. Then you will love this series.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8\\n\r\nOpening Theme 1 and Ending Theme 1 is pretty much forgettable. It's nicely made, but it's not anything you will remember. Though the Second opening after half the series, was much better. First one was more Mainstream. you've heard the kind before.\\n\r\nSecond Opening was more twisted, and repetitive in a good way. Reflecting parts of the Series well, twisted perverted Scenes and repetitive scenes of naked boobs.\\n\r\nVoice Acting was as I always, great by Japanese voice actors.\\n\r\nMusic during storyline was good as well. But I hardly remember anyone. Still, it satisfy you entirely and is good. Rated 8 is not an overrate. Nothing was wrong with the sound.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 8\\n\r\nYou could say you have seen similar main characters. One Totally clueless girl, best friend with a dominate but understanding girl that wants to protect everything dear to her. Then comes a 13 year old guy who doesn't give a shit about others, but sooner revealed. He has a heart like everyone else, which was left behind for his own reasons.\\n\\n\r\nThe Characters are good. Nothing seems off placed. Due to the great story of this Anime Series.(At the same time the absurdity) They are all still very enjoyable as new characters. Including the supportive characters. \\n\\n\r\nI give it an 8 (very good) even though I can find similarities in some characters from other series. But it's nothing bad, since these kind of characters is always enjoyable and often used. It was very enjoyable and will say they are all unique.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9\\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed this series a lot! Even if you like Ecchi or not, it's not impossible for anyone to enjoy this. It has it all. It got both good and bad guys and girls. It has boobs, perverted scenes and I'm not jokin on that part. \\n\\n\r\nWell thought through supernatural powers with a good balance. Different Elements and Levels they have reached. You can understand somewhat how powerful they are when explained.\\n\r\nIt's sometimes funny, they have put in comedy which I enjoyed a lot. More comedy could easily be fitted in.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9\\n\\n\r\nGiven genres Action, Ecchi, Shounen, Super Power, Supernatural.\\n\r\nA small tag of Comedy as well. If you find Ecchi funny or just like Ecchi, you will love this and is a must see.\\n\\n\r\nThis Series was very unique, full of enjoyment and excitement. If you DONT like Ecchi, naked boobs and perverted scenes. You will probably not enjoy this since you would be disgusted every episode.\\n\r\nThe ecchi in this series is very original. It's a very serious story and sucking boobs is not an enjoyment here, it's to gain powers to fight! Which makes it sometimes so absurd since it's nothing normal about it.\\n\r\nYou will see the enjoyment while they suck on boobs. But not because of the boobs itself. Because of the powers they get from the Soma.\\n\\n\r\nThe Story is great! Very original and enjoyable even though its so absurd in thought. But It's a good story and I love that someone has dare to come out with something like this.\\n\r\nIt's not totally unrealistic. I love the display of dirty acts by the bad guys when they have a girl as hostage for example. Starting touching and squeezing boobs to tease and anger the enemy is naturally for a maniac. And its wonderfully displayed.\\n\\n\r\nA true Shounen Series. Ofc, girls could like this as well. And I am longing for the Second Season.",

What could they have been thinking? Ok there have been other shows where powers had to b obtained by method of consummation, but what is this? Alexander, one of the main characters in the plot suddenly stops fighting, drinks from the nun's breast, and kicks the bad guys butt all the way back tohell.... What are you taking when writing (or drawing, or editing, or replaying, etc., etc., etc.,) this anime before actually taking it to the TV Lineup Executives.\\n\\n\r\nAnd on that note, what did the TV Station think when they saw this show, did they even see it, could they not think the same think as everyone else is thinking? \\n\\n\r\nInteresting.....\\n\\n\r\nWell it must be to get the ultimate pervert audience so that they can sell Adult Oriented Stuff on TV during commercial breaks.\\n\\n\r\nWell so unless your into a show that just has big breasts, some sort of recycled plot, and makes very little or no sense, then you will enjoy this show.\\n\\n\r\nThe rest of you stay clear of this show!\\n\\n\r\nSionara",

            "content": "Overview\r\nWhat happens when you take plot elements from Fullmetal Alchemist, Hellsing Ultimate, and D.Gray-man, then mix them into a bad hentai? The answer is something quite abhorrent. Seikon no Qwaser isn't just your everyday bad echii. This one ups the ante and has a 12 year old boy and a 10 year old girl sucking the breasts of women in their older teens and engaging in various sexual acts. In episode 3, a 10 year old girl threatens to kill an older teen if she doesn't consent to giving her cunnilingus. Fortunately, we don't actually have to see this. We only see the little girl'sface and hear the lapping sounds thanks to a discretion shot. Otherwise, this series wouldn't even be legal under United States Federal Law. It only gets worse from there. This series would make Vladimir Nabokov, the creator of the Loli genre, blush with shame. I am not a squeamish prude. My favorite anime is Elfen Lied. Seikon no Qwaser made me feel very, very uncomfortable!\\n\\n\r\nStory 2/10\\n\\n\r\nThere are many wizards called Qwasers capable of bending specific elements to their whim. A secret arm of the Russian Orthodox Church has some of the most powerful wizards and uses them to hunt heratic wizards. The most powerful of the church's paladins is Alexander Hell. This is of course not to be confused with Hellsing's secret arm of the Catholic Church and their heretic hunting paladin Alexander Anderson. This is totally different! It is up to Alexander or \"Sasha\" to kick ass with his scythe and protect his harem of big breasted ladies. How does he get his awesome powers? By graphically sucking their tits and drinking the milk of course! How else would a wizard get his powers? Apparently one underraged Russian isn't enough and soon the Church sends another one called Ekaterina to assist Alexander. The story pretty much solely consists of fight scenes and sucking tits. The writer also has a rudimentary knowledge of chemistry and tries to show it off so frequently that even Kurt Vonnegut would tell him to knock it off!\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 1/10\\n\\n\r\nOh dear god do the characters suck in this one. Alexander is in the running for the most 2 dimensional Russian stereotype character in all of anime. His only rivals are Zangief from Street Fighter and Russia himself from Hetalia. The really sad thing is that Alexander is the best character in this piece of shit. We also have generic tsundere girl and clueless bimbo with ridiculously huge tits. Of course the psychotic loli Ekaterina shows up later, but she has as much character depth as the shallow end of the pool. \\n\\n\\n\r\nArt 7/10\\n\\n\r\nSurprisingly the art in this anime isn't bad. This thing actually had a budget and clearly had decent animators working on it. The tits look very...succulent\\n\\n\r\nSoundtrack 7/10\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is also one of the few highlights of this series. It is genuinely pretty decent and boasts catchy opening and closing themes as well as background music.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 1/10\\n\\n\r\nIf you are in this one for the plot, firstly you are an idiot, secondly you are going to be very disappointed. If you are in this for the porn, the pedo scenes will make that boner go away faster than seeing Larry King naked on a cold day. It is possible to enjoy Seikon no Qwaser... if you are a pedophile or clinically insane.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 1/10\\n\\n\r\nThis is one of the worst anime to come out in the last 5 years. There has been a lot of crap and admittedly I haven't seen Pupa and Boko no Piko, but this one can proudly hold its own in a sucking contest with the worst of the worst.",

            "content": "Qwaser is quite the weird one... I went in expecting this to be hilariously bad but I ended up rather impressed with it. I'm currently only to episode 21, but even if it declines from here, I still enjoyed the goodness while it lasted.\r\nStory: 8\r\nIt's a very weird premise. Religion, the Periodic Table, dominatrix loli's and...Breast milk? I don't know how they made it work but it sure did. It's kept me hooked for quite a while, and it has just enough comedy to keep it from being too intense, but it doesn't cause the story to suffer any. 70% of the episodes open withan ecchi 'treat' for the viewers, and there's definitely quite a bit of ecchi in the show itself. I don't think it makes the story any less enjoyable, but I can understand how it would make it less entertaining for others.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9\\n\r\nIt's really pretty. Even though towards the beginning, a lot of the..suckling scenes were recycled, but as it went on that didn't happen as much. The battle scenes are intense and awesome, but it seems that they're cut pretty short, most of the time. I suppose it's better than having them drag out through several episodes and overstay their welcome.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 7\\n\r\nI wasn't thoroughly impressed with it. I do like both of the openings and endings, though. The voice acting is nice, very fitting. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9\\n\r\nMost of the characters are pretty good. Until later episodes, Mafuyu is rather boring. Tomo is so innocent yet lacks a shred of modesty, leading to some very funny material, which is why she's my favorite. I don't really have any complaints about any of the characters. I just wished Teresa had more screen time, she's absolutely adorable.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9\\n\r\nI really do love this show. I initially thought it was going to be stupid and just a big fanservice bonanza but I was really impressed with it's execution.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 10\\n\r\nIt's not exactly something you can suggest to all of your friends, as ecchi is not everyone's cup of tea, but for those who enjoy  that kind of thing may want to try.",

            "content": "Seikon no Qwaser is for me an underrated anime. It has 24 episodes and focuses on the fight against an evil group. The one fighting them is a small boy named \"Sasha\" who manipulates iron (the fighting theme is about manipulation of the chemical elements-just like using iron or copper and so on)...\r\nWell the interesting part is that he gains his powers by sucking from the breasts of the girls around him. Sounds more like a hentai but it is one of those ecchi animes like Queens Blade (if you know it), only that Seikon no Qwaser is taking it a little further. Still youwill only see breasts and such because it is after all an ecchi. Now it is actually a real fun part if you watch the uncensored version. I reccommand it...\\n\\n\r\nCharacters and story are all kept pretty simple though. You will see most of the typical anime girl types from shy to bold. But at least it follows a slight storyline.\\n\r\nFor the setting, drawing and fights: Setting is taking place around school mostly. Not so much to tell. But for the drawing, I was pretty surprised by the way it looks like. You will enjoy watching most of the girls. And now fights, it is a more episodic pattern of how the fights go but still showing off some nice moves. So some action is also included.\\n\\n\r\nI just want to add that the music was really one of the best parts of the anime. All the openings and ending were pretty catchy and got even better. Even if you don't like the anime, the music is great.\\n\\n\r\nSo it might seems like an ecchi trash anime with nothing special in it but it is entertaining...and with entertaining I mean that you shouldn't take it serious if you want to enjoy it. If you expect too much from it then you will fail. If you are into a little more harder sucking ecchi then you can or should check it out. I won't reccomand it if you search for something great or serious. And don't watch it censored if you know what is good for you. Finally if you are a fan of simple ecchi fighting animes then you will like it. I will give it a decent rating because it was overall good enough.",

            "content": "I started watching this series because the concept sounded pretty lulzy - after all, it's about breast sucking and gaining magic powers from it. But I soon realised that this show is literally about nothing albeit petty squabbling over the penis of a tiny exchange student. That being said, everything about it average, especialy the story.\r\nStory: 3\r\nAfter you get over the whole breast sucking fiasco and get involved in the story, you realise how little there really is. It's about the foreign exchange student, crashing daily student life and the first portion of the series is pretty reverse haremy. However, it slowly degrades into avillain of the week and the wading through that particular marsh isn't worth the very average ending.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 5\\n\r\nAverage, it's not bad but not good either. The fight scenes are relatively impressive, and the detail to the breast sucking is well done. The extreme breast physics when he extracts soma from them is pretty hilarious; and the characters themselves are rather nicely drawn and fit with the dark theme. The first few episodes were fairly good, but the art wanes as you progress through the series.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 5\\n\r\nThe first opening is very catchy; and the second one not so much. The endings with all the voice actors is also particularly impressive. The OST is essentially the one of the defining features of this show, as it sets the dark, dreary mood despite the crazy breast feasting occuring. That being said, none of the songs haven't stayed with since the time the show finished - meaning the music didn't have that much of an impression on me.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 6\\n\r\nAs per usual, harems have fairly good character development in exchange for a cromulent storyline. Seikon no Qwaser sacrifices even more character development for ecchi scenes. But over the course of the 24 episode, characters were able to be somewhat develop - but no where to the extent of other girls in other, similar length series. That being said, character development is the only saving grace for this anime - because really, there is nothing else. I also hate Tomo - those characters anger me so much. She's so useless and disgusting, yet they dedicate X episodes to give her some sort of use. It's a waste of your time.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 7\\n\r\nThere is nothing more great than laughing at an anime which attempts to be legitimate. This anime has proven that. The concept of drinking breast milk to increase ones strength is absolutely hilarious. I laughed for hours and hours and hours. If this series was 12 episodes, it would've been much more success. But 24 episode of this rubbish? I don't think so. I didn't necessarily look forward to watching one episode every week, but it was watchable. The voice acting was probably the best part of this anime, but much like anime such as Queen's Blade, no amount of voice acting can help you trawl your way through this anime. Though, Chihara Minori's sexy moaning is pretty sexy.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nThis anime promises breast sucking, but unfortunately takes this concept a little bit too far. Getting powerups from drinking the delicious milk of your female friends is pretty lulzy, but using an ecchi as a plot device isn't going to work out well. It's a stimulent which gets your penis going. It is not a concept to be explored; and definitely not the ground for an anime.\\n\\n\r\ntl;dr \\n\r\nThe story is about breast sucking. Watch it for lulz, but if you expect even the slightest bit more, you're going to be disappointed.",

            "content": "Every once in a while you come across an anime that is so far outside the realm of normality that you simply can\u2019t help but be amazed. This can be either for better or for worse but regardless of which it\u2019ll generally leave a more lasting impression.\r\nWhen it comes to Seikon no Qwaser, it made me feel progressively stupider while I was watching it. This simply has to be the strangest concept I\u2019ve ever seen for a story, but it somehow makes it work. First off I would like to say that this show is NOT for everyone. The term ecchi is nowhere near enoughto describe the extent of SnQ. I\u2019ve seen plenty of quite borderline H anime in my career, but this has to take the cake. The strange thing is that despite that, the way the show uses its extreme perverseness is actually secondary. In reality, Seikon no Qwaser is an action/super power series and shouldn\u2019t even be classified as neither a romance nor a harem series. It just so happens that all the supernatural abilities in the show are powered\u2026 by sucking breast milk from women.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is very simplistic and clich\u00e9; you\u2019ve got your male protagonist surrounded by heaps of women and they\u2019re constantly being targeted by bad guys as everyone is competing over trying to find a lost artifact which supposedly can grant its user the power of god\u2026 or something like that. The characters are split into two halves; you\u2019ve got the \u201cQwasers\u201d which are the supernatural guys who get their powers from sucking breast milk, or \u201cSoma\u201d, from the other supporting half, where the donators are called \u201cMarias\u201d. As absurd as it is, it\u2019s pretty straightforward once you\u2019ve finally accepted just what the hell you are actually watching.\\n\\n\r\nThe fights themselves are pretty interesting though. Every Qwaser is unique, as he/she is connected to a specific element on the periodic table, allowing him/her to manipulate said substance at will and use that in any which way thinkable for fighting. The amount of energy available to do so is based on the strength of the Qwaser and how much Soma he/she has digested beforehand.\\n\\n\r\nThe character cast is at first glance pretty damn stereotypical. You\u2019ve got the standard harem situation with the protagonist surrounded by a tsundere, an airhead and the silent but loyal and obedient old friend. The protag himself however is not exactly your average one, as he\u2019s a cold hearted, mechanical and revenge driven young lad. Actually when I say young lad I really mean it, he\u2019s basically a shota compared to the heroine cast, and is also a pretty huge tsundere himself. Last but not least, the final two main characters are a bit more standalone\u2026 as they share the wonderful combination of a lolicon/yuri/BDSM coupling, and quite frankly they were easily the most interesting duo to watch throughout the entire series, especially the pseudo-gothic twintailed loli dominatrix Katja voiced by Aya Hirano. They also had some extremely borderline H scenes together, unlike the mere constant breastfeeding throughout the anime. As far as side characters go though, they were pretty damn forgettable.\\n\\n\r\nVisuals and audio weren\u2019t anything particularly memorable. The whole idea of basing super powers on chemistry allowed for quite a lot of unorthodox action scenes to take place, but even so the animation wasn\u2019t anything really worth praising. As far as the soundtrack goes, neither the OP, ED nor overall OST comes to mind either. In fact I can\u2019t even remember what either sounded like even now, right after finishing the series. The seiyuu cast and performance was pretty good though overall, albeit somewhat varied in individual quality.\\n\\n\r\nBy far the best part about Seikon no Qwaser though is its entertainment value. Coming into this, I was somewhat prepared for that it would be a very strange experience, but as far as the actual enjoyment went, I have to admit I was really positively surprised. I had a ton of fun marathoning through all of this. Even if the crazy amount of boobs plastered all over the screen isn\u2019t exactly my type of thing, in this particular case I somehow didn\u2019t really mind. It\u2019s such an abstract show that I couldn\u2019t help but feel interested in it for the wtf-factor alone. SnQ isn\u2019t an ecchi anime meant to turn you on. In fact, 90% of its sexual showings will most likely creep you out more than anything, but before long you will stop thinking about it as anything more than a supporting aspect of what is in actuality an action series. Hell even the girls themselves don\u2019t seem to act like its anything out of the ordinary.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, despite its creepiness and absurdity, I wholeheartedly enjoyed this anime a lot more than I had expected coming into it. Admittedly though, it\u2019s pretty damn hard to rate, and I can see pretty much any score for it being understandable given how extreme it is, but in the end, the reason people watch anime is for entertainment, and in that aspect at least, Seikon no Qwaser manages to deliver well above expectations.",

            "content": "And I thought Eiken was the most unbearable piece of garbage I've seen from anime. Whereas Eiken had no plot whatsoever in its ridiculously ecchi antics, this turd attempts to create a cookie-cutter shounen action anime mixed in with enough perverted material that made it hard for me to even watch at points. Seikon no Qwaser's gimmick with its ecchi content comes in the form of the superpowered beings called Qwasers having to suck on breast milk to grant them their elemental/ metal manipulating powers. With this gimmick also comes plenty of instances where you can see rape-like situations and moments of sadomasochism from itscast. The problem with implementing this ecchi content for Seikon no Qwaser is that implementing its breast-sucking scenes and other perverted content in serious moments like action scenes and character development make them look more creepy, awkward and uncomfortable than immersible for any sane viewer, and the gimmick really does enough to get in the way of any relevant elements to the title's plot.\\n\\n\r\nIf you strip away the breast sucking, perversion, attempted rapes and sadomasochism though, you have nothing more than a typical story of revenge coming from Sasha's tragic past and encounters with the secret cult known as Adepts with plans of world domination, along with a cast of archetypal characters you would see done to death from enough high school/ fan service titles like the clumsy ditz (Tomo), the ojou (Miyuri), the sharp-tongued and manipulative loli (Katja) and the tomboy (Elizabeth). The villains among the Adepts are mostly nothing more than either your garden variety mook serving to get offed by Sasha and other Qwasers or a power-hungry loon who thinks he is better than everyone and wants to rule the world. The first half of the anime mostly features Sasha offing the different mooks of the Adepts and much of the second half is where the Adepts execute their big plan of world domination that Sasha and the other Qwasers have to stop, with the second half developments coming along after some pretty pathetic attempts at comedy with one notable character gaining amnesia for a couple episodes. In other words, the plot to this anime is just one huge excuse for its breast-sucking gimmick and other perverted content.\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of visuals, Seikon no Qwaser is rather standard in its presentation with decent-looking scenery and character designs. While animation shortcuts are apparent with this series at a number of points, Qwaser battles were engaging to a degree thanks to the abilities of the Qwasers to manipulate their individual elements. The very frequent appearance of huge boobs bobbing and bouncing around at enough points, however, does kill any enjoyment one would want to get from the Qwaser battles thanks to how annoyingly distracting they are.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Seikon no Qwaser is nothing more than just another ecchi show trying to find another creepy gimmick to get its sex-crazed otaku fanbase gawking over huge boobs and perversion, while using standard character archetypes and plot cliches as a crutch for its ecchi antics. Unless you have a thing for any imaginable ecchi content, definitely don't waste your time on it.",

            "content": "I originally decided to pick this up because I was told of an action series in which people literally sucked on a girl's nipple for energy to fight, yet is not a porn. In other words, it was out of sheer curiosity as to whether or not such a thing would lead to catastrophe or not. And surprisingly enough, it didn't.\r\nI'll start by letting you know this over the top fanservice will most likely either drive you away in disgust or keep you glued to the screen while shedding tears of joy. I'm sure some people will just laugh it off or ignore it aswell, but it can be pretty polarizing.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 7:/10. The story doesn't really stray from typical shounen plot, but does make use of a few really interesting concepts. For one, it's characters all have powers born of an element from the periodic table (Hydrogen, Mercury, Iron, etc.) and not the usual elements used for this sort of thing (fire, water, earth, etc.) This makes for some rather creative and enjoyable fights throughout the series. Another is it's use of the Christianity in the plot, like a painting of the virgin Mary breastfeeding Jesus containing the power of God. There have certainly been series to do a better job incorporating religion (See: Chrono Crusade), but I'll admit that I surprisingly happy with it considering it was an ero anime.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8/10. The art for this series is pretty well done, although much of the work clearly goes into breast animation (again, something you either be really happy or really sad about), ass shots. The fighting was rather well done, another surprise for a show of this premise. Overall, I was pleased with the quality.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 6/10. The \"bad shit is happening\" track sounded well placed, but everything else was pretty forgettable. This includes both opening and ending themes.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 6/10. Alexander was honestly the only interesting character in the series. With the exception of him, everyone else conformed to some archetype or another almost perfectly. The idea of a of a really short badass who looks like an emo goth sounds ridiculous, but it's honestly the best way to describe him and it worked out rather well. He also has a pretty unique scar carved into the side of his face.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8/10. The enjoyment you get from this series all hinges upon how you deal with the fanservice. If you really don't like looking at naked cartoon characters, then this isn't the series for you. If that's your thing, prepare for a full course meal of it.",

THEN!! this white haired kid and some cat ear haired bitch save the day, after he sucks her tites.\r\n^^so yeahhthats the first episode.

            "content": "Seikon no Qwaser is one anime that is easy to binge watch. There are a few reasons as to why I think that, but for now lets focus on the series.\r\nThe story takes place in Japan, and was told in a somewhat cryptic way. It doesn't really make sense until the later episodes when more things are happening and is tied together. It is a rather simple story, but I didn't find it particularly boring to watch. I found the pacing to be quite mediocre. At times, you can tell a few things were rushed and at other times it felt a bit slow. Thecomedical moments in Seikon no Qwaser were pretty funny while the Ecchi and fanservice were desireable. There were a few tropes that I felt were done right, and there were some that didn't really sit well.\\n\\n\r\nThe art style does feel a bit old school compared to other series. It is a bit standard for this style of animation. I think the creator accomplished their goal in setting the mood with the art style. If there was any CGI used in this anime, then it blended really well cause I couldn't tell if there was or not. The style and quality of the animation stayed the same throughout the series, and the animation was fluid.The backgrounds are a bit copy and paste, but fit well for the anime. The character's designs were nice and fit their personalities well. The character's were unique between them, but did remind me of a few other anime.\\n\\n\r\nI felt that some of the voices didn't match the characters. The main male protags voice sounded off to me as he sounded wayy older than he looked and was. The background music was great and fit the atmosphere of the story. I did find how some tracks highlighted certain scenes. I would find myself listening to some of the OST. I didn't really like some of the endings and the first opening was average. I really liked the second opening and felt it fit the show more than the first.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters were pretty well made. They each had their flaws, quirks, and strengths. The extra characters reacted to situations in a pretty realistic way which made it more interesting. The MCs reacted a bit unrealistic at some points. The characters did grow, but each in their own way. I found that some characters were more fleshed out than other characters. The supporting cast was only fleshed out on a few, but some were still cryptic. I did dislike the character Miyuri, and I don't think the creator had the intentions of you disliking them. She tended to be quite annoying at times. I do think I will remember some of the characters, but not their full names. \\n\\n\r\nI do think that others would like this series because of the soundtrack and art. The ecchi parts may turn off people and I can see why people would dislike the series because of that. If you aren't an anime or manga fan you probably wouldn't like this work. I would like to re-watch this anime in the future, and probably watch the whole thing over. I wouldn't like to own this series, and it is kind of memorable. Some scenes from the anime will definitely stay in my mind.\\n\\n\r\nHope you enjoyed this review. This is my first review, and I hope that it helps you on deciding to watch this series.",

            "content": "Safe to read - No Spoilers\r\nThis was recommended by my friend who watches almost every ecchi anime out there, and this was one of the ecchi anime he introduced to me that was good.  You know not the typical common ecchi anime. If I were to describe this anime it would be like you're in a science labaratory listening to your naked teacher holding a bible while fapping.\r\n-Story 8-\r\nIt a about a russian kid whose name is Aleksander Nikolaevich Hell or Sasha. He's a qwaser and to tell you what that is do you know legend of Aang or Kora? He's like the ironbender, and to use that skill he must suck soma or to simply put it \"breast milk\".\\n\\n\r\n The story/plot is good it was satisfying to watch .The flow of the story is good, character developement, and good amount of flashbacks. I really watch it for the boobs- I mean plot. I mean really just watch the first episode and the first second starts with the plot already. \\n\\n\r\n-Art 8- \\n\r\nI like the art because it fits an ecchi anime. Althoug the art isn't exactly rare or anything amazing it was just the common normal art that almost every anime has. The details is alright. You know panty shots,  and big boobs. \\n\\n\r\n-Sound 6-\\n\r\nDid not like the music,The OST was dull, it didn't strike me, you know when you're sad and the OST just makes you cry, it lack that.  I couldn't feel the music in fight scenes. The OST and ED I skipped them, it wasn't really interesting for me. Although the voice actors were good, it fits the faces of the characters.\\n\\n\r\n-Characters 7-\\n\r\nCharacter design it's alright. The characters were weird but good weird cuz it doesn't make them common characters. The girls in this anime mostly consist of big boobs girl. Really if you want to watch ecchi anime and you have big boob fetish, this one is perfect for you.\\n\\n\r\n-Enjoyment 8-\\n\r\nI can't fully enjoy the anime 1 episode and I go to the bathroom. I can't watch it in 1 go. :S Like I this was recommended by my friend and I don't really watch ecchi anime but this is great. It has that good plot that I was interested to.\\n\\n\r\n-Overall 7-\\n\r\nI really recommend for hardcore ecchi fan out there! Has uncensored and censored version though, but who the heck loves censored version?! The uncensored version is very borderline hentai, if action, ecchi, and harem is not your cup of tea don't watch it. But atleast give it a try.\\n\\n\r\nPros:\\n\r\n You can learn alot science from the story. Like periodic tables, atom and other things\\n\\n\r\nCons:\\n\r\n Too much fanservice, cant focus well on the story. To put it simply it relies on fanservice too much.\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Having watched the first two episodes of Seikon no Qwaser I have to say it wasn't a very impressive way to start a series, although I think my reasoning will be a little different then that of my fellow reviewers :)\r\nStory - The plot is a fairly average recreation of a lot of other action/ecchi type anime series, the draw-card of course being that the heroes/villains seem to powerup by sucking breast milk. This didn't bother me that much in principle (ANIME OBJECTIFYING WOMEN?! SAY IT ISN'T SO! :P)  although it would be amusing in the extreme to find out how this can possiblybe explained as leading to superpowers. Having only seen the first two epiosdes I can't say much about the overall story except that its otherwise fairly run of the mill for this genre.\\n\\n\r\nArt - The art is fairly nice, my only complaint would be with whoever designed Tomo. I understand breasts are going to play a big part in this series but really that's just ridiculous.\\n\\n\r\nSound - Not much to say, nothing stood out as particularly good or bad in the sound department.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - Initial responses to the characters is that they are decent, except for Tomo who seems designed to annoy me (is there some weird market for giant breasts on woman who act like five year olds?). Alex is a jerk but somehow I doubt he will stay one for the whole series, and a big scythe is always a fun weapon.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment -  This is where I'll get to air my pet peeve with this series and the main thing which made the whole thing awkward to watch and cause a huge dent to my enjoyment. I understand broadcasting people sucking each others chests is probably over the line in a number of ways - but what on earth was the camera doing during those scenes? I get that it has to look somewhere else but you could at least look at SOMETHING in the actual scene, all of those random shots of the sky and awkwardly framed scenes sapped the enjoyment far more then anything else in the series, even more then Tomo (--stab!)\\n\\n\r\nOverall - aside from the drawcard issue Seikon no Qwaser is just a very average action/ecchi/harem sort of deal. Its perfectly safe to watch it but unless it improves a great deal it's looking like a very mediocre series. I will actually play devils advocate here and suggest that if an uncensored version does come out it might improve things significantly by the removal of all those weird camera positions (of course if the whole thing freaks you right out then that probably will make things worse - up to you guys :) )",

            "content": "What would you do if you had the power to control an element, and power it up through breast milk?\r\nI'd be scared of babies.\r\nAnyhow, Seikon no Qwaser is... a unique concept. I first did not want to watch it due to the overwhelming amount of boobs. Really. Then I heard that it had a second season. I gave it a second try and found it amusing.\r\nSince the plot summary is already written in the anime info, I won't bother including a long one.\r\nAlexander BlahBlahvich, aka Sasha comes to this school to find this relic. He clashes at first with two female students, Mafuyu and Tomowhatevertheirnamesare. Turns out they're special. And now Sasha has to protect em by sucking girls' breast milk, or 'Soma' to empower his control of iron. Other Qwasers, like him, control a metal element (and I whip up my periodic table), well whatever, you'll just understand if you are good in chemistry. An example would be Katja-sama and her wonderful copper. There's a catch though. They all want that relic as well.\\n\r\nThe story is normal. And what do I mean by normal? I mean that there is a main character and his mascots searching for something, and bad guys want it too. That's all there is to it, really. Just prepare yourselves for some plot twists and awesome wtf moments where Sasha just beats the shit out of stuff after sucking on breasts. Isn't it just normal?\\n\\n\r\nThe characters of this anime are your unoriginal harem characters. Tsundere Mafuyu, airhead Tomo, quietly obedient Teresa. And then comes Sasha (Alexander). How cute, a tsundere shotacon. Not much creativity in the character department, and as always, the female tsundere will have feelings for the male protagonist. Other characters make the show more fun to it. Who could ignore lovely Miyuri? And you should definitely bow down to Katja if you like  BDSM. I'll shut up now. Did I mention that Sasha has a horrible past? Hence his name Sasha the Martyr. Maybe.\\n\r\nIt's nice to see Sasha's development throughout the anime. I mean, he turns /nice/. And Mafuyu? A bit more honest than before. Otherwise, there is nothing else to include. Maybe the fact that Tomo can cook a bit at the end of the anime.\\n\\n\r\nThe background music was boring. I could remember the only 5 tracks it has (I'm guessing here). Once you hear one, you can tell what's going to come next. There's one for breastfeeding time, two battle themes, bah. It's fitting but not good enough.\\n\r\nVoice acting is good. If you watch it, you can tell. Problem is the Russian they put in and the way Mafuyu pronounces Alexander. Damn she makes it sound painful. I was glad when she started calling him Sasha. Another flaw with VA however, is the moaning noises. Please, make it stooooop. Does sucking breasts really create such ecstasy that you cannot keep your mouth shut? Well maybe it's different when the Qwasers do it. I wouldn't know.\\n\r\nOP and ED were fitting. Had a slight, how do you call it, 'church' feel to it. The first ending was so eargasmic. All those lovely voice actresses singing one song. /applause. Nothing special after the first ED. Beats the rest.\\n\\n\r\nArt? What art? These things are just women with large blobs attached to their chest. I'm referring to the majority of the characters, of course. \\n\r\nOkay, fine, the art is good. Only parts when you can wince is when there are naked breasts. An overload of them. When I see Tomo, it's like a walking pair of fleshy blobs. And then I see nothing else.\\n\r\nHuh? Of course I watched the uncensored version. I didn't understand it when it was censored. So watch the uncensored one; makes more sense.\\n\\n\r\nPfuuuu, enjoyment. I enjoyed this anime. This actually made me feel like chemistry lessons were useful. I also liked the characters, especially Sasha and that tomboy with titanium powers.\\n\\n\r\nFinal verdict? Watch it if you want to. 24 episodes of boobs is a lot, and I watched them in 3 days. or something. \\n\r\nShort version:\\n\r\nArt was good, story was okay, sound was bleh, except for voice acting, character was bleh. Overall: GOOD.\\n\\n\r\nOff to watch the second season.\\n\\n\r\n\"Tremble!\"",

            "content": "Hey this is my first review.I'll try to be forthcoming as humanly possible with this show.Thirdly this review is premature with only 2 episodes in which have aired.\r\nStory- Essentially we have a silver haired character named Alexander who needs a certain form of sustenance in order to gain the energy needed for his metaphysical unravelling of the iron atom.Now what would that be, wait for it breast milk....Well isn't that the most enthralling and original concept to have surfaced in an anime.There is the local grocery store in which you can buy milk....or you can suck on a taciturn girl with gargantuan tits.Now to moveon. Alexander can morph iron at a mollecular level but he needs the milk. He finds himself at an Eastern Orthodox School on the fringes of being in conflict with a secret society.. This has been done before even though there might be an accumulative amount of symbolism(hence the scar).Where is Robert Langdon when you need him......?\\n\\n\r\nArt-Not exactly captivating or filled with guile. Even though the outlines around the girls and the luminous colours do accentuate a darker background.We also have the shounen art doctrine....chunky blocks that are suppose to suffice as hair.\\n\\n\r\nSound-The song is placating to an extent in trying to precipitate a contrite vibe in making you feel sorry for the characters past.For the most part the sound acclimates to its surroundings. With a dosage of fighting music and jaded features of techno alongside it.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter-You have an arcane male lead who has a horrendous past in Alexander. The first female lead is the typical bombastic and  or wind bag namely Oribe and then of course the reticent cohort Yamanobe who's been anointed as Alexanders personal dairy farm.Last but not least we have the dull minor villians and the minor characters who might play dress up at a gothic convention. Not everyone in Eastern Europe dresses like a surceased vitamin D drained goth.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment-Nonplussed for the most part. There's nothing to be ebullient or happy about in watching this.\\n\\n\r\nOverall- Devoid of intellect, stifling the romanticism of Eastern europe with its gaudy fashion and vacuous concepts and characters.\\n\\n",

            "content": "My review is based on what i grabbed watching 3/4 of episode 1. I couldn't bear continuing nor finishing episode 1.\r\nTo start of, i watched this series knowing what to expect. I'm just curios and disbelieved with the plot summary and wanted to know just how much of it is true, and how bad can an anime be.\r\nComing back to this anime, i graded this anime as 1/10 because it is that bad. For those looking for non-ecchi anime, this is NOT for you.For those looking for ecchi anime this is also NOT for you.  So who is the intended audience then?\r\n1. People whowants to know how bad it is.\\n\r\n2. People wanted to see girls stripped of their dignity and getting  molested by a gray-haired young man who finds nothing wrong doing it because it gives him power.\\n\\n\r\nI've never been a fan of ecchi anime, but at least i watched enough random 1-2 episodes or to-love-ru and other ecchi animes to be able to know what they are. This is totally different, this anime is more like hentai, it put female dignity to other nothingness and let a gray-haired man (signifies old man?) sucks their oversized boobs on national television. Even porn or hentai puts female of higher standards, they still see her as a female. This anime doesn't.\\n\\n\r\nBeing a 2010 anime, this anime is decently well animated with less than decent sound.  So why 4 and 6 for those category? The art is decent at best, but nothing stands out, nothing original. Ironically, what pulls down the art in this anime, are the tits of the girls of this series. To me, F-sized cup girls is more disgusting than beautiful. Too much of anything is never good. For the sound department, the only reason of why i gave it a 6 is , 5 because of the casts of the seiyuus and 1 for the script/music. I do not get how on earth, they get this seiyuus to dub this anime. Its like asking heath ledger to play 40 years old virgin.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment, as mentioned above, I'm more disgusted than not watching this so enjoyment is 1/10 without a doubt. I've watched mars of destruction and i know how bad it is. This anime, its just as bad or worst. The plot is horrendous but the idea of looking at girls pried being put down to the level that is of a cow just doesn't feel like for a man in the right mind like me. You know those commercials that drinking milk is good for your health, its like watching those but instead of drinking the milk from proper packages, you suck it directly from the cow.\\n\\n\r\nThis series is SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO bad, unless its intentional like mars of destruction is, the director has got to be an idiot. My only hope for this anime is that it doesn't destroy hirano aya's carrier. I really liked her but if her carrier is ruined because of this i'll be pissed as hell.",

            "content": "I couldn\u2019t enjoy the flow of the show, because it was so thoroughly distracting. The show couldn\u2019t make you keep a straight face, because every time you were serious for a battle, you just had to see some twit suckling a nipple. Everything that the producers and writers and developers of the last 30 years have tried to hide, was totally shit on. All the stupid coincidences of leaves blocking certain areas or objects closer to the screen that block a body \u2013 even the steam aspect of those ecchi genres made them what they were: ecchi! Quite honestly, that\u2019s the way it was supposedto stay. If you wanted anything more, you could\u2019ve gone to watch some porn somewhere! But this anime was completely outrageous. \\n\\n\r\nStory:\\n\r\nThe story was unique, but so poorly played out and depicted, that it brings it all down to mediocre. The unique part being breast milk as a catalyst for power. True, not every show should follow in the EXACT footsteps of the last, but they could have at least stuck to the traditional way of dealing with ecchi shows. I AM a guy, but that doesn\u2019t mean I was looking for porn when watching anime. The whole loli goth thing was attractive enough of an idea, but it was misconstrued with the clash of so many unneeded characters. The whole story can all be summed up in two words: FAN SERVICE.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nThe art was good. It is by no means a great animated show, but it isn\u2019t horrible. It\u2019s essentially average animation for an anime. Everything was well enough depicted, and the nudity was ON PAR with most hentai. Anime should rarely be on par with hentai, which is why this is such a huge issue. There are more nipple shots in this show then there are black men in Lisa Lampanelli at any given moment. \\n\\n\r\nSounds:\\n\r\nNow admittedly, the soundtrack wasn\u2019t bad. The opening wasn\u2019t bad. The ending was ok. That\u2019s about all there was. The rest of the soundtrack was forgettable. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nThis was probably the worst category of them all. You cant get passed the characters self reflections who ask themselves moral questions, only to realize that it didn\u2019t really matter, because it goes right back to the norm (nipple sucking) the next episode. More than that, the dumb bimbo with huge tits isnt even needed, because there is really no point to having her. True, she does play a big role at the end, but the point is that she didn\u2019t HAVE to be dumb as shit. She could\u2019ve been a regular girl. Even a smart girl. And it wouldn\u2019t have mattered. And that\u2019s what urks me. I think that every character should be placed and have a personality/attitude that\u2019s relevant to the entire story. IF the story has a character who could easily be the exact opposite (personality/looks wise) and the story would still work perfectly, then it\u2019s a wasted character, and its value/existence in the show is useless. Another character that pisses me off is the main character himself: Alexander (or Sasha for short for some reason\u2026).  Though the majority of his pictures make him look like a hard badass, how he\u2019s played throughout the show is disgusting. \\n\r\nThe spoiler runs till the next topic, btw.\\n\\n\r\n*SPOILER*\\n\r\nI know I shouldn\u2019t add a spoiler, but the one part that almost made me drop the series was when he lost his memory and thought he was a girl. I\u2019m not bothered by a cross dressing anime character, but Sasha, being the badass that he is supposed to be, started to turn into a cross dressing feminine b*tch who  just made me want to leave the series alone and never even look at the name of the show again.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nI couldn\u2019t enjoy it. There were so many babes with huge boobs that I couldn\u2019t really pay attention to the story. The only possible enjoyment I got from watching this was the fan service. And that\u2019s what the entire story is. Fan service. Nothing more, nothing less. Actually, a little more. I don\u2019t consider nipple sucking fan service, I consider it hentai. So yeah. \\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nOverall, the story could\u2019ve been a lot better. It should\u2019ve played out in a more conservative manner, and it would\u2019ve been better received, and probably could\u2019ve been better sponsored for a second season. But, because of the flashy nature of the show, it was a load of dog shit. The story eventually lost out to the fan service, and by the end, you weren\u2019t looking forward to the next mystery. You were looking forward to the next fight, and by that, I mean you were looking forward to the next time you saw someone suck a boob.\\n",

            "content": "After 5 days I finally did it. I finished the worst show I have ever seen in my life\u2026 but that was to be expected since I watched it for the sole purpose of proving my nerves of steel. Before watching this I didn\u2019t know what a show had to put me through, so I am forced to give it the lowest score possible and to be honest I didn\u2019t think this show would cut it. So what happened?\r\nLet\u2019s get down to business, shall we? \r\n(note: This might contain minor spoilers)\r\n________________________________________\r\nTo summarize it vaguely: This anime follows a generic shounen plotline, filled with borderline pornographicscenes, which take up a big part of the screen time. For the interested, these scenes consist of powerful human creatures, regardless of gender, literally sucking a magical energy-drink-like fluid, called \u201csoma\u201d, out of a female virgin\u2019s breast. These creatures, called Quasars, possess the ability to control a certain type of atoms to a molecular level, unique to each individual quasar, but without having consumed quality \u201csoma\u201d, they can\u2019t use their powers and thus are as useless as the rest of the normal humans in this show.\\n\r\nLet\u2019s start with the characters:\\n\r\n________________________________________\\n\r\nHell, Alexander Nikolaevich (\u201cSasha\u201d) _ 13 year old Russian exchange student and Quasar of iron. He has a dark past, which fails to grip the viewer making him even more unlikable than he already is. For some unclear reason he gets into a mutual love relationship with the female lead Mafuyu.\\n\\n\r\nOribe, Mafuyu _ around 15 years old. She is an uninteresting character, which only serves as the love interest of our MC. Her stubbornness and misjudgment of all the important scenes made her unbearable.\\n\\n\r\nTomo Yamanobe _ around 15 years old. She has the biggest breasts in the show. She is the one Mafuyu promised to protect. I have to give props to Toyasaki Aki, her voice actress, for the voice acting of both the female Tomo and the manly quasar of gold. Her childish personality was really enjoyable, giving refreshment to the rest of the bland characters.\\n\\n\r\nEkaterina Kurae (\u201cKatja\u201d) _ (no idea about her age) She is a masochistic loli and was for me the only enjoyable character in the cast. The show started off promising torturous scenes, which she embodied perfectly. Sadly enough the show didn\u2019t deliver those as it progressed, giving Katja even less screen time and making it even less enjoyable than it already was.\\n\\n\r\n(those are the only characters worth mentioning)\\n\r\n________________________________________\\n\r\nThe story revolves around our Russian exchange student called \u201cSasha\u201d. He is a quasar and has a job to do in Japan. On my first watch (and I\u2019ll be damned if it isn\u2019t the last) it was unclear what his goal was exactly, since you easily lost focus every now and then because of the seemingly scheduled soma feast, our important characters had to go through every episode.\\n\\n\r\nIn the first 12 episodes you get introduced to the protagonists and their friends with some backstories here and there. The show starts off depicting a torturous murder on a young girl. Regardless of the presentation, I somewhat liked this kind of tone but soon enough it was clear this was going to be bad take on a shounen series with tons of fan service. In the next episodes you see \u201cseemingly pointless fighting\u201d, which turns out to be the master plan of the evil guys, to prepare our Sasha to be sacrificed for some reason (because that always works out...). \\n\\n\r\nSurprisingly enough there was a good episode in this mess.(I will now take a detour to describe the only good moment in the show) \\n\r\nI have to give credit to episode 6 of the series, since it was the only episode in the series where I said: \u201cwow they did something right\u201d. Our gang of friends has to play maids for the rich girl, Tsujidou, Miyuri, so they can get a key for some villa to find something. While fooling around they get raided by a group of hired Russian soldiers who were ordered to find some sort of magical egg. At that point our main cast was consisting of tied up attractive underage girls and a boy who were lustfully glared upon by pleasure seeking soldiers. Everyone who hasn\u2019t lived under a rock will surely know what is about to happen. Surprisingly enough the rich girl decides to sacrifice herself and offers to strip for the soldiers, so her beloved friends can get out safe. In an earlier dialogue the loli of the cast, stated that she is like jewelry, once you get bored of it or it loses its worth you throw it away. This is how she indirectly described her relationship with the rich girl, who is obsessed with wealth, as something temporary depending on how long she can last as her \u201clittle princess\u201d. The stripping scene was accompanied by a melancholic piano which made you care for the first and last time about any character in this show. The loli ends up wanting to strip too and takes sip of soma while at it, so she can brutally massacre the soldiers and satisfy the viewers, in the meantime developed, cathartic thirst. The episode ends with the commander of the soldier group committing suicide and blowing the whole place up. Miraculously, our cast of characters survives. After this the show went downhill, dropping the themes and atmosphere developed earlier. But let\u2019s get to the second half of the show.\\n\\n\r\nEpisode 13 and 14 are to be labeled as pure fan service (although eps 14 was somewhat unique and slightly fun to watch with the rich girl being a superhero or what not BUT this will get too long if I start talking about another episode in detail. In short: \u201cboob lasers\u201d and \u201creminded me a bit of Gurren Lagann\u201d).\\n\\n\r\nIn the remaining episodes 15-24 the story goes really fast to reach the finish line. Introducing more Characters no one cares about with some of them ending up getting killed, and letting characters die who were established in the first half (no one from the main cast though). Our MC, Sasha, is now powered up and ready to fight the end boss. With the help of his friends, and the big breasts of Mafuyu, he somehow succeeds, defying all the established power levels in the story this far. The Last fight doesn\u2019t make sense at all; victory isn\u2019t achieved by any masterful strategic battle plan to defeat the superior enemy, but by the inability of the final antagonist to instakill the whole cast (as we have seen him do in other scenes), because of\u2026 reasons\u2026? I don\u2019t know, I get really angry when bad guys mess up for no reason at all and give the good guys an easy win\u2026\\n\\n\r\nAfter the final fight most of the new characters, which didn\u2019t end up dying, just disappear and don\u2019t matter anymore, but hey I guess that\u2019s what happens when you defeat the end boss. In my opinion, the Hydrogen and Carbon Quasar combo should be able to annihilate everything, but they only get one fight, which ends up being pointless.\\n\\n\r\nIn the last Eps Sasha has to leave because his job is done, letting us watch him and Mafuyu being together for the last time. This would be a heartwarming episode, but only if we actually cared for them or simply understood why those two got into a relationship in first place.\\n\r\n________________________________________\\n\r\nThe quality of the show is on relatively low standards, considering it\u2019s a 2010 show. It looks and is animated even worse than older shows like Studio Deen\u2019s Fate/Stay Night. All the character designs look like uninspired textbook shounen characters. Most of the fights are portrayed in a way which does not require good animation nor choreography, and if it does\u2026 then we have Deen-like movements. \\n\\n\r\nMusic was used to make scenes emotional, but as stated before the generic dark backstories don\u2019t sell well. You end up not even caring if someone gets hurt or has his loved ones getting killed in front of his eyes. In other words: nothing noteworthy.\\n\r\n________________________________________\\n\r\nEnjoyment was nearly inexistent for me. The constant slap to the face of boobs, panties and lewd scenes made it unwatchable, even forcing me to pause and tab away for some minutes\u2026 or hours. It\u2019s clear as day that this show was made with the clear aim to make it appeal to certain demographics, such as horny 13 year olds or hard core ecchi fans. I don\u2019t belong to any of those and thus this show was a big miss for me in the end (as expected). If the show was presented in a more mature way, or just kept its tone and atmosphere from the first episode I would have enjoyed it a bit. But then again I wouldn\u2019t have watched it in the first place. It\u2019s like saying \u201cif the show was better it wouldn\u2019t be bad\u201d so it doesn\u2019t matter in the end.\\n\r\nFor the interested in numbers:\\n\r\nCharacters: 4/10\\n\r\nStory: 2/10\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 1/10\\n\r\nOverall: 1/10\\n\\n\r\n(Art and sound didnt leave any impression which could influence the overall quality/enjoement and were thus neglected)\\n\r\n________________________________________\\n\r\nIf you think you can jerk off to minors sucking each other\u2019s breasts in borderline pornographic presentation and scenes, then this show is for you. If not then be happy to leave.\\n",

            "content": "I can assure you this. You will see boobs, boobs being sucked, boobs in varies of sizes. I have never seen this much of boobies in a Series that's actually Good!\r\nYES! It's a good Anime Series!\r\nWhen I first heard of this series, I thought: \"What weirdo would wanna watch guys sucking women breasts to gain their superpowers!?\"\r\nAnd yea, I'm one of those weridos.\r\nEither you like Ecchi, or you don't. So either you will enjoy this series, or get totally turned off by how absurd it can be at times, that you will not watch it.\r\nEither way, I'll do my best to describe this series inmy Review for you who are interested. Check the Overall (Summary) at the bottom if you wish a faster review.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 9\\n\r\nThe story is actually good! It's not the first you would think is good when how people gain their powers to fight in this series, is to suck women breasts for their so called \"Soma\".\\n\\n\r\nSo yea. It's about Qwasers. A human race whom can gain supernatural powers. Controlling Elements such as Iron, Fire, Space, Oxygen, Wind, all Elements can be controlled, and each Qwaser can controll One Element and each one have different abilities with their Element. To gain these powers, they suck women breasts for their Life Energy called Soma. Without it, they are weak and cannot control their element.\\n\r\nIt's easy to spoil stuff in this series, since small parts play part in something bigger. So I will only explain what's it about.\\n\\n\r\nWe follow mainly 2 girls and 1 specific Qwaser.\\n\r\nTomo Yamanobe, Mafuyu Oribe and the Qwaser Aleksander Nikolaevich \"Sasha\" Hell. They are both Bad and Good Qwasers, resulting in huge battles and conflicts.\\n\r\nA lot of conflicts between the Qwasers, Evil Qwasers are Dominate, want more power and control. And these girls are in the middle of it. Small parts off a bigger event is revealed through the episodes, the more you watch, the more you will want to continue. It never gets boring. The only thing you can predict in this Series that you will see boobs. Which I think, can never go wrong.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9\\n\\n\r\nIt's beautifully animated. Not a to Originally Look though, but this never goes wrong. Smooth, good variations, I like this style since it's a more realistic look. Example, Eyes in manga are supposed to be big. Yes, these are big. But I dislike Huge ones like in Clannad or Kanon.\\n\r\nBoobs looks nice as well. You could think I am \"overtalking\" the boobs section. But it's one of the main things in this series and you will see naked boobs in EVERY Episode. No kidding. Still A very watchable Great Series. I Promise you that.\\n\r\nOnly thing that bothers me, which is the same with all Series. Huge Boobies. They are girls with Natural looking boobies here, but the ones with the huge boobs are just unnatural and I have never liked it. Big boobs is one thing. Huge boobs is another. Cup size is off the charts. Though, this is a personal opinion. If you like it. Then you will love this series.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8\\n\r\nOpening Theme 1 and Ending Theme 1 is pretty much forgettable. It's nicely made, but it's not anything you will remember. Though the Second opening after half the series, was much better. First one was more Mainstream. you've heard the kind before.\\n\r\nSecond Opening was more twisted, and repetitive in a good way. Reflecting parts of the Series well, twisted perverted Scenes and repetitive scenes of naked boobs.\\n\r\nVoice Acting was as I always, great by Japanese voice actors.\\n\r\nMusic during storyline was good as well. But I hardly remember anyone. Still, it satisfy you entirely and is good. Rated 8 is not an overrate. Nothing was wrong with the sound.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 8\\n\r\nYou could say you have seen similar main characters. One Totally clueless girl, best friend with a dominate but understanding girl that wants to protect everything dear to her. Then comes a 13 year old guy who doesn't give a shit about others, but sooner revealed. He has a heart like everyone else, which was left behind for his own reasons.\\n\\n\r\nThe Characters are good. Nothing seems off placed. Due to the great story of this Anime Series.(At the same time the absurdity) They are all still very enjoyable as new characters. Including the supportive characters. \\n\\n\r\nI give it an 8 (very good) even though I can find similarities in some characters from other series. But it's nothing bad, since these kind of characters is always enjoyable and often used. It was very enjoyable and will say they are all unique.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9\\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed this series a lot! Even if you like Ecchi or not, it's not impossible for anyone to enjoy this. It has it all. It got both good and bad guys and girls. It has boobs, perverted scenes and I'm not jokin on that part. \\n\\n\r\nWell thought through supernatural powers with a good balance. Different Elements and Levels they have reached. You can understand somewhat how powerful they are when explained.\\n\r\nIt's sometimes funny, they have put in comedy which I enjoyed a lot. More comedy could easily be fitted in.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9\\n\\n\r\nGiven genres Action, Ecchi, Shounen, Super Power, Supernatural.\\n\r\nA small tag of Comedy as well. If you find Ecchi funny or just like Ecchi, you will love this and is a must see.\\n\\n\r\nThis Series was very unique, full of enjoyment and excitement. If you DONT like Ecchi, naked boobs and perverted scenes. You will probably not enjoy this since you would be disgusted every episode.\\n\r\nThe ecchi in this series is very original. It's a very serious story and sucking boobs is not an enjoyment here, it's to gain powers to fight! Which makes it sometimes so absurd since it's nothing normal about it.\\n\r\nYou will see the enjoyment while they suck on boobs. But not because of the boobs itself. Because of the powers they get from the Soma.\\n\\n\r\nThe Story is great! Very original and enjoyable even though its so absurd in thought. But It's a good story and I love that someone has dare to come out with something like this.\\n\r\nIt's not totally unrealistic. I love the display of dirty acts by the bad guys when they have a girl as hostage for example. Starting touching and squeezing boobs to tease and anger the enemy is naturally for a maniac. And its wonderfully displayed.\\n\\n\r\nA true Shounen Series. Ofc, girls could like this as well. And I am longing for the Second Season.",

            "content": "Overview\r\nWhat happens when you take plot elements from Fullmetal Alchemist, Hellsing Ultimate, and D.Gray-man, then mix them into a bad hentai? The answer is something quite abhorrent. Seikon no Qwaser isn't just your everyday bad echii. This one ups the ante and has a 12 year old boy and a 10 year old girl sucking the breasts of women in their older teens and engaging in various sexual acts. In episode 3, a 10 year old girl threatens to kill an older teen if she doesn't consent to giving her cunnilingus. Fortunately, we don't actually have to see this. We only see the little girl'sface and hear the lapping sounds thanks to a discretion shot. Otherwise, this series wouldn't even be legal under United States Federal Law. It only gets worse from there. This series would make Vladimir Nabokov, the creator of the Loli genre, blush with shame. I am not a squeamish prude. My favorite anime is Elfen Lied. Seikon no Qwaser made me feel very, very uncomfortable!\\n\\n\r\nStory 2/10\\n\\n\r\nThere are many wizards called Qwasers capable of bending specific elements to their whim. A secret arm of the Russian Orthodox Church has some of the most powerful wizards and uses them to hunt heratic wizards. The most powerful of the church's paladins is Alexander Hell. This is of course not to be confused with Hellsing's secret arm of the Catholic Church and their heretic hunting paladin Alexander Anderson. This is totally different! It is up to Alexander or \"Sasha\" to kick ass with his scythe and protect his harem of big breasted ladies. How does he get his awesome powers? By graphically sucking their tits and drinking the milk of course! How else would a wizard get his powers? Apparently one underraged Russian isn't enough and soon the Church sends another one called Ekaterina to assist Alexander. The story pretty much solely consists of fight scenes and sucking tits. The writer also has a rudimentary knowledge of chemistry and tries to show it off so frequently that even Kurt Vonnegut would tell him to knock it off!\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 1/10\\n\\n\r\nOh dear god do the characters suck in this one. Alexander is in the running for the most 2 dimensional Russian stereotype character in all of anime. His only rivals are Zangief from Street Fighter and Russia himself from Hetalia. The really sad thing is that Alexander is the best character in this piece of shit. We also have generic tsundere girl and clueless bimbo with ridiculously huge tits. Of course the psychotic loli Ekaterina shows up later, but she has as much character depth as the shallow end of the pool. \\n\\n\\n\r\nArt 7/10\\n\\n\r\nSurprisingly the art in this anime isn't bad. This thing actually had a budget and clearly had decent animators working on it. The tits look very...succulent\\n\\n\r\nSoundtrack 7/10\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is also one of the few highlights of this series. It is genuinely pretty decent and boasts catchy opening and closing themes as well as background music.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 1/10\\n\\n\r\nIf you are in this one for the plot, firstly you are an idiot, secondly you are going to be very disappointed. If you are in this for the porn, the pedo scenes will make that boner go away faster than seeing Larry King naked on a cold day. It is possible to enjoy Seikon no Qwaser... if you are a pedophile or clinically insane.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 1/10\\n\\n\r\nThis is one of the worst anime to come out in the last 5 years.

I'm currently only to episode 21, but even if it declines from here, I still enjoyed the goodness while it lasted.\r\nStory: 8\r\nIt's a very weird premise. Religion, the Periodic Table, dominatrix loli's and...Breast milk? I don't know how they made it work but it sure did. It's kept me hooked for quite a while, and it has just enough comedy to keep it from being too intense, but it doesn't cause the story to suffer any. 70% of the episodes open withan ecchi 'treat' for the viewers, and there's definitely quite a bit of ecchi in the show itself. I don't think it makes the story any less enjoyable, but I can understand how it would make it less entertaining for others.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9\\n\r\nIt's really pretty. Even though towards the beginning, a lot of the..suckling scenes were recycled, but as it went on that didn't happen as much. The battle scenes are intense and awesome, but it seems that they're cut pretty short, most of the time. I suppose it's better than having them drag out through several episodes and overstay their welcome.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 7\\n\r\nI wasn't thoroughly impressed with it. I do like both of the openings and endings, though. The voice acting is nice, very fitting. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9\\n\r\nMost of the characters are pretty good. Until later episodes, Mafuyu is rather boring. Tomo is so innocent yet lacks a shred of modesty, leading to some very funny material, which is why she's my favorite. I don't really have any complaints about any of the characters. I just wished Teresa had more screen time, she's absolutely adorable.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9\\n\r\nI really do love this show. I initially thought it was going to be stupid and just a big fanservice bonanza but I was really impressed with it's execution.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 10\\n\r\nIt's not exactly something you can suggest to all of your friends, as ecchi is not everyone's cup of tea, but for those who enjoy  that kind of thing may want to try.",

            "content": "Seikon no Qwaser is for me an underrated anime. It has 24 episodes and focuses on the fight against an evil group. The one fighting them is a small boy named \"Sasha\" who manipulates iron (the fighting theme is about manipulation of the chemical elements-just like using iron or copper and so on)...\r\nWell the interesting part is that he gains his powers by sucking from the breasts of the girls around him. Sounds more like a hentai but it is one of those ecchi animes like Queens Blade (if you know it), only that Seikon no Qwaser is taking it a little further. Still youwill only see breasts and such because it is after all an ecchi. Now it is actually a real fun part if you watch the uncensored version. I reccommand it...\\n\\n\r\nCharacters and story are all kept pretty simple though. You will see most of the typical anime girl types from shy to bold. But at least it follows a slight storyline.\\n\r\nFor the setting, drawing and fights: Setting is taking place around school mostly. Not so much to tell. But for the drawing, I was pretty surprised by the way it looks like. You will enjoy watching most of the girls. And now fights, it is a more episodic pattern of how the fights go but still showing off some nice moves. So some action is also included.\\n\\n\r\nI just want to add that the music was really one of the best parts of the anime. All the openings and ending were pretty catchy and got even better. Even if you don't like the anime, the music is great.\\n\\n\r\nSo it might seems like an ecchi trash anime with nothing special in it but it is entertaining...and with entertaining I mean that you shouldn't take it serious if you want to enjoy it. If you expect too much from it then you will fail. If you are into a little more harder sucking ecchi then you can or should check it out. I won't reccomand it if you search for something great or serious. And don't watch it censored if you know what is good for you. Finally if you are a fan of simple ecchi fighting animes then you will like it. I will give it a decent rating because it was overall good enough.",

            "content": "I started watching this series because the concept sounded pretty lulzy - after all, it's about breast sucking and gaining magic powers from it. But I soon realised that this show is literally about nothing albeit petty squabbling over the penis of a tiny exchange student. That being said, everything about it average, especialy the story.\r\nStory: 3\r\nAfter you get over the whole breast sucking fiasco and get involved in the story, you realise how little there really is. It's about the foreign exchange student, crashing daily student life and the first portion of the series is pretty reverse haremy. However, it slowly degrades into avillain of the week and the wading through that particular marsh isn't worth the very average ending.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 5\\n\r\nAverage, it's not bad but not good either. The fight scenes are relatively impressive, and the detail to the breast sucking is well done. The extreme breast physics when he extracts soma from them is pretty hilarious; and the characters themselves are rather nicely drawn and fit with the dark theme. The first few episodes were fairly good, but the art wanes as you progress through the series.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 5\\n\r\nThe first opening is very catchy; and the second one not so much. The endings with all the voice actors is also particularly impressive. The OST is essentially the one of the defining features of this show, as it sets the dark, dreary mood despite the crazy breast feasting occuring. That being said, none of the songs haven't stayed with since the time the show finished - meaning the music didn't have that much of an impression on me.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 6\\n\r\nAs per usual, harems have fairly good character development in exchange for a cromulent storyline. Seikon no Qwaser sacrifices even more character development for ecchi scenes. But over the course of the 24 episode, characters were able to be somewhat develop - but no where to the extent of other girls in other, similar length series. That being said, character development is the only saving grace for this anime - because really, there is nothing else. I also hate Tomo - those characters anger me so much. She's so useless and disgusting, yet they dedicate X episodes to give her some sort of use. It's a waste of your time.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 7\\n\r\nThere is nothing more great than laughing at an anime which attempts to be legitimate. This anime has proven that. The concept of drinking breast milk to increase ones strength is absolutely hilarious. I laughed for hours and hours and hours. If this series was 12 episodes, it would've been much more success. But 24 episode of this rubbish? I don't think so. I didn't necessarily look forward to watching one episode every week, but it was watchable. The voice acting was probably the best part of this anime, but much like anime such as Queen's Blade, no amount of voice acting can help you trawl your way through this anime. Though, Chihara Minori's sexy moaning is pretty sexy.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nThis anime promises breast sucking, but unfortunately takes this concept a little bit too far. Getting powerups from drinking the delicious milk of your female friends is pretty lulzy, but using an ecchi as a plot device isn't going to work out well. It's a stimulent which gets your penis going. It is not a concept to be explored; and definitely not the ground for an anime.\\n\\n\r\ntl;dr \\n\r\nThe story is about breast sucking. Watch it for lulz, but if you expect even the slightest bit more, you're going to be disappointed.",

            "content": "Every once in a while you come across an anime that is so far outside the realm of normality that you simply can\u2019t help but be amazed. This can be either for better or for worse but regardless of which it\u2019ll generally leave a more lasting impression.\r\nWhen it comes to Seikon no Qwaser, it made me feel progressively stupider while I was watching it. This simply has to be the strangest concept I\u2019ve ever seen for a story, but it somehow makes it work. First off I would like to say that this show is NOT for everyone. The term ecchi is nowhere near enoughto describe the extent of SnQ. I\u2019ve seen plenty of quite borderline H anime in my career, but this has to take the cake. The strange thing is that despite that, the way the show uses its extreme perverseness is actually secondary. In reality, Seikon no Qwaser is an action/super power series and shouldn\u2019t even be classified as neither a romance nor a harem series. It just so happens that all the supernatural abilities in the show are powered\u2026 by sucking breast milk from women.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is very simplistic and clich\u00e9; you\u2019ve got your male protagonist surrounded by heaps of women and they\u2019re constantly being targeted by bad guys as everyone is competing over trying to find a lost artifact which supposedly can grant its user the power of god\u2026 or something like that. The characters are split into two halves; you\u2019ve got the \u201cQwasers\u201d which are the supernatural guys who get their powers from sucking breast milk, or \u201cSoma\u201d, from the other supporting half, where the donators are called \u201cMarias\u201d. As absurd as it is, it\u2019s pretty straightforward once you\u2019ve finally accepted just what the hell you are actually watching.\\n\\n\r\nThe fights themselves are pretty interesting though. Every Qwaser is unique, as he/she is connected to a specific element on the periodic table, allowing him/her to manipulate said substance at will and use that in any which way thinkable for fighting. The amount of energy available to do so is based on the strength of the Qwaser and how much Soma he/she has digested beforehand.\\n\\n\r\nThe character cast is at first glance pretty damn stereotypical. You\u2019ve got the standard harem situation with the protagonist surrounded by a tsundere, an airhead and the silent but loyal and obedient old friend. The protag himself however is not exactly your average one, as he\u2019s a cold hearted, mechanical and revenge driven young lad. Actually when I say young lad I really mean it, he\u2019s basically a shota compared to the heroine cast, and is also a pretty huge tsundere himself. Last but not least, the final two main characters are a bit more standalone\u2026 as they share the wonderful combination of a lolicon/yuri/BDSM coupling, and quite frankly they were easily the most interesting duo to watch throughout the entire series, especially the pseudo-gothic twintailed loli dominatrix Katja voiced by Aya Hirano. They also had some extremely borderline H scenes together, unlike the mere constant breastfeeding throughout the anime. As far as side characters go though, they were pretty damn forgettable.\\n\\n\r\nVisuals and audio weren\u2019t anything particularly memorable. The whole idea of basing super powers on chemistry allowed for quite a lot of unorthodox action scenes to take place, but even so the animation wasn\u2019t anything really worth praising. As far as the soundtrack goes, neither the OP, ED nor overall OST comes to mind either. In fact I can\u2019t even remember what either sounded like even now, right after finishing the series. The seiyuu cast and performance was pretty good though overall, albeit somewhat varied in individual quality.\\n\\n\r\nBy far the best part about Seikon no Qwaser though is its entertainment value. Coming into this, I was somewhat prepared for that it would be a very strange experience, but as far as the actual enjoyment went, I have to admit I was really positively surprised. I had a ton of fun marathoning through all of this. Even if the crazy amount of boobs plastered all over the screen isn\u2019t exactly my type of thing, in this particular case I somehow didn\u2019t really mind. It\u2019s such an abstract show that I couldn\u2019t help but feel interested in it for the wtf-factor alone. SnQ isn\u2019t an ecchi anime meant to turn you on. In fact, 90% of its sexual showings will most likely creep you out more than anything, but before long you will stop thinking about it as anything more than a supporting aspect of what is in actuality an action series. Hell even the girls themselves don\u2019t seem to act like its anything out of the ordinary.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, despite its creepiness and absurdity, I wholeheartedly enjoyed this anime a lot more than I had expected coming into it. Admittedly though, it\u2019s pretty damn hard to rate, and I can see pretty much any score for it being understandable given how extreme it is, but in the end, the reason people watch anime is for entertainment, and in that aspect at least, Seikon no Qwaser manages to deliver well above expectations.",

            "content": "And I thought Eiken was the most unbearable piece of garbage I've seen from anime. Whereas Eiken had no plot whatsoever in its ridiculously ecchi antics, this turd attempts to create a cookie-cutter shounen action anime mixed in with enough perverted material that made it hard for me to even watch at points. Seikon no Qwaser's gimmick with its ecchi content comes in the form of the superpowered beings called Qwasers having to suck on breast milk to grant them their elemental/ metal manipulating powers. With this gimmick also comes plenty of instances where you can see rape-like situations and moments of sadomasochism from itscast. The problem with implementing this ecchi content for Seikon no Qwaser is that implementing its breast-sucking scenes and other perverted content in serious moments like action scenes and character development make them look more creepy, awkward and uncomfortable than immersible for any sane viewer, and the gimmick really does enough to get in the way of any relevant elements to the title's plot.\\n\\n\r\nIf you strip away the breast sucking, perversion, attempted rapes and sadomasochism though, you have nothing more than a typical story of revenge coming from Sasha's tragic past and encounters with the secret cult known as Adepts with plans of world domination, along with a cast of archetypal characters you would see done to death from enough high school/ fan service titles like the clumsy ditz (Tomo), the ojou (Miyuri), the sharp-tongued and manipulative loli (Katja) and the tomboy (Elizabeth). The villains among the Adepts are mostly nothing more than either your garden variety mook serving to get offed by Sasha and other Qwasers or a power-hungry loon who thinks he is better than everyone and wants to rule the world. The first half of the anime mostly features Sasha offing the different mooks of the Adepts and much of the second half is where the Adepts execute their big plan of world domination that Sasha and the other Qwasers have to stop, with the second half developments coming along after some pretty pathetic attempts at comedy with one notable character gaining amnesia for a couple episodes. In other words, the plot to this anime is just one huge excuse for its breast-sucking gimmick and other perverted content.\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of visuals, Seikon no Qwaser is rather standard in its presentation with decent-looking scenery and character designs. While animation shortcuts are apparent with this series at a number of points, Qwaser battles were engaging to a degree thanks to the abilities of the Qwasers to manipulate their individual elements. The very frequent appearance of huge boobs bobbing and bouncing around at enough points, however, does kill any enjoyment one would want to get from the Qwaser battles thanks to how annoyingly distracting they are.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Seikon no Qwaser is nothing more than just another ecchi show trying to find another creepy gimmick to get its sex-crazed otaku fanbase gawking over huge boobs and perversion, while using standard character archetypes and plot cliches as a crutch for its ecchi antics. Unless you have a thing for any imaginable ecchi content, definitely don't waste your time on it.",

            "content": "I originally decided to pick this up because I was told of an action series in which people literally sucked on a girl's nipple for energy to fight, yet is not a porn. In other words, it was out of sheer curiosity as to whether or not such a thing would lead to catastrophe or not. And surprisingly enough, it didn't.\r\nI'll start by letting you know this over the top fanservice will most likely either drive you away in disgust or keep you glued to the screen while shedding tears of joy. I'm sure some people will just laugh it off or ignore it aswell, but it can be pretty polarizing.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 7:/10. The story doesn't really stray from typical shounen plot, but does make use of a few really interesting concepts. For one, it's characters all have powers born of an element from the periodic table (Hydrogen, Mercury, Iron, etc.) and not the usual elements used for this sort of thing (fire, water, earth, etc.) This makes for some rather creative and enjoyable fights throughout the series. Another is it's use of the Christianity in the plot, like a painting of the virgin Mary breastfeeding Jesus containing the power of God. There have certainly been series to do a better job incorporating religion (See: Chrono Crusade), but I'll admit that I surprisingly happy with it considering it was an ero anime.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8/10. The art for this series is pretty well done, although much of the work clearly goes into breast animation (again, something you either be really happy or really sad about), ass shots. The fighting was rather well done, another surprise for a show of this premise. Overall, I was pleased with the quality.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 6/10. The \"bad shit is happening\" track sounded well placed, but everything else was pretty forgettable. This includes both opening and ending themes.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 6/10. Alexander was honestly the only interesting character in the series. With the exception of him, everyone else conformed to some archetype or another almost perfectly. The idea of a of a really short badass who looks like an emo goth sounds ridiculous, but it's honestly the best way to describe him and it worked out rather well. He also has a pretty unique scar carved into the side of his face.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8/10. The enjoyment you get from this series all hinges upon how you deal with the fanservice. If you really don't like looking at naked cartoon characters, then this isn't the series for you. If that's your thing, prepare for a full course meal of it.",

I couldn't help but download it after I read the synopsis of it. Big boobs, tons of fanservice, weird fighting and an almost all half naked female cast. I thought it would be good for a few laughs.\r\nThen I started watching it and couldn't stop. The storyline was actually good enough to draw me in. The artwork is done very well, and the sound quality is top-notch. The fighting is almost non existant actually. There is a little here and a little there. But itisn't Dragon Ball Z style. A fight starts, a few seconds later someone is in a million pieces.\\n\\n\r\nOverall this show is mostly about fanservice. And it has all kinds. Nothing crazy kinky yet. But enough that if you don't like a little S&M you probably shouldn't watch this. \\n\\n\r\nI would say that if you like hentai with good artwork, some decent characters and an above par storyline, then you should deffinately give this show a shot.",

Aight im in. the story goes like, theres these two chicks 1 with huge cow tites, and the other with softball tits, they're like sisters nd shit or something, and they get bullied a lot by some small tit bitch and some big tit bitch. One day some random bitch goes all crazy on them and is stealing the tit milk of the girls of the area because tit milk has power. THEN!! this white haired kid and some cat ear haired bitch save the day, after he sucks her tites.\r\n^^so yeahhthats the first episode. My thoughts on the series, were kinda off and on, although i loved the amount of tits, i felt it almost took away from the story they wanted to provide. I know its an Ecchi but i also love story in them like IS, i love the fact that it has 26 or something eps, that made it worth it.\\n\\n\r\nStory: i give this shit a 6, the tits were totally awesome, so were that ass shots, but i feel like it tried focusing to much on it\\n\\n\r\nArt: omg the tit art was amazing like it actually showed nipples getting hard, i was amazed, id rate the art 10\\n\\n\r\nSound: if you're into moaning nd shit at the start of the show then aye this shit is all for you, i give it a 10\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: the characters were pretty cool, but not much development id like to see, i give it a 6\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: man i cant tell you how many boners i got from watching this shit, the fan service never failed...ever, i give it a 20\\n\\n\r\nOverall: if you're looking for a decent anime to kill some time in between your ongoing ones this one is perefect",

            "content": "Seikon no Qwaser is one anime that is easy to binge watch. There are a few reasons as to why I think that, but for now lets focus on the series.\r\nThe story takes place in Japan, and was told in a somewhat cryptic way. It doesn't really make sense until the later episodes when more things are happening and is tied together. It is a rather simple story, but I didn't find it particularly boring to watch. I found the pacing to be quite mediocre. At times, you can tell a few things were rushed and at other times it felt a bit slow. Thecomedical moments in Seikon no Qwaser were pretty funny while the Ecchi and fanservice were desireable. There were a few tropes that I felt were done right, and there were some that didn't really sit well.\\n\\n\r\nThe art style does feel a bit old school compared to other series. It is a bit standard for this style of animation. I think the creator accomplished their goal in setting the mood with the art style. If there was any CGI used in this anime, then it blended really well cause I couldn't tell if there was or not. The style and quality of the animation stayed the same throughout the series, and the animation was fluid.The backgrounds are a bit copy and paste, but fit well for the anime. The character's designs were nice and fit their personalities well. The character's were unique between them, but did remind me of a few other anime.\\n\\n\r\nI felt that some of the voices didn't match the characters. The main male protags voice sounded off to me as he sounded wayy older than he looked and was. The background music was great and fit the atmosphere of the story. I did find how some tracks highlighted certain scenes. I would find myself listening to some of the OST. I didn't really like some of the endings and the first opening was average. I really liked the second opening and felt it fit the show more than the first.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters were pretty well made. They each had their flaws, quirks, and strengths. The extra characters reacted to situations in a pretty realistic way which made it more interesting. The MCs reacted a bit unrealistic at some points. The characters did grow, but each in their own way. I found that some characters were more fleshed out than other characters. The supporting cast was only fleshed out on a few, but some were still cryptic. I did dislike the character Miyuri, and I don't think the creator had the intentions of you disliking them. She tended to be quite annoying at times. I do think I will remember some of the characters, but not their full names. \\n\\n\r\nI do think that others would like this series because of the soundtrack and art. The ecchi parts may turn off people and I can see why people would dislike the series because of that. If you aren't an anime or manga fan you probably wouldn't like this work. I would like to re-watch this anime in the future, and probably watch the whole thing over. I wouldn't like to own this series, and it is kind of memorable. Some scenes from the anime will definitely stay in my mind.\\n\\n\r\nHope you enjoyed this review. This is my first review, and I hope that it helps you on deciding to watch this series.",

            "content": "Safe to read - No Spoilers\r\nThis was recommended by my friend who watches almost every ecchi anime out there, and this was one of the ecchi anime he introduced to me that was good.  You know not the typical common ecchi anime. If I were to describe this anime it would be like you're in a science labaratory listening to your naked teacher holding a bible while fapping.\r\n-Story 8-\r\nIt a about a russian kid whose name is Aleksander Nikolaevich Hell or Sasha. He's a qwaser and to tell you what that is do you know legend of Aang or Kora? He's like the ironbender, and to use that skill he must suck soma or to simply put it \"breast milk\".\\n\\n\r\n The story/plot is good it was satisfying to watch .The flow of the story is good, character developement, and good amount of flashbacks. I really watch it for the boobs- I mean plot. I mean really just watch the first episode and the first second starts with the plot already. \\n\\n\r\n-Art 8- \\n\r\nI like the art because it fits an ecchi anime. Althoug the art isn't exactly rare or anything amazing it was just the common normal art that almost every anime has. The details is alright. You know panty shots,  and big boobs. \\n\\n\r\n-Sound 6-\\n\r\nDid not like the music,The OST was dull, it didn't strike me, you know when you're sad and the OST just makes you cry, it lack that.  I couldn't feel the music in fight scenes. The OST and ED I skipped them, it wasn't really interesting for me. Although the voice actors were good, it fits the faces of the characters.\\n\\n\r\n-Characters 7-\\n\r\nCharacter design it's alright. The characters were weird but good weird cuz it doesn't make them common characters. The girls in this anime mostly consist of big boobs girl. Really if you want to watch ecchi anime and you have big boob fetish, this one is perfect for you.\\n\\n\r\n-Enjoyment 8-\\n\r\nI can't fully enjoy the anime 1 episode and I go to the bathroom. I can't watch it in 1 go. :S Like I this was recommended by my friend and I don't really watch ecchi anime but this is great. It has that good plot that I was interested to.\\n\\n\r\n-Overall 7-\\n\r\nI really recommend for hardcore ecchi fan out there! Has uncensored and censored version though, but who the heck loves censored version?! The uncensored version is very borderline hentai, if action, ecchi, and harem is not your cup of tea don't watch it. But atleast give it a try.\\n\\n\r\nPros:\\n\r\n You can learn alot science from the story. Like periodic tables, atom and other things\\n\\n\r\nCons:\\n\r\n Too much fanservice, cant focus well on the story. To put it simply it relies on fanservice too much.\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Having watched the first two episodes of Seikon no Qwaser I have to say it wasn't a very impressive way to start a series, although I think my reasoning will be a little different then that of my fellow reviewers :)\r\nStory - The plot is a fairly average recreation of a lot of other action/ecchi type anime series, the draw-card of course being that the heroes/villains seem to powerup by sucking breast milk. This didn't bother me that much in principle (ANIME OBJECTIFYING WOMEN?! SAY IT ISN'T SO! :P)  although it would be amusing in the extreme to find out how this can possiblybe explained as leading to superpowers. Having only seen the first two epiosdes I can't say much about the overall story except that its otherwise fairly run of the mill for this genre.\\n\\n\r\nArt - The art is fairly nice, my only complaint would be with whoever designed Tomo. I understand breasts are going to play a big part in this series but really that's just ridiculous.\\n\\n\r\nSound - Not much to say, nothing stood out as particularly good or bad in the sound department.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - Initial responses to the characters is that they are decent, except for Tomo who seems designed to annoy me (is there some weird market for giant breasts on woman who act like five year olds?). Alex is a jerk but somehow I doubt he will stay one for the whole series, and a big scythe is always a fun weapon.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment -  This is where I'll get to air my pet peeve with this series and the main thing which made the whole thing awkward to watch and cause a huge dent to my enjoyment. I understand broadcasting people sucking each others chests is probably over the line in a number of ways - but what on earth was the camera doing during those scenes? I get that it has to look somewhere else but you could at least look at SOMETHING in the actual scene, all of those random shots of the sky and awkwardly framed scenes sapped the enjoyment far more then anything else in the series, even more then Tomo (--stab!)\\n\\n\r\nOverall - aside from the drawcard issue Seikon no Qwaser is just a very average action/ecchi/harem sort of deal. Its perfectly safe to watch it but unless it improves a great deal it's looking like a very mediocre series. I will actually play devils advocate here and suggest that if an uncensored version does come out it might improve things significantly by the removal of all those weird camera positions (of course if the whole thing freaks you right out then that probably will make things worse - up to you guys :) )",

            "content": "A Young Boy must take revenge upon the one who has killed his sister, marked his face, and destroyed his pride. Along the way, he meets new people who at first, he thought of annoying, but has grown towards them and considered them his family. Moving along the story, he meets villains who, are not your average 'villain'. Actually, said villains have a certain background that one would not be able to fathom. \r\nStory: 9/10\r\nThe Story seems to revolve around boobs, boobs, and more boobs! But actually, that doesn't really have anything to do with the story. Certainly, boobs are in the story, but theyaren't the main focus. It's somewhat annoying In My Opinion, to see boobs jiggling, but they give you a good laugh to try and take your mind off it and focus more on the story (i've easily been able to do that). \\n\r\nAnyways, basically this story is about a Qwaser, and it's Maria. The Qwaser is the controller of an element, and the Maria is the one who supplies the Qwaser of his or her powers. There's Many of these \"Qwasers\". and Our Main Character, Alexander Nikloviech, A.K.A. Sasha, meets many of them, some friends, and some foes. \\n\r\nI've grown to love the story, mostly annoying a bunch of the Ecchi-ness of it, although i do like some of it, made me laugh :).\\n\\n\r\nThe \"Art\".10 /10\\n\r\nThe art is very good! I love it all, it's not like your old/average art, it's more like a very new-ish art. Very Detailed, and i'm very sure the Makers certainly focused on that part xD.\\n\\n\r\nSound. 10 / 10\\n\r\nThe Sound is very enjoyable, i loved the OST's, especially when the 'Battle' Music starts, Man! Did that get my heart pumpin'!\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10\\n\r\nThere is alot of Character Development in this anime, it's not your average 7 episodes per character to find out it's development, it's more like a 1 episode that focuses on the character & the others. It's very well organized and i applaud the producers for their well-done work! Seeing how this season 1 anime is only 24 episodes long, They've done a Marvelous job at organizing each and every one of the characters! (Main, not really the side ones-which is supposed to be how it goes).\\n\\n\r\nBecause many of the characters have either a tragic, or dark past, The development is really astounding! It talks about their past, and switches back and forth between past and present, showing off how they all react towards it. I really enjoyed it, seeing how i'm one for animes with tragic pasts/...Anything related to their past that they'd wish to fix. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\r\nI seriously did enjoy this anime. It was very well-done In My Opinion, although. . . they could lessen the Ecchi, some of it wasn't necessary, although i could see that they were trying to buff it up for those who are into Ecchi.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nAll-Around, this anime was a total 10/10! My only problem would be a, \\n\r\n-\"Too Much Ecchi\"- For me LoL.",

The jiggling, reminiscent of classics such as Burnup and plastic little. (which if you were a fan who collected DVD's back then like me, you will recall actually had jiggle counters on the special features in the ADV releases)\r\nWell, all I can sayis this was a fresh take on that, and despite being a new show, it ended up making me feel a tad nostalgic for those kinds of titles. It's a great series with fanservice thrown into the mix and integrated into it in a way that makes it part of the whole thing instead of just being tits for the sake of tits.\\n\r\nWorth a watch, even if you aren't into the eechii.",

            "content": "Story: 9/10\r\nSeikon No Qwaser.\r\nALERT: If you cannot stand ecchi scenes, then this anime may not be what you like. However, there are two types. The censored version, which covers up the nudity and then there is the uncensored, which you can see the body parts. \r\nAlrighty! My turn for the review. I got to admit, I only watch ecchi if and only if, it has a really good storyline. I found out about this anime, through randomly watching anime previews on YouTube.\r\nI believe, the anime producers did a masterpiece job for the storyline! I would give it a 10/10, however I gave it 9 instead,because it's a bit too flashy and fan-serviced, but as far as the story goes, I love it. Just.. the drinking from boobs, is strange. It makes me think of babies for some reason... xD\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe whole plot goes with: The boy who is known as Aleksander Nikolaevich Hell who is 13 years old and is the main character who is Russian and he is a Qwaser amongst other Qwasers, a few who are good and the others who are bad. However, later on he prefers to be called as Sasha. Anywho, he is extremely smart for his age.  However, even though he is 13 years old, he doesn't act childish. He is a extremely serious and mature person. He uses the power of Alchemy to fight enemies by using only iron as his alchemy power, as well as the enemies use Alchemy too, to fight back. Sasha, has the ability to transform his iron alchemy power to create different weapons. However, when he levels up his skills then he gets more powerful and stronger. This usually happens when the enemies turn his anger into rage, especially if other Qwasers hurt the one that he vowed to protect. \\n\\n\r\nThe role of Qwasers, they need to obtain a certain amount of \"soma\" or known as \"milk\" by breastfeeding from maidens, to gain the superior strength needed to fight, in a battle. \\n\\n\\n\r\nWhat I like behind Seikon No Qwaser, is because I like the use of originality of the supernatrual powers obtained by the use of boobs. It may sound strange, however we were all born as babies and we all have drank milk from our mums. So, as much it does sound strange is as much it is natrual for babies and their mothers. Anywho, even though the main character and the other characters aren't babies, they still do drink milk to obtain power. Which.. yes does sound a whole lot strange, but I like the idea because it is very original. \\n\\n\\n\r\nArt: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nI Loved the Art. 10/10 for me. :)\\n\r\nThe art really matches the story.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound For Music: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nI absolutely loved the opening theme song of Errand - Fayln, as well as the Ending song Passionate Squall by Ayumi Fujimora. I really think the music matched with the song!! For me both of those songs are masterpieces, as well as Wishes Hypocrites - Ayumi Fujimura.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound For The voice-overs 10/10:\\n\\n\r\nI liked all the characters voice-overs, it all matched.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 10/10\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe characters range from: Girly to Guyish. \\n\\n\r\nThere are those who are very perverted girls and actually do perverted things(example: whips).\\n\r\nHowever, pretty much all the girls are powerless (however, only their milk is powerful for Qwasers). Although, they don't have any powers, only the Qwasers have the powers. However, only one girl which is human has a power, which is un-clear to her when she obtains it, she gets confused. There is however, Teresa that only uses bow and arrows, bare-handed, kicking skills and blades, which is a human and uses her combat fighting skills when needed. \\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment With Scenes 8/10:\\n\\n\r\nI pretty much loved it all a lot. I just think it was a bit too... fan service and sometimes it would focus a lot on Ekaterina's ecchi scene's and of course boobies/ecchi instead of the storyline. I would love it, if it can start to grow the plot more during the next upcoming seasons, to make the plot take the lead role. As it does get a bit boring.. seeing repetitive scenes of Ekaterina, doing what she does x100 + times.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall  : \\n\\n\r\n9/10.",

So there's these hardass fuckers called qwasers and they can control the elements (but only one each to be fair). But we're talkin the periodic table elements and not like light and shadow so this is actually pretty original. But then the show really pulls out the big guns when it drops the ultimate fuckin truth on you when it turns out that they get their powers from sucking on goddamn titties. It's pretty cool cause I really don't see original stuff too often and it's refreshing to get some good, unique ideasthrown around in this stagnant industry. So probably the best thing about the show is the way the action and characters and plot play off eachother so masterfully. The events flow quite seamlessly and even the controversial amounts of fanservice are with my son and sexy wife Gomez. True masterstorke.",

            "content": "I cannot even begin to describe the disappointment I felt after having watched the first few episodes of this series.\r\nWhy does one take a concept as awesome as controlling a chemical element ( my god the possibilities. )  and shit all over it by having the characters with said power charge their abilities by drinking goddamn breast milk.\r\nI was merely looking for a nice, new action series with maybe some depth to it as I stumbled over Seikon no Qwaser. I didn't read into it a lot before deciding to give it a try. I mean, characters with the power to control a singlechemical element? What could go wrong, right? A concept like that is really promising and you can go all creative on 'em shizz.\\n\r\nBut not too far into the series (the first few minutes actually) you are bombarded with fetishism. At first I thought this was just some part of the story where maybe the good guys would have to fight a sadistic, perverted killer or whatever, and expected some in-depth psycho stuff. But very soon I realized that this was just gonna be the general picture of the anime, not just about sadistic, perverted killers, no, the entire thing would be borderline-hentai and a modicum of action served to the people watching this show.\\n\r\nI did not even finish the series because at some point, I just got so frustrated about how they fucked this awesome concept up, I couldn't bear it anymore. Towards the end of what I watched, the show only revolved around holy boobs carrying holy breastmilk anymore, the motif of vengeance they had established at the beginning of the show faded away except for a few moments.\\n\\n\r\nAll on all I ought to say that the main reson because I'm rating this show so bad is because it had the potential to be a really nice and entertaining show, the art is top-notch, the soundtrack is decent, but they fucked up on the general setting. The characters seemed mostly dull and not well developed safe for maybe 1 or 2 of them ( though I never fully finished the series, but I doubt they'd give them more of an edge towards the end ). All the show turns out to be about is friggin tits. Not that I have anything against them, god bless a woman's bosom, but if you want to make a series revolving around them make it either educational or a straight out damn hentai.",

            "content": "Genre:  Ecchi, Shounen\r\nNote these two genres seem odd together, because they are! It's more of an ecchi anime, with a humorous captivating plot. However, rather than just being a regular ecchi anime there is also a factor which will appeal to girls. The main character is an adorable 13 year old boy, surrounded by beautiful girls. This being said, I find it common for both genders to find the \"physical appeal\" of the anime to be quite satisfying. Basically, this is just an Ecchi anime with a plot revolving around a shota-boy.\r\nStory 9/10: The story is based on elements (chemistry) and people with thepower to control them. The characters get their powers from breast milk... I can't help but laugh every pre-fight scene because of that fact alone. There is a lot of fighting in the anime to defeat a certain group/character. The anime consist of the typical \"friendship\" theme where people warm up to each other and start appreciating the others existence. Middle of anime was little boring, but spend up at end\\n\\n\r\nCharacters 8/10: I loved the interactions between the three main characters, their personalities and the way they treated each other gave a warm friendly vibe. The characters were original and unoriginal in their own way, for an Ecchi anime I'd say they were fitting and well done.\\n\\n\r\nArt/Sound 7/10: The anime has a lot of boobs... the characters are decently drawn, nothing to be disappointed about. The voices are good, and the OP/ED are alright.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment/Overall 8/10: The anime filled the expectation of an Ecchi anime, with a shounen plot. These anime in my opinion are pretty rare, and good ones are even more rare. I found the series to be worth a watch if you're interested in the genre. Although, I can only stand so much of ecchi I lost interest and had to take long breaks between episodes XD.\\n\\n\r\n*Reminder, if you do not enjoy either of these genres of anime, obviously, you will not enjoy the anime!",

BREAST MILK (the moment I found out I was like dafuq???) The anime also includes heaps of chemistry stuff as elements are featured.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is really good, but most of the female characters have fake looking oversized boobs... If you search up their measurements, you'd be like wtf \\n\\n\r\nLet's see... The storyline.... 50% of the story line revolves around boobs, boobs, even more boobs, and SM. If the author reduced the amount of boobs in the anime by like 50%, I'm pretty sure it would get a higher rating.\\n\r\nAlthough I did mention that 50% of the story revolves around boobs and SM, this anime wouldn't be considered hentai. I'd say that if the storyline didn't have as much boobs and SM, I'd give it a 9, but now, I'd give it a 7.5.\\n\\n\r\nOverall I quite liked the anime since I found Mafuyu and Sasha really cute >< and I also liked how it featured chemistry (The anime is kind of smart..

            "content": "-No Spoilers Review-\r\nI'll be honest, I mainly was interested in watching Seikon no Qwaser due to the crazy reception that it has due to it's excessive and unique fan service. You have to go into watching this anime with the knowledge that it is meant to entertain you in ways that other anime don't. \r\nI was surprised though at how much I started to enjoy the characters as the series played out. The story is semi generic, aside from the element of drawing power by suckling a breast, but it does manage to throw in a few twists and interesting turns along the way. Nothingspecial, but not terrible. You shouldn't watch this anime for the plot. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters are a bright spot for sure and most of them are able to flesh out their personalities throughout the series. Sasha, Tomo, Mafuyu, and Ekaterina are a few of my favorites. The series is 24 episodes long, so a good number of the characters get to be fully realized even though at first they might seem shallow. All of the characters aren't needed for the story, but them being on screen isn't a crutch to the series. You'll probably have a few favorites by the end of it all.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is pretty good. Some scenes suffer from less details compared to others, but the character designs and overall illustrations are very good. Lots of focus seemed to be put towards breast animations and detail, so maybe that's why some of the further away scenes hinder. It's nothing too noticeable though and the anime is very appealing to the eyes to watch.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Seikon no Qwaser is an enjoyable anime if you're the right person for it. If you get offended at sexual situations and nudity, avoid this at all costs. But if you want to watch something different with fun characters and a plot that doesn't need to be taken too seriously, give this a watch!\\n\\n\r\nContent Rating - 17+ Graphic Nudity, Sexual Situations/Content, Blood & Gore, Some Language\\n",

I hope you find it helpful.\r\nWant a unique and exciting plot that is completely ruined by excess ecchi? Well, you've come to the right place, my friend.\r\nStory - 6\r\nThe overall concept of this anime, Qwasers being able to control an element and a quest to find the Icon, I found very intriguing and unique. And then we come onto the aspect of the 'soma'. Now, I'm not a fan of ecchi, we don't mix. This meant that I was only watching the series for the plot. The reason I only gave it a 6is because it felt like the creators has seen an opportunity to add fan-service into the story and then taken that to a whole new level of ridiculousness, which I think ruined the series for me.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 7\\n\r\nAlexander 'Sasha' Nikolaevich Hell and Ekaterina 'Katja' Kurae are the most distinct and, in my opinion, the best characters in this series. The female lead, Mafuyu Oribe, is strong and admirable also. I did find, however, that many characters were only necessary for fan-service and distracted from the plot.  \\n\\n\r\nArt/Sound - 8\\n\r\nThe quality of this anime was, no doubt, good. Clear animation made the well-paced plot move forward smoothly as well as making for some excellent fight scenes.\\n\\n\r\nOverall Enjoyment - 5\\n\r\nI gave this series a 5 (Average) purely because of the ridiculous amount of necessary fan-service. I found myself having to get used to the ecchi because I was only watching it for Alexander and the plot. With the right amount of ecchi in the this series, it could have scored a lot higher in my books. For this reason, I didn't go on to watch series 2.\\n\\n\r\nAny requests for reviews on other anime will be taken into consideration. Thank you.\\n\r\n~ Katana-chan X",

We were laughing (and cringing) so hard at the \"fanservice\"; I didn't watch the entire thing (in fact I don't want to watch any more) but you might as well call it a hentai. Then again, I'm a girl, so seeing girls with their tits defying gravity is not exactly appealing. However, it also features a loli character who is some sort of dominatrix. SHE'S ELEVEN YEARS OLD. I know I'm probably not supposed to \"take this seriously\" but why would I bother wasting my time inthe first place?\\n\\n\r\nMain character is super edgy and doesn't know anything beyond edge (and maybe boobs). They try to make him smart but he just spouts common knowledge. The concept did have a potential; characters that are called Alchemists who can control a certain element on the periodic table.\\n\\n\r\nIt is very good for a silly time, but I would rather watch something else with said \"silly time\".",

Before fight girl get her boobs sucked after fight she gets her boobs sucked and every other time girl will get her boobs sucked.\r\nStory: Story was nothing special some heretics were trying to find some stuff didn't even pay attention to it cuz its pretty boring\r\nArt: not bad art i like that kind ofart.\\n\\n\r\nSound: Yeah not bad ofc it could be better.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: All of them were pathetic except the boy with white hair well he was pretty lame sometimes too. All girls were annoying that basically did nothing only got their fucking tits sucked.\\n\r\nBasically every time girls got attacked from nowhere they just stood there doing nothing and later on like always almost got raped no matter if its male or female.\\n\r\nThe guy with white hair was nothing special too he was supposed to be edgy but he was more of a wimp he did what girls told him. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Not good it wasnt boring but i couldn't say it was interesting. Something keep't me watching but im not sure what even tho i disliked most of the things in this anime\\n\\n\r\nOverall: Its not that horrible but i dont recommend to watch. If you think seeing boobs every sec is awesome....you're wrong! Its annoying i thought that too before watching but im sick of that i want to see action and not tits being sucked.",

There are also the funny parts along with the ecchi and i did watch the uncensored.  It's true i saw one episode uncensored and it was a little wierd i was confused as to what was going on.  This is almost like soft porn (thus rated R) so those of you who dont like it BEware.  This is a total guy anime i think with all of the fanservice.  Still one hting i didn't like was the resemblance of sasha to allen walker it tripped me out. althought the personalities were different coundn't thry just have changed the hair color maybe? oh well not my decsion but i give the anime a 7 its pretty good i like it enjoyed it.",

            "content": "Hey everyone! This is my first review; but don\u2019t let that discourage you, let me tell you a tale of an amazing anime!  ( ^ . ^ )/\r\nStory: 9\r\nThe story in this was amazing, to quickly sum up in a few lines; it\u2019s about a kid named Sasha Alexander who wields alchemical powers and hunts down other \u201cQwasers\u201d who also can use this power and choose to for evil purposes; everyone with these powers has a specific element that they can control, in literally every way possible. This isn\u2019t the kind of alchemy from Full Metal Alchemist; this is in so much detail thatI was fascinated by how much the writer actually researched, if you\u2019re fed up of boring Chemistry then watch this!\\n\r\nHowever I would like to note that this anime is in fact an ecchi however has next to no fan service which is a good thing, it contains some nudity but that\u2019s more for plot reasons than actual fan service. For a \u201cQwaser\u201d to gain energy that they lose from using their abilities, they have to drink the breast milk of a woman, for it contains a magical power referred to as \u201cSoma\u201d, this is for biblical purposes as it is said that breast milk is one form of sustenance that has unparalleled purity as it comes directly from the female body.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9\\n\r\nThe art in this anime is truly great and the characters are drawn very well, the epic feel of the characters wielding these powers does not decrease throughout. Special effects are very well done which goes perfectly with the detail put into the abilities.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10\\n\r\nThe openings for this anime were awesome, neither of the two did I dislike, I always looked forwards to them at the start of each episode, they both go in well with the theme of the anime. The ending songs were just as great, and to be honest I would easily say that the first ending song would be one of my top 10 endings I\u2019ve seen in an anime. The soundtracks were also very nice, especially so for scenes with action in.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9\\n\r\nThe main character in this is a complete badass, if you\u2019ve seen D Gray Man then you will know he looks exactly like Alan Walker. All of the characters in this are well made, especially so for the antagonists as they all have such diverse personalities and motives. It\u2019s great when you see an anime where the villains don\u2019t have clich\u00e9 ambitions and personalities.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10\\n\r\nI found this anime to be very amusing, what made it so enjoyable was that it was able to switch between making you laugh your ass off and blowing your mind with intricate chemistry and badassery. Despite some of the nudity in this being unnecessary, it did not interfere with the storyline, and in some cases only added to the comedy. One of my favourite things to find in a anime that contains a lot of fighting is where the main character unlocks a new power or uses some skill that make his previous fights look like he wasn\u2019t taking them seriously, this has that effect which made it even more fun to watch.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9\\n\r\nTo sum it up; if you\u2019re looking for an anime that has comedy, epic fights, awesome powers, and a unique storyline then this is one I would recommend, there\u2019s not a single anime I\u2019ve seen that I can compare this to, as it\u2019s completely different to ones that have similar powers and genres. If you dislike the idea of the anime having nudity then there is an alternate version that doesn\u2019t show any nudity, it being cut out has no effect on the story so you can get near enough the same enjoyment as everyone else.\\n\\n\r\nHope this was good enough ^ ^\\n\r\nIf not then any feedback would be greatly appreciated, cya next time!\\n",

When I watched it was was pleasantly surprised by the show. While there are the showing of bare breasts, which is like the worst thing you can put in an anime apparently, I thought it was a unique creative way of interjecting them into the plot point. \r\nIn the anime breast milk, called sama, is the power source of these alchemists that control a certain metal on the periodic table. I like how to kinda understand what the alchemists are talking aboutyou have to have taken chemistry in high school. Over all I find this anime enjoyable and a great view\\n\\n",

            "content": "So I found this anime a while back and thought it was kinda stupid. I eventually decided to watch it after wanting to watch some ecchi for some reason and it's a lot better than I expected. In this anime you'll be seeing boobs, boobs, a bit of chemistry (huh?) and boobs.\r\nStory: The story is about Alexander whathisname Hell or Sasha for short who comes to this school to look for a powerful artifact. He's a Qwaser that belongs to this secret organization. Qwasers are humans that can manipulate elements such as iron and copper who gains their power from Soma or to put itsimply magical breast milk. Sasha comes in contact with two girls Mafuyu and Tomo after they got tangled in Qwasers' business. Now the plot is pretty generic shounenish with Sasha battling different Qwasers while meeting new allies. Also from the look of the poster, you'd think that this is a typical harem but it's actually not so a plus for that. Now a lot of people will say that this whole show is nothing but pure fanservice but the story is actually pretty intricate with twists every now and then. There's also a lot of chemistry talk so you'll be glad you took those chemistry lesson. In short the story is not the best but certainly not as bad as some people make it out to be.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: The characters are somewhat cliche as is with most shounen anime. So we have the MC Sasha who is a badass tsundere shouta with a dark past. Next is Mafuyu who's a a generic tsundereish main girl. Then we have Tomo, a girl with Down Syndrome apparently cuz she acts like a 6 year old. Some people say she's useless throughout the whole thing but that's not true! Her boobs are the biggest so she serves as a the best piece of fanservice! oh and she has powerful soma or something like that. Next is Katja, a twofaced sadist loli who's probably the best character. Her S&M relationship with Hana is hilarious.\\n\r\nThere are a bunch of other characters as well, some good some bad but I can't be bothered to name them all. Anyway characters are solid and fit in the story very well.\\n\\n\r\nArt: The art is pretty good but most importantly the boobs are drawn beautifully that come in different shapes and sizes as expected. You know how everyone has the same looking tits in hentai? well in Seikon no Qwaser, everyone has unique boobs like Teresa's firm pink nipples or Tomo's huge inverted melons. The art achieved exactly what it set out to do, which is beautifully drawn boobies. \\n\\n\r\nSound: Again pretty good I guess. Both OP are good but both ED are bad. The voice acting is good especially the female characters' moan when they get their titties sucked, better than hentai......probably. The music didn't standout much but then again I was too focus on the 'plot' to notice it.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all Seikon no Qwaser is a must watch for fans of ecchi and even shounen if you don't freak out every time you see big round breasts.\\n\\n",

The actual premise of the anime involves various people who control different elements from the periodic table.  It's actually pretty cool how they portrayed that aspect.  The unfortunate part of the anime is the fact that the characters must drink breast-milk in order to use their powers.  If the writers of this anime picked ANY other power source, this anime would be an easy 8/10.  \r\nThe story and characters are pretty interesting.  \r\nTheart and sounds are solid.  Despite the fountain of breasts, the actual art style is really good.  The voice acting, sound effects, and music are nice.\\n\\n\r\nThe fan-service levels are kind of over the top.  \\n\\n\r\nThe ecchi is literally bordering on hentai, but there is no sex in this anime, so I guess that's what makes it not hentai.  \\n\\n\r\nI'm going to ignore the part about breast-feeding and isolate the awesome chemical warfare aspect of Seikon no Qwaser and I'm going to go ahead and give it an 8/10 (score ignoring breast-feeding).\\n",

            "content": "Seik\u014d no Qwaser contains\u2026 Oops, I misspelt the title. Wait, what did I just write? Seik\u014d? Talk about Freud now\u2026\r\nSo, first of all Seikon no Qwaser contains a ridiculous amount of fanservice. It has pantsu, breasts (every size you can imagine, from DFC to \u201cOh god, strong back she has!\u201d), zettai ry\u014diki, lolicon, BDSM, tentacles, yuri, cross-dressing\u2026 every god damn perverted thing I know about. And probably some I don\u2019t even aware of. I think that idea of Qwaser was born something like\u2026\r\nIt was a hot summer evening. Yoshino Hiroyuki-shi, manga author, and his acquaintance Kaneko Hiraku-shi, anime director, were sitting in some yomise andkilling their time with drinking sake.\\n\r\n\u201cI wonder, where does the border between seijin and normal anime lie?\u201d quietly said Yoshino-shi. \u201cI mean, how much fanservice one can put into the show which is not classified as hentai?\u201d\\n\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s easy one, Yoshino,\u201d boastfully answered Kaneko-shi. \u201cJust give rights to your latest manga and I definitely will find the answer!\u201d\\n\r\nAnd so the great Seikon no Qwaser research project started.\\n\\n\r\nWell, that\u2019s not a true story, of course, but a believable one to my point of view. If you\u2019re not into fanservice, afraid of boobies or something like that, then you\u2019ll find Qwaser disgusting, so I won\u2019t recommend it to you. Seriously, you better stop reading my review and go find something less perverted. Don\u2019t waste your precious time, guys. Otherwise\u2026 Let\u2019s take a closer look.\\n\\n\r\nIn the first place I\u2019d like to point out the fact that this show has an awesome cast of voice actors. To the pleasure of KyoAni fans there are seiy\u016b of Suzumiya, Nagato, Akiyama and Hirasawa Yui, plus seiy\u016b of Roy Mustang and Saber have secondary roles. That\u2019s quite a team, huh? No wonder, the creators were able to make good opening and ending themes thanks to them.\\n\\n\r\nOne more good aspect of Qwaser is fighting scenes. They are truly epic. Once main character went battle frenzy speaking lines on Russian (\u201cMo\u00e2 du\u0161a \u2014 \u00e8to stal\u02b9, mo\u00eb telo \u2014 \u010d\u00ebrnyj metal\u201d and so on), and that was just as cool and pathos-charged as Unlimited Blade Works from Fate/stay night, if you know what I\u2019m talking about.\\n\\n\r\nWhen it comes to animation, it\u2019s pretty fair. Of course, web-rips have awful quality and the version shown on TV is censored with the help of mad skills, so they are nearly watchable, but now the blu-rays are coming out and they have nice artwork, thus no major complains here.\\n\\n\r\nI suppose one can\u2019t be serious about a plot in this kind of anime, but that\u2019s a complicated case here. Sometimes plot\u2019s really good, no kidding, but sometimes it degrades into \u201cHuh, plot? Screw that, roll the breast-feeding scene!\u201d Sucking boobies in the middle of the battle to get power-up is a bit\u2026 disturbing concept, thus it\u2019s really easy to slide down to the abyss of story stupidity. It happened especially hard in the middle (episodes 13 & 14) and towards the end (roughly all episodes after 19th). Oh yeah, by the way, the creators changed stereotypical catholic holy warriors from Vatican into orthodox holy warriors from Russia. Not a big deal, actually, but that\u2019s somewhat refreshing, plus the Russians can find it hilarious. Or they\u2019ll just get angry and beat the crap out of Japan with their rockets and bear cavalry, I don\u2019t know much about politics.\\n\\n\r\nSumming this review up, I\u2019ll tell you what: if you want to watch some anime, which is not bending your mind, full of action and has fanservice, than you definitely should check this thing out. It\u2019ll be worth watching. (There is scene where one girl stops a blade between her breasts. Sigh. The most retardedly hilarious idea ever.) Otherwise, if you\u2019re a Puritan or just want to see something intellectual and developing, than you\u2019ll gonna hate Qwaser and wanna destroy it with fire, so it\u2019s a bad idea for you to pick this up. Don\u2019t even come close to this show.\\n\\n\r\nAs for me, this is just another run-of-the-mill anime to kill free time with if you\u2019re bored and have no better alternatives. Just nothing too bad, nothing too good, thus 7 out of 10.",

However,  things just go down hill from there.\r\n   The characters gain their source of power by consuming breast milk..... I really wanna slap the editor who let the creator go through with that idea. Ignoring that,  there's still this cool set up with the eastern orthodox church fighting against a group called the adepts. This show could of been good but it chose not to. Instead We Get Another Generic Ecchi Filled Tothe Brim With OVERSACTURATED  Fanservice.   I admit the art style and animation is pretty nice but the story barely even develops until the last few episodes. Another pet peeve is katja, a sexualized sadistic little girl who makes one of the other characters her sex slave. I know there are idiots who will say \" just ignore it\" or \" the anime industry b would be dead without ecchi\" but they're to blame for the decadent state of anime in the first place.  In other words, stay away from this show.",

And I just so happen to be on of those people. \r\nI found everything, from the story to art to sound to character, average. All are rather generic and wasn't exactly new. However, I will say, the manipulation of elements (on the periodic table mind you) on an atomic level was an awesome concept. The fact that you could take advantage of your elements properties and reactions with other elements was really cool and as a science nerd, it made my day. Ionly wished that they could use that concept and develop the anime a bit more and not just focus on the breast milk. \\n\\n\r\nAgain, I found the element manipulation awesome and would recommend you watch it for the fights. However... the rest is better left unsaid",

            "content": "Let's start;\r\n- I found the second intro of the series (Baptize) to be excellent. Aside from that, most of the sound seemed acceptable/unexceptional. Props to the main character's Seiyuu, it is a woman that voices Chimeisha Sasha but she pulls it off quite well.\r\n- The art and animation are sometimes very good but the show is chock full of animation shortcuts which is very disappointing. So I cannot recommend it on raw action.\r\n- The premise is amazing. Using literal elemental powers (Iron, Sodium, Chloro, Bronze, etc.) in magical duels? yes please. The chemistry in the show was one of the best aspects simply becauseit is surprisingly accurate, of course it has much exaggeration but the base chemistry that they're using to explain a lot of their arguments for why something would work actually is substantiated. So if you are a chemistry nerd, this is a good reason to check it out.\\n\\n\r\n- The gratuitous Russian culture/language was cute. Engrish + Japanese + (Attempts at) Russian = $$$\\n\\n\r\n- And we get to the fanservice;\\n\r\nIf you have a low tolerance for fanservice, do NOT watch this show. If you like fanservice or are indifferent like me, then know that it has enormous levels of fanservice. It is an ecchi show from beginning to end.\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe general plot is obscured by the effing around the main characters do, but it has to do with an artifact being sought by an organization's members called The Adept. This is opposed by the main character's side which is Athos. So basically, two organizations fight for a McGuffin, fights and fanservice ensue.... it is a garbage plot, but the characterization is very good (Chimeisha Sasha is a great character) and the interpersonal relationships are also very strong.\\n\\n\r\nI have not read the manga but I have heard that it has much less fanservice and much greater focus on story/characterization. I wish that they had stuck to that formula rather than what they did in the anime.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, recommend to chemistry nerds that like/are indifferent to mass fanservice.\\n\r\nNOT recommend to people that do not care about chemistry or dislike fanservice.",

            "content": "This one... it's weird. Even for ecchi lover like myself this anime is just odd. I mean sucking boobs for power? Let's move on\r\nStory 6/10: The story is somewhat interesting, especially for an ecchi. It revolves around this icon, Theoktos or Tsaritsyn, a group known as the Adepts are looking for it. The 'good guy' group is Athos (a real orthodox hermitage). Now I'm a history nerd and one of my huge interests is Russian history. Tsaritsyn is now Volgagrad, which was Stalingrad. Also many people in this series are Qwasars, who can control an element on the periodic table. You'll certainly get a bitof a chemistry lesson. Anyways the story is okay, it's hard to keep track though, especially through all the boobs!\\n\\n\r\nArt 8/10: I very much like the art, it's very clean, well animated, and it's beautiful. The scenes look great as do the backgrounds. It's a very good looking anime though not the best.\\n\\n\r\nSound 4/10: It's petty 'meh'. Didn't care for any of the opening themes, the sexual sounds (like the boob sucking) are, okay I guess, but it's just odd. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter 8/10: I really had high hopes for some of these characters at the beginning but they kept dropping as it went on. Our main man Aleksander/Sasha, is kind of douche, but it's funny sometimes, and his battle scenes are pretty good. His backstory is fairly tragic but that's nothing new. Our main lady Mafuyu is a tough and brave female lead, not afraid to defend her friends. She's a decent character and attractive. However the problem I had was basically she and Sasha start to like each other, for basically no reason other then that cliche I really hate where the leads have to hook up. The other characters include Tomo, a frail girl with huge boobs. She's very derpy, but is also extremely cute and sweet. It looked like she and Mafuyu (who are best friends and Mafuyu is her protector) would hook up which I was very much hoping for. The yuri however is saved but a brutal loli by the name of Ekaterina, who basically enslaves this girl Hana, who was perving on her. Hana is a masochist, she loves to be humiliated by her loli mistress. These two and there relationship as fucked up as it could be, was always interesting. Anyways almost all the females are very attractive so ecchi fanservice can be had. I was just disappointed that the yuri was bountiful in the beginning but was being to be lost to more typical hetero as always.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 6/10: It's a pretty entertaining show for a while, but it's just so odd and so border line hentai, that it's almost to much. If you like gratuitous amounts of boobs you'll like if for a while but I feel you will get bored quickly. \\n\\n\r\nOverall 5/10: A series I came to because of supposed Yuri. I got it for a little while and then lost it.  It's fanservice galore, so if you like that you might like this one. Just don't expect much else unfortunately.\\n",

At first it will make you feel like watching hentai or some other vulgar show but as you will proceed you will start to feel the necessity of showing such \"vulgar\" acts . There could been other methods of passing the stigmata but to be honest a bond between mother and child is better than any other thing one can imagine. Sometime it becomes necessary to show intimacy because it eases the job of passing the feelings towards the viewers. But in the end you will have a show which is far more interesting and better than most other similarly plotted(breast showing etc) shows. This series has a plot and i dont think it could been told any better way than its now. \\n\r\nover all i do recommend watching the anime if u can feel intimacy love and necessity of human bond (or else you will end up being frustrated due to some scenes beyond normal ecchi)",

            "content": "NOTE: My review is based on the director's cut/uncensored version.\r\nFor those who are lazy to read the entire thing, just read the Overall at the bottom of the page, for those who are not, please read on.\r\nStory - The flow of the story is controlled fairly well. It is slow-paced at the start to allow viewers to get a feel of each character's personality and character, to allow viewers to grow on them. The story then slowly becomes intresting and then gets exciting towards the end. However, like most animes of similar genre, this is where the storyline falls. The \"last boss\" fight is executedvery poorly, killing off any excitement and causing huge disappointment. However, the story does end off nicely which is rather rare considering how the \"last boss\" fight was botched. Some other flaws are that at the beginning, it will be confusing to grasp some of the concepts in the anime and that the whereabouts of some characters are unexplained, the story does close off nicely, however, the loopholes in the ending gives it at 7/10.\\n\\n\r\nArt - One word, Fantastic. Details and design of characters, buildings, weapons and even side characters were great, defintely one of the good ones I've seen so far, but that's partly due to the advancement of  real world technology, props to the author for great designs. 9/10\\n\\n\r\nSound - Audio was good, great OSTs for daily life, battle and scenarios where things get serious. Seiyus/Voice actors did a good job as well, the voices fit the character's personality and brought out their flavour to the fullest. It lost points for constantly using the same track over and over again. If they had the budget for a 24 episode anime, I don't see why they couldn't have paid some more cash for certain character specific themes. 8/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - Great character development. It did not only focus on the main character but also worked on some of the side characters as well. Some of the characters had their backgrounds shown while others had scenes viewed from their persepectives. Overall, characters weren't over developed but also not under developed. It wasn't a perfect 10 due to some of the characters just appearing from nowhere, without us knowing when or where did they appear. 9/10\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment & Personal Views - I enjoyed the series as a whole. I only wished I had watched this when it aired and not after my exams because it made chemistry so much more fun and intresting to me. The series has potential for a second season due to loose ends with certain characters. The anime has dropped some minor hints for season 2 as well. Part of the reason I did not enjoy watching this anime is due to certain sounds that will give off the wrong impression to others who hear it. 7/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall - The series itself is alright. Those who are intrested in a school life/fantasy/ecchi series should give this anime a go. Though you might want to be discreet when watching it if you're watching the uncensored version. For those who want the school life and fantasy part, I suggest watching the censored version though I don't know how different it is from the uncensored one.",

            "content": "Seikon no Qwaser is an enigma: Balancing action with extreme ecchi; BDSM elements; in-your-face fan service including faux lesbian (and real lesbian) action, panty shots, and bathing scenes; a developing harem for the main male lead; slightly tired character tropes; and an overarching religious theme a la the Eastern Orthodox Christian church, it would seem like this anime would be destined to fail.\r\nThe fact that I enjoyed it for the most part and found that the story and characters were much more layered than they first appear makes this much more highly rated than other series that attempt to do something similar (exceptions being, arguably,Rin: Daughters of Mnemosyne).\\n\\n\r\nSTORY:\\n\\n\r\nIf you stripped the extreme ecchi out of this series, it would seem like typical shonen fare: Special people named \"Qwasers\" can control elements from the periodic table and two different groups of them, one aligned with the Church and another deemed \"heretics\",  are trying to find sacred icons that are believed to grant Qwasers enormous power. \\n\\n\r\nOne of these Qwasers, Alexendr \"Sasha\" Hell, transfers to St. Milahov Academy where Mafuyu and Tomo (two childhood friends with the former being the latter's sister via adoption by the former, now-missing Dean) attend school after he defeats a Qwaser that had been murdering women nearby.  What quickly unfolds is some conspiracy of \"heretical\" Qwasers known as the Adepts whose motives and actions are shrouded in mystery and blood. \\n\\n\r\nEnter the reason this series is rated as mature: The source of power for Qwasers is called soma, a magical substance that is most commonly found in the breast milk of women. Naturally, breasts and breast feeding are prominently featured in every episode. The amusing thing is that the women are teenagers or young adults that have not even had children yet somehow can excrete this substance regardless. Whatever, anime/manga logic.\\n\\n\r\nNow this is blatant fetish fuel and the anime takes care to focus in on these scenes with attention and detail that outshines most hentai. The thing of it is though..I dig it. I honestly dig it.\\n\\n\r\nCan I take a moment to explain why I like this anime? Could you bear with me for a moment?\\n\\n\r\nI feel like this anime, while obviously fetishizing the breasts, also at the same time honors it. In multiple instances the act of a Qwaser taking soma from his \"Maria\" is likened to that of the icon of the Virgin Mary suckling the baby Jesus. Now whether you take this as sacrilege is up to you...\\n\\n\r\nTime and again the Qwasers Ekaterina and Alexandr find themselves in need of a woman's soma to help them defeat their enemies, and each time they take it they show their gratitude. In contrast, the enemies they fight--the \"heretic\" Adepts--treat women as if they are cattle, simple living sources of soma that are to be milked dry (if you'll pardon the pun) and discarded. \\n\\n\r\nThe quiet reverence that the heroes display for the power that is to be had from the soma they consume is level with that of body worship in a fetish porno. While drawn erotically with blushing ladies that are taken to the heights of ecstasy after offering their breast to a Qwaser, these scenes also contain the creator's obvious homage to the intimacy and closeness that could be found between mother and child. This is a ball of Freudian complexes\\n\\n\r\nAnother thing that branches off from this idea and also seems to work with me is how surprisingly genuine the relationships between the girls in this anime are. There are times when LesYay occurs for the sake of enthralling the audience, but the relationship between Tomo and Mafuyu is perhaps the definition of love with a capital L. It is not erotic love per se, but one built upon a kind of understanding and enduring sisterhood and unquestionable friendship that would make a feminist proud. In fact, if you take Mafuyu is Tomo's self-proclaimed \"knight\" that protects her from harm, as Tomo is just as ditsy and prone to illness and harm as she is sweet and kind. They grew up as sisters after Mafuyu was adopted by Tomo's missing father  \\n\\n\r\nIn fact, this anime feels like it's a shade away from being feminist, in a weird way. To me, anything can be empowering to someone if you perceive it to be, so since I think it is empowering, it is empowering.\\n\\n\r\nThe most obvious reason for me is the way breasts themselves are treated in this anime. The mammaries that are featured range from nearly flat-chested to Hitomi J-Cup sized. All are treated as worthy of respect and a source of power by Qwasers. It is not necessarily the size of the breasts that determine the quality of the soma, but the woman's emotions and personality. \\n\\n\r\nAnother thing surprisingly and refreshingly absent from this anime are the men drooling over said breasts. There is probably one episode were this was a problem, otherwise it is never shown. While the breasts featured in this anime and the breast feeding is depicted as erotic fetish fuel, to me it is framed in such a way as if a woman wrote it instead of a man. There is little to no focus on how the few men who are featured feel about breasts; instead it is the women and how good it feels or how embarrassed they are. Now embarrassment is a main theme and kink in hentai and BDSM, but for those Marias and Qwasers like Teresa and Alexandr who have been partners for some time, the relationship dynamic between them is like warrior and faithful servant. While the act itself is arousing for Teresa, there is no romance between the two. \\n\\n\r\nIn other cases between other Qwasers and sources of soma, there is a layer of respect and gratitude for the act of taking it.\\n\\n\r\nThere are several women in this series who prove themselves to be fully capable and versatile: Ekaterina is a lesbian gothic lolita who manages to reel in punk bully Hana to be her \"pet\" and \"Maria\". The relationship between Ekaterina and Hana is that of master/slave with heavy BDSM and pet play, and while it is fan-service-y, there is a real relationship that develops as Ekaterina becomes attached to Hana and Hana herself grows to revel in her \"Queen's\" brand of sadism. It quickly becomes clear that Hana is a willing participant in this relationship and Ekaterina simply had to bring her to terms with her inner masochist, as Hana saves Ekaterina from danger multiple times.\\n\\n\r\nAs Tomo's \"knight\", Mafuyu is the first one to shield an innocent or defenseless person from abuse. Despite the \"bullies\" evolving into element-wielding psychopaths, she never hesitates to unsheathe her *shinai* and square off against them and do her very best to at least \\n\\n\r\nTeresa serves as Alexandr's source of soma and despite being a very quiet and serious Sister of the Church, she is competent with a bow and can land some sick kicks when required.\\n\\n\r\nLizzie is a tomboy and her skill with her sword is matched only by her enthusiasm and eagerness to fight and train. \\n\\n\r\nMiyuri, the daughter of the current dean and resident Ojo-sama bitch Queen Bee, reveals a much less narcissistic and self-centered personality where Ekaterina is concerned. While being ignorant of Ekaterina's secretly devilish and manipulative side, she sees the little Loli Doll as a little sister in need of protection, and in some instances her grudging respect for Mafuyu and ability to wise up during serious situations leads Miyuri to extend the same courtesy to her, as well.\\n\\n\r\nEven Futaba, the shy wallflower class president, manages to gain enough confidence to stand up against a particularly dangerous Qwaser.\\n\\n\r\nAs I've said before, the relationships among these young ladies, past, present, and future, are actually a bit fantastic to behold as companionship becomes love or at least some level of understanding.\\n\\n\r\nAs for Alexandr himself he's a tsundere in every sense of the word. It's in his DNA, and whether it's a result of his past or the fact he's Russian (often referred to as a \"tundra brat\" by Miyuri a lot)--or perhaps both!--while simultaneously balancing a straightforwardness with rare compliments gives him hints at depth that promote him from being one-dimensional into 2.5-dimensional.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the villains, their motivations are as single-minded as their bloodlust is blatantly apparent.  \\n\\n\r\nPersonally, personally, personally, I love it. I love this kind of eroticism mixed with what I consider decent character development and neat action scenes. This is an anime that is unwatchable if ecchi is not at all your thing or if you're someone who doesn't consider girl-on-girl action at all stimulating OR you hate boobs. It's impossible to get past the first 10 minutes if none of these concepts thrill you even a tiny bit. Being bisexual and a \"breast woman\", this was right up my alley.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND:\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack was surprisingly good. While the first opening theme sounds generic at first, after a few episodes it grows on you. The second opening theme is much more heart-racing and has that sweet, sweet church choir backing up the main vocals, an element I am an absolute sucker for. The ending theme \"Passionate Squall\" remains to be one of my favorite anime tracks of all time, and its music video features a mixture of erotic bathtub still shots with dream-like scenes of an underwater bedroom and other odd uses of said tub (a boat, for instance), making it much more creative than I would have expected the series to spawn. While the soundtrack otherwise doesn't stick out very much otherwise, it isn't bad or lacking, necessarily, and I'm honestly willing to give Sound a 10 simply for \"Passionate Squall\", for serious. \\n\\n\r\nANIMATION: \\n\\n\r\nAs for the animation, there are some shortcuts that I see but overall the colors are slick and vivid, especially whenever Alexandr is onscreen. As I've mentioned before, since this is an anime revolving around breasts, the nipples are drawn with care that you don't find in most hentai, or even ecchi for that matter. \\n\\n\r\nOVERALL:\\n\\n\r\nThis is my guilty pleasure that at the same time I don't feel that ashamed in enjoying. A girl's got needs (not to mention body hang ups), and this fulfills those needs.  Bless you, Hoods Entertainment, you're doing a perverted god's work.\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "The concept of sucking boobs for power ups sounded like it would be a good ecchi anime. The characters are bland, or annoying, or dis-likeable. The art is standard just nothing special, and the sound is serviceable it doesn't stick to you though as being remember-able. It's a shame such a concept couldn't have behind it a good story, and good characters. The atmosphere is very jaded too, and the story does not make you care at all. Don't listen to the positive reviews unless you want to be disappointed. I urge you to watch Highschool DxD since it is a good ecchi animewith decent plot, and characters. Seikon No Qwaser does have BDSM in certain scenes it could be uncomfortable to some.",

            "content": "TIP: When I talk about or mention PLOT, I'm referring to ASS & BREAST.\r\n  Seikon No Qwaser, A very PLOT driven show that revolves around a boy name Sasha & his class mates. Sasha is known as Qwaser, a being who is able to control a specific type of element. I found that its easier if you just think about the periodic table. Now associate those elements to the Qwarsers in the show. Anyway- Sasha happens to have the ability element 'Iron' & the only was he can confront any enemy is to have SOMA coursing through his body. Because without it & likemany Qwasers he's powerless. So how is he supposed to attain to the power of SOMA? By sucking on his classmates breast he will. Yes, SOMA is breastmilk. Strange rght? At any rate this anime really does a good job of making a story around breastmilk & how it gives the Qwasers more power to fight. Like many ecchies Sasha finds himself around many attractive girls. But as you continue to watch he only tends to be around 3 girls inperticular. Tomo, Mafuyu, & Kurai. I'll be sure to get into those 3 main characters in my break down review later on. So like any ecchie the PLOT in this show does not over take the main premise of the show. If you plan to watch this show expect a lot of PLOT to be shoved in your face. I highly recommend this show to fans of the ecchie series. I also felt this was also a harem but it is not tagged as such. If you're not a fan of the show I strongly urge you to give it a shot by watching 2-4 episodes, if you're not hooked by then by all means drop it. But I'm pretty sure you'll be hooked by the 2nd to 3rd episode.  Ok, time for the break down.\\n\\n\\n\r\nBREAK DOWN REVIEW; Scoring ranging from 1-10, 1 being dredful\\n\\n\\n\r\n[8] STORY: The story hits an 8 in my book, simply because they could of done so much more with the actual story & PLOT. But with animes only having so many episodes it was cut short in its potential. Nonetheless it deals exactly what you want & how you want it. & I know you what you want or else you wouldn't even have clicked on this show & its reviews.\\n\\n\\n\r\n[8] ART: The art in this show was very detailed when it came to the PLOT which is expected. But some reason this anime did a hell of a lot better when it came to showing you every little detail.\\n\\n\\n\r\n[8] SOUND: The sound like any anime is good, especially if you're watching at 1080. If you're watching at a lower resolution, you shouldn't see much of a difference in the sound the sound as much. \\n\\n\\n\r\n[8] CHARACTER:\\n\\n\r\n-Hell, Alexander Nikolaevich- Also known as \"Sasha\" our main male lead. Sasha is a 13 year old Russian boy who takes on the role of a foreign extrange student. When in reality he is a Qwaser on a mission to to find a very important artifact. Overtime he runs into 2 girls & reluctantly befriends them over time. Sasha is a very apathedic boy who shows hardly any emotions at all. But you learn that is due to his past.\\n\\n\r\n-Oribe, Mafuyu- A girl who recluctantly a very important character nearing the end of the show. Mafuyu underwent a sad experience where she lost her parents & she taken into the household of her relative, her uncle to be exact. She ends up becoming very close to cousin Tomo & vows to protect her even if it costs her very own life.\\n\\n\r\n-Yamanobe, Tomo- A huge breasted clumsy girl who happens to be Mafuyu's cousin. Due to her cluminess she is very easily taken advantage of. But when Mafuyu is around it almost never happens. Due to her big breast she is known as \"Maria\" a high class one at that. \\n\\n\\n\r\n[9] ENJOYMENT: My enjoyment overall was good. & I have no regrets putting time into this show. It was worth the watch.\\n\\n\\n\r\n[8] OVERALL: Like I mention before if you're into Ecchie this is the show for you but if not then I still strongly urge you to watch it, because I can almost say for sure you'll find it be an overall enjoyable watch. If you decide to undertake this 24 episode journey know that you won't be disappointed when you hit the finishline.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoy =)",

            "content": "Warning! This is not for someone with a faint heart because you might have a \u201cNOSE BLEED\u201d.\r\nWow! Just wow. I don\u2019t know if this is genius or unique plot but one thing for sure, I\u2019ve never encountered an anime that has this kind of plot. I mean, they have to literally refuel their powers with some kind of milk or something off from boobies. To be honest, in my 10 years of watching animes, I\u2019ve never seen so much BOOBS in my life with just one series.  If you\u2019re a conservative type then you wouldn\u2019t appreciate this one because there is so much ECCHI-nessin it. Even I myself as liberated and open-minded as I am, is very shocked. I thought I was already use to this kind of things. However, there is actually a concrete plot within it. Let me just say that this is not just about the ecchi part but there is a nice story as well. And it is interesting enough. Oddly enough, you could say that it becomes a lot more interesting because of all the boobs going around every now and then. I say that because there are moments that it is becoming hilarious. Sometimes it just becomes ridiculous that they need boobs by their side in order to power-up. Surprisingly, I am amaze how the too much ecchi-ness part is balance with the weight of the story.\\n\\n\r\nAlmost all the characters are involved with sucking or being sucked. They are even lesbians, hardcore sadist and masochist, and lolicon. But for some reasons the characters actually have personalities and roles within the story. They are not just people who suck around but they are pretty much likeable characters. Sometimes they can be so hilarious with all of their ecchi-ness. The character that I love the most is Tomo. She\u2019s just so cute with her so hot body yet have a very childish and na\u00efve personality. \\n\\n\r\nThe animation is indeed one of the best considering it is latest. The characters are beautifully done and the artworks are great. Almost all of the most famous seiyus of today gathers in this series. It just feels so surreal to hear their voices or moans in a very lewd way because some of them are known for their works in wholesome series about teenagers. \\n\\n\r\nIt might not be one of the most wholesome series but you can definitely still appreciate this. If you just don\u2019t judge it by the ecchi part but rather how the ecchi part is use for the main plot. This is not a smut series because there is actually a story. I am definitely still going to watch the sequel.\\n",
