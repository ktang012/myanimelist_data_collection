            "content": "Hers was a white lie built on a grain of truth that snowballed as one lie after the other piled up. At first it was only hers, but then it became something that the two of them shared together \u2013 like a secret, a world upon which no other could encroach. He may have been \u201cFriend A,\u201d and she \u201cthe girl that loves my best friend,\u201d but they were masquerading around a truth that neither one could openly admit because ultimately, the truth was much more painful.\r\nYour Lie in April is a deceitfully masterful series that initially appears light-hearted and colorful, its palette boasting pastelsthat lend to the idea of it being another romantic comedy. Yet the moment we step past the disillusionment that it casts upon us by its false prefaces, we quickly realize that what we have immersed ourselves in is actually a tragedy in the making.\\n\\n\r\nTragic not because of a single element but because of all of its parts, and yet at the end of everything, this isn\u2019t a series about tragedy. It is a series about learning to heal, learning to move on, and learning to accept the parts of ourselves that we\u2019d rather pretend aren\u2019t there. Part of that is accepting that sometimes we need a helping hand to take that first step. Part of it is learning to say goodbye when the time comes.\\n\\n\r\nWhat is so compelling about the storyline is that it\u2019s not merely an adventure into first love, it delves into the reality of post-traumatic stress disorder, childhood abuse, and chronic illness. It doesn\u2019t paint any of these as artistic or tragically beautiful\u2014they are horrible, they twist people, they ruin the best moments, and they have a long-lasting impact.\\n\\n\r\nNo one is completely black-and-white; everyone has their short-comings, fleshed out in full before our eyes. They have their hang-ups, their strengths, their struggles\u2014and it\u2019s in these characters that this series really takes off in full stride. It would be enough for them to be multifaceted with equal amounts of depth, but they take it a step further in painting the reality of youth.\\n\\n\r\nOlder anime fans may critically analyze the series as an unrealistic approach to young teenagers, but that pessimism overlooks the reality of what it was like for us to be that age. We were all that point when we found our first love, when we thought it was forever, when we poured our passion into something that ultimately would not come to fruition or last. That\u2019s what being young is about\u2014and that\u2019s what Your Lie in April gives us. \\n\\n\r\nGranted that it may veer a bit over-dramatic at times in its representation of youth; there are moments of symbolism or hyperbole so overt that the cheesiness makes you shift a little uncomfortably in your seat (but I promise it\u2019s not enough to gag you). Given that this is, however, a rather common trope that runs in series with heavier themes, it\u2019s not necessarily a huge setback for an otherwise solid series. In the end, it is intended to be a fictional representation that conveys more than just what can be summarized in a few sentences or less.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound is completely on point, and the soundtrack artfully matches the emotions intended to be represented in each scene. From the actual classical music to the opening and ending, everything fits in like a jigsaw puzzle to give a full, satisfying final piece. When the characters analyze someone\u2019s playing as harsh, rigid, and stilted, we can hear this\u2014whether we are knowledgeable about music or not. Your Lie in April conveys emotion to us not just visually but aurally as well.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is wonderful with bright, vibrant colors that bring the characters fully to life. There is an amazing, visually perceivable transition for the characters as time passes, particularly in regards to Kaori as the series moves on. It occasionally has some stilted moments but nothing outrageously noticeable to detract from the overall quality.\\n\\n\r\nUltimately, Your Lie in April is a story that starts out of the gates moving a bit slowly, but the pace matches the tone of the series. Structurally, it is a solid story of youth that dramatizes some aspects but never distracts from the intended message. On top of its other strong points, it\u2019s aurally and visually a joy to the senses \u2013 and to anyone appreciative of a series willing to realistically approach the conflict of childhood abuse and the resulting trauma in a positive way. It\u2019s not without a few setbacks, but in the end, Your Lie in April fashions itself to be a stand-out romance series that reminds us that while some relationships may be transient and brief, some people will come into our lives at just the right time for just long enough to touch us in a way we never thought possible.\\n",

            "content": "From a quick glance at all the other top reviews, this series seems to be one that many people rave about. While there's certainly qualities in this show that are really good, I found myself rather unimpressed to be brutally honest.\r\nStory - 3/10\r\nKousei Arima was a prodigy at playing the piano. He dominated every competition on a regular basis by playing the music perfectly as it was intended by the composer. He was so dominant to the point where he became famous among child and adult musicians alike. However, after the death of his mother (who was also his instructor), he was unable to copewith it and eventually lost the ability to hear the piano. He then quit shortly after. For the next couple of years, the world around him became dull and lifeless aside from a couple of his friends, until he met this extremely cheerful violinist, Kaori Miyazono. She revealed to him a side and style of music he never knew existed, and eventually convinced him to give the piano another shot.\\n\\n\r\nThe premise doesn't sound too bad. In fact, the way it handles the romance plot is pretty unique. It isn't just simply your typical boy meets girl and then they eventually confess, blah blah; there's a lot more to it than that. It focuses more on Kousei's development as a result of Kaori's carefree happy-go-lucky personality. The story is told primarily in Kousei's point of view, and likewise the plot revolves somewhat around him. Other characters do get screen time as well, though, and occasionally we do hear their take on things too. \\n\\n\r\nA big thing that really makes the story stand out (in the first half, particularly) is how it portrays the music. Why do we play music? Who are you playing for? What message are you trying to convey? Music isn't just there to pleasure your ears, it's used as a tool to speak from the heart. Who you are as a person, what you've gone through, and what you strive for are all expressed in how you play music. The notes may be the same, but the feel of the song can vastly vary with the way people play it. In other words, you take the music and make it your own. The way this narrative and message are pushed is rather distinct and effective in my eyes, and it was one of the few things that kept me captivated throughout the series.\\n\\n\r\nDespite how well this all is presented, there were still quite a lot of flaws, particularly in its execution of several storyline elements.\\n\\n\r\nMelodrama. It's alright to have it in moderation (it\u2019s a show about teenagers after all- there\u2019s bound to be at least some), but it was taken to a whole other level in this show. Almost every episode contains at least one overreaction to an event, almost to the point where it became hard to really feel the proper emotion you were supposed to in the particular scene. There were some instances where this was properly used and was actually beneficial to what was going on, but more often than not, I found myself cringing and unable to relate to the character(s) at all.\\n\\n\r\nPacing. The pacing of this show was all over the place, but generally speaking, it was so slow to the point where it felt like it was beating a dead horse. Literally, I could look up the word \"monologuing\" in the dictionary and find the cover art of YLIA. Episode after episode, there was an absurd amount of redundant soliloquy to the point where it became hard to watch. Again, as the saying goes: \"everything in moderation\". Internal monologue isn't inherently a bad thing, but it starts to parody itself when it gets overused. Thanks to stuff like this, it takes longer than it needs to for things to get going and actually progress.\\n\\n\r\nLastly, there's the comedy. Quality of comedy in general is unquestionably subjective (personally I didn't find a whole lot of it funny, but that's just me), but that's not where the issue lies. My gripe with it is that it was terribly misplaced. You're in the middle of this deep, sad scene, and then all of a sudden you're slapped in the face with comedic relief that doesn't fit the scene at all. To put it bluntly, it kills the mood. \\n\\n\r\nThe story had a LOT of potential. I, like many others, was hooked at the beginning, but found it harder to watch as the show goes on. It really makes me wish that this was a 12 episode anime instead so that things didn't overstay their welcome.\\n\\n\r\nArt/Animation - 7/10\\n\\n\r\nThe art in this show fits the feel of it really well. The characters designs are rather unique; they each all have full lips rather than a simple line like you see in almost every anime nowadays, and it's little subtleties like this that adds a sense of realism to the show. The brightness of the setting also appropriately fits each situation. The color palette often fits the mood of the scene very well; it's colorful and bright when things are more lively, dark and dull when things are more depressing, so on and so forth. The actual art itself isn't bad either. Animation was pretty solid and up to par with today's standards, but occasionally it was less than stellar.\\n\\n\r\nSound - 8/10\\n\\n\r\nNow, I'm not a fan of classical music at all. I don't necessarily hate it, it's just not my bread and butter, but I've started to open up to it a lot more than I originally was. The OST is nice and really adds to the emotions that the specific scene is trying to convey. The solo performances are especially good for reasons I've already touched upon. I'm also a personal fan of the OPs and EDs, both of which suit the show well. Not much else to say here, really. It's just solid all around, which is important for a show like this.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 4/10\\n\\n\r\nAs a romance and drama, the characters really are the backbone of the entire show. With the slower pacing, the characters get added depth, which is critical for a show like this to do. I must say, it did a fine job in that aspect. Many characters had their own backstory (although there are a few issues with this that I\u2019ll get to), and there aren't many one-dimensional characters that get major screen time. Most importantly, they all have likable qualities about them that make them endearing to the audience, creating an emotional bond between us and them.\\n\\n\r\nSomething that I felt was handled rather well was the development of Kousei. Being the main character, it's pretty important for him to be fully fleshed out, and thankfully he is. He starts out as a mopey, depressing, and generally dull kid, but gradually develops into something much more. After losing his mother, he really had no reason to play music. All he ever knew was to play it perfectly as the composer intended, and for the purpose of pleasing his mom. Enter Kaori. Her unique style of playing opened up Kousei's eyes in a big way, and inspired him to take up music again. His journey together with Kaori and friends has been helping him break out of his shell, and his progression bit by bit was superb.\\n\\n\r\nWhile I'm singing a lot of praise here, you'll notice the score I gave is again rather mediocre. Hear me out.\\n\\n\r\nMany of the side characters were pointless; their development overall pretty much either served no purpose and/or wasn't done well. Often times, instead of adding to the story, their screen time swayed away from the main plotline which is not how it's supposed to work. Yes, I understand that people might think it's nice and cute to see someone else's story every now and then, but again, the issues I have are 1) it sways the show away from the main narrative without connecting to it at all, and 2) the way these characters are handled just feels half-assed when compared to how well Kousei is developed. If this were a longer show where separate characters could have their own little mini-arcs, I feel like this would have been handled much better, but obviously that wouldn't be possible for a shorter seasonal anime.\\n\\n\r\nAnother thing -- Kaori. This is kind of tied into the pacing, which I also touched upon earlier. She never really received significant development until the very end of the show. Up until that point, she's nothing but a mere plot device used to stir up drama. For the duration of 21 episodes, she was just a cute girl that's meant to be likable and appeal to the audience, but with no depth whatsoever. It would have helped substantially to show her insight on the status quo as the show went on.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 4/10\\n\\n\r\nNeedless to say, I didn't enjoy this anime a whole lot. There are redeeming qualities that I'm not going to overlook out of blind hate, but overall, this just wasn't for me.\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 4/10\\n\\n\r\nIn my opinion, this anime doesn't deserve to be rated as high as it is. Again, it's not the worst thing I've ever seen; there's several redeeming qualities, and I can completely understand why someone else would enjoy it. However, to be honest, it seems pretty undeserving to be holding the #13 spot overall at the time this review was written.\\n\\n\r\nI'll try to sum it up as simply as I can: for more \"intellectual\" (for lack of a better word) viewers who care more about logic and technicalities, stay clear. As a show catered for a younger audience, it\u2019s very clear more effort was put on style rather than substance, and that can make it frustrating to watch. For more casual viewers just looking to bathe in their feels, this is definitely worth a look. There are some quirky characters here that you might enjoy, and the relationship between Kousei and Kaori is definitely one that might leave a lasting impact on you.",

            "content": "\"Did I reach you? I hope I did.\" \r\nI nearly skipped this gem just because of the music tag. Not really big into music anime but somehow the art dragged me into watching the first few episodes. First episode was an average episode with few interesting plot lines. But the second episode was the hook. Irony. The tag that made me nearly skip this anime was the one that kept me in it. The music, the music... THE MUSIC.. what can I say? It was just right down my taste. Never in my life did I thought of \"oh hey let's listen to some classicalmusic\" but this anime opened a new taste in music in me. And I'm grateful for that. \\n\\n\r\nThe first half and second half have clear differences with a very smooth pacing and objectives in mind. Some may say the pacing was slow and sometimes it felt that a point is being dragged out for long. As much as I understand where they are coming from, I feel that this series took the right amount of time to build up for the many impact full moments that is present. The inner monologues that the series loves to do felt right to display the conflicts that our characters are fighting with. Also, the conflicts dealt with are very realistic and people can very much relate to them. I happen to be one of them being able to relate to our main male protagonist. \\n\\n\r\nThe cast of characters in this show is pretty high. As a 22 episode anime, I think it did an excellent job portraying those characters. As most animes, not all the characters were fully fleshed out, and I didn't expect it to do so. The ones that mattered most were developed beautifully. Besides, nearly everyone's thought process were clear, motivations/purpose in tact and passion which shone through. \\n\\n\r\nSound is something that I will not even talk about since it is subjective. The main reason, however, that I will not dive deeper is because for me, it was perfect. I couldn't have asked for anything more. \\n\\n\r\nAnimation wise. Throughout the whole series, it was standard stuff from A-1 Pictures. It did have some drop from time to time, especially during the comedy segments, which I didn't find distracting but it wasn't great to say the least. Animation stood out where it counts. Those performances. I would have been really been disappointed if the animation was average in those moments, because of how beautiful the soundtracks are. But A-1 delivered, and they both complimented each other outstandingly. \\n\\n\r\nBy the end of the series, I was just left in awe, and honestly a bit (extremely) emotional. To compare, the 'feels' in this series (my opinion) surpasses the highly praised Clannad: After Story for one simple reason. I was just slightly more attached to the relationship our main characters shared than I was with Clannad. But the story is not about tragedy. It's about inspiration, passion, moving forward, family, friendship, helping each other (many more). It is about life and how hard it can be to carry on, but you still gotta do it. You still gotta live your life to your fullest.\\n\\n\r\n\"If you can't move with your hands then play with your feet! If you don't have enough fingers, then use your nose as well! Whether you're sad, you're a mess, or you've hit rock bottom, you still have to play! That's how people like us survive.\" - Kaori Miyazono. \\n\\n\r\nOverall 9.4/10. \\n\\n",

            "content": "My Thursdays won't be the same after finishing this anime. Shigatsu has taken me to a world of music that I will never forget.\r\nEven though the story isn't anything new, the way it was written and directed make it feel like one. It is a story that revolves around music and how it connects people and how it affects them. It does not only affect them in a good way, but in a bad way too. And with that premise, a beautiful story about tennagers started.\r\nAlthough there were some characters that didn't get a proper development to know and understand their own problems, motivations, anddreams, they didn't feel empty and meaningless. They all had a purpose and most of them where helpful to our main characters. They didn't feel clich\u00e9 neither, even when we got some of them like the childhood friend and the dandy best-friend. And the best part, at least to me, is that there was no fan-service. \\n\\n\r\nI didn't get to see a flaw in the animation in the 22 episodes aired. The palette of colours used, especially the blue ones, were gorgeous, while the performance moments were dynamic and realistic. Not to mention the opening and ending sequences, which are to date some of my favourites of all time.\\n\\n\r\nAdd to this a beautiful ost and amazing songs for the openings and endings and you'll feel in heaven. The opening songs were upbeat and represented a good tonal contrast to the story, while the ending songs complemented it, especially the second one, which can make you cry (if you were not crying already) after the emotional final episodes.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, this anime has been one of the bests I've ever seen. It hooked me since the first teaser, and never let me go until the last episode. It is not a hard story, so everyone can enjoy it as much as I did. With loveable and relatable characters with deep stories, a gorgeous animation and an amazing score, I'm pretty sure that this is one of the best anime from the past few years, and the best (TO ME) of this season. I can recommend this show to anyone who want to watch and experience a good, heart-warming romance anime.",

            "content": "**SPOILER FREE REVIEW**\r\nThe latest romantic-comedy/drama to take the anime world by storm is a little project known as Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso, or as many people know it, \u201cYour Lie in April\u201d. YLA has been the talk of the last two seasons as it has managed to captivate audiences around the world with its unbelievably bright colors and fantastic musical score complete with both famous classical pieces and original hits. However, if there is one thing about this show that people can\u2019t help but gorge themselves on, it\u2019s the melodrama. That\u2019s right folks: a romantic show contains MELODRAMA! Try to contain your surprise! Sinceintense over-exaggeration is virtually the only way to make shows like this interesting, know that I\u2019m willing to overlook melodrama to a certain degree\u2026 But not to THIS degree. Ladies and gentlemen: Do you think you know monologuing? Oh ho ho, you\u2019re about to.\\n\\n\r\nSynopsis: Kousei Arima is a former piano-playing prodigy; he was the best player alive for his young age until some serious mental trauma forced him to quit. He has refused to touch a musical instrument ever again, until he meets an eccentric girl named Kaori Miyazano; the girl who would change his life forever.\\n\\n\r\nYLA got off to a charming start with a great comedic focus while still hinting at a sufficiently dramatic backstory. In combination with the previously mentioned art and music, this anime showed promise. By the time the breathtaking violin performance in episode 2 had finished, pretty much everyone was hooked on this show, and understandably so. However, it didn\u2019t take long for it to divulge into one of the most laughable and overly drawn-out excuses for a narrative I\u2019ve ever seen. This show is about 10% original content and about 90% REPEATING THAT SAME CONTENT. Over and over and over and over and over and over again! You\u2019d think it was a parody of an anime drama rather than an actual iteration into the genre if you didn\u2019t know any better. This anime should have been 12 episodes TOPS, especially considering all the pointless side characters that serve no purpose. Instead, we get an anime that is just monologuing on top of monologuing episode after episode. You REALLY have to slog to get through all of it. I find it hard to pay attention to a show that\u2019s just going to spell everything out for me a million times; ever hear of subtlety? SHOW. Don\u2019t tell.\\n\\n\r\nThat\u2019s not to say that the drama is all that bad when they actually decide to advance the plot though. There are several instances of legitimately investing and interesting storytelling in this anime, but it\u2019s too few and far between be worthy of any real praise. Not to mention that it is constantly interrupted by inopportune comedy during or immediately following a dramatic moment. The strange thing is that the comedy can be pretty good too; this show has gotten more than one chuckle out of me. The problem lies in the directing, which is causing these elements to work against each other rather than cooperatively. Instead of adding another dimension to the show, the comedy merely dulls the edge of the more important dimension, and that\u2019s obviously a major problem.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters aren\u2019t necessarily bad, but I found them to be pretty poorly handled overall. Kousei, for example, is inconsistent. He will tell the audience how he feels about the SAME thing in SAME way over and over and over again, but there are also times when we should know what he is thinking and simply don\u2019t. For example, it\u2019s nonsensical how the most minor of exchanges will stick with him throughout the entire show and be monologued about dozens of times, but then major interactions between him and anybody not named Kaori are instantly forgotten even when they should be having a major impact on him. Kousei is an okay character, but his backstory is really the only thing that defines him. I was personally more partial to his best friend, Tsubaki, whose alternate perspective of having to deal with a struggling friend is often more interesting than the person who is actually suffering. \\n\\n\r\nKaori, on the other hand, really held the show back in my opinion. Yes she\u2019s cute, yes her violin performance was the best scene of the show, and yes she is the source of lots of drama. The problem is that she is treated a lot more like a plot device and a lot less like a character. With all the monologuing that goes on in this show, can someone explain to me why we never find out Kaori\u2019s true feelings in regards to so many events? Where exactly does her love of music come from? How does it motivate her? What are her specific feelings on Kousei at various intervals in the show? What about Watari? We don\u2019t know until the final episode of the show so we can pretend that all this vital information which we desperately need to get invested in her is some sort of Shyamalan twist; it's completely immature and ineffective. Kaori simply shows up, does whatever she needs to do to create drama, then leaves. She is the weakest character in the show and a big reason why I found the romance to be poorly executed and completely one-sided. I never felt like I knew this person.\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion, Your Lie in April is a cheesy drama loaded with inopportune comedy and cringe-worthy dialogue. It has its moments and the musical score/animation are wonderful, but bad directing and the lack of so much as an ounce of subtlety killed it. If you\u2019re one of those mushy-gushy drama lovers, I really can\u2019t recommend against this show since its flaws aren\u2019t too much more egregious than what you would normally see, but if not, I don\u2019t think you need to go out of your way to watch it by any means.",

            "content": "Making use of a calm, vibrant palette, Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso begins by depicting a mysterious blonde chasing after a black cat. Weirdly enough, it feels like it's meaningful; each camera angle is loose and meticulously timed, and the cuts between don't hinder the flow. I soon came to realize, however, that the problems lie not in the execution, but the narrative; so much so that it ends up being more of an eye-catcher than a drama. \r\nThe struggles musicians face are apparent for most: Writer's block, commitment, or even becoming notable are some of the most common examples of these. Arima's struggles, onthe other hand, are quite different. Ever since the death of his abusive mother, he's been too traumatized to hear his own playing. But when he meets the aforementioned blonde, Kaori, that all changes. Dubbed love at first sight, the series documents the ongoings of Arima and Kaori as they succumb to the world of music. By itself, this is no problem, but by introducing these characters minutes apart, we're given no time to really understand either of them. Instead, the viewer learns of Arima's past through an intrusive series of flashbacks throughout. Placing these sequences in the middle of recitals and performances disregards any tension that they may have created in the first place. Because of this, winning or losing doesn't matter; it's unsatisfying and hard to care either way. \\n\\n\r\nSadly, this isn't the only problem Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso faces. The dialogue feels like that of a middle school creative writing project, and when combined with a healthy amount of melodrama, it's hard not to laugh in ridicule each time Arima whines about his \"monotone\" life. In fact, it's a challenge to take this seriously. Each episode is filled with around ten or more minutes of these monologues, and in the end, it feels mostly redundant; a way to drag out the length of the series. The rest of the cast isn't even as lucky \u2013 the only information we get about them is regarding their past tragedies or to further the annoyingly weak symbolism regarding growing up. Since every major character is about 14, any appeal to emotion through dialogue only comes off as disposable and pretentious teenage angst. Constant similes are made regarding the texture and flavour of any musical performance, but they sound completely hilarious and synesthetic (\"The smell of chalk. [\u2026] The faint breathing of someone asleep.\"). There's even some comedy here and there, but it's incredibly unfunny and gets in the way of the little drama that's left - by portraying gags with brief changes in artstyle,  the otherwise appealing consistency of the animation is interrupted. It might be welcome in a comedy series, but why is it here?\\n\\n\r\nDespite my other complaints, the OST itself is fairly interesting. While the arrangements of traditional classical pieces are nothing to get too excited about, they're nice enough to listen to for   a few minutes while trudging through the rest of the show. Arima's disjointed playing isn't always welcome, though, as some parts sound a little too horrible. Even deaf musicians of his skill level and tenure should be unable to play that badly when given basic theory lessons. The OST itself consists of mostly ambient music to build tension, but it isn't anything too extraordinary \u2013 any fan of electronic music should find most of these tracks dull and utterly forgettable. The OP, on the other hand, is something that kept me watching each week; Goose House's acoustic  harmonies really set the mood for the show, and I dare say that nothing else in the series lives up to it. \\n\\n\r\nAs a package, Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso is bloated and gimmicky to the point of exhaustion, but it's decent entertainment nonetheless. The main storyline doesn't even progress for eleven episodes. It's like a Pitchfork r\u00e9sum\u00e9. If you're looking for a pretty experience and not too much more, you should definitely give the series a try \u2014 maybe even marathon it now that it's over!",

            "content": "If you don't want to read, then there\u2019s a tl;dr at the end, as well as a tl;dr for every section.\r\nShigatsu wa Kimi no Uso, or Your Lie in April, is 24-episode anime that started airing in October 2014, and ended in March 2015. Since its end, it has been a subject of hot debate on this site. Usually there are 2 types of people for any controversial show, those who love it to no end, and those who flat out despise it.  I personally am somewhere on the fence.\r\nNow is it the best anime ever? No. Is it bad? Definitely not. Then whatexactly is Shigatsu?\\n\\n\r\nWell, at its core Shigatsu is a story about a boy(Arima Kousei) who used to be a fantastic pianist at a young age. Unfortunately, during his growth, he lost his mother, something that left him unable to hear the piano ever again. Or at least until he met a violinist named Kaori Miyazono, who tries to help him return to music.\\n\\n\r\nWell, that\u2019s the basis of the story. Now onto the review.\\n\\n\r\nStory:- 6/10\\n\\n\r\nThe story of Shigatsu has both good and bad sides to it. Before we delve into the bad, let\u2019s take a look at the good.\\n\\n\r\nThe story, as you would normally expect, has a lot of romance, which is done pretty well. The romance in Shigatsu, is very heartfelt at times and also very fun at other times. The story tries to maintain a perfect balance of comedy and real romance, which does work, most of the time.\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately, this show is also a melodrama, which is the bad part. The drama in this show apparently got many people teary-eyed, but, I have a hard time believing that. The show tries way too hard to make you feel some \u201cfeels\u201d, and pretty much drops flat on its face. The show constantly tries to shove its drama in your face, from episode 13 onwards, and it gets annoying at times. Before episode 13, it still had some dramatic moments, but those were much better done, showing Kousei\u2019s inner fears.\\n\\n\r\nAs I previously mentioned, the show is filled with comedy, romance, and now, drama. When you but all these in a blender what do you get? Well if the blender was a good one, then you might get something amazing. But this wasn\u2019t a good blender. Instead what we got was a drink with a beautiful exterior, but a bad aftertaste.\\n\\n\r\nSince Shigatsu thinks it\u2019s a drama, but also tries to make time for comedy and romance, we get painfully abrupt scenes of melodrama, followed closely by comedy, which does not fit at all.\\n\\n\r\nOne second we might be seeing a person die, and the other we see Kousei getting kicked by his \u201cnot-girlfriend\u201d, Tsubaki.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of which, the romance aspect isn\u2019t flawless either. Somewhere during the time that the show was trying to find what genre it belongs to, we got a love-triangle. Now, it really isn\u2019t as bad as I make it sound, but it\u2019s still a bit clich\u00e9 at times. Boy A loves Girl A, Girl A loves Boy B, Girl B loves Boy A, and Boy B doesn\u2019t give a shit.\\n\\n\r\nThe romance isn\u2019t complex but it still does get stale at times.\\n\\n\r\nBut, for as much as I railed on the story, it has one saving grace. The ending. The final episode is probably the best part of this anime, in my opinion. It\u2019s a simple monologue by the female lead, Kaori. But it\u2019s so beautifully written that I couldn\u2019t help but be engrossed by it.\\n\\n\r\nTL;DR for STORY : The story has pretty good romance, which gets slightly stale near the middle. The excess of melodrama mixed with the comedy is probably the biggest flaw of the story, since those are two genres that should be implemented far away from each other. But, no matter how many flaws it has, its ending is beautiful in every way possible. Great writing, good background music, very good voice acting, and beautiful art. Speaking of art, let\u2019s move on to the next section.\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt and Animation:- 9/10\\n\\n\r\nThe art of Shigatsu is probably the best part of it. It changes according to the mood of the scene, and fits the overall feel of the show. It\u2019s very bright most of the time, and it everything ranging from the night sky to the school playground look gorgeous.\\n\\n\r\nThe character designs for the main characters are well done, and easily recognizable. The adults were also very well designed, to a point that you could actually guess their age. The only flaw I see with the character design are the children. It might just be me, but it\u2019s weird to see children who have buttons for eyes, which makes them stand out in comparison to the rest of the cast.\\n\\n\r\nMost of the time the animation is very fluent, and everything moves very nicely. The performance scenes are where the real budget went though. Accompanied with great music, it uses CGI for the piano, and extremely fluent animation for the violin. The CGI is a bit odd, and does stick out sometimes, but it did not distract from the focus of the scene, the performance.\\n\\n\r\nTL;DR for ART : The art in Shigatsu is the best part of it, with a hefty use of colors, and a very bright scenery which changes according to the mood and feel of the scene. Most of the character designs are pretty good, besides the children in the show. The animation is fluent for the most part, and the performance scenes were amazing. Even though the CGI piano was a bit jarring at times, it didn\u2019t distract me from what really mattered in the scene, the music.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound:- 8/10\\n\\n\r\nBeing an anime focused around music, one would normally think that the music of the show should be its strongest point, including me. But no, that\u2019s sadly not the case.\\n\\n\r\nTowards the beginning the performances were all amazing with the focus remaining solely on the performance and nothing else. But this is soon forgotten in the latter half of the show. The music itself is very good, or at least as much of the music I could hear. \\n\\n\r\nThe performances(in the latter half) are constantly interrupted by monologues, which are meant to bring up the drama, but instead come off as a distraction and an annoyance. Most of the performances I was yelling at the screen \u201cStop talking! I\u2019m trying to listen to the brilliance that you\u2019re playing!\u201d. I personally am a fan of classical music, so when someone talks over it, I get very annoyed, and feel like punching a hole through the screen.\\n\\n\r\nThat being said, the overall soundtrack of the show, excluding the performances, was pretty good. Although no song really stood out to me.\\n\\n\r\nThe voice actors also do their jobs pretty well, with all of the voices fitting the characters. Especially Kaori and Kousei\u2019s voice actors.\\n\\n\r\nBut of course, nothing in the show can top it\u2019s masterful opening. Opening 1(Hikaru Nara), is probably one of the best openings I\u2019ve ever heard in a while. The second opening(Nanairo Symphony) while not as good, was still great. Both endings were also pretty well done, but the second ending(Orange) is the better of the two.\\n\\n\r\nTL;DR for MUSIC : The show should focus on music, but instead many of the performances are spoken over for the majority of the time. The show tried to bring drama into the mix again (by talking over the performances) but failed horribly in this case. The soundtrack of the show is pretty good, and the voice actors do the characters justice. Its openings and endings are few of the best of 2014, and Opening 1 is one of my favorite openings of all time.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:- 5/10\\n\\n\r\nThis is where Shigatsu really fails. It\u2019s not that there isn\u2019t any character development, but certain characters, who needed development, didn\u2019t get any. I\u2019ll start with the good.\\n\\n\r\nKousei: He\u2019s probably the character who is best developed throughout the entire show. After meeting Kaori, he starts to regain his will to play music, and starts to overcome his fears. Many other characters, including Kaori, act as foils in his development, like his friends, teacher, his rivals, and even his pupil. His development is the one that got the most focus in the entire story, but maybe even too much.\\n\\n\r\nKaori: This is where I feel that the characters fail. Since I can\u2019t talk too much about Kaori without spoilers, I\u2019ll be as careful as possible to avoid spoiling anything. Kaori is probably the character who had the most potential to develop, but instead, she was used as a mere plot device. Something to simply be present to help Kousei grow. While I did praise Kousei\u2019s development, it\u2019s not worth sacrificing the development of another character that could\u2019ve grown into so much more. In fact, she was probably the character who I loved the most in the entire show, so I was extremely disappointed to see her get sidelined as a plot device with no depth at all.\\n\\n\r\nTsubaki: She\u2019s the other main female lead, and the other love interest of Kousei. In other words Girl B. She also played a large role in Kousei\u2019s development, but here, unlike Kaori, she also got some development. While she didn\u2019t get a lot of development, she was still the second-most developed character in the show, which was a step in the right direction.\\n\\n\r\nOther Characters: Most of the other characters are just treated as side characters, but some of them are developed. In fact Kousei\u2019s rivals and his pupil, all get some development, which was nice to see.\\n\\n\r\nTL;DR for CHARACTERS: The entire story of Shigatsu seems to focus on both Kousei and Kaori, but in fact it focuses just on Kousei. He is developed the most throughout the show, while Kaori gets the shortest possible end of the stick. Her development was expected, but it never came to be. The other characters sometimes got some development, and the other female love interest also got some development.\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:- 8/10\\n\\n\r\nAs much as I might rag on the show, and no matter how many flaws I point out in it, I still thoroughly enjoyed it. Yes, some characters got on my nerves, and the performances were really disappointing when someone talked over them, but even with all those flaws, I still enjoyed watching it.\\n\\n\r\nMost of the time I was engrossed by the beautiful exterior of the show, and at other times, I was yelling at the characters to stop talking over the music. But, it was still a fun ride.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nPros:\\n\r\n+ Great animation.\\n\r\n+ Brilliant Openings and Endings\\n\r\n+ A beautiful ending\\n\r\n+ A well developed main lead, and a likable cast of characters.\\n\r\n+ Enjoyable, if you don\u2019t try to notice the flaws.\\n\\n\r\nCons:\\n\r\n- Terribly developed female lead, with a ton of misused potential\\n\r\n- Performances were often talked over\\n\r\n- Story tries way too hard to be a drama, but in reality is just a mediocre melodrama\\n\\n\\n\r\nTL;DR for OVERALL:\\n\\n\r\nOverall, the anime definitely isn\u2019t bad, but it doesn\u2019t know what it wants to be. It thinks it\u2019s a drama and tries to act like one, but it had much more potential as a simple romance. If it wanted to be a drama, then it didn\u2019t need to add so much comic relief at every second. It keeps trying to get tears out of you, but it tries way too hard to do so. The characters were also something that needed a lot of work, with Kaori being one of the most misused characters in the show.\\n\\n\r\nOn the plus side, the anime looks gorgeous, and it has some of the best openings of all time, along with performances that could\u2019ve been much better, but were still very well done. The final episode is also a very good part of the show, meaning that the show has a brilliant ending.\\n\\n\r\nIn the end, it\u2019s not a masterpiece, nor is it garbage. It\u2019s a good experience, that I can recommend watching.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7.2/10",

            "content": "This series is overrated. It peaked my interest when I saw it on the front page at the highest rated anime on this site. I thought to myself this was worth a watch, I definitely won't be disappointed since the top rated anime here pretty much deserve to be there. How wrong was I.\r\nLet me first start by saying this series is melodramatic, slow-paced and cliched as hell. We have Arima Kousei, a depressed and traumatized 14-year-old pianist prodigy who lost his abusive mother two years prior to the story. The anime may come off as an anime that focuses a lot on music, butmusic is merely a sub-genre here. If you're watching this anime just for the music, you will be disappointed more than me. I couldn't symphatize with any of the characters in the story, it was pretty much predictable all the time. The romance is pretty below par too. \\n\\n\r\nWe're introduced to two rivals early in the story, but that's about it, they don't really have any impact or effect the main character in anyway. They end up being just mere acquaintances by the end. They tried to redeem his horrible mother whiched failed miserably. Characters are crying all the time, then they bring out a loli in the middle of the series with nothing to add to the story, just a mandatory irrelevant loli which seems to be a running occurance in every anime now. The main character barely develops during the story, he doesn't really accomplish anything in the musical world during the 22-episode course of the series, we're constantly having flashbacks about his past and how horrible his mother was to him. The dialogue in the series sounded too poetic and cheesy most of the time, and we're are constantly thrown life quotes at us, which was funny to me considering the main characters are 14-year-olds.\\n\\n\r\nOf course it has its strong points too. The animation really flows well with the series and while I'm not a fan of classical music, I must say I enjoyed the music being played throughout the series. But that doesn't exclude the fact that there are hundreds of anime out there with the same school drama setting with teenagers as main characters. This series ain't no Clannad, it just tries too hard. The main girls all seem to have a thing for the main character, but I didn't feel much romance effect here. The story was all about Arima coming out of his depressed self and back to the real world again. The ending wasn't really a tearjerker, as I predicted it way before during the course of the series, so there was no element of surprise here.\\n\\n\r\nOverall I can't say I particuarly enjoyed the series nor would I recommend it to others. I guess I COULD recommend it to someone who is particuarly interested in music, but then I'd also would recommend K-ON as well. It isn't a masterpiece like people are constantly saying. It's not bad but it's not good either - just average.",

            "content": "TL;DR A not unenjoyable series with some fantastic musical performances, that unfortunately suffers from forced drama, shallow characters, a drawn out, surprisingly predictable story & a tendency to have characters talk at length about what the music being played expresses rather than let us listen & hear it for ourselves. If you're looking for a tearjerker that will do everything short of poke you in the eye to get those tears flowing, Your Lie in April (YliA) might be for you. If you're looking for something more, you might want tosearch elsewhere.\r\n Music is the food of love. Something like that, anyway. It is certainlyused by many as a means of expressing emotions in ways they cannot put into words. Indeed you'll find few things that people (at least teenagers) will identify so strongly with as a favourite song or a passion for playing. But what might it take to kill that passion in someone? & if you met someone who had lost their love for music, what would it take to bring it back? These are the questions YliA sets out to answer & asks you to come with it. (Note that while I don't consider anything discussed a meaningful spoiler, you may think otherwise)\\n\\n\r\nThe boy for whom the music died is Kousei Arima, a gifted & renowned pianist as a child but having lost all passion or even the ability to play since the death of his (psychotic) mother. Now he just wiles away the days, transcribing sheet music & hanging out with his childhood friends Tsubaki  Sawabe & Ryouta Watari, stuck in that awkward period when no longer a child but not yet ready to be an adult. Then one day, in a scene that pays homage to Laputa: Castle in the Sky, he meets Kaori Miyazono, the carefree girl who he can't take his eyes off & who quickly takes it upon herself to break Kousei out of his shell & bring back his passion for music, whether he wants to or not. \\n\\n\r\nIf there is one rule that anime frustratingly breaks all too often, it's that of show, don't tell. Specifically, that it is better to show something through action rather than through exposition. YliA is full of this. Musical performances are an important part of the story & used as a means for the characters to work through internally whatever their \u201cthing\u201d at that point is, be it determination to prove that they're better than the competition or, often in Kousei's case, trying to overcome his personal demons so he can play. Musical performance, particularly of classical pieces with different sections & phrases that allow for the expression of different emotions, is a perfect for this. The actual performances in YliA are fantastic, with a range of Chopin & other classical pieces (although a little more variety or more well known pieces might have been appreciated) performed to a high standard but also in such a way that it mirrors the emotions of the performer, which is impressive considering we're watching cartoon characters play a cartoon piano. Indeed the music, both the original pieces & those by classical composers, is most certainly the strongest point of YliA.\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately, in almost every performance the music plays for about 20-30 seconds before someone's internal monologue starts talking all over it, usually as a form of very long winded exposition explaining what the performer is feeling. This isn't always a bad thing. When it accompanies more surreal visual expressions of the performers emotional state, such as when Kousei is playing only to find himself apparently enveloped in water & unable to hear the music, having his inner thoughts accompany the scene can add to it. However, more often than not our listening is simply interrupted by a still shot of the someone's head while they talk in detail about what we'd be able to hear & see for ourselves if only we were allowed to. \\n\\n\r\nIt's made all the more frustrating on the few occasions, such as the duet between Kousei & Nagi Aiza, where the exposition is kept to a relative minimum & the music allowed to just play, letting us see the two characters play off each other as they start with a fairly pedestrian rendition before gradually raising the tension in the scene as they both start to play off of & try to outdo the other. It just makes the scene that much more enjoyable to be allowed to just follow the performance without having someone talk over it to tell you what you could be listening to. Likewise the final performance, which I won't spoil, suffice to say that it is a nearly nine minute performance where everything comes together to produce a genuinely engrossing piece of animation. The high point is a nearly three minute part where no words are heard, with everything expressed simply by the facial expressions & body movements of Kousei & Kaori as they play together. If only the same could be said of all that came prior.\\n\\n\r\nThis may well simply be due to a mixture of practical constraints (animating multiple 5-10minute performance at a consistent quality can't be easy or cheap) & a hangover from the manga where, of course, there's no music to accompany the panels. It would be more forgiveable if it wasn't for the additional problem that the scriptwriter/author/translator seem to have a false sense of their own literary prowess, writing with a \u201cwhy say it in a sentence when a metaphor laden paragraph will do?\u201d approach. The use of poetic language isn't a problem in itself, but the characters monologues just go on & on, spouting simile after metaphor, often to the point that  it's hard not to be somewhat taken out of the moment. Kousei is a repeat offender of this, often unable to think about anything without employing multiple mixed metaphors. It doesn't help that despite all the words, the characters in YliA don't really think about much. Kousei monologues about his (abusive) mum & Kaori; Kaori about Kousei & music; Tsubaki about Kousei & childhood; & Watari about nothing because he's a plot device, not a character.\\n\\n\r\nIn fact all the cast in YliA are surprisingly shallow characters considering all they have to say. Watari just exists so there is someone in the way of Kousei & Kaori having a romantic relationship (because she's gotta stay on that pedestal, after all), playing no meaningful role beyond that. Tsibaki is the childhood friend & third corner of the triangle that every romance must have, while her boyfriend/senior Saito & classmate Kashiwagi are just there so she can talk to someone about her feelings for Kousei  other than the audience. Kousei's mum is just a (very abusive) albatross hanging around his neck that he needs to shed in order to move on from his childhood, & Kaori herself is ultimately only there to first encourage him out of his past & then her own misfortune to make him take the next steps into adulthood. Kousei of course bumbles fairly passively through all this, to the point that at times it feels more like watching the author kick a puppy than anything else. It doesn't help that on occasion the plot takes some ridiculous twists purely for the sake of melodrama at Kousei's expense. At one point, for example, he nearly drowns in a swimming pool because, rather than try to swim, he sinks to the bottom miming a piano because the water is what it feels like when he's trying to play. As examples of forced drama go, YliA has some pretty egregious ones.\\n\\n\r\nIndeed, on more than a few occasions the show takes an uncomfortable turn into outright cynical emotional manipulation of the audience. Kousei's childhood seems to exist purely for this purpose, as though you can hear the writer shouting \u201clook at this child! Doesn't he make you feel sad? No? How about if his mother hits him over the head with a cane? Are you sad now? DO YOU FEEL!?\u201d Yes, YliA, I do feel. Apparently, however, you don't, because despite all this clear abuse Kousei was put through everyone else just seemed to take a \u201cnot my problem, not my business\u201d view to it. Kousei's mum is depicted as a psychotic child abuser, destroying her son's mental health so she can live vicariously through his success. Despite this, however, ultimately the show takes the view that it's okay because he's got over it now & she only did it so he'd have the musical talent to play after she died. Even cultural dissonance can't be an adequate explanation for why that was thought a good story arc or why Kousei's mum deserved the character redemption it tries to give her.\\n\\n\r\nAll this is in contrast to the comparatively marginal b-plot, the competition between Kousei, Takeshi Aiza & Emi Igawa, where something akin to actual character progression takes place. They begin with Emi & Takeshi harbouring old grudges against Kousei, only for the trio to progress as Kousei rediscovers his passion for music while Aiza & Takeshi move on from simply wanting to stick it to their old rival to aspiring to greatness in their own rights. We get to see progression both through their thoughts & conversations & also their musical performances, not to mention that the more peripheral characters connected to this part of the story actually feel like they have a purpose beyond listening to Tsubaki's boy problems or the like. The main plot really doesn't have anything like that sort of dynamic, which makes sitting through episode after episode of Kousei thinking about his mum or Tsubaki thinking about Kousei all the harder to enjoy because it never feels like it's going anywhere meaningful. The ending doesn't help in that regard either. Without spoiling, it basically reveals that the whole journey we've been on was basically a \u201cromantic\u201d version of Cameron's b-plot in the \u201cOne day, One Room\u201d episode of House.\\n\\n\r\nBut I'm digressing now. Despite all the problems YliA has I can't say it wasn't watchable. Indeed, many of the problems I had with it are things you have to either take or leave with anime that share the same genre tags. As frustrating as it got, YliA never feels as dragged out as, say, Chihayafuru, & there were moments where the show really did shine as the romantic drama it is supposed to be. There are more episodes than were needed but the finale is both a highpoint & a definitive ending, which is always welcome. The art & animation were fine for the most part & were impressive when it counted, which is all one could ask for. Having reached the end of Kousei & company's journey, I can't say I'd want to watch it again, but nor would I say it wasn't worth watching either. All things considered, perhaps that's enough.",

If you liked it for the drama, unrequited loves, and music, try Kids on the Slope.\r\nThese two shows did it way better than Your Lie in April. \r\n----------------\r\nIt's about a piano genius boy who has been mentally abused by his over controlling, psycho mom, and thus is dealing with issues regarding his piano/musical life. Meets a forceful girl who's to change all that. She literally just comes along and forces him to do things her way. Most of the story is just so unrealistically exaggerated. Youjust can't take it seriously. This show is drama, I understand, but this is melodrama to the next level. I couldn't help laughing at parts I should be feeling sentimental about instead. Speaking of laughing, this serious show also attempts to throw in a bit of comedy.  Fine, but make sure it's funny before you go and do that. The comedy scenes for the most part didn't work for me. It just felt forced, not natural, and well....not funny. \\n\\n\r\nThey have things repeated to you over and over, and even in the same episode sometimes. Good god, way to make use of the 22 min screen time you get. The story is kinda predictable, and the fact that they spell everything out for you doesn't help to alleviate the boredom. Throw in some unrealistic, overdone drama, and you're left cringing for the most part. \\n\\n\r\nThe art. The only thing that will fool you into thinking this anime is great. I wouldn't say the animation is top notch, but the art is indeed pleasing to the eye. The OST is kinda nice as well. That's it. Those are the only pros to this show. \\n\\n\r\nFor this to creep up even in the top 50s, I don't even know what to think. It's not terrible, but it's way way way overrated, and I can't fathom why it's in the top 15 on MAL (at the time of writing). The quality of the story, the script, and the characters doesn't feel like it warrants this anime to be in the top 50 even.\\n\\n\r\nI fine with drama. Heck I LOVE a good touching show with or without romance. This show though, eventually became something I had to force myself to keep watching. If you are expecting this to be top quality anime that all should watch because it's sitting up here near the top of the list, you may find yourself severely disappointed... unless you're a preteen who loves romance and over the top sob stories. Then by all means go for it.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSTORY:4\\n\r\nART:8\\n\r\nSOUND:8\\n\r\nENJOYMENT: 3\\n\r\nOVERALL: 4\\n\\n",

            "content": "\"To play a wrong note is insignificant; to play without passion is inexcusable.\" - Ludwig Van Beethoven \r\nShigatsu wa Kimi no Uso is about a child prodigy classical pianist named Kosei Arima, who gave up playing due to crippling depression following the death of his mother. Even though he won many competitions back when he was still playing piano, his playing was always very \"by the book\", mechanical, and lacking in passion. This was because of the extremely strict way in which he was trained by his late mother. After hearing the very passionate and innovative performance of a brilliant young violinist named Kaori Miyazono,Kosei is able to rediscover his love for music and learn to play with heart.\\n\\n\r\nThat sounds AMAZING right? An anime musical drama/romance that tells a heartwarming tale and introduces beautiful classical music to a new generation who otherwise wouldn't give it a chance. Why then didn't I rate it a 9 or 10?! I will sadly have to explain.\\n\\n\r\nFirstly, I must say that this series REALLY had potential! Especially for me, since I am a huge fan of classical music. Both of my parents were classical violinists who played in an orchestra. I went in with very high expectations, but unfortunately I was a bit disappointed. That isn't to say that I felt Shigatsu was a bad anime. Shigatsu is a fine anime, but I am saying it could have been a LOT better and it wasted a tragic amount of potential.\\n\\n\r\nStory: \\n\\n\r\nAlthough the basic premise of the story is the stuff of an award winning drama film, the execution was...not so much. Shigatsu has a LOT of really crappy comedy that never once made me laugh and constantly threw the mood out the window! This comedy is almost always accompanied by painfully obnoxious chibi style animation to save on the show's budget. I'm not saying that using tone jarring chibi out of nowhere instantly makes an anime bad. Hellsing Ultimate did it for comedy scenes, but Hellsing Ultimate never took itself seriously and never expected the audience to take it seriously. It is a show about Count Dracula fighting Nazi vampires! Shigatsu on the other hand, tries REALLY hard every 5 seconds to make the audience cry. Shigatsu DOES take itself quite seriously and wants to really emotionally move the audience, so the use of shitty comedy and random chibi in this context was a rather poor choice. The other most obvious problem in the show's execution was just how forced a lot of the tragedy felt. Shigatsu is a flat out melodrama. I'm not one of those critics who instantly hates on melodrama and condemns series just for using a writing style that is no longer in vogue. However, this story really didn't need to be a melodrama. It felt completely tacked on unnecessarily. Tragedies get more respect than comedies right? We better try REALLY hard to make this into a tragedy! I love a good tragedy, but Shigatsu in terms of its themes, message, and basic story isn't really crafted to be a tragedy. It feels like a comedy that was forcibly changed into a tragedy in post production because some jackass thought it would win more awards! \\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\\n\r\nThe art and animation is very inconsistent. During the scenes where an instrument is being played, the animation is gorgeous and accurately captures the movements of the musician. Then it goes to barely animated chibi garbage because...why? The art style is extremely \"moe\" which may piss off some viewers.\\n\\n\\n\r\nMusic:\\n\\n\r\nThe selection of classical music is AWESOME! We get Beethoven, Chopin, Rachmaninoff, and basically lots of excellent pieces by amazing composers. The only problem is the quality of the playing used for the anime's soundtrack. We are told over and over again how Kosei is this AMAZING child prodigy and quite possibly developing into the greatest pianist of his day. Yet the piano playing we hear is...not THAT good. This wasn't a live action film. They could have used any recording since the invention of the phonograph and synced up the animation with the playing. Why not use a recording of a pianist who actually plays like ALL the characters describe Kosei? Vladimir Horowitz could play better than the dude from this soundtrack after 3 bottles of vodka, blindfolded, while being attacked by killer bees!\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\\n\r\nBasically I just wanted to say that Shigatsu wasn't a bad anime, but it really wasn't a new masterpiece and actually squandered a ton of potential with extremely questionable choices in terms of execution. This actually isn't the first time I have seen a \"moe\" melodrama that mixed slapstick comedy with extremely forced tragedy. Angel Beats already accomplished that feat years ago. The difference is that the comedy in Angel Beats was actually funny! Angel Beats was also always supposed to be a comedy, but with some drama and tragedy thrown in. Shigatsu probably started out as a comedy, but was changed into a tragedy first, a romantic drama second, and a loveletter to classical music 3rd. The comedy in Shigatsu  honestly feels WAY more out of place than the comedy in Angel Beats. Overall, I would still check it out if you really love classical music or wish to learn more about classical music, but if you are coming for the drama/romance, I would pick a better anime.",

In my opinion, this show puts way too much of an emphasis on the entire drama of everything and kinda distracts from what I think is most important in a good show: an interesting story. Say you're not like me, and you enjoy all this whiny drama stuff. I'd say disregard everythingelse I'm about to say and go ahead and watch this, because you'll be sure to enjoy it. However, if all these tears and uncertain moments make you kinda wanna puke, I'd maybe kinda wanna stay away, because you'll only end up distraught and dissatisfied with all the mixed emotions in a show like this.",

            "content": "Beethoven was a piano genius who couldn\u2019t hear his own music because of his deafness. Arima Kousei is a piano prodigy can\u2019t hear his own music because of the tragic death of his mother causing mental breakdown that casted a deep, dark shadow over music.  \r\n[Story]\r\nYour Lie in April starts out as a colorful, and lighthearted anime, but all this contrasts the life of it\u2019s main character, Arima Kousei, which is described as monotone, and dull. The lightheartedness is contradicted yet again as deeper, and much darker past is revealed as Arima falls deeply in love with Kaori. You get a large glimpse ofhis dismal past revealing the actual reason behind why he can\u2019t hear his own music, but his conditions steadily improves as he ventures into his first love. Though only calling him \u201cFriend A\u201d Kaori slowly begins to drag him back into music, as well as showing him a new side of life that was colorful, and vivid. \\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed the story as well the storytelling methods of Shigatsu. The story is told mostly through Kosei\u2019s point of view, and the anime utilizes a unique way of narration, much of the story is told through internal monologues, and thoughts. There are several pros and cons of this method, and a pro is the fact that you can see the character\u2019s thought processes, and the con is that too much monologues can be quite overwhelming as well as annoying at times.  \\n\\n\r\n[Characters]\\n\\n\r\nOne of the things that made this anime so great was the characters. The anime heavily centers in on the past of the characters, which proves to be an excellent way of characterization. Every single character in the anime no matter substantial or minor is given a great personality. And as far as character development goes, most of the main characters display a considerable amount of it, especially Kousei. \\n\\n\r\nI really enjoyed diversity between the personalities of Kousei, and Kaori. Kaori seemed like the incarnation of freedom, a happy go lucky girl. Yet Kousei is a sheltered person, he seems to withdraw himself from others in order to protect himself. They were polar opposites of each other, yet they were also made to be together.\\n\\n\r\n[Sound]\\n\\n\r\nAmazing put together, the soundtrack to the anime emphasized every aspect of the anime making it so much better. I\u2019m definitely no fan of classical music but, they were essential to the show, as to any music anime, and it turned out I really enjoyed them because the songs were part of the story. Each time Kosei performed a song it revealed to us a little bit of his past. As a person who always skips the OP and ED of an anime, I made the exception for this one since they all were so well written, and complemented the tone of the anime. \\n\\n\r\n[Art & Animation] \\n\r\nOriginal, would be the word I would use to describe the type of art style in the anime. Personally I thought it was okay but it was fairly compatible with the show, it used a lot of vibrant colors which thoroughly emphasized a lighthearted mood. \\n\\n\r\n[Negatives] \\n\r\nNo show is perfect, and this show is no exception. Not really sure why people had such a big problem with the overly dramatic scenes but it\u2019s true there were a lot of drama, especially towards the end. Personally I thought the drama made the show more realistic, but honestly do a couple of 14 year olds need that much drama.\\n\\n\r\nPacing, one thing I learned after watching this anime was that the author really likes to drag things out, and I understand that this might not be a problem for some people, but honestly, do they really need to spend a whole episode on the past of a supporting character? I really wish they would\u2019ve made the last part of the show longer rather than adding in too much detail. \\n\\n\r\n[Overall]\\n\\n\r\nI really enjoyed this anime as a whole, it took a very clich\u00e9d plot, and with it\u2019s added elements turned it into something original. And taking it\u2019s genre\u2019s into perspective, it really excels at each of them except the humor it could\u2019ve been done a lot better. The jokes were poorly placed and overall just caused awkwardness. The anime is a real tearjerker it made me cry twice, and I pride myself in being a real macho person. But as far as masterpieces go, this definitely belongs in the best of the best. It\u2019s an anime that I wished would never end, but nothing lasts forever, except true love. \\n",

The big question is whether the music-focused romance has earned its acclaim we\u2019ve seen from the bulk of reviewers? I feel it\u2019s both a yes and no, but mostly the latter. That\u2019s not to take away from it at all. This artful, musical adventure is still better than your average anime by a long way and it\u2019s still a show I\u2019d encourage everyone to watch if they get a chance.\r\nIt is one gorgeously crafted anime froma technical perspective. While its animation doesn\u2019t leap out at you, the character designs, background art and music are superb. Every scene is oozing with charm. The show is not, however, free from its flaws which come mostly from the character interactions, comedy and strange writing choices that plague the show particularly in its back half. There is no doubting that the show will be remembered for a long time in the genre thanks to its wonderful blend of art, music and sprightly collection of characters. It\u2019s not flawless, by a long shot, but it will manage to reach you somewhere on the emotional spectrum through either its uplifting moments or its sadder periods.\\n\\n\r\nThe story itself is simple enough. We have our protagonist Kousei who is a former child prodigy on the piano but has since lost both his desire and ability to play due to events in his life. Along comes Kaori into his life, a blond-haired ball of energy, who suddenly puts the colour back into his life and sparks his journey back into the musical sphere. There\u2019s no themes in here you haven\u2019t seen before but the way they are conveyed is full of life and charm. Though it borders on the overbearing when it comes to dialogue the story trundles along with a decent pace throughout the episodes, perhaps dragging along at moments. Could it have been done over 12 episodes instead? Possibly.\\n\\n\r\nThe show\u2019s biggest flaw comes from its handling of the relationship between our two main characters Kousei and Kaori. It\u2019s hard to delve into this without spoiling the story and their development but I will say a few things on the topic. \\n\\n\r\nFirst, the not-so-good news. A combination of some dreadfully unfunny and poorly timed comedic breaks, repetitive dialogue, slow progression and also exposition overload with the duo always kept me frustrated as a viewer. A lot has been said about the lengthy amount of philosophical ramblings of the characters, and it must be said that the problem with them doesn\u2019t come with the words being spouted from a 14-year-old\u2019s mouth. Instead, the problem comes in that such monologues are in stark contrast to the wacky comedic moments. The show really has no idea what kind of tone it\u2019s going for because of this conflict. The show could have done without both the philosophical and comedic moments and struck a friendly middle ground that could still have produced a concentrated script.\\n\\n\r\nThe other side of the coin is that, on their own, I feel like our leading pair are very interesting. They have desires and they change as our story progresses. As they each help them find out more about themselves and their own ability we start to see new sides of them. This is true more so in Kousei\u2019s case as Kaori remains criminally underdeveloped at points. Nothing in the show, I feel, is worthy of the dreaded \u2018melodramatic\u2019 tag. All the decisions made revolving around their music make sense, plus the emotional baggage they carry is certainly not unfounded. It\u2019s great to see Kousei try to fight through the barriers preventing him from playing without fear once again. The way he tries to achieve that makes perfect sense and is handled with respect and \u2013 to a point \u2013 realism.\\n\\n\r\nIn regards to our other characters, it seems all their purpose in the show is to further Kousei\u2019s development without expanding their own a great amount. That\u2019s not to say they don\u2019t have their moments. Tsubaki and Watari are the friends tagging alongside our leading duo and they provide a welcome change up sometimes. Their own successes and failures are utilised well by the writers as a parallel to what our leads are going through. They certainly don\u2019t just sit by the wayside achieving little.\\n\\n\r\nWhile a central theme of Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso is its classical music and how it is used to express emotion, it commits the big sin of telling instead of showing. It's disappointing to see a show that is supposed to be letting the music speak to us instead have its message spit out to us in lengthy monologues from those both playing and listening to it. Music has the ability to speak to us through its expression and dynamics. There is supposed to be no better example of this than classical piano. Shigatsu manages to capture this through its artistic elements like its beautiful light and art and also its depiction of the playing styles between our different characters. However these moments become fractured and tainted to an extent due to the constant spilling of thoughts from our characters.\\n\\n\r\nThis nit picking, to a point. Every musical scene is packed with energy and also seems to be where the majority of the animation budget would be poured into for the show. The song choices are fantastic and do a superb job at mirroring the current state of the person playing it. It would be most accurate to describe all of Kousei\u2019s performances as a means of concluding an \u2018arc\u2019 or development for him. We see him either grow or recede in his confidence in himself each time and, as stated above, the art and direction manage to capture these changes wonderfully.\\n\\n\r\nOn another music note the opening and endings are all wonderful and perfectly encapsulate the themes that the show is going for. Goose House\u2019s Hikaru Nara is the big highlight with its energetic vibe and singalong chorus, it\u2019s without a doubt one of the best openings I\u2019ve had the pleasure of listening to.\\n\\n\r\nOverall Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso is a show that I feel everyone should experience. Some may be able to look past the bloated dialogue and the sketchy writing, instead uncovering a colourful and vibrant show that manages to give off plenty of charm through its music and superb art. More than anything \u2013 despite the flaws I see \u2013 the show will stick with you. There will be moments you look back on with either fondness or sadness some time from now.",

            "content": "\"Will you forget?\" - Kaori \r\nHonestly, I have not written an anime review probably since Sword Art Online. I don't necessarily prefer writing reviews cause they're generally tedious & time consuming. However, There is only so long I can see such misleading, disrespectful, and uninformative reviews. Out of the well over 300 anime series I have seen, Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso is one of Seven anime I have given the perfect score to. And that is because this anime epitomises quality & perfection. \r\nI came in to this show with moderate expectations. I followed this show weekly - watching it each Thursday as itaired alongside my other Fall 2014 & Winter 2015 shows. Episode after episode continued to raise expectations, to command attention & perpetuate interest. I've seen a relatively fair share of Romance/Drama/School type anime, the most recent one of this genre being \"Nisekoi\" and most falling in a long line of trope filled, generic characters, non-developing story, and non existent romance. \\n\\n\r\nThe first thing you have to judge a show by is its first impression, just like any other art medium. My first impression of Shigatsu was along the lines of \"Wow, this is aesthetically pleasing.\" The meticulous attention to detail of backgrounds, artistic displays, character designs was beyond impressive. Even the way A-1 transitioned between Kosei's world of colour & that of black/white played a positive, constructive role into developing not only Kosei's character, but the plot itself. \\n\\n\r\nThe music coincides with the other positive elements of the show to create the stunning masterpiece it is. First and foremost Shigatsu is a music anime & i find some of the criticisms of this not only amusing, but contradictory. OF COURSE, the drama, romance, setting & other plot elements are going to be centred around Kosei and his Piano playing - his fears, his desires, & his inability to overcome that struggle. I thought this would be more obvious to some people who call it melodramatic, or saying the drama is forced, which is rather ironic seeing as all the drama that occurs is relevant to the story & does not feel forced. Anyway I did not intend to deviate from how special the music is. The score is very evenly and appropriately composed, and at points where the emphasis is on the recitals, the music always fits the mood of the show well, and the monologue that occurs during these moments provides invaluable access to the minds of the characters (predominately Kosei) that allow us to resonate not only to the sound of the music being played - but to the intention of the sound. To the tension of that sound - of that meaning reaching its final destination. The hearts of the audience. The hearts of us. \\n\\n\r\nDid it reach us? - Yes it did.\\n\\n\r\nYou can't have a perfect score without characters of the highest calibre. That's where Kaori Miyazano sparkles. She is confident, strong willed, beautiful, motivational, short-tempered, fragile, lonely all at the same time. To me she rates among the best female characters of all time.  Kosei was a little more frustrating at times, and a little more bland. A little more of the generic type, but even when he should feel generic, there is a realness he represents. The struggle he faces, his desires to overcome those struggles, his human emotion - his black and white world that is slowly being transformed to that of colour. Kosei surely wasn't the most spectacular of protagonists - but seeing the once \"puppet to the score's\" transformation both as a person - and as an artist is one of the best coming of age developments in Anime history. Even some of the side characters I particularly grew fond of. The most specific of these is Aiza. Aiza while truly looked up to Kosei  as a hero- as an idol, despite being equally as talented  and prodigious himself. Even looking at Kosei's back, he always strives to catch up to him, to make an impact. Not all of the characters were strong - Watari is the generic best friend who's athletic, good looking, confident, etc & Tsubaki has the archetypal role of being the childhood friend who's in love - but can't realise it. \\n\\n\r\nWhen I rate anime, 9 to me represents masterpiece, and 10 represents what i describe as \"beyond masterpiece\". I always say if I have to \"question\" if a show is a ten it is inherently not a ten, So what separates Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso from other masterpieces? It's the show's impact. Week in and week out my heart aligned with the characters - aligned with the drama. The aesthetics were unparalleled, the score so diligently composed, the characters so well developed and an ending that catalyses tears from even the most desensitized of viewers. Save for a few moments of misplaced comedic madness, the tone was consistent - the mood always properly developed & accentuated by both the score & art, and the show epitomised the absolute pinnacle of its genre. I loved this show. \\n",

            "content": "THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS\r\nNote: I am no english speaker\r\nNote: Finished the serie. It got better, I'll admit but 3 worth episodes do not compensate the whole shitness of the anime.\r\n\"Your lie in April\"? More like \"Your overrated anime in April\". Am I right?!\r\n*Awkward silence*\r\nLet me start off by saying this: I did not enjoy Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso. \r\nAs you can imagine I, being a classical music enthusiast and a big fan of Clannad (although some reviewers would have a word on that), was pretty excited about this anime and along with the hype I went and I watched it...as long as I couldtake it...\\n\\n\r\nLet's start off with the production value. Here is where Shigatsu really stands out. The art is amazing and the backgrounds are simply breathtaking. The animation is also great specially when the characters are playing their instruments as you can see the tears, the sweat and the facial expressions borned from the joyness of music. \\n\r\nThen we have the music. I already said that I love classical music, and I surely have loved that this anime had classical music. The only scenes with high quality music where the ones with the characters on the scenario. Then everything else was kinda dead silent and no real music to go along. Pretty dissapointing, but I guess I must give a high score just for those scenes alone. I have no comments on the voice acting, as I watched subbed and we all know that doesn't fail.\\n\\n\r\nLet's go with the story so I can start throwing shit here and there.\\n\r\n\"Oh! He is in love with a cute girl! Oh! The girl is his best friend's girlfriend! That was so not predictable! Oh! His girl friend loves him in secret but he doesn't have a clue that also so not predictable! Oh! The girl he loves has a medical condition that so original!\"\\n\r\nYeah, that's pretty much about it...\\n\r\nThere are three things that really bother myself about this anime. First of all is the comedy. It was hard enough for me to get into a tragic and dramatic scene, and then they totally kill the mood with crappy comedy? That's a huge backstab for any viewer. It wasn't the comedy that was bad, but it was so misplaced. You know what? Forget that, the comedy was bad indeed. But specially the bad timing they had for those shitty jokes. How do you expect me to be sensitive when suddenly you totally change the scene's mood?\\n\r\nSecondly every character cries for fucking everything. I mean come on. I get Kousei with his mom, but they cry for every fucking thing. Got a concert tomorrow? Better cry instead of practicing. You want to ask one of your best friends to be you partner? Cry, that totally does not look awkward. You see a cat on the street? Better have a heart attack. I understand that drama is necessary in an anime of this nature but Jesus Christ this was plain stupid. Lastly, the premise was really really REALLY good, and it had two strong plotlines to hold to in order to make this a brilliant anime. On one hand the relationship between Kousei and his mother (as many artists and athletes have that kind of relationship with their parents) had a lot of potential for character development and deep psychological struggle. On the other hand we had the rivalries between Kousei, Takeshi and Emi (by far the best characters) that could have become an AMAZING plot-motor, as we could have seen their egos in epic classical music battles. But what did we got instead? Crappy romance triangles with no real development and boo-boo teen angst. Including a romance for the sake of the story could have been nice but my god what a way to fuck things up.\\n\r\nI'll admit that the last episodes were good because A) they kinda cut that shitty comedy B) theyfocused more on the concerts and the actual music and C) Kaori gets less screen-time.\\n\\n\r\nNow this, leads me to the final and most important part: the characters. I liked Kousei a lot. He was well developed he was an interesting character and his struggle and emotions seemed the most natural and realistic of all the cast. I also liked Emi and Takeshi as Kousei's rivals but they get no screen-time nor development to be considered other things than fillers. The rest of the cast was plain, boring and overall a big \"meh\" with two exceptions.\\n\r\nI strongly dislike Tsubaki. Considering all the screen-time she had and the \"development\" she got (if we can call that development) it is infuriating how balnd, stupid and boring of a character she turned out to be. Really though, what the heck is she for the story? She serves no purpose and she is not even ebtertaining to watch.\\n\r\nAnd last but not least, Kaori. By far, the most bland, obnoxious, stupid and unrealistic female MC I've seen lately. Sorry I was wrong.She is not a character, she is a mere plot device. She is there just to inspire Kousei to play music. She is annoying everything she does is stupid and a forced overreaction and OH MY GOD WHY THE FUCK DOES SHE HIT HIM SO MUCH? They tried to make a cool badass tsundere like Asuka and instead they got a pile of shit with blonde hair and no real purpose on the story. Also, why they decided to throw her development as a big ball of blandness into the last episode? If I knew all that during the series progression she would have been a better character.\\n\\n\r\nSo...that's about it. That's my rant for this ani-meh. Shigatsu had a lot of potential. Kousei development was great. The music scenes were amazing. The relationship between him and his mother was splendid. The art and animation were outstanding. But they decided to throw all that away just to please the casuals with a bad romantic-drama-comedy-slice of life. It could have worked as a 12 episodes romantic anime, but stretching it for so long made it unbearable.",

            "content": "Spoiler free but one could infer things based on my reaction.\r\nShigatsu is an anime that had me torn in so many places. I think the plot , the music and the artwork are the best you will see recent memory. That said, the melodrama between the big events of the series is absolutely excruciating to watch especially for a modern anime. I had to constantly remind myself that the main characters are junior high students and not high school students to give some meaning to the unrealistic drama that unfolded. I will describe why I feel that this melodrama was so horribly written and executedand why I feel it ruined an incredible piece of art that is Shigatsu.\\n\\n\r\n The \"lie\" is supposed to be a plot device that allows Arima to have mixed feelings and give him a drive. \\n\r\nThis worked out fine story wise but to introduce that type of background and never work with it was annoying to say the least. I really feel I could argue that this was made so that \"romance\" could be injected into a musically focused story. Normally this type of relationship would be questioned. We never experience that thrill of someone finding out. Later in the series Watari openly comments on other cute girls with no remorse or guilt or obligatory anime slap to the face. This brings another issue with the series which is my main dealbreaking issue. Anytime there is a problem all you have to do is beat the shit out of Kosei,\\n\r\nKaori messes something up,attack  Kosei, another girl shows affection to Kosei, attack him for it,\\n\r\nKosei does all the work and takes no credit, attack him for it, \\n\r\nKosei suffers from depression due to trama, help him by attacking him, \\n\r\nKosei does his absolute best given the circumstances, beat the shit out of him\\n\r\nI don't know if this was supposed to funny but it was the most irritating I ever watched. I started to question anime in general because of this series. \\n\\n\r\nThere was so much they could have done instead of attacking Kosei.   I wanted more from this anime. The art work caught my eye immediately with eye popping colors that were so vivid on an OLED screen and an excellent repertoire of classical music.  Character development felt very forced as most anime do with a beta male main character. \\n\r\nThis anime could of been a must see classic if the writer had been more mature about it but now it's a just a good watch for people who like music anime with a little romance. Don't watch this anime for the romance like I did. just enjoy the ride and try not to think about it.",

            "content": "They say that when you fall in love, your whole world changes. The grey becomes colored, the dull becomes vivid, and the little moments become unforgettable ones. While there may be other stories that are written better or other productions that are animated better, Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso (Your Lie in April) struck a chord with me that I hadn\u2019t felt with a show in a long time. Even with its flaws, I loved every moment of this show, both as a musician and as an ordinary viewer. \r\nShigatsu focuses on the journey of Arima Kousei, who was a brilliant pianist as a child,but is now just a shell of his former self, haunted by the tragedies of his past. However, one day in April he meets Kaori Miyazono, the wild and unorthodox violinist, and that meeting sets off the beginning of Kousei\u2019s journey as Kaori drags him out forcefully to confront himself. While there\u2019s nothing especially groundbreaking about the premise, I felt it was executed in such a way that made the journey engaging and got me invested in the lives of the characters. The story\u2019s lighthearted moments were very enjoyable, bar a bit of repetitiveness in the slapstick comedy, while the tragic moments made me sympathize and mourn alongside the characters. Some may say that the show was a bit overdramatic, but I\u2019d have to disagree. The emotional plights that seem trivial to an outsider have much more weight to growing adolescents, and that is something I could definitely empathize with. On the other hand, the stress and despair that the musicians feel leading up to their performances may not be understandable to the casual player, but to those with a real investment in music, it is very real. I felt that the drama was well done and raised the tension in such a way that made the stakes at cost feel present. Also, I\u2019m glad that they committed to their ending and didn\u2019t kind of half-way attempt it but then turn tail because they were too afraid of committing *cough* Oreimo *cough*. It made the ending feel much more satisfying, which sadly is not the case for many shows.\\n\\n\r\nOne complaint that some might have with the show and that I\u2019d be able to understand is that it\u2019s a little heavy-handed. With an abundance of monologues containing flowery, Shakesperian-esque dialogue as well as not-so-subtle symbolism, it probably would\u2019ve been to their benefit to have toned it down a little and made it a bit more subtle. While it might be too much for some, I personally didn\u2019t really have too much of an issue with it, but it was noticeable. It could also be a little slow at times, but other than one especially noticeably repetitive episode, it wasn\u2019t too big of a problem.\\n\\n\r\n A part of the show that I enjoyed immensely was watching the musicians grow. From the climb out of despair in Kousei or just the small steps as a musician in the young Nagi, seeing all the musicians grow up on their own journeys both musically and emotionally was extremely satisfying to watch. The rest of the cast were a bit more stagnant, but they were still enjoyable characters nonetheless. Watari was a bit of the typical male best friend character and didn\u2019t really grow through the series, but was still fun to watch. Tsubaki didn\u2019t really grow much either for most of the series, but when the time came around where everyone realized just how fleeting time is, she was able to do more than just the typical childhood friend character, and I appreciated that. The characters felt like more than just two dimensional people, leading me to grow invested and care about their lives.\\n\\n\r\nNow, there was some slight controversy surrounding the show, mostly involving Kaori\u2019s forcefulness with Kousei, as well as Tsubaki and Watari to a lesser degree. While it\u2019s certainly not going to be the same case for everybody, and there are probably hundreds of different methods that could have been used, I feel as though Kaori\u2019s push isn\u2019t as wrong as some people think. I may not have gone through the same circumstances that Kousei did, nor was my despair ever as great as his, but I think that I can empathize with Kousei\u2019s mindset. And if it was me, I definitely would\u2019ve needed to have had someone else push me, even if it hurt, to ever have a chance of finding a way out, so I feel as though the story\u2019s take on the situation wasn\u2019t wrong. Of course, some people may have different opinions, and I respect that, but that\u2019s my personal take on the matter.\\n\\n\r\nOn the artistic side of things, it was a beautiful show to look at. The art style was pleasing, and the animation was mostly fluid; they also had some gorgeous stills too. The color palette changed to fit the emotions as well as the livelihood of a certain character, so that was a nice touch. There were times that the animation cut the corners a little in a way that you could tell, but it was never anything too prominent. The soundtrack was nice and fitting, with the everyday moments feeling pleasant while the dramatic ones being accentuated with the emotional music. I loved both OP\u2019s, although Hikaru Nara edges it out slightly for me, while both ED\u2019s fit nicely with the tone, with the second one more somber than the first to fit with the growing tragedy.\\n\\n\r\nOf course, as a show about musicians, the performances had to be good. And they were absolutely amazing. The performances were extremely engaging, and after every single one, I noticed that I hadn\u2019t moved an inch during the whole thing. They were animated beautifully, and the emotions in the music captivated me as a viewer. As a musician, watching these performances reignited a love for classical music I had forgotten for a long time, and it\u2019s stirred me to expand my repertoire to more than just contemporary music. As a side note, I\u2019m extremely glad that they finally didn\u2019t have a violinist just flailing around the bow like they\u2019re playing the music even though it doesn\u2019t match what\u2019s playing at all. As a former violinist it would grate my eyes whenever I saw that in a show, but thankfully this one avoids doing just that. \\n\\n\r\nMaybe it\u2019s just because I\u2019m a teenager and a musician so I can relate with the characters, but this is a show that captivated me in a way that anime hasn\u2019t done in a long time. While it may have had some flaws, the character journeys, the tragic moments alongside the lighthearted ones, the performances, and the energy of the show all just came together to create a show that was extremely enjoyable from beginning to end. \\n\\n\r\n\"Are you going to forget? Even if I die, I won't forget.\"\\n\\n\r\ntl;dr \u2013 I liked it. A lot.\\n",

            "content": "It would seem that feeling some modicum of emotional involvement whilst watching/reading something is all it takes to make a masterpiece these days. Whilst emotional involvement is always a great thing, it's not enough to excuse problems that a particular work in question has. On another note, it irks me when people say they \"got the feels\" from watching something because more often than not, it was something stupid/clich\u00e9/melodramatic. Maybe I'm a heartless sociopath or maybe it's because I've been through a lot worse in life, but I can't help but scoff when people tell me they cried like a baby whilst watching stuff likethe first season of Clannad. Then enters Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso, an anime/manga series that plagues me with cognitive dissonance because there's a lot of stuff I truly do like about this programme but there's also a LOT of irritating crap that just got on my nerves.\\n\\n\r\nThe biggest reason as to why I got emotionally involved with Shigatsu is because of Kousei himself. Like I've said in some of my other reviews, my mother's dead and I know damn well where Kousei's at and all that stuff. To me, Shigatsu was less about the music and more about the story of a teenager learning to move on from past tragedies. Add into the mix that I'm a huge fan of romantic drama and music, and you'd basically have a recipe for something that would've been among my all-time favourites (alongside the likes of White Album and Solanin). Unfortunately, it wasnt perfect. The gag comedy was a mild annoyance that gradually turned into something cringe-worthy, the monologuing was a bit tedious and it just got even more ridiculous as the show went on, and as these two aspects of the show became more obvious, I found myself getting less and less involved with what was going on. If you're an avid fan of this show, allow me to explain myself.\\n\\n\r\nI understand that levity has a place in storytelling, and what's more is that this show is aimed toward a mainstream audience that probably can't handle the intensity of things like Gong Ji-young's Our Happy Time or White Album 2. The problem is that Shigatsu's particular style of humour was grossly inappropriate for the subject matter that this show was tackling. This is a show revolving around a 14-year-old who has a dead mother who was extremely abusive toward him learning how to cope with past tragedies and learning to move on with his life. The last thing we need is a chibi-style cutaway interspliced with every dramatic moment out there. Stuff like that just takes away from the emotional impact of the story and just ruins the mood for me. If the humour was more dialogue-oriented like in Daria or in the Ultimate Spider-Man comics, it would've been more than enough to break up the excess tension that would build up and make the show uncomfortable to watch whilst also allowing for the show to play with your emotions without any interference whatsoever. Alack, hindsight's an anime studio's worst enemy and there's no changing what's already done.\\n\\n\r\nOn another note, the monologuing was nothing short of tedious and insulting. Monologues are a powerful tool and if used sparingly, they can strengthen the impact of various events that would go on in your story. The problem is that the mangaka (and A-1 Pictures by extension) fails to understand that more monologues does NOT equate to more emotional weight. I don't know about you, but I find it nothing short of insulting when an anime studio decides to tell us exactly what a character is feeling via long, drawn-out monolgues in almost every episode because it gives me the impression that A-1 Pictures thinks I'm some socially inept otaku with no understanding of how human emotions work. The strange thing is that all of the monologuing could've easily been omitted if the story actually decided to focus on Kousei and Kaori instead of bringing up the perspectives of people like Kousei's piano rivals and Tsubaki.\\n\\n\r\nI don't know about you, but I don't give a rat's ass about Tsubaki, Watari, Emi, Takeshi, or any of those other people. They're side characters, so why even bring them up? The only characters that ultimately matter by the end of it all are Kousei and Kaori. All that time that A-1 Pictures spent on those characters could've easily been spent making fleshing out Kousei and Kaori's personalities. As much as I adore the two of them, I can't exactly say that I think they''re well-written characters. Let me put it to you like this: I've found several other characters empathetic in the same way I found myself empathising with Kousei (i.e. Tohru Honda, Tomoya Okazaki, Shinji Ikari) and yet those characters made more of a lasting impression in my mind than Kousei did, namely because I found them empathetic in many more ways than I could find myself relating to Kousei. I mean, outside of the fact that I was once a motherless teenager with the hots for a blonde chick, I can safely say that Kousei isn't exactly the most relatable of individuals. As for Kaori? Well... outside of the fact that I actually like her, she's no different than Nagisa from Clannad in that they're just there to be plot devices meant to evoke an emotional response out of the viewer.\\n\\n\r\nNow those problems aside, another thing that never really sat right with me was how Kousei was treated by his friends over the course of the series. He's got a dead mother who was pretty damn abusive toward him. The last thing the bloke wants to do is play the piano, and yet he still finds himself drawn to it because you know... that was his thing. I understand his friends want him to just play the bloody instrument again and that 14-year-olds aren't psychotherapists by any stretch of the imagination, but the way they go about doing so is rather cruel to say the least. He's harassed and manipulated quite a bit over the course of the series and somehow, that's the solution to all of his problems. You know, Kousei would've had a mental breakdown if he was a real person because he'd be forced to re-live some nasty childhood trauma. I wouldn't really have much of a problem with this were it not for the fact that I've seen shit like this first-hand, and it *RARELY* works out. It also doesn't help that there was a lot of inappropriate gag comedy that was going on during these scenes where Kousei was forced to play the piano again, but let's not get into that.\\n\\n\r\nI really don't want to pick on this show so much, but the problem is that these flaws make the show incredibly difficult to take seriously. When I get taken out of my moment by flaws in a particular programme, my critical faculties are automatically turned on and now I have no choice but to take the piss out of the show I'm watching because it failed to keep me entertained in the first place. This means that stuff I would've ordinarily let slide if I were actually invested in what I was watching (i.e. the simpering, stupid dialogue about \"seeing the notes\" and \"colourful music\") end up being another point lost in my book. If this were any other programme (like say Tokyo Ghoul or Fate/stay night), this wouldn't be a problem because half the fun in watching them came from making fun of what was going on in the show. However, Shigatsu falls in with Nagi no Asukara in that it was a show that I adored the crap out of that gradually lost my interest because of various factors (much to my own dismay, of course).\\n\\n\r\nA lot of these problems could've easily been avoided if A-1 Pictures actually took the initiative to fix the problems that the source material had in the adaptation. An adaptation isn't supposed to be a translation of the source material verbatim into another medium. Adaptations can be viewed as a sort of \"second chance\" for the source material, so the most important job that an adaptation has to do is fix the various problems that plagued the source material in the first place. Unfortunately, that didn't happen whatsoever and the end result is a show full of wasted potential, poorly-timed gag comedy, tedious monologues, and a whole lot of farcical melodrama: just like the manga that it came from. Well, that's not entirely fair to say because Shigatsu does have a few redeeming qualities.\\n\\n\r\nFor a show that couldn't keep me invested in what was going on for more than five minutes at a time, I must say that the parts where I was actually into what was going on had me on the edge of my seat and despite that Clannad comparison I made earlier, this show actually had me invested in what was going on a lot more than the first season of Clannad could ever hope to. Despite the fact that the show is plagued with bad comedy, laughably pathetic melodrama, and annoying monologues, there will come a powerful scene every so often that would've otherwise left you in tears were it not for the inexcusably flawed execution. On that note, at least Shigatsu did a fair enough job of actually making me care about the characters throughout the entire show as opposed to some of the other things I've watched (i.e. Air, Nagi no Asukara) so it has that going for it as well.\\n\\n\r\nThe production values also showcase what A-1 Pictures is capable of from an audiovisual standpoint. Despite the fact that the animation quality hiccups every now and then, it's remarkably consistent and the amount of effort and detail they put into the musical performances makes them all the more captivating to watch. Speaking of music, the OST is lovely to say the least. I personally find myself liking the first OP the most, mostly because it's quirky, catchy, and makes me eager to watch more of the show despite knowing damn well what's in store for me if I do. I would say something about classical music, but I don't got that much knowledge in that department. I like violins and I like pianos. This show has plenty of tracks with violins and pianos and they sound good to my ears. Therefore, the OST is good. What more do you want me to say?\\n\\n\r\nFinal thoughts? Well... Shigatsu was definitely something I'll keep in mind for a while and whilst it was tedious to get through, it managed to do more than enough right to get a pass from me. With that said, I wouldn't necessarily call this show \"good\" because honestly... there are so many other things out there that do what Shigatsu does and better. I mean, if you want this particular show, go right ahead but I'd hold off on it for a while and try going for something like say...\\n\\n\r\na) White Album 2\\n\r\n- Another romantic drama with music that came out during the fall season. This show puts a lot more focus on the romance than the music, and what's more is that it actually keeps a serious tone throughout the eniter story! Kazusa is easily best girl, by the way\\n\\n\r\nb) Clannad: The Motion Picture (and Clannad: After Story to a greater extent)\\n\r\n- Another story about a guy whose life was changed completely after a fateful encounter with a girl in spring. Within the span of an hour and a half, a story of love, loss, and coping with tragedy is told and is done to a much greater effect than it was done in Shigatsu for various reasons (namely the fact that the entire movie was told from Tomoya and Nagisa's perspective).\\n\\n\r\nYeah, that was a lazy way to shoehorn my alternate show recommendations, but that's what happens when I spend an hour and a half writing up a review for a show that'll probably get downvoted into oblivion anyway. That's all for now though. Feedback's always welcome and with that, I'm out.

            "content": "***SPOILER WARNING: PLOT ELEMENTS & ENDING REVEALED***\r\nYour Lie in April is quite possibly the most disappointing anime that I have ever seen. This is because the series brings you in with gorgeous visuals, fantastic sound work, an interesting concept and elements of delicious suspense, and then lets you down with horrible story execution, insufferable characters, and an ending which makes you want to punch a hole through the screen. I really wanted to like this series, but it just wouldn't let me.\r\nTo get it out of the way, here is how I rated the show:\r\nStory: 3/10\r\nArt: 10/10\r\nSound: 10/10\r\nCharacters: 3/10\r\nEnjoyment: 2/10\r\nOverall: 3/10\r\nI thought about going intodetail on everything wrong, and right, about the series, but I think it would be better if I went into the two things that drag this series down into the pits: Kaori and the \"twist\" ending.\\n\\n\r\nTo begin, Kaori is one of the most terrible female MCs I have ever seen: She is selfish, dishonest, manipulative, abusive, self-righteous and histrionic. She spends the entire series forcing Kousei to relive traumatic experiences just so she can get him to play the piano, either as her accompaniment on-stage or simply for her own amusement, all the while leading him on with mixed signals as she is dating his best friend, a popular jock-type who is almost his exact opposite. She constantly belittles him for doing any little thing she doesn't like, hitting him constantly or talking down to him like a misbehaving child. On occasion, she will be incredibly sweet & endearing towards him while they're hanging out... before eventually ditching him to hang out with her boyfriend.\\n\\n\r\nThis all doesn't necessarily make for a poorly-written character, per se, but what makes this all particularly unpleasant is that her bullshit is presented as though it were a good thing for all parties involved! She is framed as some tsundere goddess with a heart of gold when she is actually just a manipulative teenage bitch with a superiority complex. Talk about cognitive dissonance! Had she been presented in a fashion which was more appropriate for her unpleasant personality, the entire series would have been drastically improved as a result, and she would have, in the end, been a far more compelling and likable character.\\n\\n\r\nWhich brings us to the abysmal ending: It turns out that she was in love with Kousei all along, and only dated his best friend to get close to him, but Kousei doesn't find out about it until after she's already dead.\\n\\n\r\nWhat. The. Fuck.\\n\\n\r\nSo let me get this straight: She spends how many months belittling this poor kid over the trauma he experienced due to the death of his abusive mother by being incredibly abusive herself, playing with his emotions and leading him on the entire time, all while dating a guy she secretly doesn't even like just to subject him to this disgusting behavior... because she was in love with him?! Again: What. The. Fuck. This plot twist and how it was executed instantly made Kaori one of the most unlikable characters imaginable, and ruined what little enjoyment the series could have brought to the table.\\n\\n\r\nNow, had they presented Kaori differently, this twist would have instantly made her a more compelling, sympathetic & endearing character, and made you look at her actions in an entirely different light, especially since harboring such love for Kousei would have seemed antithetical to her personality. Instead, we get a boring-yet-infuriating resolution to a mediocre story that leaves you feeling anything but satisfied.\\n\\n\r\nIn summation: Like I said before, this show had a world of potential, and I really wanted to like it. I thought it would have everything I wanted in a story like this, and started out strong enough to make me anticipate the rest of the series... but then it took a watery shit all over my expectations, leaving me annoyed & dissatisfied in the end.

            "content": "Hers was a white lie built on a grain of truth that snowballed as one lie after the other piled up. At first it was only hers, but then it became something that the two of them shared together \u2013 like a secret, a world upon which no other could encroach. He may have been \u201cFriend A,\u201d and she \u201cthe girl that loves my best friend,\u201d but they were masquerading around a truth that neither one could openly admit because ultimately, the truth was much more painful.\r\nYour Lie in April is a deceitfully masterful series that initially appears light-hearted and colorful, its palette boasting pastelsthat lend to the idea of it being another romantic comedy. Yet the moment we step past the disillusionment that it casts upon us by its false prefaces, we quickly realize that what we have immersed ourselves in is actually a tragedy in the making.\\n\\n\r\nTragic not because of a single element but because of all of its parts, and yet at the end of everything, this isn\u2019t a series about tragedy. It is a series about learning to heal, learning to move on, and learning to accept the parts of ourselves that we\u2019d rather pretend aren\u2019t there. Part of that is accepting that sometimes we need a helping hand to take that first step. Part of it is learning to say goodbye when the time comes.\\n\\n\r\nWhat is so compelling about the storyline is that it\u2019s not merely an adventure into first love, it delves into the reality of post-traumatic stress disorder, childhood abuse, and chronic illness. It doesn\u2019t paint any of these as artistic or tragically beautiful\u2014they are horrible, they twist people, they ruin the best moments, and they have a long-lasting impact.\\n\\n\r\nNo one is completely black-and-white; everyone has their short-comings, fleshed out in full before our eyes. They have their hang-ups, their strengths, their struggles\u2014and it\u2019s in these characters that this series really takes off in full stride. It would be enough for them to be multifaceted with equal amounts of depth, but they take it a step further in painting the reality of youth.\\n\\n\r\nOlder anime fans may critically analyze the series as an unrealistic approach to young teenagers, but that pessimism overlooks the reality of what it was like for us to be that age. We were all that point when we found our first love, when we thought it was forever, when we poured our passion into something that ultimately would not come to fruition or last. That\u2019s what being young is about\u2014and that\u2019s what Your Lie in April gives us. \\n\\n\r\nGranted that it may veer a bit over-dramatic at times in its representation of youth; there are moments of symbolism or hyperbole so overt that the cheesiness makes you shift a little uncomfortably in your seat (but I promise it\u2019s not enough to gag you). Given that this is, however, a rather common trope that runs in series with heavier themes, it\u2019s not necessarily a huge setback for an otherwise solid series. In the end, it is intended to be a fictional representation that conveys more than just what can be summarized in a few sentences or less.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound is completely on point, and the soundtrack artfully matches the emotions intended to be represented in each scene. From the actual classical music to the opening and ending, everything fits in like a jigsaw puzzle to give a full, satisfying final piece. When the characters analyze someone\u2019s playing as harsh, rigid, and stilted, we can hear this\u2014whether we are knowledgeable about music or not. Your Lie in April conveys emotion to us not just visually but aurally as well.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is wonderful with bright, vibrant colors that bring the characters fully to life. There is an amazing, visually perceivable transition for the characters as time passes, particularly in regards to Kaori as the series moves on. It occasionally has some stilted moments but nothing outrageously noticeable to detract from the overall quality.\\n\\n\r\nUltimately, Your Lie in April is a story that starts out of the gates moving a bit slowly, but the pace matches the tone of the series. Structurally, it is a solid story of youth that dramatizes some aspects but never distracts from the intended message. On top of its other strong points, it\u2019s aurally and visually a joy to the senses \u2013 and to anyone appreciative of a series willing to realistically approach the conflict of childhood abuse and the resulting trauma in a positive way. It\u2019s not without a few setbacks, but in the end, Your Lie in April fashions itself to be a stand-out romance series that reminds us that while some relationships may be transient and brief, some people will come into our lives at just the right time for just long enough to touch us in a way we never thought possible.\\n",

            "content": "From a quick glance at all the other top reviews, this series seems to be one that many people rave about. While there's certainly qualities in this show that are really good, I found myself rather unimpressed to be brutally honest.\r\nStory - 3/10\r\nKousei Arima was a prodigy at playing the piano. He dominated every competition on a regular basis by playing the music perfectly as it was intended by the composer. He was so dominant to the point where he became famous among child and adult musicians alike. However, after the death of his mother (who was also his instructor), he was unable to copewith it and eventually lost the ability to hear the piano. He then quit shortly after. For the next couple of years, the world around him became dull and lifeless aside from a couple of his friends, until he met this extremely cheerful violinist, Kaori Miyazono. She revealed to him a side and style of music he never knew existed, and eventually convinced him to give the piano another shot.\\n\\n\r\nThe premise doesn't sound too bad. In fact, the way it handles the romance plot is pretty unique. It isn't just simply your typical boy meets girl and then they eventually confess, blah blah; there's a lot more to it than that. It focuses more on Kousei's development as a result of Kaori's carefree happy-go-lucky personality. The story is told primarily in Kousei's point of view, and likewise the plot revolves somewhat around him. Other characters do get screen time as well, though, and occasionally we do hear their take on things too. \\n\\n\r\nA big thing that really makes the story stand out (in the first half, particularly) is how it portrays the music. Why do we play music? Who are you playing for? What message are you trying to convey? Music isn't just there to pleasure your ears, it's used as a tool to speak from the heart. Who you are as a person, what you've gone through, and what you strive for are all expressed in how you play music. The notes may be the same, but the feel of the song can vastly vary with the way people play it. In other words, you take the music and make it your own. The way this narrative and message are pushed is rather distinct and effective in my eyes, and it was one of the few things that kept me captivated throughout the series.\\n\\n\r\nDespite how well this all is presented, there were still quite a lot of flaws, particularly in its execution of several storyline elements.\\n\\n\r\nMelodrama. It's alright to have it in moderation (it\u2019s a show about teenagers after all- there\u2019s bound to be at least some), but it was taken to a whole other level in this show. Almost every episode contains at least one overreaction to an event, almost to the point where it became hard to really feel the proper emotion you were supposed to in the particular scene. There were some instances where this was properly used and was actually beneficial to what was going on, but more often than not, I found myself cringing and unable to relate to the character(s) at all.\\n\\n\r\nPacing. The pacing of this show was all over the place, but generally speaking, it was so slow to the point where it felt like it was beating a dead horse. Literally, I could look up the word \"monologuing\" in the dictionary and find the cover art of YLIA. Episode after episode, there was an absurd amount of redundant soliloquy to the point where it became hard to watch. Again, as the saying goes: \"everything in moderation\". Internal monologue isn't inherently a bad thing, but it starts to parody itself when it gets overused. Thanks to stuff like this, it takes longer than it needs to for things to get going and actually progress.\\n\\n\r\nLastly, there's the comedy. Quality of comedy in general is unquestionably subjective (personally I didn't find a whole lot of it funny, but that's just me), but that's not where the issue lies. My gripe with it is that it was terribly misplaced. You're in the middle of this deep, sad scene, and then all of a sudden you're slapped in the face with comedic relief that doesn't fit the scene at all. To put it bluntly, it kills the mood. \\n\\n\r\nThe story had a LOT of potential. I, like many others, was hooked at the beginning, but found it harder to watch as the show goes on. It really makes me wish that this was a 12 episode anime instead so that things didn't overstay their welcome.\\n\\n\r\nArt/Animation - 7/10\\n\\n\r\nThe art in this show fits the feel of it really well. The characters designs are rather unique; they each all have full lips rather than a simple line like you see in almost every anime nowadays, and it's little subtleties like this that adds a sense of realism to the show. The brightness of the setting also appropriately fits each situation. The color palette often fits the mood of the scene very well; it's colorful and bright when things are more lively, dark and dull when things are more depressing, so on and so forth. The actual art itself isn't bad either. Animation was pretty solid and up to par with today's standards, but occasionally it was less than stellar.\\n\\n\r\nSound - 8/10\\n\\n\r\nNow, I'm not a fan of classical music at all. I don't necessarily hate it, it's just not my bread and butter, but I've started to open up to it a lot more than I originally was. The OST is nice and really adds to the emotions that the specific scene is trying to convey. The solo performances are especially good for reasons I've already touched upon. I'm also a personal fan of the OPs and EDs, both of which suit the show well. Not much else to say here, really. It's just solid all around, which is important for a show like this.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 4/10\\n\\n\r\nAs a romance and drama, the characters really are the backbone of the entire show. With the slower pacing, the characters get added depth, which is critical for a show like this to do. I must say, it did a fine job in that aspect. Many characters had their own backstory (although there are a few issues with this that I\u2019ll get to), and there aren't many one-dimensional characters that get major screen time. Most importantly, they all have likable qualities about them that make them endearing to the audience, creating an emotional bond between us and them.\\n\\n\r\nSomething that I felt was handled rather well was the development of Kousei. Being the main character, it's pretty important for him to be fully fleshed out, and thankfully he is. He starts out as a mopey, depressing, and generally dull kid, but gradually develops into something much more. After losing his mother, he really had no reason to play music. All he ever knew was to play it perfectly as the composer intended, and for the purpose of pleasing his mom. Enter Kaori. Her unique style of playing opened up Kousei's eyes in a big way, and inspired him to take up music again. His journey together with Kaori and friends has been helping him break out of his shell, and his progression bit by bit was superb.\\n\\n\r\nWhile I'm singing a lot of praise here, you'll notice the score I gave is again rather mediocre. Hear me out.\\n\\n\r\nMany of the side characters were pointless; their development overall pretty much either served no purpose and/or wasn't done well. Often times, instead of adding to the story, their screen time swayed away from the main plotline which is not how it's supposed to work. Yes, I understand that people might think it's nice and cute to see someone else's story every now and then, but again, the issues I have are 1) it sways the show away from the main narrative without connecting to it at all, and 2) the way these characters are handled just feels half-assed when compared to how well Kousei is developed. If this were a longer show where separate characters could have their own little mini-arcs, I feel like this would have been handled much better, but obviously that wouldn't be possible for a shorter seasonal anime.\\n\\n\r\nAnother thing -- Kaori. This is kind of tied into the pacing, which I also touched upon earlier. She never really received significant development until the very end of the show. Up until that point, she's nothing but a mere plot device used to stir up drama. For the duration of 21 episodes, she was just a cute girl that's meant to be likable and appeal to the audience, but with no depth whatsoever. It would have helped substantially to show her insight on the status quo as the show went on.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 4/10\\n\\n\r\nNeedless to say, I didn't enjoy this anime a whole lot. There are redeeming qualities that I'm not going to overlook out of blind hate, but overall, this just wasn't for me.\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 4/10\\n\\n\r\nIn my opinion, this anime doesn't deserve to be rated as high as it is. Again, it's not the worst thing I've ever seen; there's several redeeming qualities, and I can completely understand why someone else would enjoy it. However, to be honest, it seems pretty undeserving to be holding the #13 spot overall at the time this review was written.\\n\\n\r\nI'll try to sum it up as simply as I can: for more \"intellectual\" (for lack of a better word) viewers who care more about logic and technicalities, stay clear. As a show catered for a younger audience, it\u2019s very clear more effort was put on style rather than substance, and that can make it frustrating to watch. For more casual viewers just looking to bathe in their feels, this is definitely worth a look. There are some quirky characters here that you might enjoy, and the relationship between Kousei and Kaori is definitely one that might leave a lasting impact on you.",

            "content": "\"Did I reach you? I hope I did.\" \r\nI nearly skipped this gem just because of the music tag. Not really big into music anime but somehow the art dragged me into watching the first few episodes. First episode was an average episode with few interesting plot lines. But the second episode was the hook. Irony. The tag that made me nearly skip this anime was the one that kept me in it. The music, the music... THE MUSIC.. what can I say? It was just right down my taste. Never in my life did I thought of \"oh hey let's listen to some classicalmusic\" but this anime opened a new taste in music in me. And I'm grateful for that. \\n\\n\r\nThe first half and second half have clear differences with a very smooth pacing and objectives in mind. Some may say the pacing was slow and sometimes it felt that a point is being dragged out for long. As much as I understand where they are coming from, I feel that this series took the right amount of time to build up for the many impact full moments that is present. The inner monologues that the series loves to do felt right to display the conflicts that our characters are fighting with. Also, the conflicts dealt with are very realistic and people can very much relate to them. I happen to be one of them being able to relate to our main male protagonist. \\n\\n\r\nThe cast of characters in this show is pretty high. As a 22 episode anime, I think it did an excellent job portraying those characters. As most animes, not all the characters were fully fleshed out, and I didn't expect it to do so. The ones that mattered most were developed beautifully. Besides, nearly everyone's thought process were clear, motivations/purpose in tact and passion which shone through. \\n\\n\r\nSound is something that I will not even talk about since it is subjective. The main reason, however, that I will not dive deeper is because for me, it was perfect. I couldn't have asked for anything more. \\n\\n\r\nAnimation wise. Throughout the whole series, it was standard stuff from A-1 Pictures. It did have some drop from time to time, especially during the comedy segments, which I didn't find distracting but it wasn't great to say the least. Animation stood out where it counts. Those performances. I would have been really been disappointed if the animation was average in those moments, because of how beautiful the soundtracks are. But A-1 delivered, and they both complimented each other outstandingly. \\n\\n\r\nBy the end of the series, I was just left in awe, and honestly a bit (extremely) emotional. To compare, the 'feels' in this series (my opinion) surpasses the highly praised Clannad: After Story for one simple reason. I was just slightly more attached to the relationship our main characters shared than I was with Clannad. But the story is not about tragedy. It's about inspiration, passion, moving forward, family, friendship, helping each other (many more). It is about life and how hard it can be to carry on, but you still gotta do it. You still gotta live your life to your fullest.\\n\\n\r\n\"If you can't move with your hands then play with your feet! If you don't have enough fingers, then use your nose as well! Whether you're sad, you're a mess, or you've hit rock bottom, you still have to play! That's how people like us survive.\" - Kaori Miyazono. \\n\\n\r\nOverall 9.4/10. \\n\\n",

            "content": "My Thursdays won't be the same after finishing this anime. Shigatsu has taken me to a world of music that I will never forget.\r\nEven though the story isn't anything new, the way it was written and directed make it feel like one. It is a story that revolves around music and how it connects people and how it affects them. It does not only affect them in a good way, but in a bad way too. And with that premise, a beautiful story about tennagers started.\r\nAlthough there were some characters that didn't get a proper development to know and understand their own problems, motivations, anddreams, they didn't feel empty and meaningless. They all had a purpose and most of them where helpful to our main characters. They didn't feel clich\u00e9 neither, even when we got some of them like the childhood friend and the dandy best-friend. And the best part, at least to me, is that there was no fan-service. \\n\\n\r\nI didn't get to see a flaw in the animation in the 22 episodes aired. The palette of colours used, especially the blue ones, were gorgeous, while the performance moments were dynamic and realistic. Not to mention the opening and ending sequences, which are to date some of my favourites of all time.\\n\\n\r\nAdd to this a beautiful ost and amazing songs for the openings and endings and you'll feel in heaven. The opening songs were upbeat and represented a good tonal contrast to the story, while the ending songs complemented it, especially the second one, which can make you cry (if you were not crying already) after the emotional final episodes.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, this anime has been one of the bests I've ever seen. It hooked me since the first teaser, and never let me go until the last episode. It is not a hard story, so everyone can enjoy it as much as I did. With loveable and relatable characters with deep stories, a gorgeous animation and an amazing score, I'm pretty sure that this is one of the best anime from the past few years, and the best (TO ME) of this season. I can recommend this show to anyone who want to watch and experience a good, heart-warming romance anime.",

            "content": "**SPOILER FREE REVIEW**\r\nThe latest romantic-comedy/drama to take the anime world by storm is a little project known as Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso, or as many people know it, \u201cYour Lie in April\u201d. YLA has been the talk of the last two seasons as it has managed to captivate audiences around the world with its unbelievably bright colors and fantastic musical score complete with both famous classical pieces and original hits. However, if there is one thing about this show that people can\u2019t help but gorge themselves on, it\u2019s the melodrama. That\u2019s right folks: a romantic show contains MELODRAMA! Try to contain your surprise! Sinceintense over-exaggeration is virtually the only way to make shows like this interesting, know that I\u2019m willing to overlook melodrama to a certain degree\u2026 But not to THIS degree. Ladies and gentlemen: Do you think you know monologuing? Oh ho ho, you\u2019re about to.\\n\\n\r\nSynopsis: Kousei Arima is a former piano-playing prodigy; he was the best player alive for his young age until some serious mental trauma forced him to quit. He has refused to touch a musical instrument ever again, until he meets an eccentric girl named Kaori Miyazano; the girl who would change his life forever.\\n\\n\r\nYLA got off to a charming start with a great comedic focus while still hinting at a sufficiently dramatic backstory. In combination with the previously mentioned art and music, this anime showed promise. By the time the breathtaking violin performance in episode 2 had finished, pretty much everyone was hooked on this show, and understandably so. However, it didn\u2019t take long for it to divulge into one of the most laughable and overly drawn-out excuses for a narrative I\u2019ve ever seen. This show is about 10% original content and about 90% REPEATING THAT SAME CONTENT. Over and over and over and over and over and over again! You\u2019d think it was a parody of an anime drama rather than an actual iteration into the genre if you didn\u2019t know any better. This anime should have been 12 episodes TOPS, especially considering all the pointless side characters that serve no purpose. Instead, we get an anime that is just monologuing on top of monologuing episode after episode. You REALLY have to slog to get through all of it. I find it hard to pay attention to a show that\u2019s just going to spell everything out for me a million times; ever hear of subtlety? SHOW. Don\u2019t tell.\\n\\n\r\nThat\u2019s not to say that the drama is all that bad when they actually decide to advance the plot though. There are several instances of legitimately investing and interesting storytelling in this anime, but it\u2019s too few and far between be worthy of any real praise. Not to mention that it is constantly interrupted by inopportune comedy during or immediately following a dramatic moment. The strange thing is that the comedy can be pretty good too; this show has gotten more than one chuckle out of me. The problem lies in the directing, which is causing these elements to work against each other rather than cooperatively. Instead of adding another dimension to the show, the comedy merely dulls the edge of the more important dimension, and that\u2019s obviously a major problem.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters aren\u2019t necessarily bad, but I found them to be pretty poorly handled overall. Kousei, for example, is inconsistent. He will tell the audience how he feels about the SAME thing in SAME way over and over and over again, but there are also times when we should know what he is thinking and simply don\u2019t. For example, it\u2019s nonsensical how the most minor of exchanges will stick with him throughout the entire show and be monologued about dozens of times, but then major interactions between him and anybody not named Kaori are instantly forgotten even when they should be having a major impact on him. Kousei is an okay character, but his backstory is really the only thing that defines him. I was personally more partial to his best friend, Tsubaki, whose alternate perspective of having to deal with a struggling friend is often more interesting than the person who is actually suffering. \\n\\n\r\nKaori, on the other hand, really held the show back in my opinion. Yes she\u2019s cute, yes her violin performance was the best scene of the show, and yes she is the source of lots of drama. The problem is that she is treated a lot more like a plot device and a lot less like a character. With all the monologuing that goes on in this show, can someone explain to me why we never find out Kaori\u2019s true feelings in regards to so many events? Where exactly does her love of music come from? How does it motivate her? What are her specific feelings on Kousei at various intervals in the show? What about Watari? We don\u2019t know until the final episode of the show so we can pretend that all this vital information which we desperately need to get invested in her is some sort of Shyamalan twist; it's completely immature and ineffective. Kaori simply shows up, does whatever she needs to do to create drama, then leaves. She is the weakest character in the show and a big reason why I found the romance to be poorly executed and completely one-sided. I never felt like I knew this person.\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion, Your Lie in April is a cheesy drama loaded with inopportune comedy and cringe-worthy dialogue. It has its moments and the musical score/animation are wonderful, but bad directing and the lack of so much as an ounce of subtlety killed it. If you\u2019re one of those mushy-gushy drama lovers, I really can\u2019t recommend against this show since its flaws aren\u2019t too much more egregious than what you would normally see, but if not, I don\u2019t think you need to go out of your way to watch it by any means.",

            "content": "Making use of a calm, vibrant palette, Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso begins by depicting a mysterious blonde chasing after a black cat. Weirdly enough, it feels like it's meaningful; each camera angle is loose and meticulously timed, and the cuts between don't hinder the flow. I soon came to realize, however, that the problems lie not in the execution, but the narrative; so much so that it ends up being more of an eye-catcher than a drama. \r\nThe struggles musicians face are apparent for most: Writer's block, commitment, or even becoming notable are some of the most common examples of these. Arima's struggles, onthe other hand, are quite different. Ever since the death of his abusive mother, he's been too traumatized to hear his own playing. But when he meets the aforementioned blonde, Kaori, that all changes. Dubbed love at first sight, the series documents the ongoings of Arima and Kaori as they succumb to the world of music. By itself, this is no problem, but by introducing these characters minutes apart, we're given no time to really understand either of them. Instead, the viewer learns of Arima's past through an intrusive series of flashbacks throughout. Placing these sequences in the middle of recitals and performances disregards any tension that they may have created in the first place. Because of this, winning or losing doesn't matter; it's unsatisfying and hard to care either way. \\n\\n\r\nSadly, this isn't the only problem Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso faces. The dialogue feels like that of a middle school creative writing project, and when combined with a healthy amount of melodrama, it's hard not to laugh in ridicule each time Arima whines about his \"monotone\" life. In fact, it's a challenge to take this seriously. Each episode is filled with around ten or more minutes of these monologues, and in the end, it feels mostly redundant; a way to drag out the length of the series. The rest of the cast isn't even as lucky \u2013 the only information we get about them is regarding their past tragedies or to further the annoyingly weak symbolism regarding growing up. Since every major character is about 14, any appeal to emotion through dialogue only comes off as disposable and pretentious teenage angst. Constant similes are made regarding the texture and flavour of any musical performance, but they sound completely hilarious and synesthetic (\"The smell of chalk. [\u2026] The faint breathing of someone asleep.\"). There's even some comedy here and there, but it's incredibly unfunny and gets in the way of the little drama that's left - by portraying gags with brief changes in artstyle,  the otherwise appealing consistency of the animation is interrupted. It might be welcome in a comedy series, but why is it here?\\n\\n\r\nDespite my other complaints, the OST itself is fairly interesting. While the arrangements of traditional classical pieces are nothing to get too excited about, they're nice enough to listen to for   a few minutes while trudging through the rest of the show. Arima's disjointed playing isn't always welcome, though, as some parts sound a little too horrible. Even deaf musicians of his skill level and tenure should be unable to play that badly when given basic theory lessons. The OST itself consists of mostly ambient music to build tension, but it isn't anything too extraordinary \u2013 any fan of electronic music should find most of these tracks dull and utterly forgettable. The OP, on the other hand, is something that kept me watching each week; Goose House's acoustic  harmonies really set the mood for the show, and I dare say that nothing else in the series lives up to it. \\n\\n\r\nAs a package, Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso is bloated and gimmicky to the point of exhaustion, but it's decent entertainment nonetheless. The main storyline doesn't even progress for eleven episodes. It's like a Pitchfork r\u00e9sum\u00e9. If you're looking for a pretty experience and not too much more, you should definitely give the series a try \u2014 maybe even marathon it now that it's over!",

            "content": "If you don't want to read, then there\u2019s a tl;dr at the end, as well as a tl;dr for every section.\r\nShigatsu wa Kimi no Uso, or Your Lie in April, is 24-episode anime that started airing in October 2014, and ended in March 2015. Since its end, it has been a subject of hot debate on this site. Usually there are 2 types of people for any controversial show, those who love it to no end, and those who flat out despise it.  I personally am somewhere on the fence.\r\nNow is it the best anime ever? No. Is it bad? Definitely not. Then whatexactly is Shigatsu?\\n\\n\r\nWell, at its core Shigatsu is a story about a boy(Arima Kousei) who used to be a fantastic pianist at a young age. Unfortunately, during his growth, he lost his mother, something that left him unable to hear the piano ever again. Or at least until he met a violinist named Kaori Miyazono, who tries to help him return to music.\\n\\n\r\nWell, that\u2019s the basis of the story. Now onto the review.\\n\\n\r\nStory:- 6/10\\n\\n\r\nThe story of Shigatsu has both good and bad sides to it. Before we delve into the bad, let\u2019s take a look at the good.\\n\\n\r\nThe story, as you would normally expect, has a lot of romance, which is done pretty well. The romance in Shigatsu, is very heartfelt at times and also very fun at other times. The story tries to maintain a perfect balance of comedy and real romance, which does work, most of the time.\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately, this show is also a melodrama, which is the bad part. The drama in this show apparently got many people teary-eyed, but, I have a hard time believing that. The show tries way too hard to make you feel some \u201cfeels\u201d, and pretty much drops flat on its face. The show constantly tries to shove its drama in your face, from episode 13 onwards, and it gets annoying at times. Before episode 13, it still had some dramatic moments, but those were much better done, showing Kousei\u2019s inner fears.\\n\\n\r\nAs I previously mentioned, the show is filled with comedy, romance, and now, drama. When you but all these in a blender what do you get? Well if the blender was a good one, then you might get something amazing. But this wasn\u2019t a good blender. Instead what we got was a drink with a beautiful exterior, but a bad aftertaste.\\n\\n\r\nSince Shigatsu thinks it\u2019s a drama, but also tries to make time for comedy and romance, we get painfully abrupt scenes of melodrama, followed closely by comedy, which does not fit at all.\\n\\n\r\nOne second we might be seeing a person die, and the other we see Kousei getting kicked by his \u201cnot-girlfriend\u201d, Tsubaki.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of which, the romance aspect isn\u2019t flawless either. Somewhere during the time that the show was trying to find what genre it belongs to, we got a love-triangle. Now, it really isn\u2019t as bad as I make it sound, but it\u2019s still a bit clich\u00e9 at times. Boy A loves Girl A, Girl A loves Boy B, Girl B loves Boy A, and Boy B doesn\u2019t give a shit.\\n\\n\r\nThe romance isn\u2019t complex but it still does get stale at times.\\n\\n\r\nBut, for as much as I railed on the story, it has one saving grace. The ending. The final episode is probably the best part of this anime, in my opinion. It\u2019s a simple monologue by the female lead, Kaori. But it\u2019s so beautifully written that I couldn\u2019t help but be engrossed by it.\\n\\n\r\nTL;DR for STORY : The story has pretty good romance, which gets slightly stale near the middle. The excess of melodrama mixed with the comedy is probably the biggest flaw of the story, since those are two genres that should be implemented far away from each other. But, no matter how many flaws it has, its ending is beautiful in every way possible. Great writing, good background music, very good voice acting, and beautiful art. Speaking of art, let\u2019s move on to the next section.\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt and Animation:- 9/10\\n\\n\r\nThe art of Shigatsu is probably the best part of it. It changes according to the mood of the scene, and fits the overall feel of the show. It\u2019s very bright most of the time, and it everything ranging from the night sky to the school playground look gorgeous.\\n\\n\r\nThe character designs for the main characters are well done, and easily recognizable. The adults were also very well designed, to a point that you could actually guess their age. The only flaw I see with the character design are the children. It might just be me, but it\u2019s weird to see children who have buttons for eyes, which makes them stand out in comparison to the rest of the cast.\\n\\n\r\nMost of the time the animation is very fluent, and everything moves very nicely. The performance scenes are where the real budget went though. Accompanied with great music, it uses CGI for the piano, and extremely fluent animation for the violin. The CGI is a bit odd, and does stick out sometimes, but it did not distract from the focus of the scene, the performance.\\n\\n\r\nTL;DR for ART : The art in Shigatsu is the best part of it, with a hefty use of colors, and a very bright scenery which changes according to the mood and feel of the scene. Most of the character designs are pretty good, besides the children in the show. The animation is fluent for the most part, and the performance scenes were amazing. Even though the CGI piano was a bit jarring at times, it didn\u2019t distract me from what really mattered in the scene, the music.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound:- 8/10\\n\\n\r\nBeing an anime focused around music, one would normally think that the music of the show should be its strongest point, including me. But no, that\u2019s sadly not the case.\\n\\n\r\nTowards the beginning the performances were all amazing with the focus remaining solely on the performance and nothing else. But this is soon forgotten in the latter half of the show. The music itself is very good, or at least as much of the music I could hear. \\n\\n\r\nThe performances(in the latter half) are constantly interrupted by monologues, which are meant to bring up the drama, but instead come off as a distraction and an annoyance. Most of the performances I was yelling at the screen \u201cStop talking! I\u2019m trying to listen to the brilliance that you\u2019re playing!\u201d. I personally am a fan of classical music, so when someone talks over it, I get very annoyed, and feel like punching a hole through the screen.\\n\\n\r\nThat being said, the overall soundtrack of the show, excluding the performances, was pretty good. Although no song really stood out to me.\\n\\n\r\nThe voice actors also do their jobs pretty well, with all of the voices fitting the characters. Especially Kaori and Kousei\u2019s voice actors.\\n\\n\r\nBut of course, nothing in the show can top it\u2019s masterful opening. Opening 1(Hikaru Nara), is probably one of the best openings I\u2019ve ever heard in a while. The second opening(Nanairo Symphony) while not as good, was still great. Both endings were also pretty well done, but the second ending(Orange) is the better of the two.\\n\\n\r\nTL;DR for MUSIC : The show should focus on music, but instead many of the performances are spoken over for the majority of the time. The show tried to bring drama into the mix again (by talking over the performances) but failed horribly in this case. The soundtrack of the show is pretty good, and the voice actors do the characters justice. Its openings and endings are few of the best of 2014, and Opening 1 is one of my favorite openings of all time.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:- 5/10\\n\\n\r\nThis is where Shigatsu really fails. It\u2019s not that there isn\u2019t any character development, but certain characters, who needed development, didn\u2019t get any. I\u2019ll start with the good.\\n\\n\r\nKousei: He\u2019s probably the character who is best developed throughout the entire show. After meeting Kaori, he starts to regain his will to play music, and starts to overcome his fears. Many other characters, including Kaori, act as foils in his development, like his friends, teacher, his rivals, and even his pupil. His development is the one that got the most focus in the entire story, but maybe even too much.\\n\\n\r\nKaori: This is where I feel that the characters fail. Since I can\u2019t talk too much about Kaori without spoilers, I\u2019ll be as careful as possible to avoid spoiling anything. Kaori is probably the character who had the most potential to develop, but instead, she was used as a mere plot device. Something to simply be present to help Kousei grow. While I did praise Kousei\u2019s development, it\u2019s not worth sacrificing the development of another character that could\u2019ve grown into so much more. In fact, she was probably the character who I loved the most in the entire show, so I was extremely disappointed to see her get sidelined as a plot device with no depth at all.\\n\\n\r\nTsubaki: She\u2019s the other main female lead, and the other love interest of Kousei. In other words Girl B. She also played a large role in Kousei\u2019s development, but here, unlike Kaori, she also got some development. While she didn\u2019t get a lot of development, she was still the second-most developed character in the show, which was a step in the right direction.\\n\\n\r\nOther Characters: Most of the other characters are just treated as side characters, but some of them are developed. In fact Kousei\u2019s rivals and his pupil, all get some development, which was nice to see.\\n\\n\r\nTL;DR for CHARACTERS: The entire story of Shigatsu seems to focus on both Kousei and Kaori, but in fact it focuses just on Kousei. He is developed the most throughout the show, while Kaori gets the shortest possible end of the stick. Her development was expected, but it never came to be. The other characters sometimes got some development, and the other female love interest also got some development.\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:- 8/10\\n\\n\r\nAs much as I might rag on the show, and no matter how many flaws I point out in it, I still thoroughly enjoyed it. Yes, some characters got on my nerves, and the performances were really disappointing when someone talked over them, but even with all those flaws, I still enjoyed watching it.\\n\\n\r\nMost of the time I was engrossed by the beautiful exterior of the show, and at other times, I was yelling at the characters to stop talking over the music. But, it was still a fun ride.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nPros:\\n\r\n+ Great animation.\\n\r\n+ Brilliant Openings and Endings\\n\r\n+ A beautiful ending\\n\r\n+ A well developed main lead, and a likable cast of characters.\\n\r\n+ Enjoyable, if you don\u2019t try to notice the flaws.\\n\\n\r\nCons:\\n\r\n- Terribly developed female lead, with a ton of misused potential\\n\r\n- Performances were often talked over\\n\r\n- Story tries way too hard to be a drama, but in reality is just a mediocre melodrama\\n\\n\\n\r\nTL;DR for OVERALL:\\n\\n\r\nOverall, the anime definitely isn\u2019t bad, but it doesn\u2019t know what it wants to be. It thinks it\u2019s a drama and tries to act like one, but it had much more potential as a simple romance. If it wanted to be a drama, then it didn\u2019t need to add so much comic relief at every second. It keeps trying to get tears out of you, but it tries way too hard to do so. The characters were also something that needed a lot of work, with Kaori being one of the most misused characters in the show.\\n\\n\r\nOn the plus side, the anime looks gorgeous, and it has some of the best openings of all time, along with performances that could\u2019ve been much better, but were still very well done. The final episode is also a very good part of the show, meaning that the show has a brilliant ending.\\n\\n\r\nIn the end, it\u2019s not a masterpiece, nor is it garbage. It\u2019s a good experience, that I can recommend watching.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7.2/10",

            "content": "This series is overrated. It peaked my interest when I saw it on the front page at the highest rated anime on this site. I thought to myself this was worth a watch, I definitely won't be disappointed since the top rated anime here pretty much deserve to be there. How wrong was I.\r\nLet me first start by saying this series is melodramatic, slow-paced and cliched as hell. We have Arima Kousei, a depressed and traumatized 14-year-old pianist prodigy who lost his abusive mother two years prior to the story. The anime may come off as an anime that focuses a lot on music, butmusic is merely a sub-genre here. If you're watching this anime just for the music, you will be disappointed more than me. I couldn't symphatize with any of the characters in the story, it was pretty much predictable all the time. The romance is pretty below par too. \\n\\n\r\nWe're introduced to two rivals early in the story, but that's about it, they don't really have any impact or effect the main character in anyway. They end up being just mere acquaintances by the end. They tried to redeem his horrible mother whiched failed miserably. Characters are crying all the time, then they bring out a loli in the middle of the series with nothing to add to the story, just a mandatory irrelevant loli which seems to be a running occurance in every anime now. The main character barely develops during the story, he doesn't really accomplish anything in the musical world during the 22-episode course of the series, we're constantly having flashbacks about his past and how horrible his mother was to him. The dialogue in the series sounded too poetic and cheesy most of the time, and we're are constantly thrown life quotes at us, which was funny to me considering the main characters are 14-year-olds.\\n\\n\r\nOf course it has its strong points too. The animation really flows well with the series and while I'm not a fan of classical music, I must say I enjoyed the music being played throughout the series. But that doesn't exclude the fact that there are hundreds of anime out there with the same school drama setting with teenagers as main characters. This series ain't no Clannad, it just tries too hard. The main girls all seem to have a thing for the main character, but I didn't feel much romance effect here. The story was all about Arima coming out of his depressed self and back to the real world again. The ending wasn't really a tearjerker, as I predicted it way before during the course of the series, so there was no element of surprise here.\\n\\n\r\nOverall I can't say I particuarly enjoyed the series nor would I recommend it to others. I guess I COULD recommend it to someone who is particuarly interested in music, but then I'd also would recommend K-ON as well. It isn't a masterpiece like people are constantly saying. It's not bad but it's not good either - just average.",

            "content": "TL;DR A not unenjoyable series with some fantastic musical performances, that unfortunately suffers from forced drama, shallow characters, a drawn out, surprisingly predictable story & a tendency to have characters talk at length about what the music being played expresses rather than let us listen & hear it for ourselves. If you're looking for a tearjerker that will do everything short of poke you in the eye to get those tears flowing, Your Lie in April (YliA) might be for you. If you're looking for something more, you might want tosearch elsewhere.\r\n Music is the food of love. Something like that, anyway. It is certainlyused by many as a means of expressing emotions in ways they cannot put into words. Indeed you'll find few things that people (at least teenagers) will identify so strongly with as a favourite song or a passion for playing. But what might it take to kill that passion in someone? & if you met someone who had lost their love for music, what would it take to bring it back? These are the questions YliA sets out to answer & asks you to come with it. (Note that while I don't consider anything discussed a meaningful spoiler, you may think otherwise)\\n\\n\r\nThe boy for whom the music died is Kousei Arima, a gifted & renowned pianist as a child but having lost all passion or even the ability to play since the death of his (psychotic) mother. Now he just wiles away the days, transcribing sheet music & hanging out with his childhood friends Tsubaki  Sawabe & Ryouta Watari, stuck in that awkward period when no longer a child but not yet ready to be an adult. Then one day, in a scene that pays homage to Laputa: Castle in the Sky, he meets Kaori Miyazono, the carefree girl who he can't take his eyes off & who quickly takes it upon herself to break Kousei out of his shell & bring back his passion for music, whether he wants to or not. \\n\\n\r\nIf there is one rule that anime frustratingly breaks all too often, it's that of show, don't tell. Specifically, that it is better to show something through action rather than through exposition. YliA is full of this. Musical performances are an important part of the story & used as a means for the characters to work through internally whatever their \u201cthing\u201d at that point is, be it determination to prove that they're better than the competition or, often in Kousei's case, trying to overcome his personal demons so he can play. Musical performance, particularly of classical pieces with different sections & phrases that allow for the expression of different emotions, is a perfect for this. The actual performances in YliA are fantastic, with a range of Chopin & other classical pieces (although a little more variety or more well known pieces might have been appreciated) performed to a high standard but also in such a way that it mirrors the emotions of the performer, which is impressive considering we're watching cartoon characters play a cartoon piano. Indeed the music, both the original pieces & those by classical composers, is most certainly the strongest point of YliA.\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately, in almost every performance the music plays for about 20-30 seconds before someone's internal monologue starts talking all over it, usually as a form of very long winded exposition explaining what the performer is feeling. This isn't always a bad thing. When it accompanies more surreal visual expressions of the performers emotional state, such as when Kousei is playing only to find himself apparently enveloped in water & unable to hear the music, having his inner thoughts accompany the scene can add to it. However, more often than not our listening is simply interrupted by a still shot of the someone's head while they talk in detail about what we'd be able to hear & see for ourselves if only we were allowed to. \\n\\n\r\nIt's made all the more frustrating on the few occasions, such as the duet between Kousei & Nagi Aiza, where the exposition is kept to a relative minimum & the music allowed to just play, letting us see the two characters play off each other as they start with a fairly pedestrian rendition before gradually raising the tension in the scene as they both start to play off of & try to outdo the other. It just makes the scene that much more enjoyable to be allowed to just follow the performance without having someone talk over it to tell you what you could be listening to. Likewise the final performance, which I won't spoil, suffice to say that it is a nearly nine minute performance where everything comes together to produce a genuinely engrossing piece of animation. The high point is a nearly three minute part where no words are heard, with everything expressed simply by the facial expressions & body movements of Kousei & Kaori as they play together. If only the same could be said of all that came prior.\\n\\n\r\nThis may well simply be due to a mixture of practical constraints (animating multiple 5-10minute performance at a consistent quality can't be easy or cheap) & a hangover from the manga where, of course, there's no music to accompany the panels. It would be more forgiveable if it wasn't for the additional problem that the scriptwriter/author/translator seem to have a false sense of their own literary prowess, writing with a \u201cwhy say it in a sentence when a metaphor laden paragraph will do?\u201d approach. The use of poetic language isn't a problem in itself, but the characters monologues just go on & on, spouting simile after metaphor, often to the point that  it's hard not to be somewhat taken out of the moment. Kousei is a repeat offender of this, often unable to think about anything without employing multiple mixed metaphors. It doesn't help that despite all the words, the characters in YliA don't really think about much. Kousei monologues about his (abusive) mum & Kaori; Kaori about Kousei & music; Tsubaki about Kousei & childhood; & Watari about nothing because he's a plot device, not a character.\\n\\n\r\nIn fact all the cast in YliA are surprisingly shallow characters considering all they have to say. Watari just exists so there is someone in the way of Kousei & Kaori having a romantic relationship (because she's gotta stay on that pedestal, after all), playing no meaningful role beyond that. Tsibaki is the childhood friend & third corner of the triangle that every romance must have, while her boyfriend/senior Saito & classmate Kashiwagi are just there so she can talk to someone about her feelings for Kousei  other than the audience. Kousei's mum is just a (very abusive) albatross hanging around his neck that he needs to shed in order to move on from his childhood, & Kaori herself is ultimately only there to first encourage him out of his past & then her own misfortune to make him take the next steps into adulthood. Kousei of course bumbles fairly passively through all this, to the point that at times it feels more like watching the author kick a puppy than anything else. It doesn't help that on occasion the plot takes some ridiculous twists purely for the sake of melodrama at Kousei's expense. At one point, for example, he nearly drowns in a swimming pool because, rather than try to swim, he sinks to the bottom miming a piano because the water is what it feels like when he's trying to play. As examples of forced drama go, YliA has some pretty egregious ones.\\n\\n\r\nIndeed, on more than a few occasions the show takes an uncomfortable turn into outright cynical emotional manipulation of the audience. Kousei's childhood seems to exist purely for this purpose, as though you can hear the writer shouting \u201clook at this child! Doesn't he make you feel sad? No? How about if his mother hits him over the head with a cane? Are you sad now? DO YOU FEEL!?\u201d Yes, YliA, I do feel. Apparently, however, you don't, because despite all this clear abuse Kousei was put through everyone else just seemed to take a \u201cnot my problem, not my business\u201d view to it. Kousei's mum is depicted as a psychotic child abuser, destroying her son's mental health so she can live vicariously through his success. Despite this, however, ultimately the show takes the view that it's okay because he's got over it now & she only did it so he'd have the musical talent to play after she died. Even cultural dissonance can't be an adequate explanation for why that was thought a good story arc or why Kousei's mum deserved the character redemption it tries to give her.\\n\\n\r\nAll this is in contrast to the comparatively marginal b-plot, the competition between Kousei, Takeshi Aiza & Emi Igawa, where something akin to actual character progression takes place. They begin with Emi & Takeshi harbouring old grudges against Kousei, only for the trio to progress as Kousei rediscovers his passion for music while Aiza & Takeshi move on from simply wanting to stick it to their old rival to aspiring to greatness in their own rights. We get to see progression both through their thoughts & conversations & also their musical performances, not to mention that the more peripheral characters connected to this part of the story actually feel like they have a purpose beyond listening to Tsubaki's boy problems or the like. The main plot really doesn't have anything like that sort of dynamic, which makes sitting through episode after episode of Kousei thinking about his mum or Tsubaki thinking about Kousei all the harder to enjoy because it never feels like it's going anywhere meaningful. The ending doesn't help in that regard either. Without spoiling, it basically reveals that the whole journey we've been on was basically a \u201cromantic\u201d version of Cameron's b-plot in the \u201cOne day, One Room\u201d episode of House.\\n\\n\r\nBut I'm digressing now. Despite all the problems YliA has I can't say it wasn't watchable. Indeed, many of the problems I had with it are things you have to either take or leave with anime that share the same genre tags. As frustrating as it got, YliA never feels as dragged out as, say, Chihayafuru, & there were moments where the show really did shine as the romantic drama it is supposed to be. There are more episodes than were needed but the finale is both a highpoint & a definitive ending, which is always welcome. The art & animation were fine for the most part & were impressive when it counted, which is all one could ask for. Having reached the end of Kousei & company's journey, I can't say I'd want to watch it again, but nor would I say it wasn't worth watching either. All things considered, perhaps that's enough.",

If you liked it for the drama, unrequited loves, and music, try Kids on the Slope.\r\nThese two shows did it way better than Your Lie in April. \r\n----------------\r\nIt's about a piano genius boy who has been mentally abused by his over controlling, psycho mom, and thus is dealing with issues regarding his piano/musical life. Meets a forceful girl who's to change all that. She literally just comes along and forces him to do things her way. Most of the story is just so unrealistically exaggerated. Youjust can't take it seriously. This show is drama, I understand, but this is melodrama to the next level. I couldn't help laughing at parts I should be feeling sentimental about instead. Speaking of laughing, this serious show also attempts to throw in a bit of comedy.  Fine, but make sure it's funny before you go and do that. The comedy scenes for the most part didn't work for me. It just felt forced, not natural, and well....not funny. \\n\\n\r\nThey have things repeated to you over and over, and even in the same episode sometimes. Good god, way to make use of the 22 min screen time you get. The story is kinda predictable, and the fact that they spell everything out for you doesn't help to alleviate the boredom. Throw in some unrealistic, overdone drama, and you're left cringing for the most part. \\n\\n\r\nThe art. The only thing that will fool you into thinking this anime is great. I wouldn't say the animation is top notch, but the art is indeed pleasing to the eye. The OST is kinda nice as well. That's it. Those are the only pros to this show. \\n\\n\r\nFor this to creep up even in the top 50s, I don't even know what to think. It's not terrible, but it's way way way overrated, and I can't fathom why it's in the top 15 on MAL (at the time of writing). The quality of the story, the script, and the characters doesn't feel like it warrants this anime to be in the top 50 even.\\n\\n\r\nI fine with drama. Heck I LOVE a good touching show with or without romance. This show though, eventually became something I had to force myself to keep watching. If you are expecting this to be top quality anime that all should watch because it's sitting up here near the top of the list, you may find yourself severely disappointed... unless you're a preteen who loves romance and over the top sob stories. Then by all means go for it.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSTORY:4\\n\r\nART:8\\n\r\nSOUND:8\\n\r\nENJOYMENT: 3\\n\r\nOVERALL: 4\\n\\n",

            "content": "\"To play a wrong note is insignificant; to play without passion is inexcusable.\" - Ludwig Van Beethoven \r\nShigatsu wa Kimi no Uso is about a child prodigy classical pianist named Kosei Arima, who gave up playing due to crippling depression following the death of his mother. Even though he won many competitions back when he was still playing piano, his playing was always very \"by the book\", mechanical, and lacking in passion. This was because of the extremely strict way in which he was trained by his late mother. After hearing the very passionate and innovative performance of a brilliant young violinist named Kaori Miyazono,Kosei is able to rediscover his love for music and learn to play with heart.\\n\\n\r\nThat sounds AMAZING right? An anime musical drama/romance that tells a heartwarming tale and introduces beautiful classical music to a new generation who otherwise wouldn't give it a chance. Why then didn't I rate it a 9 or 10?! I will sadly have to explain.\\n\\n\r\nFirstly, I must say that this series REALLY had potential! Especially for me, since I am a huge fan of classical music. Both of my parents were classical violinists who played in an orchestra. I went in with very high expectations, but unfortunately I was a bit disappointed. That isn't to say that I felt Shigatsu was a bad anime. Shigatsu is a fine anime, but I am saying it could have been a LOT better and it wasted a tragic amount of potential.\\n\\n\r\nStory: \\n\\n\r\nAlthough the basic premise of the story is the stuff of an award winning drama film, the execution was...not so much. Shigatsu has a LOT of really crappy comedy that never once made me laugh and constantly threw the mood out the window! This comedy is almost always accompanied by painfully obnoxious chibi style animation to save on the show's budget. I'm not saying that using tone jarring chibi out of nowhere instantly makes an anime bad. Hellsing Ultimate did it for comedy scenes, but Hellsing Ultimate never took itself seriously and never expected the audience to take it seriously. It is a show about Count Dracula fighting Nazi vampires! Shigatsu on the other hand, tries REALLY hard every 5 seconds to make the audience cry. Shigatsu DOES take itself quite seriously and wants to really emotionally move the audience, so the use of shitty comedy and random chibi in this context was a rather poor choice. The other most obvious problem in the show's execution was just how forced a lot of the tragedy felt. Shigatsu is a flat out melodrama. I'm not one of those critics who instantly hates on melodrama and condemns series just for using a writing style that is no longer in vogue. However, this story really didn't need to be a melodrama. It felt completely tacked on unnecessarily. Tragedies get more respect than comedies right? We better try REALLY hard to make this into a tragedy! I love a good tragedy, but Shigatsu in terms of its themes, message, and basic story isn't really crafted to be a tragedy. It feels like a comedy that was forcibly changed into a tragedy in post production because some jackass thought it would win more awards! \\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\\n\r\nThe art and animation is very inconsistent. During the scenes where an instrument is being played, the animation is gorgeous and accurately captures the movements of the musician. Then it goes to barely animated chibi garbage because...why? The art style is extremely \"moe\" which may piss off some viewers.\\n\\n\\n\r\nMusic:\\n\\n\r\nThe selection of classical music is AWESOME! We get Beethoven, Chopin, Rachmaninoff, and basically lots of excellent pieces by amazing composers. The only problem is the quality of the playing used for the anime's soundtrack. We are told over and over again how Kosei is this AMAZING child prodigy and quite possibly developing into the greatest pianist of his day. Yet the piano playing we hear is...not THAT good. This wasn't a live action film. They could have used any recording since the invention of the phonograph and synced up the animation with the playing. Why not use a recording of a pianist who actually plays like ALL the characters describe Kosei? Vladimir Horowitz could play better than the dude from this soundtrack after 3 bottles of vodka, blindfolded, while being attacked by killer bees!\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\\n\r\nBasically I just wanted to say that Shigatsu wasn't a bad anime, but it really wasn't a new masterpiece and actually squandered a ton of potential with extremely questionable choices in terms of execution. This actually isn't the first time I have seen a \"moe\" melodrama that mixed slapstick comedy with extremely forced tragedy. Angel Beats already accomplished that feat years ago. The difference is that the comedy in Angel Beats was actually funny! Angel Beats was also always supposed to be a comedy, but with some drama and tragedy thrown in. Shigatsu probably started out as a comedy, but was changed into a tragedy first, a romantic drama second, and a loveletter to classical music 3rd. The comedy in Shigatsu  honestly feels WAY more out of place than the comedy in Angel Beats. Overall, I would still check it out if you really love classical music or wish to learn more about classical music, but if you are coming for the drama/romance, I would pick a better anime.",

However interested I was at first, even with the outstanding music, at this point I can't even stomach this show. In my opinion, this show puts way too much of an emphasis on the entire drama of everything and kinda distracts from what I think is most important in a good show: an interesting story. Say you're not like me, and you enjoy all this whiny drama stuff. I'd say disregard everythingelse I'm about to say and go ahead and watch this, because you'll be sure to enjoy it. However, if all these tears and uncertain moments make you kinda wanna puke, I'd maybe kinda wanna stay away, because you'll only end up distraught and dissatisfied with all the mixed emotions in a show like this.",

            "content": "Beethoven was a piano genius who couldn\u2019t hear his own music because of his deafness. Arima Kousei is a piano prodigy can\u2019t hear his own music because of the tragic death of his mother causing mental breakdown that casted a deep, dark shadow over music.  \r\n[Story]\r\nYour Lie in April starts out as a colorful, and lighthearted anime, but all this contrasts the life of it\u2019s main character, Arima Kousei, which is described as monotone, and dull. The lightheartedness is contradicted yet again as deeper, and much darker past is revealed as Arima falls deeply in love with Kaori. You get a large glimpse ofhis dismal past revealing the actual reason behind why he can\u2019t hear his own music, but his conditions steadily improves as he ventures into his first love. Though only calling him \u201cFriend A\u201d Kaori slowly begins to drag him back into music, as well as showing him a new side of life that was colorful, and vivid. \\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed the story as well the storytelling methods of Shigatsu. The story is told mostly through Kosei\u2019s point of view, and the anime utilizes a unique way of narration, much of the story is told through internal monologues, and thoughts. There are several pros and cons of this method, and a pro is the fact that you can see the character\u2019s thought processes, and the con is that too much monologues can be quite overwhelming as well as annoying at times.  \\n\\n\r\n[Characters]\\n\\n\r\nOne of the things that made this anime so great was the characters. The anime heavily centers in on the past of the characters, which proves to be an excellent way of characterization. Every single character in the anime no matter substantial or minor is given a great personality. And as far as character development goes, most of the main characters display a considerable amount of it, especially Kousei. \\n\\n\r\nI really enjoyed diversity between the personalities of Kousei, and Kaori. Kaori seemed like the incarnation of freedom, a happy go lucky girl. Yet Kousei is a sheltered person, he seems to withdraw himself from others in order to protect himself. They were polar opposites of each other, yet they were also made to be together.\\n\\n\r\n[Sound]\\n\\n\r\nAmazing put together, the soundtrack to the anime emphasized every aspect of the anime making it so much better. I\u2019m definitely no fan of classical music but, they were essential to the show, as to any music anime, and it turned out I really enjoyed them because the songs were part of the story. Each time Kosei performed a song it revealed to us a little bit of his past. As a person who always skips the OP and ED of an anime, I made the exception for this one since they all were so well written, and complemented the tone of the anime. \\n\\n\r\n[Art & Animation] \\n\r\nOriginal, would be the word I would use to describe the type of art style in the anime. Personally I thought it was okay but it was fairly compatible with the show, it used a lot of vibrant colors which thoroughly emphasized a lighthearted mood. \\n\\n\r\n[Negatives] \\n\r\nNo show is perfect, and this show is no exception. Not really sure why people had such a big problem with the overly dramatic scenes but it\u2019s true there were a lot of drama, especially towards the end. Personally I thought the drama made the show more realistic, but honestly do a couple of 14 year olds need that much drama.\\n\\n\r\nPacing, one thing I learned after watching this anime was that the author really likes to drag things out, and I understand that this might not be a problem for some people, but honestly, do they really need to spend a whole episode on the past of a supporting character? I really wish they would\u2019ve made the last part of the show longer rather than adding in too much detail. \\n\\n\r\n[Overall]\\n\\n\r\nI really enjoyed this anime as a whole, it took a very clich\u00e9d plot, and with it\u2019s added elements turned it into something original. And taking it\u2019s genre\u2019s into perspective, it really excels at each of them except the humor it could\u2019ve been done a lot better. The jokes were poorly placed and overall just caused awkwardness. The anime is a real tearjerker it made me cry twice, and I pride myself in being a real macho person. But as far as masterpieces go, this definitely belongs in the best of the best. It\u2019s an anime that I wished would never end, but nothing lasts forever, except true love. \\n",

            "content": "Prepare yourself for a musical ride with Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso (Your Lie In April), one of the most talked about anime in the western community of late. The big question is whether the music-focused romance has earned its acclaim we\u2019ve seen from the bulk of reviewers? I feel it\u2019s both a yes and no, but mostly the latter. That\u2019s not to take away from it at all. This artful, musical adventure is still better than your average anime by a long way and it\u2019s still a show I\u2019d encourage everyone to watch if they get a chance.\r\nIt is one gorgeously crafted anime froma technical perspective. While its animation doesn\u2019t leap out at you, the character designs, background art and music are superb. Every scene is oozing with charm. The show is not, however, free from its flaws which come mostly from the character interactions, comedy and strange writing choices that plague the show particularly in its back half. There is no doubting that the show will be remembered for a long time in the genre thanks to its wonderful blend of art, music and sprightly collection of characters. It\u2019s not flawless, by a long shot, but it will manage to reach you somewhere on the emotional spectrum through either its uplifting moments or its sadder periods.\\n\\n\r\nThe story itself is simple enough. We have our protagonist Kousei who is a former child prodigy on the piano but has since lost both his desire and ability to play due to events in his life. Along comes Kaori into his life, a blond-haired ball of energy, who suddenly puts the colour back into his life and sparks his journey back into the musical sphere. There\u2019s no themes in here you haven\u2019t seen before but the way they are conveyed is full of life and charm. Though it borders on the overbearing when it comes to dialogue the story trundles along with a decent pace throughout the episodes, perhaps dragging along at moments. Could it have been done over 12 episodes instead? Possibly.\\n\\n\r\nThe show\u2019s biggest flaw comes from its handling of the relationship between our two main characters Kousei and Kaori. It\u2019s hard to delve into this without spoiling the story and their development but I will say a few things on the topic. \\n\\n\r\nFirst, the not-so-good news. A combination of some dreadfully unfunny and poorly timed comedic breaks, repetitive dialogue, slow progression and also exposition overload with the duo always kept me frustrated as a viewer. A lot has been said about the lengthy amount of philosophical ramblings of the characters, and it must be said that the problem with them doesn\u2019t come with the words being spouted from a 14-year-old\u2019s mouth. Instead, the problem comes in that such monologues are in stark contrast to the wacky comedic moments. The show really has no idea what kind of tone it\u2019s going for because of this conflict. The show could have done without both the philosophical and comedic moments and struck a friendly middle ground that could still have produced a concentrated script.\\n\\n\r\nThe other side of the coin is that, on their own, I feel like our leading pair are very interesting. They have desires and they change as our story progresses. As they each help them find out more about themselves and their own ability we start to see new sides of them. This is true more so in Kousei\u2019s case as Kaori remains criminally underdeveloped at points. Nothing in the show, I feel, is worthy of the dreaded \u2018melodramatic\u2019 tag. All the decisions made revolving around their music make sense, plus the emotional baggage they carry is certainly not unfounded. It\u2019s great to see Kousei try to fight through the barriers preventing him from playing without fear once again. The way he tries to achieve that makes perfect sense and is handled with respect and \u2013 to a point \u2013 realism.\\n\\n\r\nIn regards to our other characters, it seems all their purpose in the show is to further Kousei\u2019s development without expanding their own a great amount. That\u2019s not to say they don\u2019t have their moments. Tsubaki and Watari are the friends tagging alongside our leading duo and they provide a welcome change up sometimes. Their own successes and failures are utilised well by the writers as a parallel to what our leads are going through. They certainly don\u2019t just sit by the wayside achieving little.\\n\\n\r\nWhile a central theme of Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso is its classical music and how it is used to express emotion, it commits the big sin of telling instead of showing. It's disappointing to see a show that is supposed to be letting the music speak to us instead have its message spit out to us in lengthy monologues from those both playing and listening to it. Music has the ability to speak to us through its expression and dynamics. There is supposed to be no better example of this than classical piano. Shigatsu manages to capture this through its artistic elements like its beautiful light and art and also its depiction of the playing styles between our different characters. However these moments become fractured and tainted to an extent due to the constant spilling of thoughts from our characters.\\n\\n\r\nThis nit picking, to a point. Every musical scene is packed with energy and also seems to be where the majority of the animation budget would be poured into for the show. The song choices are fantastic and do a superb job at mirroring the current state of the person playing it. It would be most accurate to describe all of Kousei\u2019s performances as a means of concluding an \u2018arc\u2019 or development for him. We see him either grow or recede in his confidence in himself each time and, as stated above, the art and direction manage to capture these changes wonderfully.\\n\\n\r\nOn another music note the opening and endings are all wonderful and perfectly encapsulate the themes that the show is going for. Goose House\u2019s Hikaru Nara is the big highlight with its energetic vibe and singalong chorus, it\u2019s without a doubt one of the best openings I\u2019ve had the pleasure of listening to.\\n\\n\r\nOverall Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso is a show that I feel everyone should experience. Some may be able to look past the bloated dialogue and the sketchy writing, instead uncovering a colourful and vibrant show that manages to give off plenty of charm through its music and superb art. More than anything \u2013 despite the flaws I see \u2013 the show will stick with you. There will be moments you look back on with either fondness or sadness some time from now.",

            "content": "\"Will you forget?\" - Kaori \r\nHonestly, I have not written an anime review probably since Sword Art Online. I don't necessarily prefer writing reviews cause they're generally tedious & time consuming. However, There is only so long I can see such misleading, disrespectful, and uninformative reviews. Out of the well over 300 anime series I have seen, Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso is one of Seven anime I have given the perfect score to. And that is because this anime epitomises quality & perfection. \r\nI came in to this show with moderate expectations. I followed this show weekly - watching it each Thursday as itaired alongside my other Fall 2014 & Winter 2015 shows. Episode after episode continued to raise expectations, to command attention & perpetuate interest. I've seen a relatively fair share of Romance/Drama/School type anime, the most recent one of this genre being \"Nisekoi\" and most falling in a long line of trope filled, generic characters, non-developing story, and non existent romance. \\n\\n\r\nThe first thing you have to judge a show by is its first impression, just like any other art medium. My first impression of Shigatsu was along the lines of \"Wow, this is aesthetically pleasing.\" The meticulous attention to detail of backgrounds, artistic displays, character designs was beyond impressive. Even the way A-1 transitioned between Kosei's world of colour & that of black/white played a positive, constructive role into developing not only Kosei's character, but the plot itself. \\n\\n\r\nThe music coincides with the other positive elements of the show to create the stunning masterpiece it is. First and foremost Shigatsu is a music anime & i find some of the criticisms of this not only amusing, but contradictory. OF COURSE, the drama, romance, setting & other plot elements are going to be centred around Kosei and his Piano playing - his fears, his desires, & his inability to overcome that struggle. I thought this would be more obvious to some people who call it melodramatic, or saying the drama is forced, which is rather ironic seeing as all the drama that occurs is relevant to the story & does not feel forced. Anyway I did not intend to deviate from how special the music is. The score is very evenly and appropriately composed, and at points where the emphasis is on the recitals, the music always fits the mood of the show well, and the monologue that occurs during these moments provides invaluable access to the minds of the characters (predominately Kosei) that allow us to resonate not only to the sound of the music being played - but to the intention of the sound. To the tension of that sound - of that meaning reaching its final destination. The hearts of the audience. The hearts of us. \\n\\n\r\nDid it reach us? - Yes it did.\\n\\n\r\nYou can't have a perfect score without characters of the highest calibre. That's where Kaori Miyazano sparkles. She is confident, strong willed, beautiful, motivational, short-tempered, fragile, lonely all at the same time. To me she rates among the best female characters of all time.  Kosei was a little more frustrating at times, and a little more bland. A little more of the generic type, but even when he should feel generic, there is a realness he represents. The struggle he faces, his desires to overcome those struggles, his human emotion - his black and white world that is slowly being transformed to that of colour. Kosei surely wasn't the most spectacular of protagonists - but seeing the once \"puppet to the score's\" transformation both as a person - and as an artist is one of the best coming of age developments in Anime history. Even some of the side characters I particularly grew fond of. The most specific of these is Aiza. Aiza while truly looked up to Kosei  as a hero- as an idol, despite being equally as talented  and prodigious himself. Even looking at Kosei's back, he always strives to catch up to him, to make an impact. Not all of the characters were strong - Watari is the generic best friend who's athletic, good looking, confident, etc & Tsubaki has the archetypal role of being the childhood friend who's in love - but can't realise it. \\n\\n\r\nWhen I rate anime, 9 to me represents masterpiece, and 10 represents what i describe as \"beyond masterpiece\". I always say if I have to \"question\" if a show is a ten it is inherently not a ten, So what separates Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso from other masterpieces? It's the show's impact. Week in and week out my heart aligned with the characters - aligned with the drama. The aesthetics were unparalleled, the score so diligently composed, the characters so well developed and an ending that catalyses tears from even the most desensitized of viewers. Save for a few moments of misplaced comedic madness, the tone was consistent - the mood always properly developed & accentuated by both the score & art, and the show epitomised the absolute pinnacle of its genre. I loved this show. \\n",

            "content": "THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS\r\nNote: I am no english speaker\r\nNote: Finished the serie. It got better, I'll admit but 3 worth episodes do not compensate the whole shitness of the anime.\r\n\"Your lie in April\"? More like \"Your overrated anime in April\". Am I right?!\r\n*Awkward silence*\r\nLet me start off by saying this: I did not enjoy Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso. \r\nAs you can imagine I, being a classical music enthusiast and a big fan of Clannad (although some reviewers would have a word on that), was pretty excited about this anime and along with the hype I went and I watched it...as long as I couldtake it...\\n\\n\r\nLet's start off with the production value. Here is where Shigatsu really stands out. The art is amazing and the backgrounds are simply breathtaking. The animation is also great specially when the characters are playing their instruments as you can see the tears, the sweat and the facial expressions borned from the joyness of music. \\n\r\nThen we have the music. I already said that I love classical music, and I surely have loved that this anime had classical music. The only scenes with high quality music where the ones with the characters on the scenario. Then everything else was kinda dead silent and no real music to go along. Pretty dissapointing, but I guess I must give a high score just for those scenes alone. I have no comments on the voice acting, as I watched subbed and we all know that doesn't fail.\\n\\n\r\nLet's go with the story so I can start throwing shit here and there.\\n\r\n\"Oh! He is in love with a cute girl! Oh! The girl is his best friend's girlfriend! That was so not predictable! Oh! His girl friend loves him in secret but he doesn't have a clue that also so not predictable! Oh! The girl he loves has a medical condition that so original!\"\\n\r\nYeah, that's pretty much about it...\\n\r\nThere are three things that really bother myself about this anime. First of all is the comedy. It was hard enough for me to get into a tragic and dramatic scene, and then they totally kill the mood with crappy comedy? That's a huge backstab for any viewer. It wasn't the comedy that was bad, but it was so misplaced. You know what? Forget that, the comedy was bad indeed. But specially the bad timing they had for those shitty jokes. How do you expect me to be sensitive when suddenly you totally change the scene's mood?\\n\r\nSecondly every character cries for fucking everything. I mean come on. I get Kousei with his mom, but they cry for every fucking thing. Got a concert tomorrow? Better cry instead of practicing. You want to ask one of your best friends to be you partner? Cry, that totally does not look awkward. You see a cat on the street? Better have a heart attack. I understand that drama is necessary in an anime of this nature but Jesus Christ this was plain stupid. Lastly, the premise was really really REALLY good, and it had two strong plotlines to hold to in order to make this a brilliant anime. On one hand the relationship between Kousei and his mother (as many artists and athletes have that kind of relationship with their parents) had a lot of potential for character development and deep psychological struggle. On the other hand we had the rivalries between Kousei, Takeshi and Emi (by far the best characters) that could have become an AMAZING plot-motor, as we could have seen their egos in epic classical music battles. But what did we got instead? Crappy romance triangles with no real development and boo-boo teen angst. Including a romance for the sake of the story could have been nice but my god what a way to fuck things up.\\n\r\nI'll admit that the last episodes were good because A) they kinda cut that shitty comedy B) theyfocused more on the concerts and the actual music and C) Kaori gets less screen-time.\\n\\n\r\nNow this, leads me to the final and most important part: the characters. I liked Kousei a lot. He was well developed he was an interesting character and his struggle and emotions seemed the most natural and realistic of all the cast. I also liked Emi and Takeshi as Kousei's rivals but they get no screen-time nor development to be considered other things than fillers. The rest of the cast was plain, boring and overall a big \"meh\" with two exceptions.\\n\r\nI strongly dislike Tsubaki. Considering all the screen-time she had and the \"development\" she got (if we can call that development) it is infuriating how balnd, stupid and boring of a character she turned out to be. Really though, what the heck is she for the story? She serves no purpose and she is not even ebtertaining to watch.\\n\r\nAnd last but not least, Kaori. By far, the most bland, obnoxious, stupid and unrealistic female MC I've seen lately. Sorry I was wrong.She is not a character, she is a mere plot device. She is there just to inspire Kousei to play music. She is annoying everything she does is stupid and a forced overreaction and OH MY GOD WHY THE FUCK DOES SHE HIT HIM SO MUCH? They tried to make a cool badass tsundere like Asuka and instead they got a pile of shit with blonde hair and no real purpose on the story. Also, why they decided to throw her development as a big ball of blandness into the last episode? If I knew all that during the series progression she would have been a better character.\\n\\n\r\nSo...that's about it. That's my rant for this ani-meh. Shigatsu had a lot of potential. Kousei development was great. The music scenes were amazing. The relationship between him and his mother was splendid. The art and animation were outstanding. But they decided to throw all that away just to please the casuals with a bad romantic-drama-comedy-slice of life. It could have worked as a 12 episodes romantic anime, but stretching it for so long made it unbearable.",

            "content": "Spoiler free but one could infer things based on my reaction.\r\nShigatsu is an anime that had me torn in so many places. I think the plot , the music and the artwork are the best you will see recent memory. That said, the melodrama between the big events of the series is absolutely excruciating to watch especially for a modern anime. I had to constantly remind myself that the main characters are junior high students and not high school students to give some meaning to the unrealistic drama that unfolded. I will describe why I feel that this melodrama was so horribly written and executedand why I feel it ruined an incredible piece of art that is Shigatsu.\\n\\n\r\n The \"lie\" is supposed to be a plot device that allows Arima to have mixed feelings and give him a drive. \\n\r\nThis worked out fine story wise but to introduce that type of background and never work with it was annoying to say the least. I really feel I could argue that this was made so that \"romance\" could be injected into a musically focused story. Normally this type of relationship would be questioned. We never experience that thrill of someone finding out. Later in the series Watari openly comments on other cute girls with no remorse or guilt or obligatory anime slap to the face. This brings another issue with the series which is my main dealbreaking issue. Anytime there is a problem all you have to do is beat the shit out of Kosei,\\n\r\nKaori messes something up,attack  Kosei, another girl shows affection to Kosei, attack him for it,\\n\r\nKosei does all the work and takes no credit, attack him for it, \\n\r\nKosei suffers from depression due to trama, help him by attacking him, \\n\r\nKosei does his absolute best given the circumstances, beat the shit out of him\\n\r\nI don't know if this was supposed to funny but it was the most irritating I ever watched. I started to question anime in general because of this series. \\n\\n\r\nThere was so much they could have done instead of attacking Kosei.   I wanted more from this anime. The art work caught my eye immediately with eye popping colors that were so vivid on an OLED screen and an excellent repertoire of classical music.  Character development felt very forced as most anime do with a beta male main character. \\n\r\nThis anime could of been a must see classic if the writer had been more mature about it but now it's a just a good watch for people who like music anime with a little romance. Don't watch this anime for the romance like I did. just enjoy the ride and try not to think about it.",

            "content": "They say that when you fall in love, your whole world changes. The grey becomes colored, the dull becomes vivid, and the little moments become unforgettable ones. While there may be other stories that are written better or other productions that are animated better, Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso (Your Lie in April) struck a chord with me that I hadn\u2019t felt with a show in a long time. Even with its flaws, I loved every moment of this show, both as a musician and as an ordinary viewer. \r\nShigatsu focuses on the journey of Arima Kousei, who was a brilliant pianist as a child,but is now just a shell of his former self, haunted by the tragedies of his past. However, one day in April he meets Kaori Miyazono, the wild and unorthodox violinist, and that meeting sets off the beginning of Kousei\u2019s journey as Kaori drags him out forcefully to confront himself. While there\u2019s nothing especially groundbreaking about the premise, I felt it was executed in such a way that made the journey engaging and got me invested in the lives of the characters. The story\u2019s lighthearted moments were very enjoyable, bar a bit of repetitiveness in the slapstick comedy, while the tragic moments made me sympathize and mourn alongside the characters. Some may say that the show was a bit overdramatic, but I\u2019d have to disagree. The emotional plights that seem trivial to an outsider have much more weight to growing adolescents, and that is something I could definitely empathize with. On the other hand, the stress and despair that the musicians feel leading up to their performances may not be understandable to the casual player, but to those with a real investment in music, it is very real. I felt that the drama was well done and raised the tension in such a way that made the stakes at cost feel present. Also, I\u2019m glad that they committed to their ending and didn\u2019t kind of half-way attempt it but then turn tail because they were too afraid of committing *cough* Oreimo *cough*. It made the ending feel much more satisfying, which sadly is not the case for many shows.\\n\\n\r\nOne complaint that some might have with the show and that I\u2019d be able to understand is that it\u2019s a little heavy-handed. With an abundance of monologues containing flowery, Shakesperian-esque dialogue as well as not-so-subtle symbolism, it probably would\u2019ve been to their benefit to have toned it down a little and made it a bit more subtle. While it might be too much for some, I personally didn\u2019t really have too much of an issue with it, but it was noticeable. It could also be a little slow at times, but other than one especially noticeably repetitive episode, it wasn\u2019t too big of a problem.\\n\\n\r\n A part of the show that I enjoyed immensely was watching the musicians grow. From the climb out of despair in Kousei or just the small steps as a musician in the young Nagi, seeing all the musicians grow up on their own journeys both musically and emotionally was extremely satisfying to watch. The rest of the cast were a bit more stagnant, but they were still enjoyable characters nonetheless. Watari was a bit of the typical male best friend character and didn\u2019t really grow through the series, but was still fun to watch. Tsubaki didn\u2019t really grow much either for most of the series, but when the time came around where everyone realized just how fleeting time is, she was able to do more than just the typical childhood friend character, and I appreciated that. The characters felt like more than just two dimensional people, leading me to grow invested and care about their lives.\\n\\n\r\nNow, there was some slight controversy surrounding the show, mostly involving Kaori\u2019s forcefulness with Kousei, as well as Tsubaki and Watari to a lesser degree. While it\u2019s certainly not going to be the same case for everybody, and there are probably hundreds of different methods that could have been used, I feel as though Kaori\u2019s push isn\u2019t as wrong as some people think. I may not have gone through the same circumstances that Kousei did, nor was my despair ever as great as his, but I think that I can empathize with Kousei\u2019s mindset. And if it was me, I definitely would\u2019ve needed to have had someone else push me, even if it hurt, to ever have a chance of finding a way out, so I feel as though the story\u2019s take on the situation wasn\u2019t wrong. Of course, some people may have different opinions, and I respect that, but that\u2019s my personal take on the matter.\\n\\n\r\nOn the artistic side of things, it was a beautiful show to look at. The art style was pleasing, and the animation was mostly fluid; they also had some gorgeous stills too. The color palette changed to fit the emotions as well as the livelihood of a certain character, so that was a nice touch. There were times that the animation cut the corners a little in a way that you could tell, but it was never anything too prominent. The soundtrack was nice and fitting, with the everyday moments feeling pleasant while the dramatic ones being accentuated with the emotional music. I loved both OP\u2019s, although Hikaru Nara edges it out slightly for me, while both ED\u2019s fit nicely with the tone, with the second one more somber than the first to fit with the growing tragedy.\\n\\n\r\nOf course, as a show about musicians, the performances had to be good. And they were absolutely amazing. The performances were extremely engaging, and after every single one, I noticed that I hadn\u2019t moved an inch during the whole thing. They were animated beautifully, and the emotions in the music captivated me as a viewer. As a musician, watching these performances reignited a love for classical music I had forgotten for a long time, and it\u2019s stirred me to expand my repertoire to more than just contemporary music. As a side note, I\u2019m extremely glad that they finally didn\u2019t have a violinist just flailing around the bow like they\u2019re playing the music even though it doesn\u2019t match what\u2019s playing at all. As a former violinist it would grate my eyes whenever I saw that in a show, but thankfully this one avoids doing just that. \\n\\n\r\nMaybe it\u2019s just because I\u2019m a teenager and a musician so I can relate with the characters, but this is a show that captivated me in a way that anime hasn\u2019t done in a long time. While it may have had some flaws, the character journeys, the tragic moments alongside the lighthearted ones, the performances, and the energy of the show all just came together to create a show that was extremely enjoyable from beginning to end. \\n\\n\r\n\"Are you going to forget? Even if I die, I won't forget.\"\\n\\n\r\ntl;dr \u2013 I liked it. A lot.\\n",

            "content": "It would seem that feeling some modicum of emotional involvement whilst watching/reading something is all it takes to make a masterpiece these days. Whilst emotional involvement is always a great thing, it's not enough to excuse problems that a particular work in question has. On another note, it irks me when people say they \"got the feels\" from watching something because more often than not, it was something stupid/clich\u00e9/melodramatic. Maybe I'm a heartless sociopath or maybe it's because I've been through a lot worse in life, but I can't help but scoff when people tell me they cried like a baby whilst watching stuff likethe first season of Clannad. Then enters Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso, an anime/manga series that plagues me with cognitive dissonance because there's a lot of stuff I truly do like about this programme but there's also a LOT of irritating crap that just got on my nerves.\\n\\n\r\nThe biggest reason as to why I got emotionally involved with Shigatsu is because of Kousei himself. Like I've said in some of my other reviews, my mother's dead and I know damn well where Kousei's at and all that stuff. To me, Shigatsu was less about the music and more about the story of a teenager learning to move on from past tragedies. Add into the mix that I'm a huge fan of romantic drama and music, and you'd basically have a recipe for something that would've been among my all-time favourites (alongside the likes of White Album and Solanin). Unfortunately, it wasnt perfect. The gag comedy was a mild annoyance that gradually turned into something cringe-worthy, the monologuing was a bit tedious and it just got even more ridiculous as the show went on, and as these two aspects of the show became more obvious, I found myself getting less and less involved with what was going on. If you're an avid fan of this show, allow me to explain myself.\\n\\n\r\nI understand that levity has a place in storytelling, and what's more is that this show is aimed toward a mainstream audience that probably can't handle the intensity of things like Gong Ji-young's Our Happy Time or White Album 2. The problem is that Shigatsu's particular style of humour was grossly inappropriate for the subject matter that this show was tackling. This is a show revolving around a 14-year-old who has a dead mother who was extremely abusive toward him learning how to cope with past tragedies and learning to move on with his life. The last thing we need is a chibi-style cutaway interspliced with every dramatic moment out there. Stuff like that just takes away from the emotional impact of the story and just ruins the mood for me. If the humour was more dialogue-oriented like in Daria or in the Ultimate Spider-Man comics, it would've been more than enough to break up the excess tension that would build up and make the show uncomfortable to watch whilst also allowing for the show to play with your emotions without any interference whatsoever. Alack, hindsight's an anime studio's worst enemy and there's no changing what's already done.\\n\\n\r\nOn another note, the monologuing was nothing short of tedious and insulting. Monologues are a powerful tool and if used sparingly, they can strengthen the impact of various events that would go on in your story. The problem is that the mangaka (and A-1 Pictures by extension) fails to understand that more monologues does NOT equate to more emotional weight. I don't know about you, but I find it nothing short of insulting when an anime studio decides to tell us exactly what a character is feeling via long, drawn-out monolgues in almost every episode because it gives me the impression that A-1 Pictures thinks I'm some socially inept otaku with no understanding of how human emotions work. The strange thing is that all of the monologuing could've easily been omitted if the story actually decided to focus on Kousei and Kaori instead of bringing up the perspectives of people like Kousei's piano rivals and Tsubaki.\\n\\n\r\nI don't know about you, but I don't give a rat's ass about Tsubaki, Watari, Emi, Takeshi, or any of those other people. They're side characters, so why even bring them up? The only characters that ultimately matter by the end of it all are Kousei and Kaori. All that time that A-1 Pictures spent on those characters could've easily been spent making fleshing out Kousei and Kaori's personalities. As much as I adore the two of them, I can't exactly say that I think they''re well-written characters. Let me put it to you like this: I've found several other characters empathetic in the same way I found myself empathising with Kousei (i.e. Tohru Honda, Tomoya Okazaki, Shinji Ikari) and yet those characters made more of a lasting impression in my mind than Kousei did, namely because I found them empathetic in many more ways than I could find myself relating to Kousei. I mean, outside of the fact that I was once a motherless teenager with the hots for a blonde chick, I can safely say that Kousei isn't exactly the most relatable of individuals. As for Kaori? Well... outside of the fact that I actually like her, she's no different than Nagisa from Clannad in that they're just there to be plot devices meant to evoke an emotional response out of the viewer.\\n\\n\r\nNow those problems aside, another thing that never really sat right with me was how Kousei was treated by his friends over the course of the series. He's got a dead mother who was pretty damn abusive toward him. The last thing the bloke wants to do is play the piano, and yet he still finds himself drawn to it because you know... that was his thing. I understand his friends want him to just play the bloody instrument again and that 14-year-olds aren't psychotherapists by any stretch of the imagination, but the way they go about doing so is rather cruel to say the least. He's harassed and manipulated quite a bit over the course of the series and somehow, that's the solution to all of his problems. You know, Kousei would've had a mental breakdown if he was a real person because he'd be forced to re-live some nasty childhood trauma. I wouldn't really have much of a problem with this were it not for the fact that I've seen shit like this first-hand, and it *RARELY* works out. It also doesn't help that there was a lot of inappropriate gag comedy that was going on during these scenes where Kousei was forced to play the piano again, but let's not get into that.\\n\\n\r\nI really don't want to pick on this show so much, but the problem is that these flaws make the show incredibly difficult to take seriously. When I get taken out of my moment by flaws in a particular programme, my critical faculties are automatically turned on and now I have no choice but to take the piss out of the show I'm watching because it failed to keep me entertained in the first place. This means that stuff I would've ordinarily let slide if I were actually invested in what I was watching (i.e. the simpering, stupid dialogue about \"seeing the notes\" and \"colourful music\") end up being another point lost in my book. If this were any other programme (like say Tokyo Ghoul or Fate/stay night), this wouldn't be a problem because half the fun in watching them came from making fun of what was going on in the show. However, Shigatsu falls in with Nagi no Asukara in that it was a show that I adored the crap out of that gradually lost my interest because of various factors (much to my own dismay, of course).\\n\\n\r\nA lot of these problems could've easily been avoided if A-1 Pictures actually took the initiative to fix the problems that the source material had in the adaptation. An adaptation isn't supposed to be a translation of the source material verbatim into another medium. Adaptations can be viewed as a sort of \"second chance\" for the source material, so the most important job that an adaptation has to do is fix the various problems that plagued the source material in the first place. Unfortunately, that didn't happen whatsoever and the end result is a show full of wasted potential, poorly-timed gag comedy, tedious monologues, and a whole lot of farcical melodrama: just like the manga that it came from. Well, that's not entirely fair to say because Shigatsu does have a few redeeming qualities.\\n\\n\r\nFor a show that couldn't keep me invested in what was going on for more than five minutes at a time, I must say that the parts where I was actually into what was going on had me on the edge of my seat and despite that Clannad comparison I made earlier, this show actually had me invested in what was going on a lot more than the first season of Clannad could ever hope to. Despite the fact that the show is plagued with bad comedy, laughably pathetic melodrama, and annoying monologues, there will come a powerful scene every so often that would've otherwise left you in tears were it not for the inexcusably flawed execution. On that note, at least Shigatsu did a fair enough job of actually making me care about the characters throughout the entire show as opposed to some of the other things I've watched (i.e. Air, Nagi no Asukara) so it has that going for it as well.\\n\\n\r\nThe production values also showcase what A-1 Pictures is capable of from an audiovisual standpoint. Despite the fact that the animation quality hiccups every now and then, it's remarkably consistent and the amount of effort and detail they put into the musical performances makes them all the more captivating to watch. Speaking of music, the OST is lovely to say the least. I personally find myself liking the first OP the most, mostly because it's quirky, catchy, and makes me eager to watch more of the show despite knowing damn well what's in store for me if I do. I would say something about classical music, but I don't got that much knowledge in that department. I like violins and I like pianos. This show has plenty of tracks with violins and pianos and they sound good to my ears. Therefore, the OST is good. What more do you want me to say?\\n\\n\r\nFinal thoughts? Well... Shigatsu was definitely something I'll keep in mind for a while and whilst it was tedious to get through, it managed to do more than enough right to get a pass from me. With that said, I wouldn't necessarily call this show \"good\" because honestly... there are so many other things out there that do what Shigatsu does and better. I mean, if you want this particular show, go right ahead but I'd hold off on it for a while and try going for something like say...\\n\\n\r\na) White Album 2\\n\r\n- Another romantic drama with music that came out during the fall season. This show puts a lot more focus on the romance than the music, and what's more is that it actually keeps a serious tone throughout the eniter story! Kazusa is easily best girl, by the way\\n\\n\r\nb) Clannad: The Motion Picture (and Clannad: After Story to a greater extent)\\n\r\n- Another story about a guy whose life was changed completely after a fateful encounter with a girl in spring. Within the span of an hour and a half, a story of love, loss, and coping with tragedy is told and is done to a much greater effect than it was done in Shigatsu for various reasons (namely the fact that the entire movie was told from Tomoya and Nagisa's perspective).\\n\\n\r\nYeah, that was a lazy way to shoehorn my alternate show recommendations, but that's what happens when I spend an hour and a half writing up a review for a show that'll probably get downvoted into oblivion anyway. That's all for now though. Feedback's always welcome and with that, I'm out.

            "content": "***SPOILER WARNING: PLOT ELEMENTS & ENDING REVEALED***\r\nYour Lie in April is quite possibly the most disappointing anime that I have ever seen. This is because the series brings you in with gorgeous visuals, fantastic sound work, an interesting concept and elements of delicious suspense, and then lets you down with horrible story execution, insufferable characters, and an ending which makes you want to punch a hole through the screen. I really wanted to like this series, but it just wouldn't let me.\r\nTo get it out of the way, here is how I rated the show:\r\nStory: 3/10\r\nArt: 10/10\r\nSound: 10/10\r\nCharacters: 3/10\r\nEnjoyment: 2/10\r\nOverall: 3/10\r\nI thought about going intodetail on everything wrong, and right, about the series, but I think it would be better if I went into the two things that drag this series down into the pits: Kaori and the \"twist\" ending.\\n\\n\r\nTo begin, Kaori is one of the most terrible female MCs I have ever seen: She is selfish, dishonest, manipulative, abusive, self-righteous and histrionic. She spends the entire series forcing Kousei to relive traumatic experiences just so she can get him to play the piano, either as her accompaniment on-stage or simply for her own amusement, all the while leading him on with mixed signals as she is dating his best friend, a popular jock-type who is almost his exact opposite. She constantly belittles him for doing any little thing she doesn't like, hitting him constantly or talking down to him like a misbehaving child. On occasion, she will be incredibly sweet & endearing towards him while they're hanging out... before eventually ditching him to hang out with her boyfriend.\\n\\n\r\nThis all doesn't necessarily make for a poorly-written character, per se, but what makes this all particularly unpleasant is that her bullshit is presented as though it were a good thing for all parties involved! She is framed as some tsundere goddess with a heart of gold when she is actually just a manipulative teenage bitch with a superiority complex. Talk about cognitive dissonance! Had she been presented in a fashion which was more appropriate for her unpleasant personality, the entire series would have been drastically improved as a result, and she would have, in the end, been a far more compelling and likable character.\\n\\n\r\nWhich brings us to the abysmal ending: It turns out that she was in love with Kousei all along, and only dated his best friend to get close to him, but Kousei doesn't find out about it until after she's already dead.\\n\\n\r\nWhat. The. Fuck.\\n\\n\r\nSo let me get this straight: She spends how many months belittling this poor kid over the trauma he experienced due to the death of his abusive mother by being incredibly abusive herself, playing with his emotions and leading him on the entire time, all while dating a guy she secretly doesn't even like just to subject him to this disgusting behavior... because she was in love with him?! Again: What. The. Fuck. This plot twist and how it was executed instantly made Kaori one of the most unlikable characters imaginable, and ruined what little enjoyment the series could have brought to the table.\\n\\n\r\nNow, had they presented Kaori differently, this twist would have instantly made her a more compelling, sympathetic & endearing character, and made you look at her actions in an entirely different light, especially since harboring such love for Kousei would have seemed antithetical to her personality. Instead, we get a boring-yet-infuriating resolution to a mediocre story that leaves you feeling anything but satisfied.\\n\\n\r\nIn summation: Like I said before, this show had a world of potential, and I really wanted to like it. I thought it would have everything I wanted in a story like this, and started out strong enough to make me anticipate the rest of the series... but then it took a watery shit all over my expectations, leaving me annoyed & dissatisfied in the end.

            "content": "WARNING!! SPOILERS AHEAD!!\r\nDid it reach me? Well, in some parts.\r\nLet's just say that Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso is a very over-rated series. I understand why people say it's so great, because \"omg, the art is amazing, the music is amazing, the end is so sad, oh no, i cried so much, best ever 10/10\" Ok. The art was beautiful. The only word to describe the art in KimiUso is beautiful. I have not seen music being played animated so beautifully, since Free did that with swimming. The character design fit the characters perfectly. The music was also tip-top, as to expect from amusic anime. I loved all the opening and ending themes, with an exception for the 1st ED, which for some reason, didn't buy me. Plot.... I was fine. I guess. The \"deliquent, who meets a girl and suddenly his life starts to change\" motive is used very, very frequently, and KimiUso does not outstand the schemes. I'm not gonna go into the story, cos I'm pretty darn sure all of you know it all by heart. The plot was fine, but I feel the ending, the sad, dramatic ending, was a bit rushed, and so was the progress of Kaori's illness. I felt that literally in the moment she and Kousei went on stage together, she went into hospital and STAYED THERE. And that, my friends, is a big shame, 'cos I was really looking forward to seeing more of Kousei and Kaori on stage together. Fun fact: after watching this anime, I started wanting to play the violin. Like, really bad.\\n\r\nThe biggest disappointment in KimiUso was the characters. I want to discuss that a little more deeply.\\n\r\nArima Kousei\\n\r\n A heart-warming, good person, who didn't deserve the tragedy he got. I admit, he was a bit of a coward, sometimes annoying, but he was such a good guy! The one thing I loved about the characters in KimiUso was their reaction to Kaori's death, even Kaori herself. But Kousei, even though he was heart-broken, even if he was sad and wanted to cry and scream: he didn't. Because he was a musician. Because Kaori taught him, that he was a musician. And I liked that better than the situation in Clannad:After Story, whereas Tomoya had a mental breakdown and depression after losing Nagisa. And as much as I liked Clannad better than KimiUso, I can't not say that Kousei acted better than Tomoya. And they were in a really similar situation. Anyways, for the wonderful development and his kindness, Kousei gets a 8/10.\\n\r\nMiyazono Kaori\\n\r\nAh, Kaori. Haven't had such mixed feelings towards a character since Kushieda Minori from Toradora. One one hand, I hated, HATED Kaori. She had the predispositions to be my favorite character, but she killed them before the end of the first episode. Her personality was bitchy and annoying, and the titular \"lie\" she told was really stupid. I mean, she really wasn't the sort of girl who'd do that! But on the other... I absolutely adored her reactions to her illness and the fact she knew she was going to die. Opposite from Hazel from TFIOS, who got all depressed after finding out she was gonna die. Not Kaori! Knowing she didn't have much time, she did all the things she wanted to do in life, just to do them! To gain experience! That motivated me in so many ways. But, for the reasons earlier mentioned, Kaori gets  6/10\\n\r\nSawabe Tsubaki\\n\r\nPeople hate Tsubaki- And I'm no exception! I think she was the most hated anime character of 2014, starring alongside Seryuu Ubiquitous. She was annoying, selfish, and just simply STUPID! She, like all of the \"main\" characters except Kaori and Kousei did not get any development and at times I even wondered why she's even there. 4/10\\n\r\nWatari Ryota\\n\r\nAww, Watari! Pal, you are so under-rated! I loved you! And that is the thing with Watari: he deserved and could have had amazing development, but did not. Even still, I loved Watari. He gets a solid 7/10\\n\r\nOverall, KimiUso isn't a bad series. It just had so much wasted potential. Neverthless, it was touching. It was enjoyable. And it deserves a score of 6-7 but not higher and not lower. 7 is a high as it gets, really.",

            "content": "I've finally got around to watching this anime just over a month ago. After I finished watching this anime, I was extremely disappointed. I've heard lots of good things about this anime, but unfortunately it ended up being a pathetic pile of shit. It wasn't even enjoyable to watch in the slightest. Also, I highly suggest that you don't read this review if you haven't already watched this anime yet. \r\nI'll just give a quick synopsis of the story since I'm sure you all know what it's about. The story is about how a kid named Kousei is abused and forced to play the pianoby his abusive mother. Fast forward to a couple years later, the heroine Kaori is pretty much forcing him to start playing the piano again. Kaori is a violinist and she pretty much begs him to start playing piano again. This Kaori girl then gets some unknown disease, therefore she's unable to play the violin with Kousei. Throughought the anime we see her struggling with this disease, and I admit that it was kind of sad to watch.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is actually pretty interesting to be honest. I have no problem with the story of this anime at all. What I do have a problem with is the bad writing and poor execution. I actually expected this anime to be mature since it's touches on things like PTSD, Depression, Suicide, Disease, etc. Unfortunately, this anime was not mature in the slightest. Infact, this anime was extremely immature which kind of disappointed me. There was many moments of unfunny and unnecessary comedy that really shouldn't have been there. I mean for fucks sake, the characters in this show talk about comitting suicide. I seriously want to know what the writer was thinking when he decided to add childish comedy to a manga that has mature themes. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters are just god awful and unlikeable it's ridiculous. The only one that developed as a character was Kousei. Every other character is one dimensional and unlikeable. I have no idea why people like Kaori. Just because she has a disease and the anime makes you feel sorry for her, that doesn't mean she's a good character. I felt bad for her aswell, but she's still a generic one dimensional character. I was disgusted at how annoying Tsubaki was. She's the most annoying female character I've ever seen in an anime, period. There's just way too many characters that serve no purpose to the story, such as Nagi, and the two people that are obsessed with Kousei. \\n\\n\r\nThis show becomes extremely repetitive very fast. I mean the second half of the show is the same thing repeated over and over again ad nauseam. I literally felt like I was watching the same episode over and over again. The last 12 episodes have very slow pacing and it was a pain to watch them.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation was good at sometimes, but bad at other times. Anytime there's a piano/violin performance, there usually is beautiful animation. Unfortunately anytime there's a comedy scene, the animation is just god awful. The art style just completely changes when there is comedy involved and it's animated so ugly. It's as if there's comedy in this anime just for the sole purpose of saving budget. If that's actually the reason, then that's absolutely pathetic.\\n\\n\r\nI just didn't enjoy this anime one bit. It was extremely childish and immature I just couldn't stand it. I didn't enjoy the characters because they were annoying pieces of shit. The performances were fun to watch at first, but quickly became boring because of the slow pacing. I didn't enjoy watching the bad comedy. This anime is just bad and overrated.\\n",

            "content": "There is much bitterness in life, but we have to learn that we must forget that and keep go on. Just like a rainbow in the rain, Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso ends beautifully.\r\nShigatsu wa Kimi no Uso is a story about Kousei Arima, a piano prodigy who is quite famous at his young age thanks to his mother who introduced him to the world of piano. Arima dominates all competitions he participated because of his perfect performance. One day her mother died. Arima feels shocked since then and got some sort of trauma that makes him unable to play the piano again. Kousei gavein to the world of music until one day he meets a young violinist girl named Miyazono Kaori who introduced Kousei the true meaning of music. \\n\\n\r\nOne of the oldest art forms in the earth is music, music has become a friend of mankind since the beginning of civilization. But what exactly is the meaning of a music? What causes sound was very interesting to listen to? Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso has the right answer for it. Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso prove that music was meant more widespread than we think, not just a set of joyful sound but can mean different - depending on one's own thoughts.\\n\\n\r\nIf we look deeper into the story, the concept of the story is not too complex but not too simple either, which makes the story more easily accepted. Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso also has advantages in the individual elements of the story, though sometimes the comedy is a bit flat. The anime also success in delivering expressive situation, you can feel the intense drama though sometimes looks too hyperbole and exaggerating. \\n\\n\r\nOne of the things that makes a lot of people become difficult to enjoy this anime is the pacing. The pacing is very slow with many flashbacks to appear, it might make you not stand with this movie and feel bored if you not yet accustomed to watching this kind of setting. But this is not a deficiency, the slow pacing makes the story more visible so that there is no stiffness in its delivery. The process is visible and the results are quite satisfactory.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation owned by Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso is wonderful and suitable, the background illustrated in great details with a different feeling. Different in every scene, could be seen shining and beautiful color, and can also be dark with despair surrounding it. When playing the piano, the animation sometimes turns into CG. Character design very represents and match with the story.\\n\\n\r\nWhat can I say about the sound settings? One word to describe \u2026 \u201cWonderful\u201d. OP / ED theme is nice & and matched with the mood of the story. Also, the classical instruments of the performance are also nice & expressive with many different feeling.  The seiyuu did their work fairly well in bringing the character to the screen.\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of deepening the characters Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso is not less than any other anime. The number of flashbacks in the story makes the main character (Kousei) illustrated very clear and very deep as well, a massive character development occurs in Kousei, it is the main success as well.\\n\\n\r\nBesides Kousei, we have Kaori which has a considerable role in encouraging Kousei to plunge into the world of music again, Kaori takes a great role in the 2nd half of the series as well. Some development is also found in the other main characters, such as Tsubaki. Characters with the weakest development are entirely Watari appeared only to meet the needs of the plot alone. Some of the side characters like Aiza Takeshi & Emi Igawa have their own proper development.\\n\\n\r\nFor the enjoyment, Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso also quite entertaining with all the advantages and disadvantages. Fans Slice of Life must watch this anime, also, if you are looking for an anime with strong character development & great dramatic storyline, you come to the right place. In the end, this anime is a true color spectrum that all of the story aspects with rainbows and light that they have. It is really a real deal.",

Honestly, this was the most lacking emotional anime I have ever watched. Violet Evergarden was even better than this sorry of an excuse anime. The characters especially are horrid, the main female lacks so much character development it makes me wanna puke. Honestly, I was crying. Crying with tears from laughing so hard.\r\nPathetic. Honestly, anyone liking this and protecting this has no taste in actual emotional anime, or actually animes that make you FEEL for the characters. Animessuch as Clannad, Air, Kanon, Violet Evergarden, Macross Frontier, and so much more you really need to get better XDDD",

            "content": "Your lie in April is my favorite show of all time. Beautiful, inspiring, wonderful.\r\nThe characters of Kousei Arima and Kaori Miyazono will likely stick with me forever. Kousei is an immediately tragic character. His inner monologues give him a characterization that show someone who is withdrawing from the world in order to protect himself. Seeing how he progresses throughout the story is one of the best things about Your lie in April. And showing a wisdom far beyond her age alongside a bright perspective on life and music, Kaori is absolutely inspiring. The words she says to Kousei help to bring him back into theworld, but some of her knowledge may actually be words to the audience as well. \\n\\n\r\nUsing the love of classical music as a backdrop gives the often introspective characters a place where \"music might just transcend words.\" The classical music is absolutely wonderful. The moment that the first performance begins in episode two was the moment that I was hooked on this show. AS the show progresses, the classical music becomes more and more incredible leading up to what has become my favorite classical piece.\\n\\n\r\nIn many ways, the classical music is the star of the show, but the heart is in it's coming of age story. Showing an honest side to first loves, dealing with loss, and growing up, Your lie in April's story is an absolute wonder to behold. From the exhilarating highs of the story, to the very tear-jerking moments, Your lie rarely manages to skip a beat. (Seriously, bring a tissue box, you will likely need one)\\n\\n\r\nIt's not perfect of course. The humor sometimes seems out of place, and the characters sometimes feel a bit older than they are supposed to be, but even with these very minor flaws, Your lie in April is phenomenal. \\n\\n\r\nEarly in the show one character remarks that the people watching their performance will never forget what they saw that day. As lame as it sounds, I don't think that I'll ever forget this show. It is, in my mind, a masterpiece.",

            "content": "I may be late to the party but I have this utmost desire to share these thoughts here. Not because this anime has made me feel the feelest of feels but because it made me feel shit after watching it. So shitty, I even made an account just for this!\r\nI'm just a petty teenager who loves anime. I like classical music too. It should not take so much to at least make me amused by this show. But this show managed to make me hate it. I'm no professional critic but I know flaws when I see one. \r\nThe story is about a young geniuspianist who developed a trauma which kept him from continuing his career. It all changes when he meets a brillant violinist who inspires him to play again.That kind of plot has potential. A lot of potential. But it managed to be bad. REAL BAD.\\n\\n\r\nI will start with the nitpicking with the use of monologues and flowery words. It's fine if the characters introspect and speak like they are a Shakespearian poet if their character development needs them to. But to do this ALL the TIME? The characters are just 14! Even the 13 year old sister of the Super Saiyan guy!? It was fucking ridiculous! Also, they have the habit of repeating the same fucking statements over and over, just a different wording so idiots won't notice. All of this bullcrap made me not to take anyone seriously. How can a pubescent kid talk/think so dramatically all the time? How!?\\n\\n\r\nThere's also the comedy. It's not that the comedy is badly placed, it's just because its bad. Me and my sister's self-insert jokes are funnier than their cliche comedy. Their comedy mostly consists of hitting/beating Kousei beyond salvation, so our female leads has to beat him all the time. Even if there is no reason at all. Because that's funny, right? No. It's a poor attempt to make anyone laugh. It was a slapstick bullshit. Nodame Cantabile has better slapstick than this.\\n\\n\r\nNow, the worst aspect of this show, the characters. Yes, the element that drives the show's heart and soul is the most shitty.\\n\\n\r\nFirst, we have Kousei, the protagonist. He's not as bad as the other characters. Actually, watching him overcome struggles as a musician is interesting. But like the other characters, he suffered with the crappymonolouguetitis and talkinglikeasuicidalemo diseases. So despite his competent character development, I never took him seriously.\\n\\n\r\nThen, we have Kaori. The blonde tsundere chick made from hell. Out of everyone, she is the one I hate the most. Her personality is so incosistent, more inconsistent than a bipolar. She hits Kousei at first, then becomes a gentle lamb with a life quote to say. She keeps flipping attitudes faster than sound. So even when she died, I never felt a hint of sadness. She was an unrealistic character, why feel sad? It will be like crying over a strand of hair that fell out of someone's scalp. It's not just her personality that made me hate her. Actually, I started hating her early in the show because she forced Kousei in playing piano for her in a competition. This bullshit that she did is portrayed in a positive light. Yeah, force a guy to relive a traumatic experience, it will help! If he never gives in to your forcefulness, cry pathetically! Fuck with his feelings! It will cure him! After that and showing inconsistencies with her personality, I thought there is no way that I can hate her more! But behold! The eponymous lie is actually about liking Watari! In actuality, she likes Kousei! She was a fan of his all along! Totally not obvious! Totally unpredictable! Totally logical for her to lie about it! Totally amazing!! Then to add insult to injury, there's also the fact that they never mentioned what sickness she really had. It's like, the writer said: ' I will just make her suffer so bad! People just has to pity her! I'm too lazy to do some research about diseases, so fuck it!'\\n\r\n*sigh...Kaori is seriously, the worst female character I've ever seen.\\n\\n\r\nBut wait! There is another insufferable tsundere! Her name is Tsubaki! Kousei's tomboy friend and Kaori's foil. She had so many episodes revolving around her troubles, and it was all annoying. She wants Kousei to stop playing piano so he will just to pay attention to her? What the hell!? That is so selfish! Why would I want to watch more of her struggles? She is not worth my time! She is not a good friend, and I bet my pinky finger, she will never be a good girlfriend. She kicks you to show her love! Not a good girlfriend material if you ask me.\\n\\n\r\nWere not done here! There's also another blonde, annoying tsundere! Super Saiyan's little sister! She is also not worth my second. She is just another addition to Kousei's tsundere collection. She likes saying 'that is so cliche!'. Ironically, she is also very cliche. Her arc was pointless. It made me think this show just keeps stretching itself till it's nothing. How wonderful.\\n\\n\r\nWe also have the  ignored characters! \\n\\n\r\nMeet Ryouta, a playboy and jock bro of Kousei who is nothing but a plot device. He's just there so Kaori can initiate her crappy lie. We get to see a little of his character when he cried over the loss of his team in a game. But you can only get that. Sorry.\\n\\n\r\nThere is also Kousei's not-rivals. Super Saiyan and Super Forehead. They claim  to be Kousei's rivals but in reality, he never gave a crap about them, which is a shame. Rivalry and competition between these characters is an interesting angle, it will create tension and excitement! But it was sadly ignored in favor of annoying tsunderes' tales focus.\\n\\n\r\nAnd lastly, we have the cliche reasonable adult, Kousei's Aunt. She is bland and uninteresting. Focusing on her relationship with Kousei's mother is a nice thing to tackle or exploring her own struggles as a musician is nice too. But those are ignored too. What a pity.\\n\\n\r\nNow, the music. This part should be amazing, right? Eh, I beg to differ. The music are fine, but what I'm most bothered about is whenever someone plays, a monolouge comes in. Seriously, how will I enjoy it!? It's fine to comment on it from time to time, so the audience will be informed of some stuff. But to monologue to most of it? Come on! They also mix in some other instrument whenever someone plays a solo. Seriously!? Why!? I want to enjoy the piano for being a piano, don't mix it with drums! The fact that the music here is not the focus but, just a tool for the characters' expression is jarring. I was promised anime about music, and I get this?\\n\\n\r\nAnd for the last, the only good thing. The visuals.\\n\r\nThe backgrounds are so good. The pastel colors, lighting and stuff is nice. The animation is not really consistent at times, but it was great during musical performances. So, yeah... This anime only managed to get a score from me because of the visuals. \\n\\n\r\nBasically, this anime is your example of a pretty shell. Beautiful to look at but empty inside. Oh wait, it's not actually empty, there is horse shit inside! Surprise! \\n\\n\r\nPlease don't hate me for disliking this anime. It just really gave me and my sister a bad time. So bad, I felt the urge to write about it. If you like this anime, don't be mad. I'm just a minority, sweat no worry. Peace out.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "While other musical animes don't have a good plot, Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso has a good a interesting plot (thought the title of the anime can tell a good part of what you are expectating)\r\nThe story is about Arima Kousei a ex-pianist that one day gets invited by he friends to go hang out with they to show Watari(a friend of Arima) a girl named Kaori Miyazono, Arima go to the local first and see Kaori playing a instrument, immediately Kousei fall in love for the girl that like his friend.\r\nA few episodes later Kaori tells Kousei to be her companion for a show,Kousei refuses it but later on he accept it.\\n\\n\r\nWhen he start playing everything is good but he remembers of his dead mother saying, to him \"That's your punition\", and he starts playing very bad since he cannot hear the notes, he look at Kaori and with determination and he start, playing the piano again but he imagine the sounds.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSo basically the first part is focused on Kousei forgetting those bad memories and choose better memories so he can play the piano nice.\\n\r\nThe other part is focused on Kaori disease.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is outstanding, it's hard to see animes with good art these days, this one of the reasons I didn't stop watching it.\\n\\n\r\nAbout the characters, I can say in the beggining Kousei is a very very boring character, Tsubaki is dumb until the end of the anime, Watari is funny, Kaori is the typical character that is dumb but still fun and can bring you tears to your eyes.\\n\\n\r\nThe anime has a lot I mean a lot of Melodrama, every episode someone is in depression or cry a lot and someone shows up to cheer up. I Don't get mad with a bit of drama, but in every episode it starts getting boring and repetitious and predictable.\\n\\n\r\nMy final opinion is this:\\n\\n\r\nWhile this anime has a good art, music and good characters, it fails in character development, it uses a lot of melodrama, the story is too much predictable. I Liked the anime, but this anime can have a lot of opposite opinions because of the melodrama.\\n",

            "content": "Here\u2019s some interesting fruit for thought: imagine a world without music or sound. A place void of lyrics, voices, or emotions. It would look pretty hollow doesn\u2019t it? For a character named Kousei Arima, he knows what it\u2019s like to be around music. During his childhood, he became a child prodigy with his talent in playing the piano. But one single solidary moment changed his life forever and his world became hollow.  From the child prodigy he once was, Kousei is now a normal kid attending school with his friends. Until one day, he meets a beautiful young girl named Kaori Miyazono who couldmake his inner dark world just a bit brighter. This is the story of about more than just music. This is a story about conquering his demons in a world where anything is possible.\\n\\n\r\nShigatsu wa Kimi no Uso (April is Your Lie) is an anime adaptation based off the manga of the same name. However, there are two noticeable things to take consider about the source material. One is that the series is actually completed so expect a full adaptation. And two, it has won a Kodansha Manga Award for the shounen category in 2013. Thus, expectations coming into the series are relatively high. It also doesn\u2019t take long for the series to take off in the beginning as we meet Kousei and his friends. The first few episode sets up the foundation of what\u2019s to come. We meet Kousei who seems to be doing well at school with a normal personality. He has friends so loner isn\u2019t part of his vocabulary but there are also hints showing that part of his past isn\u2019t so very pleasant. The shift in balance of the series is reflected by the musical atmosphere. The way he meets Kaori could be described as a miracle as she is someone who really stands out in this show. But for what\u2019s worth, the series isn\u2019t just about music alone.\\n\\n\r\nIn many ways, the show is almost like a journey, at least for our main characters anyways. In the case of Kousei, it\u2019s much more. To him, it\u2019s about overcoming a deep scar that still remains in present day influenced by his past. This is clearly shown when he and Kaori goes up on the stage to perform but during the session, Kousei suffers a mental breakdown. We can see his grey and hollow world after realizing that he cannot \u201chear the music notes\u201d from the piano. Of course, this can all be interpreted as a mental sphere as all these events are going through his mind. The talking cat, the water-like dream phases, and broken piano notes serves more as a metaphor. In this way, the show does an outstanding job in reflecting Kousei\u2019s mental stability. It doesn\u2019t take long for viewers to find out that the cause is Kousei\u2019s overbearing mother. You ever been part of a family where your parents push you beyond your limits? I\u2019m talking about the type where they expect you to come out as #1 every single time. Kousei\u2019s mother is something along that line but what\u2019s more so is her final moments that really stung Kousei in the heart. So for this show, it\u2019s about how Kousei can recover from that in this journey infused with both music and interpersonal issues. On another level, there\u2019s also Kaori and her problems. Although her past isn\u2019t influenced by an overbearing parent, there\u2019s something that is holding her back. It doesn\u2019t take long for the show to make viewers suspect that she may not be a perfectly healthy girl like some of us think she may be. Just do take a note that the show can sometimes be staggering when it comes to transition between events from the past and present. The timing is a key and it nails it on spot when it finds its way. However, the show sometimes over-saturates it to a point where it may become an annoyance or overbearing.\\n\\n\r\nOf course, these two main characters are only half of the main cast. On a lighter side of the story, we have Kousei\u2019s childhood friend Tsubaki. She has an interesting past with him that brings out both a brighter and emotional side of the story. Her cherry personality is similar to that of Kaori and is always supportive of her friends. Then, there\u2019s popular school athlete Watari who is more of the ladies\u2019 man. Unfortunately, the series doesn\u2019t focus much on his character as much as the others. We don\u2019t see much about his background story and he lacks the impact of both emotional and social problems that is reflected in the other characters. What do these all four characters have in common though? There\u2019s a sense of connection. All of them are supportive with one another in their dreams. In fact, without them, Kousei\u2019s life would have been quite different than what he imagined it to be. Then, there\u2019s the more emotional side of the story involving romance. I can say this show is labeled more as a romance square. There are obvious hints to who likes although some of the characters themselves don\u2019t realize it until later in the story. However, do take not that the show isn\u2019t just focused on romance and serves more as a sub-plot; albeit an important one to bring out the interpersonal issues with the characters especially towards at the very end. Another key thing to note about character relationships is how they react to certain situations. In many ways, it\u2019s realistic and relatable to how some of our own lives. I also have to say that the growing bond between the characters remains strong from almost start to finish with every episode. \\n\\n\r\nIn a world where there is music, competition also exists. For Kousei, that also comes in sheer force with characters like Emi and Takeshi. In most shows, they would push this plot to a point where competition becomes a driven force. But in this series, Kousei\u2019s concern isn\u2019t so much about winning but about overcoming his own fears. After all, he already proved himself to be the stronger competitor in the past against the both of them. No, it\u2019s more about how Kousei can live up to people\u2019s expectations in the present. A good portion of the first half presents Kousei\u2019s fight against his inner demons. The illusionary binds of his past is his major obstacle that only he can overcome. And this is where the show gets the more dramatic when we see Kousei\u2019s multidimensional struggles. However, he also realizes for the first time that his friends are in his heart to fight with him (especially Kaori). And at the same time, it echoes Kousei\u2019s present life and how he can find ways to change. This becomes a driven factor as Kousei also plays the role of a mentor after meeting an old friend later on in the story. This is somewhat similar to Kaori\u2019s own battle as she literally fights for her life. With a tragic sense of tone, the show is able to capitalize on each pivotal moment and articulate them in a profound manner. It\u2019s also fun at the same time to see how the show is able to mix in comedy with timings during appropriate moments to make you feel more at ease. \\n\\n\r\nIf there\u2019s something else unique about the show, artwork can easily fit in that category. Taking a close glance at the visuals is like looking at lively water paint. The show has this serene-like mood wherever it goes. Each episode makes a solid effort to illustrate the backgrounds, characters, and setting with its pastel artistry. Character designs also reflect on their personalities well especially for Kaori and Kousei. It even shows the physical condition of Kaori later on as there\u2019s a dramatic change in her looks. Similarly, the show also adapts metaphors with a precise mood to reflect on whatever message it\u2019s trying to deliver. There are however occasions when the series becomes lazy in regards with the background characters. Well, it\u2019s more like the characters that just appears in the background with their single dotted eyes. But overall when it comes to art, the show knows what it\u2019s doing with it phenomenal production.\\n\\n\r\nAh yes, the music. This is probably a flagship for this series. It is a driving factor of Kousei\u2019s journey to once again realize why he began playing piano from the beginning. As this series highlights both piano and violin play (rather than singing), it adapts more of a classic tone. Famous music such as Kreutzer Sonata (Beehoven) makes a presence in this show. At the same time, it\u2019s interesting to see how the show reacts to the characters\u2019 movements on stage. Their feelings are poured in a stylistic matter to synchronize with the movements while their music speaks by itself through talent. Other noticeable music played such as Etude in E minor and Lover\u2019s Duet also makes their debut in the show to spice up the hype. Even the duet plays by Kousei and Kaori is important for their ability to move the audience beyond just the music notes. OP and ED songs on most parts has their lighthearted style such as the case of Goose House and Coala Mode. It also has some foreshadowing and imagery with a stylish portrayal that can just be so fun to watch. Finally, I give a lot of praise to the voice acting of this show. Characters are able to speak from their heart with their very real voice, perhaps an irony of the title. But for everything that comes and goes, music is something that I\u2019d stress not to forget.\\n\\n\r\nShigatsu wa Kimi no Uso has this powerful ability to convey and enlighten beyond just the musical side of its story. We get character relationships, interpersonal struggles, and all in all a journey that is filled with passion. Romance may not always prevail as a dynamic factor and the music may not be a suitable taste for everyone. However, the show captures the essence of personalities and issues. It effectively portrays a compelling cinema when it comes to performance (both in musical style and character). And furthermore, the show has a graceful portrayal at what having friends is like during the darkest of the hour. A show like this makes a lot of its concepts and themes relevant. It has a meaning that celebrates music culture and a journey of ground-shaking emotions.\\n",

            "content": "\"We\u2019re all afraid, you know.. to get up on stage. Maybe you\u2019ll mess up. Maybe they\u2019ll totally reject you. Even so, you grit your teeth and get up on stage anyway. Something compels us\u2026 moves us to play music.\" -Kaori Miyazono\r\nLife is a concert, a conglomerate of symphonies and pieces that seamlessly transition from one song to the next.  Like a concert hall, life has moments of crescendos, the rising areas where we feel accomplished, or pleased with ourselves, but it also has those moments of diminuendo, where our lives dip into sadness, failure, and despair.  There are times where we speed up,even flutter by with the trills and flings of life, and there are times where we slow down to take in the small things that we sometimes miss.  In the end though, life, much like music, ends just before the time that we finally begin to enjoy it.  It is with this, that I bring you a review of Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso, better known as \"Your lie in April.\"\\n\\n\r\nAuthor's Note:  (This is also my 100th review on MAL.  YAY!  :D  )\\n\\n\r\nStory (8.89/10): Arima Kousei was once a brilliant prodigy on the piano.  Known throughout the entire music community in his hometown, he has now fallen into despair with the passing of his mother, also known as his music teacher.  With the despair of losing one of the most important people in his life, Kousei has fallen into despair, now according to him, unable to hear the notes of the piano, now unable to hear or use his last tie to his now deceased mother.  It is here in his despair and sorrow that on one faithful day in spring, underneath the cherry blossom trees, he hears the sound of music playing, and he meets the girl known as Kaori Miyazono, the girl who would change his life forever.\\n\\n\r\nShigatsu, as I like to call it, follows the story of Kousei as he, his friends Watari and Tsubaki , and most importantly, Kaori, bring Kousei back to the world of music, putting him in front of his trials, and the past the he is so desperately conflicted about.  What I think this story excels so much in, is how we as the audience look through what Kousei is experiencing and go along with him as this new life of his takes him on a journey that he has never experienced before.  We experience what being a pianist is like, and what kind of trials and tribulations someone of this career path experiences.  (You know, without all the methodical practice.  It kinda skips over that thankfully.)  At the beginning, the show uses this kind of story as its plot.  But as it advances, it changes into something more.  \\n\\n\r\nShigatsu utilizes the theme of life as its main focal point in the series.  Throughout the series, the show not only focuses on Kousei's story, but also the people that are around him.  In life, we have many people around us that help us in different ways.  Similar to this, Shigatsu uses this idea by running much shorter stories to our main protagonist, making the anime feel a little bit more real and developed.  Within these, other character's ideals make the focal point of the series for just a brief moment and give the series more life.  \\n\\n\r\nIn addition, Shigatsu has its own unique way of storytelling, a very brilliant way of doing so, I might add.  In terms of actual dialogue, the show doesn't really utilize that as much as a normal anime would.  Instead, half of the subtitles that you will be reading will be utilized in internal character monologues.  Very often, the show will transition from a character interaction to a moment in time that focuses solely on one character thinking to his/herself.  With this, the audience gets a very clear picture as to what the certain character is thinking at the moment, and the emotions that they are conveying become very prominent and clear to the viewer.  Personally, I think that this is a great way to showcase the expansive amount of character growth in this series solely because of the fact that the internal monologues provide the viewer and easier way of understanding what each individual character is coming to terms with.  It perfectly encapsulates what this show is about and it is by far, one of the highest points this show has in terms of storytelling.  Sadly though, no show is without its flaws.  (Now that would be a lie, if it didn't.)\\n\\n\r\nPacing is what I feel is one of the biggest flaws in this anime.  With the show being 22 episodes long, the show is split up into two equal parts of 11 episodes, each half dealing with something different with progression of time.  The biggest flaw I have seen with this show is the fact that both halves are incredibly different in terms of pacing.  Bluntly put, the first half is way too drawn out and rather slow, while the second half is slightly rushed, with a good chunk of details missing.  In addition, the show while provides little sidestories for a good deal of the cast, doesn't really do it for all.  Two very prominent characters, Watari and Emi, don't get any portion of the story really devoted to themselves, as evident of the lack of personal narratives/internal monologues that a lot of characters have.  While these flaws don't seem very big, in a show where story progression and character growth, explanation, and development are essential to the themes it was trying to convey, they become very glaring and put a bad chord to this show.\\n\\n\r\nOverall though, Shigatsu's story was executed very well.  While missing some details, the anime encapsulated the manga to a near perfect status, and finished the story of this beautiful little tale with a very heartfelt and emotional ending.  The show deals with the hardships of loss, the grand thoughts of our own personal dreams and aspirations, the happiness and despair that life brings us, and overall, the idea of no matter how hard we are beaten down, we must keep moving forward.  No matter what happens, we must keep on living.\\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+  Simple, yet beautiful story\\n\r\n+  Exudes character growth and development\\n\r\n+  Internal monologues help with story-telling\\n\r\n-   Pacing varies from episode to episode, creating imbalance\\n\r\n-   Lacking growth/importance for some relatively key characters\\n\\n\r\nCharacters (8.76/10): In Shigatsu, the characters represent the instruments to a symphony.  As they spin the tale of music, each individual character provides their own part to the song \"plot\", creating their own sound that melds well with the piece known as \"Your lie in April.\"\\n\\n\r\nArima Kousei is our main protagonist in this series.  As a prodigy on the piano, he has since two years prior to the story's beginning not performed in a piano competition, squandering around his miserable life day in and day out of his home as he deals with his mother's loss, forcing himself to play the thing that he hates the most even though he, according to him, \"Can't hear the notes.\"  Kousei out of all of the characters in this series gets the most character development, with every character warping around him as some kind of inspiration in order to help sing the tune that is his life.  As the series progresses, you can see the progress he makes as a character as he relearns the piano, develop his own personal sound, and get closer to the people around him, especially one special girl.  \\n\\n\r\nAnd then, we have Kaori Miyazono.  According to Kousei, Kaori is a selfish girl, a violent brute who forces him to go along with whatever antic she has come up with, making him go along with whatever she wants to do at the time, and punishing him every time he does something that displeases her.  Kaori serves as Kousei's main inspiration and focus for why he plays the piano.  Throughout the whole series, you can see how Kaori and Kousei grow a bond together, blossoming the aspect of life known as bonds and closeness between people.  In the beginning, you don't really learn much about Kaori, but instead, about the influence that she has as you watch Kousei admire this girl's freedom and tenacity for life.  As the series goes on though, you learn more about her, understanding more about who Kaori Miyazono is.  What I think is a flaw for Kaori is the fact that she really remains a mystery for the show up until the very last episode.  With a character that is so essential to the plot, the show doesn't really put much attention towards her past like a lot of other characters.  While saving all the facts till the end does work for the show to some degree, I still wished that the series gave a bit more information on Kaori as a person during the span of the show rather than saving everything till the end.  \\n\\n\r\nApart from these two, we have the other two \"main\" characters, Tsubaki and Watari.  These two are an interesting duo of characters primarily because of the fact that rather than serving as main characters, they don't really show up all too often.  The amount of screentime they both get doesn't really make them seem like a main character at all.  Even less so for Watari's case because he really doesn't serve much of a purpose for the series besides one key point.  This is evident  because Watari doesn't actually get a single monologue to himself, instead, really just being that dude who likes soccer and girls.  As for Tsubaki, the series does flesh her out a little more as a character.  While small in comparison to Kousei, it was a nice addition to the story that in the long run, did play out some significance to the overall story.  \\n\\n\r\nAs for supporting cast, the series does well in developing a good number of its side characters.  From Takashi and his little sister's aspirations for piano, to Hiroko's atonement for her past deeds.  Apart from them though, the other characters serve rather minimal roles, but are really of no downside to the series.  However, like I have mentioned before, the character known as Emi doesn't particularly get much development.  I find this odd because she's on the same level of importance as the characters mentioned above, yet she doesn't really get any time devoted to herself.  It's this imbalance that leaves the sound of the show slightly off-key because pretty much every other character that has some sort of importance towards Kousei is given a section of the show devoted to them.  \\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+  Fantastic character growth\\n\r\n+  Growth for side characters relevant to the story\\n\r\n-   Kaori's development came too late/involvement wasn't there\\n\r\n-   Several key characters didn't receive same treatment as others\\n\\n\r\nArt and sound (9.09/10):  A-1 pictures have done it again.  Shigatsu wa kimi no uso is an anime that has very stunning visuals.  From the first minute of the series, the show is breathtaking to look at, utilizing a very light and detailed environment and artstyle as its way of conveying the story.  Showcasing a lot of symbolism during the piano performance scenes is also what this show excels at doing, utilizing visual imagery to convey the emotions that the pianists playing at the time are conveying, making the pre-recorded concert music sound very stunning.  \\n\\n\r\nThe show uses a dual artstyle in order to convey what it wants to show.  In addition to the already stunning visuals that the show normally provides, Shigatsu also has a comedic style of animation to it, essentially reverting the characters to become little demonic sprites of themselves rather than their ordinary, beautifully looking representations.  While this is quite niche, the show does suffer a little bit from this.  The reason being is that sometimes, the comedic artstyle doesn't really fit really well with scene that it's placed in, (sometimes putting it in a scene with its standard animation), which can really leave an ugly sound.  Sometimes, the comedic style can look downright bad because it's so unfitting of the moment it's being used in.  \\n\\n\r\nAs for music, there is no denying that an anime about music would express such a beautiful set of tracks.  Because the series is split into two parts, each part features their own OP and ED.  For openings, we have \"Hikaru Nara\" and \"Nanairo Symphony\".  Both of these tracks are beautiful to listen to.  Hikaru Nara has a very big band feel to it, with a group of 6 people known as Goose House singing a six part harmony to the song, while Nanairo Symphony uses a single singer in a small band.  Both of these openings are beautiful and stunning in their own way, giving off their own individual feels that can drive one to not only sing to the lyrics (given they've heard it long enough), but dance and move along to the beat.  \\n\\n\r\nAs for endings, we have \"Kirameki\" for the first half, and \"Orange\" for the second half.  Compared to their opening counterparts, these two have very different emotions for each of them.  While they both utilize one singer, Kirameki gives off the hopeful and bright feel that corresponds to the pleasant feelings that life can give us, while Orange sings a sorrow filled and regretful tone responding to the sadness that life can deal us.  All four of these tracks I feel are very memorable pieces that deserve credit where credit is due because when anime music is exceptionally memorable, I feel it should be considered a masterpiece.\\n\\n\r\nIn addition, Shigatsu's OST is fantastic to listen to.  While the entire OST is more or less filled with tracks that sound rather similar, with only slight variations of instruments being used to play the tracks, practically every track is beautiful in their own way, and each are memorable in their own way.  Each piece is used at the right moments in the anime and help exemplify the power that each scene has, thus, making the \"feels train\" hit just a little bit harder.\\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+  Stunning animation\\n\r\n+  Fantastic soundtrack\\n\r\n+/-  Comedic art style is hit/miss\\n\r\n+/-  Good chunk of the OST sounds rather similar\\n\\n\r\nPersonal Enjoyment (9.78/10):  When I first saw this show on Anichart, my first thought was \"Cool!  A music anime that's actually about music!\"  (Sorry, the memories of K-on being a \"music anime\" flooded in)  When I first started this series, I knew that this was going to be good the moment I started.  I expected myself to be completely blown away by what I was about to witness.  In the end though, I was sorta right.  \\n\\n\r\nDid I like this anime?\\n\\n\r\nAbsolutely.  As a music player myself, it was easy to engross myself in the beautiful soundtrack and the concert pieces that this anime featured during its runtime.  Not only were the aesthetics amazing, but I found myself engrossed with the story, feeling depressed and sad after every episode.  The characters for the most part drew me in, and I was glad that this series didn't disappoint me.  \\n\\n\r\nWhat didn't I like about this anime?\\n\\n\r\nAs I have stated before, with a show that tries its best to stay true to what it wants to do, any messups become clear as day.  For Shigatsu, the flaws existed partially in every genre I have analyzed.  The pacing of the series is unbalanced and many times, jump over things and sometimes don't let certain events/moments sink in fully, skipping to the next part without a moment's notice.  In addition, the comedic visual style clashes heavily with the standard animation, leaving the viewer to view the scene as weird, and the character growth/explanation for certain characters (especially Kaori) were not brought to its fullest extent, and docked the series down a bit.\\n\\n\r\nWould I recommend this anime?\\n\\n\r\nYes.  Personally, I feel like Shigatsu is a great example and representation of life in animated form.  It begins slow like the beginning of a piece, rising up and up with every note being played, before ending on a soft major chord before you even realize that the series is over.  It represents the beauty and terrifying nature that our own futures have, and that no matter what, we have to look forward.  Drama isn't everyone's favorite genre, and it's understandable if music isn't either.  But, from what I've seen, Shigatsu is a beautiful show, stunning in almost every aspect, and is a prime example of what a good anime can be.  Saying that it's perfect, well it's a bit much.  Saying it's a touching and well-written story, well, it'd be a lie if I said it wasn't.\\n\\n\r\nOverall Score: 8.95/10",

            "content": "\"Your Lie In April\" is a transparent attempt to pull at your heartstrings, and it works well.\r\nThe best part of this anime is how it ties character growth to musical ability.  You can have fantastic piano technique, but if you're temperamental, immature, or just plain boring, it will come across in your music.  Kousei's character growth comes across well in his playing, and that goes for the other characters too.  The show manages to make multi-episode piano competitions interesting, which is itself quite the accomplishment.\r\nThe other good part is how it depicts the characters' struggles to figure out what they want fromlife.  Becoming a world-class musician requires immense sacrifice, and finding the motivation to pour your heart into one of Chopin's Etudes for the hundredth time is no small task for a child.  The struggle to produce collides head-on with the cold reality that sometimes you're just not good enough... something that's mirrored in the athletic careers of Kousei's two friends.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are well done all around.  They all get to show their strong and weak sides, they have motivations and doubts, they lie and do things that they'll regret.  Kousei's mentor, Seto, is refreshing when she arrives, because she brings both a mature perspective to the situation as well as a more adult set of problems.\\n\\n\r\nBut there are two issues.\\n\\n\r\nFirst, this anime has no business being 22 episodes long.  There is simply not 22 episodes worth of content.  It matches the source material rather closely, but I would rather have seen a couple filler episodes with new content rather than have it stretched out so much.  Some parts drag on a bit, and in a few parts, the events are depicted in anachronic order to pad out the time a bit.\\n\\n\r\nSecond, the drama is far too obvious.  Did you see the ending coming?  You should have.  This is a very \"architected\" plot: everything that happens supports the plot, and the characters never get the opportunity to go off the rails.\\n\\n\r\nReviewers on this site are a bit too fond of shows that try to make you cry.  This show currently sits at #14, not far below \"Clannad: After Story\" at #6.  Yes, \"Your Lie In April\" is good, but it's not that good.  It hits all the right notes but it never gives you any doubt about what's going to happen next.  You'll enjoy the show but it will never challenge you.",

I would go as far as saying that most of them were completely unnecessary.\\n\r\nThe only good developed character is the main protagonist who starts as a dull, gutless Shinji (from Neon Genesis Evangelion) clone who has no reason to play music anymore to something slightly better.\\n\r\nAnd another thing the character of Kaori got very late development. For the 90 % of the show she was just a forceful tsundere doing forceful things.\\n\\n\r\nThe main reason i even watched this sad excuse for an anime was because of the classic music it promised and it delivered.\\n\r\nThere are some timeless pieces from Beethoven, Chopin, Rachmaninoff and other prominent names of the music world.\\n\r\nTho the Opening and the ending however were absolutely horrendous,but i have to say they were fitting for a show of the same caliber.\\n\r\nThe voice acting was good,but not because of an amazing Seiyu cast,but instead of how easy it is to voice characters so shallow.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation of is beautiful full of vibrant backgrounds.\\n\r\nAnother thing that made an impression on me was the scenes in which an instrument is being played the animation was at its peak.\\n\r\nThe art itself is just plain moe which can piss some viewers,but that doesn't mean it's bad.And Unlike other moeblob the characters in this one have full lips.\\n\r\nWhat more can you want ?A good story ?Who needs those !?Just gimme dat tsundere loli!\\n\\n\r\nAlthough having great Sound and decent animation,this anime had MAJOR phasing problem jumping from the tragedies of the main hero to the romance of a minor characters,pointless character interactions and some''genius'' mind though using monologues to the point of beating a dead horse.\\n\r\nAt one point i just wanted Kousei to get in the damn robot!\\n\\n\r\nFor some actually good anime that revolves around music i point you towards Sakamichi no Apollon, White Album 2, Nana and Nodame Cantabile. Heck if being a weeb is not quite your tempo you might even watch Whiplash.(ba-dum-tss!)",

            "content": "This review has spoilers so if you haven\u2019t watched Shigatsu yet, just scroll down to the bottom for the (spoiler-free) pros and cons section. If you do decide to read all of it, then you\u2019ve been warned, it\u2019s pretty long.\r\nI would start by explaining the plot but I\u2019m sure you know what it\u2019s about by now. If you don\u2019t know, go read it and come back. Did you read it? I don\u2019t know about you but its premise to me sounds amazing. In fact, before Shigatsu aired, I thought it would be the easiest 10 I have ever given a show. However, I was quitewrong and I\u2019ll tell you just how bad this show actually turned out to be.\\n\\n\\n\r\nThis is a romance and drama anime, and in shows of these genres the cast of characters is the most important aspect. There\u2019s a lot to say about them but to summarize our cast in just two words, it\u2019d be \u201cmediocre\u201d and \u201cunderdeveloped.\u201d There\u2019s honestly not much to say about our MC, Kousei Arima. I liked him most of the time. The only time I felt frustrated with him was when, in one episode, his mom\u2019s ghost finally smiles and it looks like he overcame his fear of playing but a couple of episodes later, he\u2019s back to crying and clutching his head. What happened to all that character development, ehh??? Oh yeah, there was also that one time he said \u201cKaori\u2019s the only person I need\u201d even though his friends have been with him longer than Kaori has. How can you just ignore your friends like that for some girl you just met? Despite that, he\u2019s the only character who gets a decent amount of development and his outlook on life changes by the end. If you compare how he was at the beginning with how he ended up, there\u2019s definitely a difference. \\n\\n\r\nOur other MC, Kaori, is one of the worst-written characters I\u2019ve ever come across in any medium. She has no definitive personality and most of the time she\u2019s insufferable. At the beginning she seemed like a nice girl but as it went on, the worse and worse she got. She could be replaced by a cardboard cutout of a VS Pink model with a speech bubble saying \u201cYou can do it!\u201d and the show would be 10 times better. She\u2019s just a plot device and because of that, the author forgot to give her a personality. The little bit of personality she DOES have makes no sense and is just all around inconsistent. One second she\u2019s smiling and telling Arima to believe in himself and the next she\u2019s hitting him for no reason. At least in other shows, the tsundere hits the MC because he embarrassed her or made himself look like a pervert, but with Kaori, she hits him for literally no reason. Every time Arima asked angrily \u201cwhat was that for?!\u201d I was asking myself the exact same thing. Why, Kaori, did you hit Kousei when he did nothing to hurt or embarrass you? Please tell me, I want to know just as much as he does. Kaori also loves to spout philosophical BS that sounds like she got from one of those Tumblr pages filled with filtered photos with \u201cinspirational\u201d text on it that girls like so much. She makes those stupid philosophical speeches many times, too. It\u2019s not endearing, it makes it seem like she\u2019s trying too hard with this \u201ccarefree and happy\u201d vibe she\u2019s trying to project. Kaori is also manipulative, proven by the fact that she cried one time to get Kousei to be her accompanying pianist. She could\u2019ve just calmly told him that she admires him (I\u2019m sure he\u2019s quite used to hearing those type of comments) but no, she had to go and cry. And to make her personality even more confusing, there was that one time she asked Kousei out of the blue, \u201cwanna commit double suicide? Nah, just kidding.\u201d Her \u201cpersonality\u201d is an utter mess. That\u2019s not her only flaw, though. We barely find out anything about her. The only things we know about her is that she likes sweets, cats and that she always wanted to perform with Arima ever since seeing one of his performances when she was little. That\u2019s pretty much it. Her character is confusing, extremely underdeveloped and there\u2019s no way someone like her can exist in real life. I do not understand why people think she is a good character and cry when she dies. She isn\u2019t realistic, relatable or likeable so why do so many people feel sad when she dies? It\u2019s like if you were watching someone kick rocks. Do you cry when you see those poor rocks getting kicked about? Hell no, they\u2019re lifeless rocks. That\u2019s exactly what Kaori dying is like to me. I don\u2019t feel sad or anything because it doesn\u2019t feel like she could be an actual person, as if she\u2019s just some rock.\\n\\n\r\nTsubaki is another main character and Arima\u2019s childhood friend and as with every \u201cchildhood friend\u201d clich\u00e9, she likes Arima and boy, does she take forever to realize it. It was absolutely infuriating waiting for her to come to terms with her feelings already. Her chibi comedy bits were unfunny and incredibly annoying. Most of the chibi segments consisted of her yelling nonsense at the people around her. The worst example of those comedy bits being unfunny and just plain disrespectful was when in the last episode, Kousei is reading Kaori\u2019s letter by the train tracks, there\u2019s a sad atmosphere and all, and then Tsubaki shows up uninvited and kicks him in the shin (while looking like a chibi) and yells at him \u201cdon\u2019t ever think you\u2019re alone!\u201d  Who thought that was an okay thing to add to that scene??\\n\\n\r\nWatari is Arima\u2019s other friend and another plot device. There are two plot device characters in this show??? Yup. Watari only exists so Kaori and Arima can meet, and Kaori only exists so Arima can feel better again without getting any actual development of her own. Back to Watari. His only traits are: acting like a playboy and liking cute girls and acting like a bro to Arima. Even when he said he liked Kaori (for some reason), Watari just put his arm around Arima\u2019s neck and said \u201cI know.\u201d Watari\u2019s 100% top bro material. Too bad he barely gets any character development, either. There was a scene with him where I felt was the ONLY time I actually related to a character on this show and it was when his soccer team lost a match and he cried over their loss. That\u2019s kind of childish but I\u2019m sure everybody has lost a match or some competition and cried or at least FELT like crying. I could relate to how he was feeling at that moment. However, that\u2019s the only lick of development he gets in the whole show. After that he\u2019s mostly just ignored. \\n\\n\r\nThere are a bunch of supporting characters that are just\u2026.there. They don\u2019t add anything to the story nor do their personalities get fleshed out. There\u2019s Takeshi, Arima\u2019s \u201crival,\u201d whose main traits are: sporting a frown most of the time, acting confident in his piano-playing skills and having one of the most ridiculous hairstyles I have ever seen. Seriously, his hair\u2019s ridiculousness rivals even JP\u2019s from Redline. He would be completely forgettable if it weren\u2019t for his retarded hair. There\u2019s the other \u201crival,\u201d Emi, who is only there because the author says so. She likes Kousei as well, so I guess her only real purpose is to be the third girl in his little harem. She\u2019s a pretty useless character too. Here\u2019s my problem with Arima\u2019s \u201crivals\u201d: their \u201crivalry\u201d doesn\u2019t feel like a rivalry because he doesn\u2019t care about them. Not once, during a competition, did Kousei look at them, acknowledge that they have talent and say \u201cI\u2019m gonna beat you guys!\u201d like actual rivals do. Takeshi and Emi think of Arima as their rival but he didn\u2019t even remember their NAMES when he met them again after their last competition together. It\u2019s a one-sided rivalry and that\u2019s why I put quotation marks around the word \u201crival,\u201d because Arima himself doesn\u2019t think of them as rivals, he just ignores them most of the time, like their talent is nothing compared to HIS talent. There\u2019s also Nagi, Takeshi\u2019s little sister. She likes to say \u201cwhat a clich\u00e9!\u201d a lot, which is extremely annoying. Even though she only got a couple of episodes in the spotlight, I felt like I understood more of her personality than I understood Kaori\u2019s in the entire show. Arima\u2019s teacher and mother figure, Hiroko, was a pretty nice person and I liked her. She didn\u2019t annoy me and there were no scenes with her where I felt like strangling her. She\u2019s probably the best character in the whole show mainly because there aren\u2019t any glaring flaws in her personality or role. I\u2019m going to talk about one other character that people never mention in reviews: Kashiwagi, Tsubaki\u2019s friend. She had literally the worst character introduction I have ever seen: by not getting introduced. One episode, she\u2019s not there, and the next she\u2019s hanging around Tsubaki and getting screentime. I thought I accidentally skipped an episode when I saw her. We never find out anything about her, she doesn\u2019t do anything to help Arima nor do anything significant of any sort. Heck, she even got a spot in the second OP. But just look at her MAL page. There\u2019s nothing on it. She shows up a lot and there\u2019s no info on her to put on there. \\n\r\nYou see all these supporting characters I talked about? Yeah, all of them are pretty much useless. They don\u2019t have very interesting personalities not did I ever feel like wanting to learn more about them.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, the cast is absolute garbage. None of the characters are interesting and character development is non-existent in this show. Arima was the only one who got even a bit of development while everyone else was ignored. But hey, he\u2019s our main character, he\u2019s the only one that REALLY matters here, amirite?\\n\\n\\n\r\nThere is also an insane amount of flashbacks, foreshadowing, deathflags and inner monologues. Even the supporting characters get flashbacks. There are TOO. MANY. FLASHBACKS. The \u201cforeshadowing\u201d was incredibly obvious and made you see the ending coming from a mile away. They even made it seem like Kaori had a chance of living. There was one scene where her doctor tells her that she can have surgery and she decides to have it. This scene brought us false hope, making us think she\u2019ll live, but since we\u2019ve been stuffed to our necks with deathflags, it\u2019s no surprise she ends up dying anyway. In one of the later episodes, Kousei comes out of the hospital (after visiting Kaori) feeling depressed, he sees that the black cat that REPRESENTS KAORI is lying on the street after being run over, dying, and he picks it up and tries to help it but it dies anyway. If that isn\u2019t the most obvious \u201cforeshadowing\u201d ever, I don\u2019t know what it is. It\u2019s not subtle, that\u2019s for sure. The inner monologues are just as annoying as the flashbacks and they show up at the most inappropriate of times: during performances. The most idiotic example of inner monologues interrupting the music being played was in one of Emi\u2019s performances. Instead of hearing the piece she\u2019s playing, what do you hear instead? Emi\u2019s voice in her head exclaiming, \u201cHibike! Hibike!\u201d Just STFU, Emi, and let me hear the song you\u2019re playing! I hate it when people praise this show for having classical music in it when you can barely hear it. All you hear is the characters\u2019 voices OVER the music.\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe \u201cromance\u201d in this show is abysmal. If anything, it\u2019s quite shallow. Kaori started to become interested in Arima after hearing one of his performances (and the reason why I say Kaori was only \u201cinterested\u201d in Arima and she didn\u2019t \u201clike\u201d him is because we never find out if she likes him or not. This makes their little romance one-sided), and the only reason why Arima started to like Kaori was because of her violin-playing and her little inspirational speeches. What, does he go falling in love with every one of his therapists, too? Because that\u2019s basically what Kaori is to Arima. There is no romantic development between our two MCs, and they like each other for very stupid reasons. \\n\\n\\n\r\nOne last thing I want to talk about is Kaori\u2019s disease. They NEVER tell us what disease she actually has. It\u2019s like the author just HAD to make her have some sort of disease but didn\u2019t care enough to think about exactly WHAT disease she will have. I have seen people try and GUESS what disease she has based on her symptoms. The very fact that people had to GUESS and that the show never told us is incredibly lazy on the author\u2019s part.\\n\\n\\n\r\nI will talk about the good parts, though. The OPs and EDs were above-average. I even listen to 2 of the songs regularly because I just liked them SO MUCH. I have one complaint, though: the second OP wasn\u2019t as good as the first one (although I still liked it) and it didn\u2019t fit the overall tone of the show in the second half. Luckily, the second ED makes up for the positivity of the OP with a more sad melody, definitely fitting the tone better than the OP. The animation was pretty good and the backgrounds were lovely. The actual animation was pretty solid, for the most part, but sometimes they used still shots during performances, so whenever they did that it just looked lazy. I was quite pleasantly surprised at how the last episode and Kaori\u2019s death played out. The last episode was really well done (except for that one scene with Tsubaki I mentioned earlier). I thought the last episode would have a really depressing tone and lots of crying and screaming from Arima but the atmosphere was actually quite mellow compared to other episodes and there was no crying, either. After Kaori\u2019s death, they skipped the whole grieving process (I\u2019m quite thankful they did that) and moved ahead to a little while after her death when the characters have gotten used to her being gone and have stopped crying. This creates a very peaceful atmosphere. Another thing, Kaori\u2019s \u201cdeath\u201d scene was actually quite tasteful and special, in a way. The way they showed her \u201cdying\u201d was a pretty good way to show her leaving the world. And that concludes my points on the good parts of Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso.\\n\\n\r\nAs for my personal enjoyment\u2026..there was none. At the beginning I quite liked it but the more it went on the more I hated it. I didn\u2019t ENJOY watching these kids deal with their problems. If anything, I feel only pity towards these characters, living in that sorry little world of theirs.\\n\\n\r\n****************************************************************\\n\\n\r\nPros \\n\r\n+ Above average OPs and EDs\\n\r\n+ Good animation \\n\r\n+ The last episode was well done\\n\\n\r\nCons\\n\r\n- Characters are unrelatable, boring and underdeveloped\\n\r\n- Lots of useless characters\\n\r\n- Foreshadowing was incredibly obvious, completely ruining the ending \\n\r\n- Too many flashbacks and inner monologues \\n\r\n- The slapstick chibi parts weren\u2019t funny and uncalled for at times\\n\r\n- Terrible \u201cromantic\u201d development\\n\r\n- Performances kept getting interrupted by inner monologues, not allowing you to actually hear the music being played\\n\\n\\n\r\nFor those that haven\u2019t watched Shigatsu yet: if you like classical music, don\u2019t watch this because you can\u2019t even hear the music anyway. If you like romance, don\u2019t watch this because it\u2019s not romantic in the least. If you like watching realistic and interesting characters, then DON\u2019T. WATCH. THIS. Don\u2019t even watch it for any of the pros I listed. Just look up the OPs and EDs on youtube and save yourself some time. Don\u2019t watch it for the last episode because it\u2019s in no way worth suffering through 21 other episodes to watch, and if you\u2019re watching it for the animation then you\u2019re watching anime wrong. None of the pros I listed are worth picking this show up to watch.\\n\\n\\n\r\nI gave this show a 2 because there is NOTHING about this show that could\u2019ve saved it. I couldn\u2019t even find anything about the characters or story that was actually good. The only reason why I didn\u2019t give it a 1 was because I loved the opening and ending songs, but that\u2019s it. This show is garbage and it\u2019s not even worth the salary of the animators who made it. It is horrifying that so many people think that this show is good simply because it made them CRY. Just because it made you cry doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s a good anime, it just means you\u2019re a huge baby who gets attached to cardboard cutout characters easily. I\u2019m probably the biggest crybaby I know and I couldn\u2019t even FORCE myself to cry at the end. It is a disgrace that better shows such as Yojouhan Shinwa Taikei and Uchouten Kazoku get rated lower than this turd.\\n",

            "content": "Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso. \r\nMy first proper review.\r\nPeople go through life following the path they've chosen and often they encounter stories along the way that they never forget. Those stories, the living and breathing characters in those stories, the vivid worlds birthed from within the story, all of them break into fragments and get meshed into your being, into your personality, into your mind and soul. Those stories we all encounter shape up who we are, and this is one of them.\r\nThis particular fantasy, holds beautiful fragments in the form of music, faces, dialogue, emotions, struggles, imagery and sensations all bursting with color. Theymaterialize inside you as valuable lessons that will forever be engraved in your mind.\\n\\n\r\nThe lessons themselves, they teach you that sometimes you need someone to push you forward and believe in you if you wish to achieve anything great. They teach you the power and freedom that music, human passion and art in all its forms has to offer. They teach you how to say goodbye and how to embrace what fragments and memories the people you encountered throughout your life have given you, even though they've drifted away. They teach you that nothing that's great or beautiful comes without a tiny bit of sacrifice, sweat and strife. The lessons teach you how to cope, heal and keep on moving through another spring, with a smile on your face and fragments in your heart.\\n\\n\r\nThere's a lot you can assimilate from this series, especially if you marathon 22 episodes in two days like I have, so I want to wish you a fun little ride, because it will definitely be something you won't forget any time soon, if ever.\\n\\n\r\n- Story: 7/10 Good -\\n\\n\r\nThe story might be perceived as somewhat clich\u00e9 by the veterans out there, but what mattered the most to me was the pacing and flow of everything. How every center piece unraveled in the beginning, how the narrative accelerated in small crescendo steps, with peaks every couple episodes. It was all that I was looking for. The story might have some imperceivable flaws in it and be a template straight-forward romantic comedy, but after all, what matters is the imprint it leaves on you. The story does show you multiple perspectives of other characters occasionally, which I really enjoyed. \\n\\n\r\nThe comedic aspect of the show is decent, not great, but it sometimes stands out as bad by being misplaced in between several serious scenes that were developing nicely and it saddens you when you see that cut happen, but you get used to it after the first two or three times.\\n\\n\r\nThe romance aspect is constantly being displayed throughout each episode, but it alternates in importance gradually. Sometimes love becomes the focus, but there are other emotions out there beside it, some maybe more complex to explain, and the story has an entire spectrum of feelings for you to experience.\\n\\n\r\nThe story delves into darker parts as well, and that's what makes it good in my book. Treating matters like trauma, chronic illness the way it has been here departs it from many other works of the same genre, and ascends it in a higher place.\\n\\n\r\n- Art/Animation: 9/10 Great -\\n\\n\r\nIt's bursting with color, and everything rises from monotones. Technical achievements is what carries a work of art, and in this case it does more than enough justice to the underlying world it aimed to build. The synesthesia between the imagery and the sound is an absolutely superb dance of two well known art forms: animation and music.\\n\\n\r\nThe art and animation is in a supporting role, the main stage being taken by the music. Because of that, it's not as great as other examples out there, but it's great nonetheless. In this show, the animation in art was made for the music.\\n\\n\r\nAll of this becomes clear when it reaches the pinnacle at the end of the series.\\n\\n\r\n- Sound/Music: 10/10 Outstanding -\\n\\n\r\nYou can't help but stand up, applaud and ask for an \"Encore!\" after you experience this recital. By far the most vivid imprints and fragments you get from it are the music presented in its raw form: classical music. If this show doesn't make you adore classical music, then probably nothing will.\\n\\n\r\nThe emotions are conveyed masterfully through the soundtrack. I haven't seen a show mirror the story and characters as well as Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso. As expected from an anime that revolves around music, it doesn't disappoint.\\n\\n\r\nVoice acting is top notch, too. There was no point in dragging the quality of the characters down if the instruments were so well spoken, wasn't it?\\n\\n\r\nAn aural delight. \\n\\n\r\n- Characters: 8/10 Very Good - \\n\\n\r\nThe characters themselves aren't anything out of the ordinary. They're just young boys and girls that have their own paths to trek, their own struggles and ambitions, and I love how they've played their respective roles. \\n\\n\r\nThe bad parts like the over-dramatic bursts of the characters and general elongated monologue scenes are not that big of a deal, unless you're the type of person that either cringes too easily or doesn't like to get too emotional. I personally enjoyed that intensity, even though many times it wasn't that warranted.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters become dear to you, bit by bit as you get to know them. Some side characters don't shine that brightly, but the main ones do very much that.\\n\\n\r\n- Enjoyment: 10/10 Outstanding - \\n\\n\r\nOverall, this has to be one of my favorite experiences I received from watching an animated series, ever. It's true what they say that the whole is more than the sum of its parts, and the way this entire jigsaw puzzle shapes up and ends with a masterfully executed center-piece is just astonishing to witness.\\n\\n\r\n- Overall: 9/10 Great - \\n\\n\r\nI can't recommend it enough to anyone that can hear music.",

            "content": "The feels, Meh feels, so romantic, oh the sadness and makes me wanna cri evrytiem all aboard the feel trip.\r\nThis is all I have been hearing from people who have watched Your Lie in April and given the show masterpiece praise for it's \"feel factor\" \"good characters\", and beautiful animation. So as almost everyone loved this Anime, I decided to give it a try hoping that I would also go through the same emotion and personal joy watching this Anime. \r\nInstead, no offense but all I see is a bunch of melodramatic teenage idiots trying WAY TOO HARD to make everything look sad and emotionalwhile nearly every scene being plagued with unfunny and baffling comedy that pretty much ruins the so called emotion. I don't have problems with comedy, contrary I love it but Your Lie in April doesn't do it well. Not to mention that the story is a drag and pretty much the stays very much the same and takes up a whole episode list just to get straight to one point and plagued with very stupid and pointless arcs. Let me explain the problem with this Anime, oh and the romance is POOR! I MEAN REALLY POOR!\\n\\n\r\nStory: 3/10\\n\r\nYour Lie in April's story is dry as dried omelet. The story had a promising start and for about the first few episodes seemed like a good field trip runner. But the problem already began quick. The story starts with a depressed young boy by the name of Kousei Arima who is depressed in life because of a dark past that ended in a very tragic manner and is now lost in life and is scared to play the piano again because he lost his touch with the piano. Sounds understandable at first, but the problem is the approach to this manner. Because of all of a sudden... ALL OF SUDDEN! A blonde chick named Kaori Miyazono enters his life and because he sees her playing the violin and keeps getting convinced from her and his friends in order to play the piano once again and then he is at it at long last. That to me is a awfully poor way to progress the story with that sudden change. It's not that it was handled bad, it's just that there was literally no emotion to put into it whatsoever and the way that it was handled was so forced and to an extent questionable since the drama and emotion was so forced and melodramatic that the emotion I felt was completely cut off.\\n\\n\r\nThe feel factor is mostly the most important part of the show. But I'm going to say something about this part. I didn't feel ANY feel factor whatsoever. Almost half of the scenes are forced as hell and the drama and crying are so melodramatic that I sometimes thought to myself if these were real emotions or just the script and the scenario trying their very hard to make me feel super sad. People claim the scenes are sad and while there can be some little emotion on what happens at the end this all feels like forced trashed melodrama to me and the fact that I was told by everyone that I was going to be very sad and going through a post depression feeling with this Anime made me even more angry. I mean, come on here! So many scenes  like Tsubaki's stupid cry or kousei's worry for Kaori or trying hard to get him hearing the piano again. It's just so obscure to me that I didn't even notice that was suppose to be the focus of the show. I have seen more emotional and feel triggered emotions. No offense again, but these people that consider your lie in april to be one of the most emotional Anime's ever are the same ones that go on saying that shows like Elfen Lied or Kanon are edgy  and bad at doing romance scenes and try way too hard to be emotional and heartbreaking for the audience. For me honestly it's the exact contrary to what I believe. It's not those 2 that are like that. It's this overrated pile of crap that is what I described earlier.\\n\\n\r\nNow I am going to be completely honest on this subject. The romance between kousei and Kaori is perhaps the worst aspect of the show. People claim that the romance in this anime is good. But I'v noticed that no one can really give a good reason on why the romance is good. All I see is praise like *oh it's because of the feels, feels, feels, and feels\". No one can literally explain why the romance  in this Anime is good. Sometimes when watching this Anime I kept forgetting that this was a romance Anime since I LITERALLY DON'T SEE ANYTHING ROMANTIC IN THIS ANIME! They just have a thing for each other and say emotional things to each other and give them motivational speeches and wish each other the best of luck. THAT'S NOTHING ROMANTIC RIGHT THERE! YOU SEE THIS CRAP LITERALLY IN ANYTHING FREAKING GENRE! Like seriously, how the heck can this be considered a good \"romance Anime\" when both Kousei and Kaori literally do absolutely NOTHING with each other other than oh just think of each other and do nothing else. Sometimes when watching this Anime I wondered to myself if there really was a romantic connection between the two. There are no heartwarming scenes between the both. No deep affection, deep love, and stuff that will literally make you blush and make your heart turn all bubbly because of how damn cute it is. THERE'S NOT EVEN A KISS FOR CRYING OUT! Now I know that not all romance Anime's have a kiss but at least they progress the relationship. Ylia does NO SUCH THING AT ALL! So to me this is TERRIBLE romance and this is the plague that is killing romance Anime nowadays. The only 2 dumb meaningful things that happened between the both of them was some stupid scene where they started at each other with fireflies and another in the final episode where some very hardcore and forced melodramatic scene happens where it's [SPOILERS!] just him crying that he's gonna lose her with stupid flashing sparkles and visuals. Seriously how lame...\\n\\n\r\nArt/Animation 8/10\\n\r\nThe Art style is good. It's very pretty and the eyes, noses, and mouths look pretty cute too. I'd call it a bit aesthetic and spot on. The animation is pretty good too. Beautiful 4K like visuals that are at least enough to wow your eyes and the scenes being played were quite a pleasure to watch from the eye. Especially the music play scenes. Overall I give praise to the Art and Animation.\\n\\n\r\nSound/Soundtrack 7/10\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is pretty good. There are some nice songs and believe or not but some songs are played well too. Just the problem is they can get really repetitive at times and sometimes they spam Pianos and try to force sad piano songs that just cut off the emotion. But a still good soundtrack at least.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters 1/10\\n\r\nTHE CHARACTERS ARE A FREAKING ABOMINATION! LIKE SERIOUSLY THESE CHARACTERS ARE HONESTLY SOME OF THE WORST ANIME CHARACTERS I HAVE EVER SEEN!\\n\\n\r\nLook, it may look like that I am over exaggerating, but honestly this is how I felt and I will give my reasons to explain why I think these characters are poor as hell and didn't enjoy them at all.\\n\\n\r\nkousei Armia is a pianist prodigy who excelled very well at the Piano and won numerous competitions to claim the ultimate prize. But look from my perspective he is one of the most blandest and dull protagonists I have ever seen. He is beta for pretty much the whole show and he is a bore to watch and is no cool badass guy like we like to see. His lameness is just there to progress the story and had no alpha motives and remains a generic nice nerdy dork-like personality. His motivation to play the Piano is pretty hilarious since it seems like it was thanks to blonde poster chick that motivated him to play the piano through a very poor manner. Even though he had his friends for 2 years and were always by his side including a female childhood friend who was always there to support him and liked him at a young age but suddenly he doesn't like her and didn't like her at all since it seems like their support to him didn't mean crap all until the blonde chick suddenly comes to change his life. Wow... How strange is that...? What makes it even more funnier is that a age 14 Kousei acts like he's a 5 year old boy and pretty much does nothing else for his entire life which is also pretty hilarious considering that realistically boys around his age would probably be going under Tsubaki's skirt already because that's just how people are naturally. But instead remains an innocent and oblivious minded kid throughout the entire show is utterly stupid because lets be honest, THAT WOULD NOT HAPPEN AT ALL! You want an example? Go read Goodnight Punpun. It perfectly sums up youth very well. His romance with Kaori is poor as crap and as I stated before he does nothing romantic with her whatsoever at all. Nothing deep just hints and self thought feelings that he likes her.\\n\\n\r\nKaori is another disaster. She is an annoying stuck up blonde chick that meets Kousei and now suddenly bosses him around with a forced motivation. She is annoying, just there to be the poster chick, and has this illness that plays an important role for the show and because of that illness for the rest of the show, she doesn't really develop well at all and pretty much remains absent throughout the entire show. Honestly that illness hindered her progress really badly and quite sad how other side characters got more development than she did. There really is nothing much to say about her other than be there because again she is the poster chick of the show. She's the main girl and the main girl has to win for the sake of a poor story. Also, her encounter and personality with Kousei is unbearable to watch as she teases him with unfunny attempts to play with him and her romance with Kousei sucks because all she does is... Nothing...\\n\\n\r\nTsubaki is another pathetic character. She is one of those tomboy side chicks that are destined to get beaten by the main chick Kaori because it's some stupid dumb trope that's been there in romance Anime's since the late 2000s. She is good at baseball, bosses Kousei around, likes him, was always there for him to support him, but he doesn't like her back and then she becomes the side chick that losses. Yep, seen this stupid trope over and over again and hilarious enough this one is done the worst. She is literally just there to fill in the side chick role.\\n\\n\r\nRyouta is Japanese Soccer player who is currently negotiating a transfer to Manchester United for a record fee of a fee that is bigger than all of Japan's economy.\\n\\n\r\nThe rest of Ylia's support characters are obscure and irrelevant to the story. Kousei's mom is this evil wicked witch that abuses him, but then shows him sympathy. This causes a whole confusion if she really is evil. But all we know is that she is an abusive doofus and there is nothing else known about her. The rivals are just rivals and are there to put this DBZ like tournament feeling that goes flushed down the toilet since they are pretty much obscure. Nagi was just this girl to waste time and lead to a useless and pointless arc that really resulted in it being a waste.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 4/10\\n\r\nI didn't enjoy the annoying melodrama feeling at all. There was no enjoyment felt for me at all and most of the time I was waiting and hoping that at least something romantically meaningful was going to happen or least something that wowed me but nope. None of that happened at all... Instead all I got was pretty colors and pretty backgrounds with piano music that sounded nice but not enough to keep me pleased at all.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 4/10\\n\r\nI did not enjoy Your Lie in April at all! I found this Anime to be extremely disappointing and a huge letdown. This Anime SUFFERS from melodrama, overuse of shock factor, scenes that are trying WAAAAY to hard to make me feel sad and worst of all the characters are an absolute mess to watch. I can't believe that I literally wasted at least 22 episodes of my life just to watch something that would let me down in the end. This Anime is not good in my opinion, the romance is one of the worst I have ever seen and it's pretty sad and hilarious too how a vanilla doujinshi or an incest Anime like Yosuga No Sora can capture the theme of love in a more romantic and deep way than this pile of disappointing garbage. The fact that it's compared to Clannad too makes me ask myself just what the heck is so emotional about it other than shock factor or forced melodrama. Sorry, to me this Anime is a HUGE disappointment and a letdown. Only the soundtrack and the animation was good. But that doesn't save it from being a bad Anime for me. Because if that were the case, then Sonic the Hedeghog 2006 would be the best video game in history am I right?",

            "content": "After watching the last episode I thought to myself, \"Was it worth it?\" The answer to that question is a simple, no. I had very high hopes for this anime and it failed to meet my expectations (perhaps they were a bit too high). BUT at least Shigatsu gripped me, gripped me by the ball sack and wouldn't let go i mean.\r\nAlthough I have only watched 15 episodes I still believe that it was not worth my time. (I did see the last episode though)\r\nThe art of Shigatsu is very appealing and the animation was at least consistent but nothing I would call amazing. Thepiano playing was all done in cg, making the hands look very much out of place. \\n\\n\r\nThe sound is absolutely wonderful, often being exactly on point with the current scene and adding so much more to the atmosphere. I greatly enjoyed both openings of the anime and found the endings to also be fitting. \\n\\n\r\nThe story of Shigatsu is simple but also had much potential. The way the start of the series was, in my belief, handled well enough. There weren't many to any plot holes in the entire story that I could see but, it went in a very very slow pace causing me to feel a slight dread within the bottomless pit that is my heart. The comedic relief scenes also felt very out of place and quite awkward, tearing me completely out of immersion. The problem with the scenes were not that they were just there to relieve the tension, as they are meant to, but that they were poorly done.    \\n\\n\r\nThe biggest flaw of Shigatsu is certainly its two main characters. First, Kousei. He definitely develops, as he competes with his old rivals to claim the top spot and along the way understands just how much of an impact he had on these other people. And through his interactions with the heroine he is able to move on and continue to purse being a pianist. However Kousei is, in my eyes, a boring main character that gives the viewer an overall depressing feeling. There just isn't enough things about him that can make up for his monotone character. \\n\r\nKaori was also another character that didn't resonate with me. Sure she was fun loving and \"care free\" but those characteristic just felt forced into her character. If she was a side character I think that I would have been fooled into believing she was actually having fun in the scenes but she (and other characters) very much overreact to such scenes. Another part of her that made me dislike her was that she didn't clearly convey her emotions to the other members, maybe even manipulating other \"major\" characters (one might say). She also had a very aggressive attitude to Kousei (for no real reason) causing me to instantly dislike her. \\n\r\nA large problem with the other members of the cast including Kaori, was that they forced Kousei who had PTSD to instantly do the thing that is part of his trauma without any kind of ACTUAL help or any easing into it. \\n\\n\r\nThe melodrama was also very heavy. So heavy that even I couldn't handle it. The constant repeating of words also annoyed me. The constant reuse of the word over and over again withing the span of a few seconds felt awkward and felt like they were trying to invoke a feeling (WHICH I DID NOT FEEL) down my throat.\\n\\n\r\nOverall the episodes, including the last one, were not very compelling. The only reason I got as far as I did was because I had hope that it would turn into something greater than it was and because my friends were also watching it. I do feel like my expectations were a bit high for this anime but I also feel that I gave it a fair score despite my hopes. \\n\\n\r\nI may re watch and maybe actually finish the anime in a year or so once my thoughts on the anime are not quite as vivid as they are now.\\n\r\nIf my thoughts in the future change I may come back to edit but for now, Dropped.\\n",

            "content": "The music and of course means original soundtrack is wonderful. I love the original soundtrack including its two openings and endings song.\r\nIn terms of art, I cannot say much. It is a good art, both character design and the concept art are great. \r\nI must admit the animation was awesome! Just look at how Arima played his piano, not many music (especially) piano anime can animate such a great move of fingers on the keys. I am always, well almost hyperventilated every time I watched them play. It was outstanding.\r\nThe character development was... okay?\r\nNow, in terms of story. I know many people love this anime,but I am sorry this was not my cup of tea. The idea was all good, I'd no problem... but how they put the idea and make it into story, I was just... should I say dreadful? The plot was horrifyingly slow. It was devastating for me to watch this anime, and disappointed, and tired, and so so so angry. \\n\\n\r\nMoreover, the thing I most detest was the flashback that keeps appearing in the middle of the performance and repeating over and over again. I know flashback is important to build the feel and emotions, but this was too much. I was so annoyed that I feel like want to throw my TV away.\\n\\n\r\nI think it will be better if they cut it into 12 episodes.. After the 10th episode, I skipped most of the part and only get into the performance. \\n\\n\r\nSo, the art and soundtrack are both mesmerising, but the story wasn't that interesting to watch. Piano no Mori movie is much more heartwarming than this sad romance music thing. In terms of story, Sakamichi no Appollon still wins compare to Shigatsu. My mistake was to watched this anime when I knew that romance anime is a no for me....",

            "content": "\"I want to hear it again, yet I don't want to hear it again. I want to see her, yet I don't want to see her. What do you call this kind of feeling again?\"\r\nMusic is the only language which people of all nationalities are capable of understanding. It is a unique method of sending messages to one another and to understand one another. It's a conversation through instruments. In that sense, music transcends words.\r\nShigatsu wa Kimi no Uso is a deeply melodramatic story about love and life itself, and how the aspect of music can be used to affect both. It is one ofvery few anime which actually revolves around classical music, and it does so in a stunning fashion the likes of which hasn't been seen since Nodame Cantabile.\\n\\n\r\nIf you just want a short summary of what Shigatsu (I'll just refer to it as such henceforth) is about, and why you should or should not watch it, then here's a quick rundown of it. Otherwise the full review follows below:\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nPros & Cons:\\n\\n\r\n+ One of very few anime which to a large extent revolves around classical music\\n\r\n+ Very poetic writing and an abundance of intricate monologues\\n\r\n+ Lots of character facades where there are a ton of bottled up thoughts and feelings inside all of the characters which they don't show to anyone else\\n\r\n+ Absolutely beautiful music with exquisite presentation and an incredibly captivating atmosphere. If you would discount all other factors of this anime, then really the audio department alone is honestly enough of a reason to watch it\\n\\n\r\n+/- Very slow pacing during live performance sessions, but as long as you can lean back and just appreciate the beautiful classical music then it's not really an issue\\n\r\n+/- A minor love polygon is present, though it's definitely not the main focus of the show\\n\r\n+/- Highly melodramatic \u2013 this can either be interpreted as it being beautiful and emotional or cheesy and clich\u00e9, depending on who you ask\\n\\n\r\n- Highly predictable plot development overall; you can pretty much sketch out how the entire anime will play out after just a handful of episodes\\n\r\n- Poor usage of comic relief and overall bad timing of non-serious moments\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nShigatsu wa Kimi no Uso (or \"Your Lie in April\" in English) primarily follows the life of Arima Kousei; a diligent and strictly trained piano prodigy who dominated all the classical music competitions during his childhood. However after having a traumatic experience along with the death of his mother, he suffered a mental breakdown and completely lost his ability to play the piano. That is until two years later when he one day happens to stumble upon his polar opposite in the form of Miyazono Kaori; a beautiful and energetic young violinist who tries to live her life to the fullest. She begins to show Kousei the wonders and beauty of music and tries to teach him that he should play the piano not because he can or must, but because he wants to.\\n\\n\r\nInitially, the setting seems fairly familiar as we have Kousei basically restarting from rock bottom of his life, but with the help of his friends his vast potential slowly starts to reveal itself over the course of time. Along with this, the anime provides us with some absolutely exquisite live classical music performances which give the series its own flair as well as a fantastic atmosphere more often than not. However as is also made evident as the story progresses, that is not the only thing that Shigatsu has to offer, as it gets gradually more and more depressive and tragic, resulting in a great deal of a little certain something we most often refer to as \"melodrama\".\\n\\n\r\nThis is the real make-or-break factor of the entire show.  The melodramatic elements in the latter portion of the anime are highly prevalent and affect the story quite drastically. Now some people will find this absolutely beautiful and touching since the anime does become extremely emotional as it tries to draw out as much \"feels\" as possible from its viewers. On the other hand many other people will instead claim that this only made the story cheesy and clich\u00e9 as a result of bad writing. And honestly... I can't really say either side is wrong. Melodrama by itself is neither a good nor a bad thing, but it will cause some rather extreme reactions from its viewership. If the anime succeeds in bringing out the emotions from you as it tries to do, then you'll probably love this show. On the other hand if it doesn't, it'll probably just make you roll your eyes in exasperation. It's an extremely individual matter, and thus the only real recommendation I can make as far as that goes is to simply try it out and see for yourself. Maybe you'll like it, maybe you won't, but it's at least worth giving it a chance.\\n\\n\r\nNow if I could mention something which I would actually label as a problem however, then it would rather be the way the story as a whole is structured. This is simply because as it is, the plot developments of Shigatsu are for the most part highly predictable. You really don't need to watch very far into it before you will most likely have a reasonable estimation of how the rest of the story will play out, and there are very few moments where it actually manages to surprise you. This fact may also indirectly reduce the impact that many of the show's emotional peaks contain, not because they're poorly written but simply because you will probably see them coming beforehand.\\n\\n\r\nKousei comes across as your fairly typical admirable protagonist with a tragic past. He's shy and quiet but he is very caring for those who are close to him. Out of all the characters, Kousei's development is by far the most noticeable as the changes he goes through over the course of the story are quite massive, and his extensive monologues give you a really good insight on what is going on inside his head. Kaori on the other hand is what I at first glance would have described as the anime character personification of Lindsey Stirling, which made me personally very excited as I've always been a huge fan of hers. She has a very cheerful and outgoing personality (albeit lightly tsun at times) which makes her the trusted mood maker of the cast. She tends to keep her private life more secretive however and doesn't like to let other people know what she's going through very much, but she certainly has a fair share of development as well. The other two main characters of the show, Kousei's two friends Tsubaki and Ryouta, are both somewhat neglected in this area though I feel, especially the latter one. I think this is a bit unfortunate because in all honesty the two of them have surprisingly big supportive roles in this anime.\\n\\n\r\nAnyhow, for the most part I would still have to say that Shigatsu is a very enjoyable anime. Especially the live music segments are exquisite, and although the pacing tends to slow down to a snail's pace during them, at the time the show still manages to completely captivate you as a viewer by just how well it is presented and how beautiful it is. I haven't read the manga admittedly (yet?) but I have a very hard time seeing Shigatsu being as good without the presence of audio. It really is the department where the anime shines the brightest.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation for Shigatsu was done by A-1 Pictures, and as you may expect from them, almost everything in the show looks very crisp and clean. I did have some minor issues with the almost exaggeratedly rounded faces in the first few episodes though, but I got used to it pretty quickly thereafter. The bottom line is, the anime looks beautiful when it tries to... *when* it tries to that is...\\n\\n\r\nWhich brings me to the second problem I have with this show, namely its utilization of comedy. Every so often, the animation quality will deteriorate drastically and reduce the character designs to more chibi-like designs in typical shounen-comedy fashion, and then it tries to incorporate some average comic relief gags into it. Case in point: this entire aspect of the show *should not have existed*. At all. Let's be real here, regardless of whether or not the anime is in a segment where it's focusing on character interaction, music or drama, it always feels serious. The general atmosphere of this story is stylish and dramatic, as you would expect from a story revolving around classical music to such a large extent. The last thing I would ever want to see thrown into that mix is cheap chibi comedy; it breaks the atmosphere apart like no tomorrow. It's so incredibly needless and off-putting, and I can't for the life of me figure out why it was implemented to begin with. If you look at Nodame Cantabile for example which has a very similar premise, that show still manages to incorporate comedy despite its mature and dignified atmosphere. It almost feels like Shigatsu was aimed at the wrong target audience, and as if it would have been better off being aimed at adults, perhaps even women primarily. I mean I understand that the main characters here are all middle schoolers but still.\\n\\n\r\nEven with that taken into account however, at the end of the day what you have is an anime where the pros still heavily outweigh the cons... *unless* you're unable to stomach the melodramatic aspects that is. However that is something you will have to find out for yourself. Personally I'd like to believe I'm fairly neutral as far as that matter goes as I neither love or hate it, and with that in mind then I still definitely liked Shigatsu a lot overall.\\n\\n\\n\r\nRecommended for:\\n\r\nFans of emotional dramas and classical music, as well as those who can truly appreciate exquisite presentation for what it is\\n\\n\r\nNot recommended for:\\n\r\nPeople who believe solid writing carries more weight than emotional impact, and also those who for some reason don't like classical music to begin with\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso still stands as one of the more memorable (and conclusive) romance anime in recent years, and while I can't call it the best ever it still definitely stands out for what it is. Although it is certainly far from flawless, it still goes to show that that isn't really necessary anyway. The whole is greater than the sum of its parts, and in Shigatsu's case it provides us with an anime that although it's far from perfect, it's still a hell of a lot better than most.",

            "content": "Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso, in English \u201cYour Lie in April\u201d, could have been a true masterpiece. A-1 Pictures has made efforts in that direction, creating a series that is flawless, technically speaking at least. The animation is well-cared-for and extremely fluid, to the point that it really gets close to perfection. It certainly does its job of capturing the viewer with its undeniable beauty, especially during the musical scenes. The soundtrack is just as fitting, with a selection of beautiful classical pieces. Also thanks to a great direction, A-1 Pictures gives its public some scenes it will never be able to forget. It's quiteexciting so far, but unfortunately all that glitters is not gold. Behind this pleasant surface, in fact, Shigatsu hides many flaws.\\n\\n\r\nAn anime\u2019s plot can easily be its weakest point, but this is not the case for Shigatsu: its plot, though not original, is rather likeable and eye catching. The way the plot is handled, though, is another matter entirely. Every scenes is exaggerated, thus becoming excessive and unrealistic. This is evident especially in the countless dramatic scenes, that after a while become melodramatic and annoying. Among all the tear-jerking themes, one of the worst is Kousei\u2019s childhood trauma: it is presented again and again for almost half the series, obsessively. Some of the scenes are way too rough and brutal, and end up feeling very out of place. To make things worse this theme is treated with superficiality, which is a paradox given how much they insist on it. The lack of depth of this anime is always lurking behind its illusory seriousness though, and we have proof of this in the second half of the anime, which focuses on Kaori more. She has had her run of bad luck, just like Kousei, and her problems are treated in a very shallow way, like you would expect after enduring twelve episodes of flat drama.\\n\\n\r\nBut let\u2019s explore another weak point of this series: the supporting characters. Calling them this is perhaps too kind, as they are more plot devices than actual characters. This is especially true for Tsubaki \u2013 Kousei\u2019s childhood friend \u2013 and Ryouta \u2013 the popular guy friend. Each time the plot lingers on them, it is only because they have something to do with the main character. They do not exist per se, because they are supplementary to the main character. Some have said that Kaori herself is subordinate to Kousei and his development, and even if this statement should be taken with a grain of salt, I don\u2019t feel like denying it completely.\\n\\n\r\nThe psychological characterization of the supporting characters is also terrible. We could say that there is only one female character in the entire anime. Kaori, Tsubaki, Nagi and Hiroko are the main female characters, and they are all, ALL similar. It is indeed baffling how the creator of this series, in the making of the characters, started from a basic tsundere girl, and then added some irrelevant additional traits here and there to create some diversity. But in the end they all have the same personality \u2013 tsundere, as mentioned above \u2013 and even the same relationship with the main character \u2013 all love him but struggle admitting it, thus choosing to punch him and shout at him for most of the series. Ryouta has not had a better fate: he does not show much throughout the series, but when he does it is only to fulfill the rival role, vital to the plot.\\n\\n\r\nA positive note, however, goes to Kousei\u2019s musician rivals: Takeshi and Emi. They both have a more original characterization. Even if they do not appear much in the series, they seem to have a personal role, not subordinated to Kousei\u2019s character. I should mention however how forced and unrealistic their long-lasting admiration for Kousei is.\\n\\n\r\nYou would think Shigatsu\u2019s flaws ended here, but nope. This anime fails at what was probably its main aim: transmitting to the viewer the beauty of classical music. The musical scenes are so boring they seriously compromise the anime\u2019s pace. The public is lead to think that the director didn\u2019t know how to make the viewer appreciate classical music. Instead of simply showing how beautiful a classical track can be, the director chose to add long interior monologues and exaggerated reactions of the public. Thus long minutes of beautiful classical music are weighed down by long soliloquies and the \u201comg, marvelous, I can see the colourful notes happily dancing in a flowering field!\u201d of the public.  \\n\\n\r\nIn the end: is this anime worth watching? All things considered, it is not: its flaws outnumber its merits by far. If you like tear-jerking scenes and are willing to turn a blind eye on the problems I\u2019ve mentioned, though, you might enjoy it. At the very least you will love the animation and the wonderful soundtrack. \\n\\n\r\n\u2605\u2605\u2605 SCORE \u2605\u2605\u2605\\n\r\n- Plot: 1/3, unsatisfactory.

            "content": "First of all, I do not love it because it is popular. I'm French and nobody knows it in France. So, nope, I've just been told by a friend about Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso.\r\nI'll try to organise my review: we'll first talk about the plot. Then, we'll talk about the music. After, we'll deal with the characters. Last, but not least, we'll \"judge\" the animation.\r\nSo, let's begin with the plot: fabulous. Yet, the original speech looked classical: Kosei was a great pianist, \"the human metronome\", who was able to play perfectly every score, as if the original composer was playing. Today, being fourteen, hedoesn't play the piano anymore, because of a trauma I won't spoil, and see a monochromatic world, the same colours as a music sheet or a piano keyboard. But comes in his life an excentric and free-spirited violonist, named Kaori, playing the score the way she wants to. She will try to make Kosei's love for piano and music reappear. Yes, we could have thought the plot would be: \"Kosei unhappy. \u2192 He meets Kaori. \u2192 She helps him playing piano. \u2192 It's hard though. \u2192 She doesn't forsake. \u2192 Kosei is alive again. \u2192  They fall in love and live happily ever after.\" Well, perhaps it's a little bit more complicated. The work doesn't use music in order to deliver a cheesy shojo. It's more \"a slice of life\", even if Wikipedia and Mangafox describe it as a shonen. No matter what, it's a real love letter to music. We insist on the emotions music can make us feel, and it's amazing! Love, anger, loneliness, sadness, determination, the panel is pretty wide. And it's really strong. We're told that it's this way of playing which will make our music etch in people's hearts. We've got a reflection about music, but about the place of the artist as well: must they be what people expect them to be? Or must they be themselves, but being people that no-one understands? Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso also proposes a reflection about the surfacing of love feelings, about seeing your beloved far away, about traumas, about mourning and so on. It's pretty good. And to insist on these ideas, several symbols are given to the spectator, free to interpret as they wish: spring, cherry tree's flowers, piano, music at bottom, stars and even trains (the only thing I cannot interpret). Yet, there's still some little faults: the beginning of the second part. That Kosei faces his trauma at the beginning of this part, according to me, should have been at the end of the first part: moreover, the 10th episode was excellent because it had already concerned that and the battle looked like it was led. In my notes, I've even suggerated an achievement of the hero. But, fortunately, this accomplishment is completed at the 13th episode (the second episode of the second part): it's not worth grieving! Especially as the humour is particularly excellent. For the plot, I let me give a 5/5, deserved.\\n\\n\r\nLet's deal with the music. We have got Chopin's. I think it is enough to show how excellent it is. The \"songs\" we listen are extremely well played, it's a feast for our ears. The original score is effective, and even though it is not unforgettable, it's able to be mixed with \"classical music\" (I use \"classical\" because I can't make a difference between \"classical music\", \"baroque music\" and so on, even if I hardly recognise the romantic music.) Endings and openings are excellent. Especially openings. Especially the second one. Music is enchanting, and pictures' representation is superb. Fine art. All of this work's music (opening, ending, original score and intradiegetic) is well done. In a nutshell, the music, without surprising nobody, 5/5.\\n\\n\r\nThen, characters: most of them are interesting. The hero is well made. A musician not hearing the piano when he concentrates on playing: it was ambitious! So, we have a character traumatised, totally empty, monochromatic, and who has got nothing to prove to the world, and to himself too. Yes, he will change (luckily, seeing a depressive character the whole work on wouldn't have been worth seeing, it's only well done in Life). He will colour his world thanks to Kaori, extrovert and free-spiritied musician. Kaori, who is, all the same time, an excellent character. All of the characters are excellent, and I won't be able to develop without spoiling, because all of them are suprising. Even some characters you discover after a lot of episodes and who are not that present are amazing. Nevertheless, there is one flaw: Watari (what an unluck, it's one of the main characters!). He didn't seem really developed. I thought it was an empty character that they wanted to contrast with the hero (you will understand how they are constrated by watching the anime). But we understand that he's got a willing making him cry. Is he developed or isn't he? If he weren't supposed to be developed, why this little development? If he were, it's not enough. Conclusion? It kills me admiting that but... it's... a... *clearing his throat* non-sense... Regarding Tsubaki, in order to complete the square of teenagers, she is extremely well made and deep. Characters, 4,75/5, but because of Watari.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation only confirms the rest. Super. Grandiose. They have really good ideas, really good effects. I mean, representing Kosei non-hearing the sounds playing piano by diving him in the water is an excellent idea. Landscapes are detailed, the characters, amazing to look, and lots of efforts are made: we have even got sentences on t-shirts (the \"No Life Is Enough\" made me laugh). Animation is intelligently between 2D and 3D. Even if it's not the best 3D ever (*sweet looks to Disney and Pixar*), it's enough to what it represents, and, in addition to that, rare enough for not bothering. Moreover, it's not that far from the 2D animation, it's pretty good. It's not like if they used that for the whole show (isn't it, KIRARIN REVOLUTION 3?). Yes, I find the animation superb, splendid, intra/extradiegetic plans are excellent, beautiful work, 5/5.\\n\\n\r\nTo put it in a nutshell, is it neat? You have understood: a masterpiece. Even a big  one. 19,75/20 (=9,875/10, so let me give 10/10) isn't from nowhere. People say you can judge something only when it is finished: it is finished and superb! The beginning, the middle, the end: everything verges on genius! Excellent things, a rich and mastered universe (just one little non-sense), you've got everything to have a good time. This anime is an excellent \"mise en abyme\" of its aim: it offers you anything it has got in order to stay in your heart forever. Your Lie in April, as it is translated is a pure masterpiece, the centrepiece of shonen and \"slice of life\" mangas, a delicious work deserving more than a glance: it deserves your heart, your soul and your passion.

            "content": "There are two things that I love; music and anime. Put them together and you end up with a....dropped anime? I was anticipating watching Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso after hearing that is is an award winning manga about a musical child prodigy learning to face his demons, with a bit of romance thrown in. If done right, this could have been another gem to add to the multiple other music-based anime out there. But instead it seems that almost everything went wrong.\r\nThe protagonist of Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso is Kousei, an unbelievably talented musician who's mother's death has been haunting him, so muchso that he cannot play anymore. Since then he's found life fairly meaningless, apart from moments of happiness with his two best friends; Tsubaki and Ryouta. Then one day he meets a near perfect-looking girl his age who is also a violinist and has arrived to change his world. There's nothing wrong with this premise; in fact there are many enjoyable films with the \"depressed male meets manic pixie dream girl\" premise. What follows is where the problems begin.\\n\\n\r\nThe first problem arises when Kousei is describing the loss of his musical ability. Instead of saying something a regular person would say, such as \"I don't like it anymore\", Kousei says he \"cannot hear the music anymore\". When I heard him say this I thought that it was just a bit melodramatic, nothing more. However, now that I look back I can see why he uses these words. Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso wants to be a feels trip, but doesn't know how. So it turns the drama dial to the max, even if things don't seem natural. The characters don't speak like normal people. Every line of dialogue (outside of the attempts at humour) is portrayed to have some deep meaning for them. \\n\\n\r\nThis is emphasised by the constant monologuing and flashbacks. Kousei isn't just seen struggling to play music, he'll have a discussion in his head about how difficult everything is and then there'll be flashbacks of his mother abusing him. He won't just have a few scenes showing that he struggles with girls (even though his best friend is a female - which is generally far more than what most guys have at his age), he'll launch into a monologue about how he's \"always the sidekick\" - repeatedly. There's nothing wrong with the problems he is facing seeing as there are people who have gone through similar circumstances. But there is no need to constantly repeat and emphasise these issues in an attempt to create drama. \\n\\n\r\nThen there's the emotional and \"life-changing\" moments. The characters of Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso are overcoming obstacles and creating new outlooks on life every few minutes. This is simply too much. This is where most critics start calling the show pretentious, which is understandable. No human being has the wisdom to come up with the realisations these characters do so frequently. No one reflects on their friendship, hobbies and place in life every second of the day. For a show that requires the viewer to relate to its characters, it does everything it can to achieve the opposite. \\n\\n\r\nThe next issue is Kaori and the cliches. Now, I don't believe that cliches are inherently wrong. Especially considering almost every adventure film involves the same plot devices. However, Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso even failed to do cliches right. This is where Kaori comes in. She is meant to be an MPDG; the girl that comes in to Kousei's life to change his world. But, like the drama, this is turned up to the max. Everything about Kaori is meant to be perfect. She's happy-go-lucky, loves music, intelligent, willing to show her emotions, beautiful, gets along with children and has a massive interest in our protagonist. They even throw in that she's sick and dying in case everything else didn't receive an emotional response. However, due to how overboard they've gone to make her a MPDG, it's actually made even fans of the show to have some dislike for her. When she is pushing Kousei to play with her, the show is attempting to portray her as encouraging Kousei to come out of his shell, but it comes across as borderline bullying. Her character is simply a trope gone wrong.\\n\\n\r\nThe cliches continue for the other characters and it makes it predictable. Tsubaki clearly has feelings for Kousei but will end up accepting that Kousei does not reciprocate. Ryouta will not change at all and is only there to create a love triangle. Kaori's sickness will end up getting worse, but before dying she'll reveal that the whole time she loved Kousei. Kousei will end up coming out of his shell and still love Kaori even after she's gone. The side characters will come and go without doing much and each episode will be padded out with flashbacks and monologues. It is obvious what's coming and really only has content to last a film, not a whole 20+ episode series.\\n\\n\r\nAfter all that rambling about the negatives (and there are more, but mostly minor at this point), there are some positives. The artwork in Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso is wonderful to look at. Take a screenshot at any point in most episodes and you would have a good wallpaper. The animation is fairly decent, especially when the effort is put in to the concert performances. The music throughout the show is brilliant and the choice of songs throughout are actually very appropriate. The OP is incredibly catchy and as much as I didn't enjoy the show, I still enjoy listening to the OP. \\n\\n\r\nSo, if you enjoy forced melodrama with music involved, then you might get more out of this show than I did. However, there are definitely better drama-based anime out there, even with music being a focus. Personally, I'm just disappointed knowing that this show could have been much better.",

            "content": "What a treat. I didn't pick up Shigatsu wa kimi no uso expecting much. The art style is a bit conservative,  and the musical love story is a well trodden path. While A-1's contributions to the Noitamina block include the memorable Ano Hana, they have also delivered the stale light novel adaptation Nanana's Buried Treasure, the infamous Fractale, and even this season a straightforward harem in Saekano. Fortunately, A-1 pictures  brought their A-game to Shigatsu, and in fact this is one of the better shows of the past year.\r\nShigatsu starts of as a verbose, slightly melodramatic series and stays that way. Arima Kouseiis very conflicted about his mother's death, and he's going to let you know with some marathon-length monologues that span half-episode long piano performances. Other characters are similarly self-reflective, and the viewer might occasionally feel like they're at a confessional. \\n\\n\r\nShigatsu is at its heart a tale about the things that hurt us but also make us move forward as individuals. Love, loss, and relentless dedication to a craft, in this case music. Most of the musicians in the series are pianists, except the lively Miyazono Kaori whose kinetic, off-the-rails violin performance inspires change in the diminished and sad Arima Kousei. In the second half the main character's brooding finally exits the stage and the cast of supporting characters is given more room to breathe life into the series. \\n\\n\r\nWhen you get swept into the emotional tides of Shigatsu's youthful, vibrant cast, it becomes an immersive experience. Due to its vary nature as a character and monologue-driven experience though, I think whether the viewer is sympathetic to the main characters or endears to its style of storytelling will hugely influence their enjoyment. While I ultimately did, the show really does drone on at times. Anime writers take note; sometimes concepts are simple enough they don't need to drag on for hundreds of lines.\\n\\n\r\nShigatsu really sets a high bar with its production values. The art style is a tad conservative but the use of colour and lighting really is sumptuous. Super-deformity, which is fairly ubiquitous across many shows, makes an appearance. While its use suits the show's humour, which often comes in short, abrupt bursts of comic relief, it isn't a good contrast with the relatively serious and realistic nature of the series. Perhaps best left in the manga? The animation on the whole is very solid nonetheless. The way the characters move convincingly with the piano during recitals is particularly impressive. The series also makes use of CG to animate piano playing, and while slightly off-looking, it's certainly preferable to badly animating it in 2D or conveniently avoiding it. \\n\\n\r\nThe audio is clearly where Shigatsu ought to shine, and through a choice of classic piano pieces it indeed does. There are scenes where spectators at concerts, in monologue, evangelise the beauty of how emotions are conveyed in the performances. I'm honestly too tone deaf to tell, but listening to classic pieces is mesmerising regardless of whether the claimed level of personalisation is actually being conveyed. The show's actual OST is intensely forgettable. Shigatsu offers one audio gift to forgive its mediocre OST though; great voice acting. With monologues stretching for literally minutes at a time, having them delivered in a suitably emotional, almost breathless manner makes them feel more colourful.\\n\\n\r\nDuring the relentless monologues and 3 episode long concerts in the first half, watching Shigatsu felt a bit like a chore, but after the half-way point, Shigatsu hits its stride and delivers a passionate, pitch-perfect drama about music, youth, and love. Ultimately, its workmanlike presentation and dialogue means the only way it stands out among similar shows is quality, but this level of quality and consistency in production is quite rare.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 7, Art: 7, Sound: 8, Character: 8, Enjoyment: 8\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7",

            "content": "Ah, Your Lie in April, the best romance anime with so much feels I cry my eyes out at the mere mention of its name! Such a masterpiece it is, and who the hell am I kidding? YLIA SUCKS! There is not a single redeemable quality about this anime. I do not understand how people can cry over this bucket of crap! What's there to feel sad about honestly? That this was such a terrible anime? That's one reason  I can agree with.\r\nStory: 0/10\r\nThere isn't a story. The end. \r\nYLIA is supposed to show the story of suffering pianist, Kousei Arima and his romancewith the cheerful violinist, Kaori, who is slowly dying from a disease. Kousei is traumatized during every performance because of his mother's abuse and death. Sounds pretty tragic right? So you know something is very wrong when this anime fails to give me any sort of emotion at all. \\n\r\nThe drama sucks. It's pointless, repetitive, and annoying.\\n\\n\r\nThere is honestly no story progression. Kousei gets over his fear of performing and Kaori's condition worsens. But what's the story that goes along with it? Things just happen for the sake of happening! Like hello? Crappy stories I wrote in kindergarten have more plot then this crap!  I thought I missed something when Kaori, spoiler alert, died because I was like wait that's it? It was a huge let down after hearing it compared to one of my favorite animes, Clannad, all the time. Also the romance is SERIOUSLY lacking. It's forced, superficial, and really lame. Kousei loves Kaori as soon as they meet and it really doesn't develop much from there. Like um HELLO! This is supposed to be a ROMANCE anime! WHERE IS THE ROMANCE? Someone get me a magnifying glass to find that romance.  \\n\\n\r\nArt: 6/10\\n\r\nNow I might not have been the biggest fan of the art, but it's alright. Bright, colorful, and very pretty designs. It is visually appealing and eye catching. And that's about all this anime even has going for it. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 5/10\\n\r\nAs an anime centered around music, I say it's done pretty well. .. the music itself at least. How the music is incorporated into the story is sloppy! It's not used smoothly and to progress the characters. It doesn't DO anything except oh hey that's nice to listen to! If I wanted to listen to music I'd use my radio. I'm looking for an ANIME here. The music, story, and characters can't flow separately, but yet that's what YLIA is trying to do.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 0/10\\n\r\nThere is nothing, not a single thing about these characters that interests me. They are boring people that mean nothing to me. Even their passions for music are dull, dull, dull! Everything's just sort of there, and nothings coming together. There is just NOTHING to these characters. All they do is take the single thing about these characters and keep repeating it over and over and over! Thanks Kousei for reminding us he had a traumatic past since we might have forgotten in the last 2.5 seconds! Super helpful and definitely necessary to our story. Keep it up. And Kaori is really just there for the drama. Really what this anime suffers from is the same thing Kousei is suffering from in the anime - playing just what's on the page! I swear some messed up crap like that happened here,  like some dood made the anime without even making a story. Good, I got one basic trait for each my characters and story? Heh who the hell needs story? I'll just throw in some drama to blend in the gaps! **production staff high fives**\\n\r\nIn result, we have a whole cast of boring characters that literally contribute nothing to anything and are incapable of making me feel any sort of motion towards them. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 0/10\\n\\n\r\nAs you can probably tell by this far into my review, YLIA is my most favorite anime of all time! No plot? No development? No romance? Now that sounds like one hell of a successful anime! \\n\r\nTo be honest, there is one part of YLIA I most definitely enjoy. Pissing off annoying normie fanboys who obsess over this crap of an anime! \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 0/10\\n\r\nIt's an utter piece of crap. \\n\r\nHi I'm Kousei I play the piano because I was forced to and I'm always sad, but oh hey there's a pretty girl and now my life gets better but oops she *spoiler alert* dies so okay everyone be sad for me now. That's it. That's the story.\\n\r\nHoney, I feel sad for the grass that gets squashed when it's stepped on, but I can't understand how to feel sorry for you and cry my eyes out for you, so I'm thinking you got an issue there. \\n\r\nThis anime is wayyy too overrated, and really lacks any passion. Just flush it down the toilet like the trash it is and go watch some real romance.",

            "content": "[4.0/10]\r\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________________\r\nIn a world where every teenager is a philosopher. Where every decision is backed up by a few minutes of brooding monologue, as the extremely obvious is explained repeatedly exists a show that is deeply flawed simply due to it's own genre trappings. \r\nYour Lie In April is that show. In this review I will probably be harsher than perhaps I should be, however, watching all twenty two episodes elicited a very interesting reaction from me. One of frustration, exasperation, lost potential, and maybe just a little bit of hope. \r\nA show that could've done so much right. A show that is dragged down byshallow themes, weak romance, appalling humor, limp characterization, and most importantly, a fetish for trying to make you cry. A fetish that gets extremely tedious to sit through. \\n\\n\r\nIn this review I aim to explain my dislike of many of these elements, however, I also want to touch on the hidden potential that occasionally shines through the cloying husk of this empty, repetitive show. \\n\\n\r\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________________\\n\\n\r\n[MUSIC]\\n\\n\r\nSo this show is about music. Specifically piano, however, it touches on just the broad strokes of the idea of music. The vague notion of what music can do to a person. The expression in music. This is actually kind of cool. One, because there is a sorry lack of shows that are about music. Two, because I love music!\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately, these themes are explained. Yes. Quite often. However, the show rarely ever demonstrates what it explains. The raw emotion of the piano is so powerful. Nonetheless, the show tries its hardest to bury one of the prettiest instruments under a blanket of monologuing and exposition. \\n\\n\r\nWhile this is pretty common for Shounen anime, it was particularly frustrating in Your Lie. The whole point of music is that it doesn't need to be explained. Why the hell would they keep trying to explain it? This is where there simply needed to be liberties taken in adapting this show from the Manga. You can't hear music from a comic strip, so it makes sense to have characters listening discuss the impact it is having on them.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, why would they include this into the show? What benefit does explaining something you can hear have? None. It takes one of the shows biggest and most repetitive themes of expression through music, specifically \"reaching\" someone through song, and spits in its face. Especially when there are constant cuts away from the actual music to flashbacks or characters you simply don't care about, like contest judges, monologuing about how \"oh man, this dude is good at the piano cause he is using emotion to play!\" Man, I wish I could hear this emotion! I wish there wasn't just snippets of this emotion they keep talking about!\\n\\n\r\n...\\n\\n\r\nWith that being said, though, the big scenes involving piano and violin are absolutely jaw-dropping to look at. A-1 pictures, a studio I really didn't know had it in them, really went all out with little details. Fingers strumming the keys, the way a pianist flicks his wrists. It's all meticulously done. Of course there are bouts of time-saving still images that permeate through the shows middle half. Unfortunately, for as solid as the art is overall, these budget-saving and time-saving aspects are understandable, but i'd be lying if I said they didn't effect my overall enjoyment of the show. \\n\\n\r\nThese huge musical extravaganza's rarely get to breath, as I said, constantly being interspersed with monologues and exposition. This, however, has a nice turn with the final episode where that breathing room is finally given. It makes for a somewhat worth it wait, although I have to ask myself If I would have enjoyed the show more if every scene like this was made to express, rather than to explain. \\n\\n\r\n...\\n\\n\r\nThe music itself is great, too. The pieces picked are all very beautiful. I found myself looking up the composition after it was played just to experience it outside of the show. They nailed the sound here. \\n\\n\r\nWhile the opening was generally just OK, the closing tracks were gorgeous. Especially the one in the second half of the show. In fact, it's so pretty, that it almost feels as though it doesn't belong in a show that wears it's melodrama on its sleeve. \\n\\n\r\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________________\\n\\n\r\n[ART]\\n\\n\r\nSo the character designs are generally pretty good too. The art, as I've said, is almost always pretty to look at. The characters are all fairly memorable (in design), and flaunt unique traits... such as lips. Which is pretty interesting for an anime. This stylistic choice actually really grew on me and I found myself really enjoying how expressive this simple addition could make a character.\\n\\n\r\nThe art design isn't perfect, though. I found there being a huge dissonance between the characters at the forefront of the story and the same characters as seen in flashbacks. A simple two year flashback would revert these characters into blabbering children that looked like they were around six or seven, while the present had them at the \"mature\" age of fourteen, where they looked more like they were around twenty. That, unfortunately, I never got used to. \\n\\n\r\nEvery girl in the show wears hilariously short skirts. It's a weird thing to notice but I just couldn't help but laugh at this shows need to market these characters. There's something so weird about a character that looks distinctly mature, however, is just a fourteen year old girl with an incredibly short skirt. It's ridiculous to even imagine this kind of shit being applicable in the real world. It's like a bunch of older girls doing sexy cosplays of schoolgirls, rather than actual schoolgirls. It wasn't the smartest choice by the design team. \\n\\n\r\n...\\n\\n\r\nFor it's music, the animators use extremely pretty CG to animate the fingers and the piano. On occasion there were a few textures that didn't blend too well with the cell-shaded characters, however, for the most part, the pianos and the hands playing them looked spectacular. I wish there was a bit more creativity put into the shot composition of these scenes, though, as I felt like I saw the same exact swooping shot of Arima's fingers strumming the keys multiple times. \\n\\n\r\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________________\\n\\n\r\n[STORY, CHARACTER, AND THEMES]\\n\\n\\n\r\nSo inevitably I have to touch on what truly bothered me about this show. Because the sound and music are generally spectacular. The characters, the story, and the thematic elements were all fairly weak in Your Lie. In fact, they were straight up lazy. \\n\\n\r\nA few unique elements into the generic \"love triangle\" were injected with the fact that the show really didn't have any villains. It was kind of refreshing to see the competition against Arima, our protagonist, were all well-meaning people who respected him greatly. Seeing this support each other was awesome and it makes me wish that the show really didn't have romance in it at all. \\n\\n\r\nBut it does. Oh boy does this show have romance. In fact, I'd say the amount of romance dwarfs any musical elements this show shows off. Just about every scene was plagued in melodrama. Just... plagued. I always disliked melodrama because it felt like something injected into a story just to stir conflict, rather than create progress. \\n\\n\r\nThe amount of melodrama in Your Lie is simply exhausting. Every scene played out so similarly, with such a low variety of topics, that I felt like I watched the same episode three or four times on occasion. That's really bad for a show that only runs twenty two episodes. \\n\\n\r\n...\\n\\n\r\n\"Uh Oh, blonde girl lost her pencil! Watch as she looks at her hands and we get a PoV shot of her crying!\" There is literally nothing more frustrating than seeing a show try, and fail, to make you feel sad about shit. Instead of developing characters, as in, making them like-able to begin with. Your Lie makes the bold move of just giving us emotional conflict right off the bat. \\n\\n\r\nWe hardly know these characters and they're already crying. This doesn't make me feel attached to them. In fact, I just found myself annoyed most of the time. No, I don't fucking care that Pixie Dream Girl is having health problems because I DON'T KNOW HER. Every piece of information about her is fed so ham-handedly that I never felt like I could connect myself with the heroine of the story. \\n\\n\r\nShe plays generic Pixie Dream Girl. If you don't know what that is, it's a character archetype that pretty much enters our protagonists life seemingly out of nowhere and inhabits this playful, cheery persona that sweeps them off their feet and has the protagonist do things he usually wouldn't do. These characters also often have sad backgrounds. This is the definition of Kaori, the blonde girl who does stuff and plays the violin... once or twice, I guess. \\n\\n\r\nAnd so the story begins of kids caring too much about shit I couldn't care less about. I suppose that's the problem with the genre. Maybe i'm just really not into melodrama. I personally didn't know that the show was going to be literally 90% melodrama. \\n\\n\r\nEspecially since Kaori is less of a character and more of a tool for Arima to develop. However, this tool is so mediocrely portrayed and boring that I found myself with a mild disdain for her throughout the entire series. Which is sad since Your Lie has proven that it can write interesting characters with Arima's mom, Saki, who is this sympathetic character that has done horrendous things. It's hard to write a character like that and the show does so extremely well.\\n\\n\r\nIt's just sad that that's where it ends. The show really is just filled with the most generic possible characters apart from that. \\n\\n\r\nWe have...\\n\\n\r\n---> Oblivious love interest number 2. \\n\\n\r\n---> Sports guy\\n\\n\r\n---> That friend who gives advice and is quirky\\n\\n\r\n---> Younger girl that likes protagonist\\n\\n\r\n---> Rivals who secretly know that they are worse than the protagonist\\n\\n\r\n---> Other characters i'm forgetting. \\n\\n\r\n...\\n\\n\r\nThe themes aren't handled much better, either. For example : \"Maybe the light can reach the bottom of a dark ocean,\" is not only a quote, but also a prominent theme throughout most of the show. Arima being pretty much Shinji from Evangelion, but less interesting. So much so that we get direct homages to Shinji's hand. We see Arima's teenage angst being portrayed as though he is at the bottom of the ocean. It's dark, wet, and without sound. \\n\\n\r\nThat's a fine theme to touch on. Maybe even build a deeper story within. However, ironically, this theme about a deep ocean is incredibly shallow and surface-level. Yet it gets explained so often, and so bluntly, that I found myself rolling my eyes constantly at the screen.\\n\\n\r\nThis can be said about everything in this series. Everything is explained. Nothing gets to breath or marinate in your mind. If a motif is teased, get ready for it to be explained directly to your face. It gets so tiresome to hear the same thing being said in a slightly different way five times, only to move on to an equally shallow and obvious theme that is done the same exact way. \\n\\n\r\nWow, I never have heard love being compared to the seasons. Wow. What a creative and original idea. Maybe if they... nope, they're just gonna go ahead and say love is like the seasons forty seven times so you get that the weather around the characters is supposed to resemble their budding love. \\n\\n\r\n... \\n\\n\r\nSo we have this Catcher in the Rye-esq edge to the protagonist that gets humdrum by episode four, but what truly is offensive is the fact that all of this edge is delivered like a punch to the mouth. With extensive monologues. I'm talking pages and pages of characters speaking into thin air. Dreary and endless doesn't even begin to cover how obnoxious this was.\\n\\n\r\nEspecially since hearing these fourteen year olds wax poetically about love is something that may have been interesting to me when I was fourteen, but now that I've grown up and realized that a crush on a girl in highschool isn't love. And most definitely doesn't deserve this much attention. It's not even a friendship that develops, I never get the idea that these characters are friends first, romantic interests second. It's all just romance in the most hackneyed possible way. \\n\\n\r\nEven if these characters are just actually supposed to be edgy teenagers, it doesn't really do the show any favors by not making a comment about that concept. No, I don't find a kid being edgy interesting. It's more of a joke. Ironically, a funnier joke than anything this show can muster up. Have I mentioned how unpleasantly unfunny this show is? It's anime reaction humor that is so misplaced and awkward that it wasn't just unfunny, it was cringe-inducing at times. \\n\\n\r\nKids don't talk like this. Kids don't act like this. I don't care that he's a piano prodigy. The show never makes me care that he is a piano prodigy because the piano takes a sideline to more melodrama. A love triangle that spins its wheels until an axle breaks and it finally hits a lamp post and dies. Finally. \\n\\n\r\n...\\n\\n\r\nIf this isn't annoying enough, the protagonist is literally the center of the galaxy in this show. Every scene that doesn't include him is about him. Every scene that he's in, is about him. I get that he's the protagonist, but by making every character live off him makes the entire world feel unnatural and artificial. Two girls walk down the street. What do they talk about? I'll give you one guess. \\n\\n\r\nThese characters have no discernible lives apart from talking about the main character. It makes sense for someone like Tsubaki to go on and on about Arima because she gets the glorious roll of the most retarded, unaware girl in the show. But the real kicker is that she doesn't even get a resolution. She's just another girl fawning over the protagonist. \\n\\n\r\nI get that these kinds of shows are marketed towards teenage boys. Usually lonely teenage boys. And by including cute girls that secretly love them it gives these lonely teenage boys the ability to insert themselves into the position of the main character and pretend like they have cute anime girls wanting to suck their cock. I also get that Arima, unlike a lot of anime protagonists, is actually very talented at the piano. But it doesn't make the fact that literally every important girl character in the show is literally in love with him.\\n\\n\r\nI say \"literally\" in love,  because this show is so self-absorbed and unaware of it's ridiculousness that when a fourteen year old says \"I love you,\" you are supposed to actually take it seriously. As if he found his soul mate. It's a joke. \\n\\n\r\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________________\\n\\n\r\n[CONCLUSION]\\n\\n\r\nIs it clear yet that I have quite a few gripes with this show? If it weren't for the outstanding production and sound this show's grade would be fairly abysmal. It genuinely couldn't ring a single emotion out of me. That is not good for a show that's entire purpose was to ring emotion out of you. It's as if it's trying to milk a cow and it's not satisfied until ever last drop is squeezed out. \\n\\n\r\nThe main character, piano prodigy Arima, is pretty much friend zoned throughout the entire show. Except he's an anime protagonist so it turns out every important girl \"loves\" him. \\n\\n\r\nThe ridiculous themes, while extremely pretty in execution are incredibly empty. There is no substance to them so the show needs to repeat the same thing over and over again just to fill its run-time. I wouldn't call the show slow paced because I think that the pacing is all over the place. One episode is just a monologue stating something that a four year old could figure out, another episode has fifteen plot points it needs to resolve.\\n\\n\r\nThere's this weird dialogue-driven structure where a character just repeats a phrase throughout an entire episode. It's really corny and sometimes kind of unintentionally hilarious. Talking about hilarious, this show is the opposite of that. It's so unfunny that I actually felt kind of depressed after every joke it forced down your throat. \\n\\n\r\nIt had a few unique elements in it's genre archetype, as the general lack of villains and excess of competitors gave it a very unique and somewhat interesting vibe when it came to the actual concerts. However, these concerts really don't play a huge roll in anything but furthering melodrama. As I said, the expression through music is almost always dampened by rampant cutting into loud, obvious, and repetitive dialogue. Thankfully the show at least let the final, astounding bravado performance breath and it was spectacular to look at, even if I never really found myself attached to any of the characters. \\n\\n\r\n...\\n\\n\r\nI never really enjoyed melodrama. I think if I knew this show would have so much of it I would have stayed far away from it. It's not necessarily a bad show, in fact, my grade goes to show that it is but a woefully mediocre one. Which is sad because of how astounding some of the artistic elements are. That's where the topic of potential is ignited. \\n\\n\r\nThis show left me frustrated because it could've been so much more interesting if it axed every single romance element and became a show about a kid overcoming his own issues through music. Instead, it became a show about a kid overcoming his own issues through a girl telling him about music. Letting him explore a kind of expression in music he wasn't familiar with. Which sounds interesting in theory, but the amount of exposition through obvious themes ruined any potential for an interesting romance.\\n\\n\r\nRomance isn't inherently bad. However, the characters in said romance need to likable. Arima is simply a perfect human being that was stricken with understandable stress. If he didn't go through what he did he'd be this nice, handsome, great guy with awesome friends and a happy life. This lack of actual flaws to the character apart from maybe being shy on occasion remove any actual relate-ability to him. I can't relate to his reaction to anything because the reaction is so cloying rather than raw. \\n\\n\r\nYour Lie is deeply flawed through its own genre trappings. It takes itself so seriously that you may find yourself grasping for air. There is no levity. No wit. No brevity. It's just this slow crawl to the finish line. It's a very pretty crawl filled with great animation on occasion, pretty characters and strong voice work. But it's not a crawl i'd recommend. Especially if you dislike melodrama. \\n\\n\r\nAs I said, it's art and sound elevate a lacking product. The characters, story, and themes were weak and often too simple to explain potentially complicated situations. The music is beautiful but I can't say that's enough reason to watch something. A mediocre product, not because of it's lack of trying, but due to it's completely inconsistent nature. \\n\\n\r\nIf you want to see expressionism through music, watch Whiplash. If you want to see a bunch of broody kids monologue and cry fourteen times per episode, watch Your Lie in April. \\n\\n",

This anime feels very much like Clannad, in that it is pretty melodramatic. I personally prefer happy endings, and I wouldn't say this one has a happy ending. I personally feel frustrated after watching this.\r\nThere wasn't really much of a plot or story, the anime focuses mostly on the characters and their past. The flow of the anime is very inconsistent as well. You go from music, to competition, to love triangle, to very disappointing ending.\r\nIt's hard to describe more withoutgiving tons of spoilers so I'll leave it there. I'm not the best at writing detailed reviews as most would prefer, I can only leave my feelings here for anyone else that might find it useful. I really wanted to love this anime, and maybe in a sort of weird way I did, but overall I am disappointed and frustrated.",

            "content": "(THIS REVIEW HAS SOME SPOILERS SO PLEASE READ AT YOUR OWN RISK)\r\nSo this review is basically on Shigatsu wa Kimi (Japanese) or Your Lie in April (English). I have to say, this anime was pretty awesome but it had some major clich\u00e9 stuff going on but I'm pretty sure I'd rate it as a must watch if you like the kind of touchy-touchy or romantic anime (I also use the word 'clich\u00e9' a lot so please don't be annoyed). And of course, I must state again that this review of Shigatsu wa Kimi has spoilers, so please read at your own risk. Anyways, enjoy thisreview!\\n\\n\r\nSTORY:\\n\r\nSo, the story had some major problems. The protagonist, Arima Kousei, was a star pianist. That I get but then he stopped hearing the notes? Seriously? I mean, I guess it's supposed to be dramatic but seriously, this? I mean come on. And then the other protagonist, Miyazono Kaori, she had an illness that paralyzed her legs? Talk about clich\u00e9. And then all of a sudden she produced a violin out of thin air? Seriously? I seriously think that the sad scenes in the anime are forced but then again, it had some beautiful moments. I rate the story 6.\\n\\n\r\nART:\\n\r\nThe art was seriously great. It was really vibrant, which of course I like. Sometimes it's a bit too bright for my eyes but it's cool, I can live. I s'pose that it had some minor blemishes but it's fine. I loved the character design for the protagonists though, like seriously. It was pretty cool. I rate the art a 9.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND:\\n\r\nThe sounds are awesome, it's pretty much beautiful but that would be an understatement. I mean, the opening song is flippin' amazing, at least two people saw me try to sing along with it in Japanese. The soundtracks are equally amazing too, well, what do you expect? This is an anime that features the infamous pianist, Arima Kousei, and the gorgeous violinist, Miyazono Kaori. I rate the sound a 10 but I do regret it that I can't rate the sound higher.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER:\\n\r\nThe character backgrounds are clich\u00e9, again. I mean, Arima lost his mom at a young age and then he quit violin? Come on. All I can say is clich\u00e9, clich\u00e9, clich\u00e9. And then all of a sudden, a girl changes his mind? And Kaori also had a past that was pretty.. how do I say it.. unoriginal? She was a frail child and had went through a lot of surgeries. Then she saw Arima at a music recital and was encouraged to meet him. Talk about clich\u00e9. But I guess I can't see how they could end it if they couldn't go clich\u00e9. I rate it 6, I guess.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT:\\n\r\nI loved it, I really did. But the scenes where people cry over are pretty nonchalant to me. I feel as if the scenes are like you put sad anime songs in the background and then BOOM, you just start to bawl your eyes out. The thing is, the sad or \"feely\" scenes are pretty forced. But even so, I still enjoyed the anime even with all of it's forced scenes, clich\u00e9 scenes, and so on. I'd rate the enjoyment a fair 6.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL:\\n\r\nThe anime was pretty clich\u00e9 (I'm sorry but I had to use the word again), but it was worth it. Again, it is a must watch (well, for me it is). I really did love this anime and I hope there's going to be a second season. This anime did have a few ups and downs but this is seriously one of the best anime I have watched (so far, and note, \"ONE OF\" the best, not the best) in the first-half of the year. It was amazing, really amazing. Loved every second of it (excluding the forced scenes).",

            "content": "Perhaps the most cringe worthy melodrama I've yet seen in anime. The premise itself is just plain cheesy. I mean, he \"can't hear the music?\" Really? While I felt that the foundation of the story seemed a bit dramatic to begin, I thought I'd give it a chance mostly because of the high rating it has so far. I quickly found that the execution and the character interaction was just as cheesy as the premise. This is one of those shows that tries too hard to give viewers \"the feels.\" Each episode I saw (I only saw 3 mind you) had some ordinary event blownway out of proportion by trying to force an emotional soundtrack and overly emotional acting in an otherwise mundane event. Its a shame, because I thought the soundtrack itself was actually good, and I appreciated the classical pieces that are featured in the show. Unfortunately, the cringeworthy melodrama made this show unwatchable for me. I often find that the most emotional shows don't make \"the feels\" their main focus, which is why I'm often wary of shows that are raved about for being so emotional, cause often these shows are trying too hard in that regard. If you can stomach the forced melodrama, then you may like the show (which probably means you're also a fan of Clannad or Anohana).",

            "content": "Before you read my review, keep in mind that, as this site is not equipped with an exemplary rating, I'm in the habit of ranking things out of nine, and only when something is phenomenal and distinctly outstanding does it merit a ten.\r\nSometimes, amidst the millions of generic Shonen Anime and other cliches you will find, there comes a show that is truly different. One that doesn't give a flying Kuso about the current norms and trends, and creates something original. Is Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso that show?\r\nIt just might be.\r\nThe story is told from the point of view of one Arima Kousei, whowas once a child prodigy and a budding piano virtuoso under the tutelage of his extremely stringent mother. However, after her untimely death, his next performance brought with it a surprise; he was unable to hear the piano. Now, I'm sure the word 'Interesting' has surfaced in your thoughts by now. Let's throw in the traditional wild card; a perky blonde-haired violin player who does what she wants with the music, completely ignoring the rather stringent set of rules that seem to hound the world of classical music in Japan. Some annoyingly cheesy moments ensue, and they begin to walk the long road to reclaiming Kousei's lost music.\\n\\n\r\nIf I were to look at that paragraph without any prior knowledge of that show, I'd say it has as much potential as anything I've ever witnessed before. Hell, depending on what it does, maybe more! \\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately, the show decided to go in an entirely different direction with things, and soon enough, I found that nothing significant was happening, and nothing was interesting or entertaining enough to give it the flair that a good slice of life show comes with. As of the ninth episode, we're still learning about two of Kousei's former tsundere admirers, which is essentially the same two lines of introduction; 'I like the piano. I want to be better than Arima Kousei'. And this isn't even the largest problem.\\n\\n\r\nWhere this show goes horribly wrong is the timing. Every single performance is punctuated by flashbacks. Sure, they add some flavour now and then, but after the first time or so they start to annoy, and when you witness five minutes of it bang in the middle of what's supposed to be an important performance, it's exasperating, no matter how good the flashbacks get in terms of character development and explanations. That being said, there are times where this show completely nails its moments, and to the trained eye, these moments are golden.\\n\\n\r\nBut despite squandering opportunities left and right, there is still promise. In my opinion, the story and setup get a 6.\\n\\n\r\nThe protagonist, Arima Kousei, doesn't have a whole lot of depth to him. At least not up until this last episode (episode nine), where you're forced to rethink any thoughts you've formed about his character as jarringly dark details regarding his past are revealed.\\n\\n\r\nThe other characters aren't anything special. However, there is one character I find I am taking quite a liking to; that of Miyazano Kaori, the aforementioned free-spirited blonde violin-playing girl. Her chirpy demeanour takes some rather dramatic turns, and even a rather dark (if subtle) one in this last episode. You could say she's the equivalent of Durarara's Celty Sturlurson; a character in a terrible show that is so good, you'd watch another three seasons just to see what becomes of her.\\n\\n\r\nI think the characters deserve a 7 out of 10, even if all but one are more akin to mannequins with descriptions than characters. I tip my imaginary hat to you, miss Miyazano.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is spectacular, and while I don't harbour any profound respect for A-1 pictures, they definitely know how to pretty things up, and the art style is something I haven't come across before. The performances, however, are where things are slightly slack. Don't get me wrong, if they weren't punctuated by several flashbacks apiece, they would be the high points of the show, but the bar has been raised for me with Sakamichi no Apollon and its perfectly rotoscoped jam sessions. I would have liked for them to be a little more... Captivating.\\n\r\nThe animation gets an 8 out of 10, in my opinion.\\n\\n\r\nIf you're a fan of classical music, you'll relate to this show to an extent, but it uses the music more as a plot point or a stepping stone rather than an element of the show that receives appropriately sincere treatment. Hell, that isn't to say that the soundtrack is bad; it's actually rather good; it's just that it isn't given a chance. \\n\r\nI think it deserves a 7 out of 10.\\n\\n\r\nAs for my personal enjoyment, I find myself rather intrigued by certain parts of this series, particularly some questions that arose in the last episode; but there's too many inhibiting factors that prevent me from genuinely enjoying the show. There's the god-awful pacing, the more obtuse moments that serve no purpose and are likely to make you cringe, and the fact that it relentlessly interrupts the one great thing it has going for it; classical music recitals that could be exceptionally badass.\\n\\n\r\nAs for my final rating, I hereby bestow upon Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso a 7 out of 10. \\n\\n\r\nFor a similar show, I recommend Sakamichi no Apollon (Kids on the Slope). It too has its fair share of acute pitfalls, but it more than makes up for it by nailing the setting damn near perfectly and some jaw-dropping visuals, complete with a bucket of AWESOME covers of Jazz standards.",

            "content": "This review only applies for the first 6 episodes of the series, it does not constitute for the overall experience of the anime itself and it will be comprised of what I liked/disliked about the anime and the reason I have had dropped it for.\r\nMen are fucking worthless. In the situation that you see one, or are somehow friends with one, you should, in any situation, be violent towards them. Good examples of violent acts viable are throwing heavy objects at them, hitting them with musical instruments or simply punching them. Also keep in mind that men are creatures that are incapable of making adecision on their own. You should decide their future, even if the decisions they've made are to avoid the effects of PTSD. You see, they are incapable of rational or individual thought, so, if they choose not to do something, and you think they should do it, force them for their own good, especially when it directly benefits you, since you don't want to be pulled down by the decisions of a M.A.L.E. In the situation that these males don't abide by your will, keep hitting and harassing them with your request until they do. Don't accept rejection on any level. As a last ditch attempt, you have one last ultimate weapon. Crying. These species are so honestly pathetic around crying women, even when they can clearly see it is fake, that they will give up, and do whatever you ask of them. But maybe you are a kind person at heart and you'd never hurt or want to manipulate these animals. But trust me, it's okay. Because if you'll ask them \"Do you resent me?\" they will only answer that you make them better. \\n\\n\r\nWhile dropping the exaggerated meninist attitude, this is how the life of Kousei Arima is. He is treat exactly this way by his friends and love interest(s). I can understand some degree of slapstick, designed to make the show more lighthearted and humorous. Sure, I am not a big fan of slapstick, but I witnessed it enough to understand what it means. However, in Kousei Arima's situation, it is entirely overdone. You see, this character, has PTSD, due to the abuse his mother put him through as a child. His mother was crippled by a disease and was unable to play on the piano due to it. The mother forced him to practice the piano continuously days and days on end while hitting him each time he made a mistake, and convinced him that if he wins the competitions, she will get better. Not only did the kid blame himself for any mistake he made, but his mother, the person he wanted to help, hit and abused him at every step of the way. And he was loyal to her to the point anyone who was badmouthing her, he would think to himself \"I am the only person who is on my mother's side.\" Then his mother dies and due to the trauma, he was left unable to use the piano because he couldn't hear what he was playing on the piano as an aftereffect of the trauma. The anime's goal is for this character to rediscover his love for music. But instead what I see is how a 14 year old boy gets taken advantage of in this anime. Taken advantage of how?\\n\\n\r\nTo fill you in, as every relationship screaming quality storytelling, this starts by him taking an accidental photograph of his love interest while her dress is lifted up by the wind, revealing her crotch. She acts out violenty towards him. Then they get introduced to each other by their friends because they were supposed to meet in order to introduce this friend of hers to this girl so they can go on a date. The date consists of her playing at a violin contest. They listen to her and there the 14 year old forms the impression of, and I quote \"She's ultraviolent, her personality blows and she leaves the worst impression, but she's beautiful\". They eventually leave, but they meet again, where she angrily tells him to play a song on the piano in front of some children because otherwise she'd look bad. Then eventually they have a heart to heart and he tells her about the fact he can't hear the notes, but that doesn't affect his day to day life. Then she starts kicking him and tell him that he should play regardless because that's how people like them survive. Afterwards she decides that she wants him to play as her accompaniament at her next concert and has his group of friends bombard him with requests, music sheets and the song she wants him to play for an entire week. He dodges this harassment as much as he can until in the last 30 minutes until the competition. Then she cries in front of him and that convinces him to say yes.\\n\\n\r\nNow let me change my example to something much more extreme and over the top, with which I hope will get my point across.\\n\\n\r\nTo fill you in, as every relationship screaming quality storytelling, this starts by him accidentally parking in an illegal space due to a flat tire, and her giving him a ticket because she works law enforcement. She acts out violenty towards him. Then they get introduced to each other by their friends with one of them having a date with her. The date consists of her going to a shooting range and shooting, I don't know, bottles. They watch her and there the war veteran forms the impression of, and I quote \"She's ultraviolent, her personality blows and she leaves the worst impression, but she's beautiful\". They eventually leave, but they meet again, where she angrily tells him to shoot a gun in front of some children because otherwise she'd look bad, somehow. Then eventually they have a heart to heart and he tells her about the fact he has flashbacks of his buddies dying every time he sees a gun. Then she starts kicking him and tell him that he should use a gun regardless because that's how people like them survive. Afterwards she decides that she wants him to accompany her to a nearby war zone but he refuses. She harasses him alongside his friends by placing guns at his work and playing the country's anthem. He dodges this harassment as much as he can until in the last 30 minutes until the troups assemble. Then she cries in front of him and that convinces him to say yes.\\n\\n\r\nAgain, an extreme parallel, but I need you to understand that any case of PTSD is serious, especially to the person that has been through the trauma. You don't get over your issues just because requests you to and you would avoid the triggers as much as possible because that could make you relieve the trauma and have flashbacks. The writing of the show pretty much makes Arima be bullied out of his depression and be forced to play for the laughs of others. And I simply find that stupid and unrealistic. You can't expect someone to get bullied out of their depression on the sheer fact that they got a crush. You can't simply expect that a character you've written as suffering of PTSD due to child abuse to simply do the activities other people want him to, when they abuse him in order to get him to do it. I am a generally insensitive person, but this is a subject that you do not delve in without understanding how such a person would behave. I am sure that someone that was traumatized by war would avoid fighting in another war. I am sure that a rape victim would have a hard time seeking romantic partners, if not simply avoid them entirely. And I am also sure that someone that has been abused as a child would seek to avoid the means because of which they were abused for. But one thing I am sure of is this. You will never be able to force these people into doing the cause of the trauma ever.\\n\\n\r\nI wish I could've mocked it instead for the fact that it spouted cringy lines like \"my spring came and she made my world colorful. why is the sky so starry tonight\". I wish that I could've mocked it for having all the characters fall in love with each other just because they had screentime. I wish that I could've mocked the series for every other character being simply selfish pricks. But the way this character has been portrayed simply undermine any other complaints I might make because it simply ruined any sort of credibility I could've seen in the series. I cannot be entertained by a relationship that I would believe would never realistically act out this way, and much less by the fact that Arima is just expected to overcome this with no individuality and because his friends want him to. If the week would've been spent with the characters having a talk with him, telling him that he shouldn't give up on his hobby, as he seems to be still quite attached to it after some time, or bring any other arguments to him or at least try to reason with him, I could deem this at least acceptable. But nobody cares about what Arima thinks. Including Arima's boner for the blonde. Nobody tries to understand and be accepting of him. They just want him to do stuff.\\n\\n\r\nThe only thing I truly appreciated about this series is the production values. I've enjoyed the classical music even if I occasionally listen to classical music, but I appreciate it every time. And I also appreciated the detail put in the animation, like the realistic way the hands reflect onto the piano as just one example. It is dissapointing to me that this is wasted on Shigatsu, who equates hitting people as displays of affection as well as an endearing trait, which to be fair, is something common in anime. It is dissapointing to me that it is wasted on something that displays that someone's psychological issues are as just them being fussy and difficult about it. But the fact that is most dissapointing that the main character will be thankful for it, and think that his lifestyle is improved by going through this again. I wholeheartedly agree that if depressed, it is very important to do things that you don't want to do or normally wouldn't do. I also think that friend should be supportive of you and make sure that you are still active in your life. But forcing you to simply do something due to which you got traumatized, is neither support or a way to tackle depression. It's anguish and torture for the person forced to do so. I can't buy into this character acting the way he does, simply because I understand that trauma doesn't work this way.\\n\\n\r\nThe only way I can recommend Shigatsu is if you're easily influenced emotionally and/or impressionable, and are looking for a romance story with good production values. Shigatsu is that. It definitely has atmosphere and metaphors for the romantics out there, and as far as I know, these type of series depend on how you feel about them, rather than what you'd think. I am a more rational person, and I simply can't enjoy things I don't understand, and all of the previous paragraphs explain why I don't understand the way the story goes forward. And if I can't understand how he could see his romantic interest as his romantic interest, besides being 14 and horny, I can't appreciate this series.",

The show follows the life of Kousei Arima as he attempts to overcome his trauma and be able to play the piano again. Naturally, Your Lie in April is full of the usual tropes present in schoolkid slice-of-life musical animes, prodigies, romance, and teenage angst galore.\r\nSo the entire point of any review is if you should watch the aforementioned show: and my short answer is yes, especially so if you like melodrama. Below is the long answer.\r\nWhen viewing any new anime a questionarises, does Your Lie in April bring something fresh and new to the anime community?\\n\\n\r\nWell the short answer is, no, it doesn't. It follows the same formula that is present in every melodrama of the last decade. In fact, it doesn't even try to hide it, blatantly foreshadowing melodrama every step of the way. But does that mean you shouldn't watch it? By all means no. Although it doesn't bring anything new that doesn't mean that it's not good at doing what it does. To put it in short, Your Lie in April does what a melodrama does best, it acquaints you with the characters and makes you actually care about their lives. \\n\\n\r\nThe story is decently written, although there are few if any plot twists, the story does what it's meant to do, and that is it kept me interested to the very end. Although pacing in the show is sometimes questionable, when some side arcs felt more distracting to the overall story, it was generally alright, though the middle of the series lagged on a bit.\\n\\n\r\nThe art was beautifully done in most cases as well, the pastel art style and beautiful landscapes make many frames of this show wallpaper worthy material. However, there are several times when it is obvious the animators skimped with the art.\\n\\n\r\n The sound was generally good considering much of the soundtrack is comprised of songs written by the classical giants. Beethoven, Saint-Saens, Kreisler, and even Debussy comprise the majority of the show's important scenes. A gripe I had with the sound though was the constant voice overs during the musical performances. An anime about music and the music is replaced by dialogue. Who decided that was a good idea?\\n\\n\r\nFinally, the main problem I had with the show were its characters. I understand that it is hard to build up many complex characters within a 22 episode time frame, but even so some of the characters were so shallowly developed it makes me wonder why they're there in the first place. Also, at many points in the show I felt I was listening to adults going through their midlife crisis instead of middle schoolers. Their views on life and success make this cast the most mature set of 15 year olds I have ever seen. Even so, the characters were generally likable, even if they were not the most dynamic.\\n\\n\r\nOverall the show had a well written story and it had good execution. The characters were the weakness of the anime, but it doesn't take too much away from the overall experience. And I guess the most important part was that I thoroughly enjoyed the ride.\\n",

            "content": "Shigatsu is an anime that has been highly praised ever since it's debut. Many people will enjoy and love this anime to death, and others will be able to see it's poor writing and blatant flaws (It seems that a large majority of MAL users are part of the former). \r\nStory: 6/10\r\nThe story of the anime has an in captivating premise, and retains a beautiful outer atmosphere while still exhibiting the true dark nature of the show. Kousei Arima, piano prodigy, experienced harsh child abuse from his mother, (although now deceased) which plays a key factor in his inability to perform to the best ofhis abilities in the present. The imagery is also very well used during Kousei's struggle to play the piano. \\n\\n\r\nThe second half of the show is where things begin to crumble. The show undergoes a repetitive process where characters would perform in competitions and face the same turmoil and problems they experienced in previous performances. The plot also introduces characters here and there that were used as cheap plot devices in order to drive the characters to perform better. The melodrama is another aesthetic that was taken to a whole new level and even began to irritate me with how over the top it was. \\n\\n\r\nThe pacing was very slow, and felt unnecessarily dragged in order to display the '\"battles\" the characters experienced on stage. As I stated before, the anime withstood a repetitious plot, which didn't help with the poor pacing. \\n\\n\r\nArt/Animation: 8/10\\n\r\nThis art in the anime is beautiful. The show is very colourful during performances, and uses darker and bleak colours during the depressing scenes. The animation is fluid and retains consistency throughout the entirety of the show. It never feels flat. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 9/10\\n\r\nThe music is the primary aesthetic of the anime, and it truly does it justice. \\n\r\nMajority of the music is classical, which adds to the realism in the anime. The Opening's and Ending songs are great, and fit the nature of the show very well. The soundtrack is another plus, and I found myself listening to many of the OST's quite often. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 5/10\\n\r\nBy far the weakest aspect of the anime. The main female lead of the anime, Kaori, was horribly written and was a complete plot device. Other characters of the show were weak and didn't receive the necessary screen time and character development required. The only fleshed out and well written character was Arima, but apart from that, I can't mention anyone else.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8/10\\n\r\nShigatsu was an enjoyable anime. It truly was. Even with all of it's flaws and terrible characters, the anime was still a fun watch. The romance, although slight, was still good to see and the relationships between the main characters was heartwarming. The music was superb and I enjoyed every bit of it. The last few episodes of the show was beautifully executed, and definitely provides a tearjerker of an ending. \\n\\n\r\nOverall 7/10\\n\\n\r\nA fun ride, with a real tearjerker of an ending, but includes various flaws that hindered the experience.",

            "content": "A common trend that I see around me is that many people seem to regard any show that is emotional and tear jerking \"beautiful\" or a \"masterpiece\". These people get so caught up in their \"feels\" that they seem to disregard all the problems that a show might have. \r\nThe proof? Your Lie in April\r\nYour Lie in April follows Arima Kousei. A former piano prodigy who swept the competition through his flawless performances when he was a child. But when his mother dies he suffers a mental breakdown and becomes unable to hear the sound of the piano even though his hearing is completely fine.After that Kousei gives up the piano and lives a carefree life with his friends for two years. Now he views the world in monotone, devoid of any color. His usual life continues until one day a chance encounter in April turns his melancholic lifestyle around and changes his life forever.\\n\\n\r\nThe first half is pretty lighthearted for the most part. The colorful animation, unique characters and slapstick comedy really give off the feeling that it's a romantic comedy. It's only when you delve deeper into the show that you realize this isn't the case. In the second half the show becomes much darker and this is what brings me to my problem, the melodrama. For me I don't hate melodrama that much. It is an effective way of evoking emotions from the viewer, but the problem that I have with Your Lie in April is that apparently the producers thought it was a good idea to put in a dull joke in almost every sad or dramatic scene. It feels like the makers of the show thought that the melodrama would be too much for the viewers, so they decided to slide in a crappy joke to lighten up the mood. This just ruined many emotional parts of the show for me and it was pretty annoying.\\n\\n\r\n One of the biggest criticisms I see with this show and agree with is the excessive use of monologues. The show has a lot of monologues, and when I mean a lot I mean every episode. Now although I personally like monologues in literature and animation Your Lie in April uses monologues so much that in many cases it becomes redundant. Is it so much to ask that you don't treat the viewers like we have no idea what the characters are feeling?\\n\\n\r\nAs a character driven show. You would expect a lot of depth in the characters right? Well yes and no. One thing that I really commend Your Lie in April for is Kousei's development. His growth from a depressed and melancholic kid to a person who stands up to the face of tragedy and moves on is truly rewarding. But don't expect this amount of development for the other characters. Watari gets little to no development over the course of the show. He is pretty much just a side character filling in the role of friend A (pretty ironic, isn't it?) Watari's lack of development doesn't bother me that much, but Kaori's lack of development does. In the start of the show. Kaori is shown as probably one of the most important main characters that helps Kousei get over his past trauma and help him play again. But in the second half of the show she feels like a side character whose only purpose is to move the story forward, and she only gets the development she deserves in the final episodes. This was truly disappointing for me because her character had so much potential to be great. There was one character that Your Lie In April didn't neglect though, and that's Sawabe Tsubaki. (Kousei's childhood friend) Tsubaki's constant struggle with caring for Kousei while denying her feelings for him was nice and it was very interesting to see grow through the internal struggles of her feelings.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation in Your Lie in April is pretty impressive. The vibrant colors and beautiful backgrounds really bring the show to life. Characters are animated with more detail than usual which might turn some people off, but I found it to make the show that much better. One thing that I really liked from Your Lie In April is the visual effects that are implemented in the emotional parts. There were definitely some effects that really intensified the whole mood, and it was absolutely beautiful. There are parts where the animation took a small dip,(Still shots, lazy animation) but all in all the animation was just stunning and I wouldn't want the show to look any other way.\\n\\n\r\nNow for a show like this you would expect the music to be an integral part of this show, and Your Lie in April doesn't disappoint. The soundtrack is top notch and fits into every scene flawlessly. The musical performances were also nothing short of stunning. The first opening \"Hikaru Nara\" is a great opening that fits the lighthearted tone of the first half, while the second opening \"Nanairo symphony\" didn't seem to fit in the second half as well I had hoped but it was still a great opening nonetheless. The first ending \"Kirameki\" is a really nice song with a laid back tone while the second ending \"Orange\" has a bit more sorrowful tone to it which fit the atmosphere of the show perfectly.\\n\\n\r\nI'll be honest here. I would be lying if I said I didn't like this show. I was the person that would watch the newest episode right when it came out. And in the end I guess its the reason that I really like this show that I can point out its mistakes, and take out the time to actually write a review for it. If you truly loved someone would you ignore his/her flaws and treat them as a perfect person? Of course you wouldn't. From personal enjoyment I loved Your Lie in April. I  loved Kousei's performances and watching Kaori's energetic personality always brought a smile to my face, but nevertheless just because I love a show doesn't mean I ignore all the flaws with it. \\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Story (7) : \r\nThe story focuses around Arima Kousei, a 14 year old boy who stopped playing the piano when his mother died..14 years old. This is probably the most unsettling aspect of the show. He is is barely starting his teenage years yet his thoughts and the way he interacts with other characters are extremely mature. I think most monologues in the show were brilliant and greatly helped with character development and I don't think it's fair to discredit an entire show simply because the age of the characters don't really fit with their thinking process but it was annoying. The show focuses alot on the music and the growth of Arima as a pianist. Personally, I feel like Shigatsu is one of those shows where it is incredibly easy to get involved emotionally in the story because of how the monologues are executed. The premise of the show is very interesting and the execution in itself is always pretty flawless. However, the main reason I gave the story aspect a 7 is the very missed attempt at creating a dramatic setting. I am far from saying the show fails as a drama but I feel like the aspect is not explored correctly before late in the show. It feels like the story was created for dense harem mc's who just can't understand something unless you shove it in their face a billion times. The ending of the show is easily one of my favorites but I don't think every single episode of the serie had to remind us of what was going to happen. I mainly focused on the bad aspects of the story but it's  because it's the weakest point of the anime in my opinion. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters (8) : \\n\\n\r\n      Giving a rating to the character section was incredibly difficult as I would consider certain characters incredible and others very mediocre, especially considering they are labeled as \"mains\" on here. Let's start with the good ones.\\n\\n\r\nArima Kousei is the main character of the series and by far the one with the most depth. Throughout the anime, seeing him develop as a pianist and as a person feels incredibly rewarding and he was easily the best part of the show for me. Shigatsu is an anime filled with monologues, almost exclusively from Kousei and while they are not necessary to understand his emotions, they add incredible depth to them and contribute greatly to getting the viewer involved emotionally in the story. This is where I think shigatsu may be hit or miss for most people. I think if you're not able to care for the characters, the flaws of the story and of certain characters will completely take away your enjoyment of the series.\\n\\n\r\nThen, there is Kaori Miyazono, a 14 year old violonist. Throughout the whole series, we get to know more about what she really thinks and how she really feels since it's something she hides a lot and again, it just feels rewarding to watch.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, Arima and Kaori aren't the only good characters of the series. The other pianists, Emi and Takashi, receive an incredible amount of screentime for side characters. We get to know a lot about their past and see them evolve and their relation with Arima evolve throughout the entire series.\\n\\n\r\nNow, here is where the series messed up character-wise, Tsubaki and Watari. In the first episodes, they are almost constantly with Arima and we get the impression they will have important roles to play in the story but they just... kinda stand there, especially Watari. He is Arima's friend but besides helping him a couple times and playing the goofy lady killer, he is absolutely useless to the story. Tsubaki as a whole receives a bit more depth, but this depth is often just forgotten to keep the main story going. She will often get a lot of screentime one episode and just be forgotten for the three next.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters were either incredible or mediocre, which again could lead to a different enjoyment of the series depending on which ones you pay more attention to.\\n\\n\r\nSound (10) : Shigatsu Wa Kimi No Uso is not a music anime. The piano performances are here to express the character's emotions and they achieve their goal brilliantly. Every single piece in the anime holds a different meaning and conveys different emotions, The pieces fit in perfectly with the mood and unlike most other piano animes, the piano keys pressed are actually accurate. The openings and endings are also breathtaking.\\n\\n\r\nArt (10) : At first, I found the character design very weird and unsettling. However, this feeling quickly disappeared after a couple of episodes and I was able to fully enjoy how incredible the art truly was. In fact, the art gets better and better as the anime progresses especially once the piano scenes start to increase as it's able to convey emotions without even needing words.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (10) : I can easily recognize the flaws of the series and I can totally understand why some would consider it overrated. I feel like this is probably a hit or miss like most drama animes. Personally, everytime I started an episode, the flaws just disappeared and I was fully enjoying everything. This is why to me, Shigatsu Wa Kimi No Uso is a masterpiece.",

Kousei is the only character who got fairly developed to be honest. Kaori's character was stereotypical, the main character's love interest who lacked depth. However, her \"development\" or should i say \"exploration\" came way too late which was unfortunate. Another thing about the characters was the fact that there were so many and most of them served no purpose they only distracted the viewer from the main plot. \r\n- Unrealistic characters. Weare talking about 14 year old kids, who weren't portrayed as so. I get that Kousei was depressed due to the loss of his mother and his struggles but as a whole the other characters were too dragged to the point of melodrama. \\n\r\n- Failed comedy relief. The jokes were bad and some scenes were cringe worthy. \\n\r\n- Unnecessary and long monologues that were also repetitive. The dialogues were also unrealistic and awkward. Also, there were same scenes over and over again that failed to be entertaining.

            "content": "Spoilder-free review: I really wanted to give Your Lie in April a 10/10, I truly did. A lot of the times with high quality anime I try to work backwards and rationalize a 10, but I found that I just couldn't overlook the flaws in this show, and in particular the following 3 things were the deal breakers for me:\r\nTHE BAD:\r\n1. I didn't enjoy the music - and it's not because I'm not a classical fan - I\"m a piano player myself and I still didn't enjoy the music. For an anime centered around music, that is unacceptable in my opinion. I'm always looking atSakamichi no Apollon as the standard for this one because the music was memorable, catchy and instantly recognizable as the series approached its end. Unfortunately, that was not the case with Your Lie in April as I found myself forgetting the piano pieces played in the series. The reason for this was because half the time I couldn't completely hear the performance. There was too much inner monologue that would disrupt the music, and often the monologue dragged on far too long when a simple epiphany was needed. The side characters were also too eager to comment on the side and interrupted the piano. For a show that speaks about how a pianist should let their emotions be conveyed by their playing, it doesn't follow through. I wish that it would commit to the music and let it runs it course, then follow with exposition or vice versa. It simply didn't let one of it's greatest assets as an anime about music shine.\\n\\n\r\n2. I never cried and was never close to it. In fact I didn't even feel sad. The show doesn't seem to know how to dispel dramatic and tense moments other than with ill-timed \"comedic\" moments. I put comedic in quotations because that was their intent but it never came off properly. I felt that whenever a dramatic scene between two characters unfolded, the show was unwilling to have those characters engage in meaningful heart-to-heart talk that is so central to slice of life shows. It was as if it was afraid of getting serious and this was truly a missed opportunity because those are the moments where you can truly witness some character development. And its exactly this problem that causes Your Lie in April to fumble with its big, cry-inducing moments because it dispels all of the atmosphere it creates with this treatment. I'm comparing this aspect with Anohana which never avoided these sorts of situations by dodging with comedy. \\n\\n\r\n3. There wasn't enough closure. I feel like I can't discuss this point without spoiling anything, so I will leave it at that.\\n\\n\r\nTHE GOOD\\n\\n\r\n1. Openings and Endings: MY GAAAAAAAAAAAAWD THESE WERE AMAZING. Loved all four of 'em, especially ED 2.\\n\\n\r\n2. Art & Animation: I liked the theme of colour - how A1 Productions portrays colour entering and leaving Kousei's world is just a treat and Your Lie in April is one of the most animated shows I've seen.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL\\n\\n\r\nI know I wrote extensively about the bad but little about the good, but I truly enjoyed the show a lot, I'm just focusing on why I can't give it a 10/10. Taking this all into consideration I'm giving it a solid 8.",

            "content": "So I went and checked out the hype train despite my busy sched and backlogs, and ladies and gentlemen, I am glad to report that the hype.. is real! Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso (Your Lie in April) is a MUST WATCH specially for fans of classical music.\r\nKimi Uso, if I would put into imagery, is like trying out this Black Forest cake specialty that uses sour cherries at this new classical cafe everyone is talking about. You walk-in, greeted by the beautiful classical ambience, and when your order reaches the table, you see that it actually looks great and appetizing. You start tasting itbut get disappointed, feeling that it does not live up to its reputation, but as you continue eating it, you realize that it has just the right amount of sweetness accompanied with sourness within each layer that gives good contrast and variety, perfect for your palate (well depending on your taste of course). Then when you finally get to the eat the whole cherry on top which you expected to be the dramatically and tear-jerkingly sour climax, you find out that it has this unique, indescribable anticlimactic taste of satisfaction instead.\\n\\n\r\nMusic, romance, humour, trauma, despair, realization, inspiration, change; I find this series having one of the best story concepts and premises I've seen to date. It starts out quite slow and only picks up half-way through, but you can really see the character development and it ends conclusively well, connecting everything, tracing back to episode one. It has good casting, with perfect setups for each character introduction; everyone fits-in and is significant. The only thing I did not like is the inconsistency, blandness or coldness I felt at the end because I was expecting more drama, more emotions, and my helpings of super tear-jerky scenes.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is paired with a beautiful art style consistent with what you can see on the cover and good selections of wonderful classical pieces that can attract people who are new to the genre. You will see fitting character designs, beautiful backgrounds and non half-assed (though sometimes repetitive or recycled) full concours audience with fully detailed expressions; and the most amazingly fluid instrument-playing animation with the most flashy, emotional performances you can experience to date. You will hear well selected voice acting and great, goose bump inducing classical piano and violin that I so love; and which Disney fans should look forward to because they also included Tchaikovsky's Sleeping Beauty Waltz in a most awe-inspiring duet. Such budget. Much wow. This series is eye and ear candy.\\n\\n\r\nShigatsu wa Kimi no Uso is short but complete, and is well produced. I really enjoyed it; to the point that what was supposed to be a check of the pilot episode to pass a few minutes of my time during my visit to the beach, ended up being an all-nighter, that made me miss half a day of my beach vacation. People who liked music titles such as Nodame, Beck, Sakamichi Apollon, should definitely watch this. It is beautiful. It is amazing. It is so much worth.\\n\\n\r\nP.S. I do not eat black forest cakes; that imagery is a lie I told you guys this April.",

            "content": "Watching this show back in 2015, I had high expectations for it.\r\nGiven its beautiful color palette, catchy opening theme, and incredible OST; I had given it the benefit of the doubt, ultimately making the show's outcome worse for me.\r\nCharacters:\r\nFirstly, the anime centers around the overly-melodramatic life of our protagonist, Kousei. After his mother's death, Kousei refuses to play the piano any longer. Yes, I understand losing a family member is hard, but this melodramatic dialogue is prominent throughout the entirety of the show. \r\nOh, someone mentions piano? \"Sorry, I don't like piano, nor do I play it anymore.\"\r\nTake a drink every time he mentions thereasons why he refuses to continue playing, or anytime he makes a dramatic, or depressing line. You'll die.\\n\r\nHe's the typical tragic-backstory-protagonist. Nothing unique, honestly.\\n\\n\r\nSecondly, Kaori. She's the cliche tsundere love-interest that we've seen everywhere. Hitting the protagonist multiple times out of spite for \"comedy\". Which, ironically enough, is a trope this show tries to play out, and ultimately fails at. Her character isn't as likable as others put out. She's aggressive, rude, and bipolar, to say the least. Her character literally centers around her lies. Lies towards Watari, and her interests towards him. And lying about her terminal illness. Which, in itself was incredibly predictable for the outcome of the anime.\\n\\n\r\nTsubaki is more-or-less, the familiar childhood friend character. A sensitive, clingy, and caring side-character that'll never get the protagonist. And, that's how it plays out. Tsubaki hurts herself by clinging onto Kousei, although she knows that he doesn't have the slightest bit of interest in her - only seeing her as a friend.\\n\r\nShe's a forgettable character that's only there for the sake of the plot \"development\". \\n\\n\r\nWatari. There isn't much to say about him, other than; the only reason he's in this show is to make Kousei feel uneasy about his and Kaori's relationship, and is only posed as a friendly rival that ultimately has no other purpose in the show. \\n\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\\n\r\nNothing spectacular, the opening is decent, at the very least. But, nothing\\n\r\nextraordinary as a contrast to other shows. The only part I like is the pastel color scheme that fits perfectly for the anime's setting set in spring.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\\n\r\nBy far, the only part I deem worthy of this show. The OST is beautiful, and fits the show. The classical hints throughout each piece are great. I love classical music, so this was a hit for me.\\n\\n\\n\r\nStory:\\n\\n\r\nOh, boy. Where do I start? This show is overly cliched, and I fail to even see how it has gotten such a high score. I cannot begin to fathom the overuse of cliches and easily predicted scenes. \\n\\n\r\nThe typical tragic backstory, overly melodramatic dialogue, are all factors that decreased my enjoyment for the show. \\n\r\nKaori is rude towards Kousei because he refuses to play for kids, knowing about his mother's death. And even so, she is continually rude towards him, yet he chooses to accompany her with her performances. \\n\r\nHe's known for \"not being able to hear the keys\", and repeatedly states the problems with his mother. This show attempts to play at both comedy and drama, although the two were not able to mix correctly in this show. \\n\r\nThe ending was predictable as ever. Any terminal illness deems death, as what happened. Even though she said she'd be okay, she died.\\n\r\nThe love confession and reveal of her lies were found in a letter Kaori had written for Kousei, and yadda, yadda, cue emotional scene #231.\\n\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion, I did not enjoy this show. \\n\r\nThis in particular is why I avoid romance anime to begin with.\\n\r\nThey're generally overly cliched, with general anime stereotypes that I'd prefer not to see for the millionth time.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nStory: 3/10\\n\r\nArt: 4/10\\n\r\nSound: 7/10\\n\r\nCharacter: 2/10\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 3/10\\n\r\nOverall: 4/10\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Why do I play music? What image am I trying to convey? Did I reach you?\r\nAs a composer myself, these are all inquiries which resonate within me. Combining this with the excellent art, animation, and sound qualities, I was immediately entranced. So given the awesome premise, it might seem strange that I gave Shigatsu a relatively average score. Unfortunately, despite impressive technical qualities, the storytelling falls flat, turning a potential masterpiece into a train wreck of flashbacks, monologue, and feels.\r\nOne of the key themes behind Shigatsu is the dichotomy between vibrancy and monotone. The whole plot is structured around overcoming setbacks and replacing dullness withflair, with Kaori helping Arima recover his love for music after he became tone-deaf.\\n\\n\r\nAll the technical qualities complement this theme very well. The art expresses the concept of each individual scene wonderfully, with bright, vivid backgrounds contrasted with many dark, confined environments. The art style gives each individual character a sense of depth by bringing the character\u2019s emotions to life. The art and animation are also incredibly detailed, with well-drawn, full lips and reasonably accurate portrayals of playing piano and violin. \\n\\n\r\nThe way the artwork for each character changed over time to reflect their emotional and physical state was also extremely well-done. The changes were gradual as to immediately cause alarm bells to ring, but there was a continuous gradient, which complemented the mood very well. There are a few instances in which art and animation quality tanks, but overall, the character designs and backgrounds simply look great.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound complements the spirit of each scene as well as, if not even better than the art. The background music is beautiful, and although the same few tracks are repeated throughout the series, each time they are used they reflect the emotions in the scene nearly perfectly. Furthermore, the background music is not too overpowering, which sets an excellent atmosphere. A lot of shows tend to have the music either be out of place or overwhelm the dialogue and other sounds, but Shigatsu avoids this pitfall with style. The opening and ending songs are incredibly well integrated into each episode, giving the messages they convey much more impact. In particular, I love how the music suddenly changed midway through the series once tragedy was imminent. The first eleven episodes gave off a very free-spirited mood, which was exemplified nicely with the opening and ending. In the second half the music shifts towards a more mellow, expressive, and trance-like atmosphere, which complements the feels very well.\\n\\n\r\nA few episodes into the show, I expected Shigatsu to be the show of the year, especially as the first few episodes were executed close to perfectly with no significant drop-off in technical qualities. Unfortunately, not long after numerous crucial storytelling flaws caused the plot to completely tank.\\n\\n\r\nOne of the key paradigms to effective plots is \u201cShow, don\u2019t tell.\u201d For some reason, Shigatsu decided to throw this concept completely out the window. All throughout the second half, the producers opted to use monologue and flashbacks to explain a whole bunch of random background stories that really didn\u2019t need much explanation, especially at the end of the show. It was so incredibly obvious exactly what was going to happen that even an idiot could easily figure it out, as early as episode nine. \\n\\n\r\nMonologue can be effective when used well, but the producers decided to use it more as filler for actual substance. Similarly, flashbacks were thrown around all over the place, but the information they conveyed wasn\u2019t particularly important, and for the most part the information was already fairly obvious. The net result is that there was an excessive amount of repetition. Expect to see any emotionally charged scene over and over again, as the characters recall those experiences on a whim, for seemingly no reason at all other than to generate feels. \\n\\n\r\nThis problem also creates a huge pacing issue. As repetition fills the void for substantial information, it becomes rather frustrating, especially towards the end, to have simple scenes drag on for so long some of which even continue into multiple episodes. I like the length of the performances themselves, but there\u2019s an unreasonable amount of introspective thought (read: monologue and flashbacks) during such a high-pressure situation. \\n\\n\r\nAs so many scenes continue into multiple episodes, Shigatsu really likes to use cliffhangers over and over again. Used well, they can build anticipation and create more impact in the next episode, but all throughout the series the producers decide to use it more as a way to generate feels. This is not the problem itself though \u2013 it is that every single time a cliffhanger creates anticipation, the very next episode the tension is suddenly released by poorly placed comedic relief. This happens rather frequently within episodes as well. It\u2019s almost as if the motor suddenly breaks down half-way up the first hill of the emotional roller coaster, leaving the viewer to founder. Not a very fun experience to say the least.\\n\\n\r\nAnother big gripe I have with this series is the ending, which completely lacks emotional impact. Whether this is because the rest of the show drained all my feels out and killed my emotional sensitivity or that the last episode too conveniently wrapped up everything, I\u2019m not entirely sure. I get it; the show is about recovering from painful situations, but cutting the emotional impact short and finally solving all the mystery behind Kaori simply gives an unsatisfying resolution. \\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of which, overall the character development is reasonably solid. Although some of the side-stories are a slightly irrelevant to the overarching plot and the melodrama is overdone at times, most of the main and side characters are dynamic and change in realistic ways. The character designs are unique, enjoyable, and most importantly relatable, which gives a sense of depth to the characters. The progression of Arima and Tsubaki throughout the series is done very well, as Arima eventually breaks free from his confined environment to a colorful life and Tsubaki begins to face her true emotions. Kaori\u2019s transition was also executed well, with both her temperament and appearance changing with her physical state. However, it would have definitely been an improvement if Kaori\u2019s background information was explained throughout the series instead of in one big clump at the end. The way the information is presented, Kaori doesn\u2019t have enough depth, which makes some of her actions sometimes seemingly unmotivated and kills some emotional impact. \\n\\n\r\nSurprisingly, despite all its flaws, Shigatsu is actually one of the more enjoyable series I\u2019ve watched recently. Perhaps it\u2019s the awesome character design, or the incredibly well-done and well-integrated technical qualities that immediately captivated me. Some parts towards the end definitely made me face-palm hard, but altogether the show was a great experience. It\u2019s given me important insight \u2013 why do I compose? To create the image I\u2019m looking for, to reach my audience, to express my underlying emotions.\\n",

            "content": "Although I did enjoy watching this anime, I believe that it's incredibly overrated. This anime is very enjoyable to watch, yet at the same time has many flaws that make it not as good as it could've been.\r\nThe story is about a boy named Kousei, a pianist that used to win very competition, until something happens. When he was 11 years old his mother died. He then just stops playing the piano due to the trauma caused by his abusive mother. He then meets Kaori, a character who makes a huge impact on his life and encourages him to start playing the piano again. Shethen asks him to be her accompanist. \\n\\n\r\nNow here's my problem: This anime had no idea what the fuck it wanted to be. Sometimes it was trying to be a romance. Sometimes it just tries to just be an anime about classical music. Other times it tries to be comedy, and this just doesn't work. To be honest, it was a terrible idea to try and combine all three of them, because it clearly didn't work here. Sometimes this anime would make you feel sad, but next second you see childish comedy that comes out of nowhere and vice versa. This brings me to my next point\\n\\n\r\nThe unfunny comedy really killed off my enjoyment of this anime. Times where the girls would just beat the shit out of Kousei and moments like that. I find that to be unnecessary and it just ruins the vibe. As I said before, this anime tries to include stupid comedy during \"depressing\" moments. It really lessens the quality and my enjoyment a lot. If only this anime was more mature then I would've enjoyed a lot more. Sadly this isn't the case here.\\n\\n\r\nI will say that the romance between Kousei and Kaori was pretty decent. Any moment with Tsubaki though was just terrible for me though. This brings me to my next point.\\n\\n\r\nSome characters in this show get too much backstory/screentime yet they have no significant impact on the plot. Tsubaki is the perfect example of this. Her entire \"romance\" with Kousei and jealousy has nothing to do with the story. At least the romance between Kousei and Kaori was significant. They're both musicians so Kousei can understand Kaori more than Tsubaki. And this jealousy thing was just a little bit too cliche for me. I came into this anime thinking it was just about classical music and sad moments. I didn't come here to watch this childish ass romance and jealousy bullshit.\\n\\n\r\nAnother example of a character that got her own arc when she shouldn't have: Nagi. What was the point in introducing this character? I honestly don't know why she's even a character. She just comes out of nowhere and becomes a student of Kousei just to play at a festival. After that she's completely irrelevant. I think she had a bit too much screen time for the nonexistant impact she had on the plot.\\n\\n\r\nAnd holy shit Emi and Takeshi are easily the most annoying characters in this show. Their obsession with Kousei is clearly abnormal, and I just felt like punching my screen everytime I saw that shit. \\n\\n\r\nWhen it comes to characters in general, there aren't many good ones. Kaori was the typical and cliche female character you see in a lot of slice of life anime. Watari was easily the worst character in the entire show. One dimensional, and cliche. Those are the two words that describe most of the characters in this show. I will admit that this show does a good job of making its characters likeable. Even then, when it comes to actual quality writing they aren't very good characters.\\n\\n\r\nThe best written character was Kousei obviously, and also my favorite character. Unlike many of the other characters, he actually got great character development. \\n\\n\r\nAnother problem I have with this show is the flashbacks. There's a lot of flashbacks showing Kousei/Tsubaki as kids, and they get annoying real fast. A lot of them didn't really have anything to do with what was currently going on in the story. They just didn't do anything...? As I was watching this I was always asking myself: what does this flashback have to do with anything? I'm specifically talking about the flashbacks with Kousei and Tsubaki. Some of them were relevant, but some of them were also completely irrelevant and served no purpose.\\n\\n\r\nWhen it comes to pacing, thats one of the biggest problems of this anime. The pacing is just too slow...I feel like the show is also repetitive. I was getting annoyed by Kousei whenever he just stopped playing his piano. It got annoying real fast. That was only for the first half of the show though. The second part of the show got really repetitive as well. First Kousei practices piano, then contemplates on whether or not he should visit Kaori or not. The plot structure is very formulaic, specifically the second season.\\n\\n\r\nThe music and animation are obviously top notch. It would be weird to not have good animation or music for a god damn music anime. I feel like the soundtracks for this anime were overshadowed by the piano playing though. I never really noticed the background tracks to be honest. This anime has two great openings that are easily in my top 10 favorite openings of all time. The art was absolutely amazing though. The art is unique and far different compared to most other modern anime nowadays. I'd give the art a 10/10.\\n\\n\r\nEven though it looks like I'm shitting on this anime, I still enjoyed it a lot. There's just many things that I would've done differently if I was writing it. Firstly, it should've been more mature. All that childish comedy and shit can go away, or at least have a limited amount of comedy. Secondly, I would just get rid of Nagi and Watari. Actually I would just get rid of any character that gets too much screen time even though they're underdeveloped and don't have a significant impact on the plot. Lastly, I would fix the pacing. If those three were better then this anime would've been a 9/10 at the very least. Unfortunately they had to make this anime childish to appeal to a younger audience...\\n\\n\\n\r\nStory/Plot: 6/10\\n\r\nCharacters: 510\\n\r\nArt: 10/10\\n\r\nMusic: 10/10\\n\r\nAnimation: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nOveral: 6/10\\n",

            "content": "Your lie in April is is a snoozefest about about a cast of stupid, generic characters who do nothing interesting or entertaining. Despite this, the show expects us to care about these characters as they go through a tragedy. That's right, it's basically the 13 Reason's Why of anime.\r\nOur main character is Kousei, a character whose single interesting personality trait is the fact that he's good at playing music but doesn't want to. The problem is that the show isn't even really about music so he's functionally a blank slate.\r\nOther members of our ensemble cast include but are not limited too:\r\nKaori, a manic pixie dreamgirl who is extremely useful at driving the plot forward. \\n\\n\r\nTsubaki, the childhood friend character (I would include more if I could but that's literally all she is).\\n\\n\r\nAnd last but not least, Ryouta, the guy whose there to make a love triangle.\\n\\n\r\nThe cast is literally so boring and generic that I didn't even see them as people, and thus couldn't care less about what happened to them.\\n\\n\r\nAlso this show is somehow 22 episodes, despite the fact that the story is only complex enough to really merit 12. Because of this the anime is constantly in slow motion. \\n\\n\r\nJokes aside the show isn't terrible. There are some genuinely interesting things that happen (not because of the characters), and with some better pacing and characterization it probably would've been a good show. It's dull but there is much worse out there.\\n\\n\r\nOh yeah, the art and sound are decent too but basically every show worth watching has decent art and music, so that's pretty irrelevant.",

            "content": "\u201cI met the girl under full-bloomed cherry blossoms and my fate has begun to change\u201d\r\n     There is undeniably great animes with the theme of music and romance. But one that stands out for its art, story, and music is undoubtedly Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso. Filled with beautiful art, music and characters, each episode makes you instantly want to watch the next. This is one series that kept me fascinated from start to end.\r\n     Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso may seem like any other music anime; A talented musician participating in competitions and overcoming obstacles with othersand growing as a musician, but it is so much more. \\n\\n\r\n     The story begins with our protagonist Arima Kousei, a fourteen year old prodigy at the piano. Having being prodded to practice piano for most of his childhood, the sole reason for his devotion was not to the piano itself, but for the happiness of his mother. After his mother passed away his world lost its color, having lost what made him who he was, his standalone quality. He lives out his middle school days, without any direction. However this all changes when he meets Miyazono Kaori, a beautiful violinist that brings the color back into his world. \\n\\n\r\n     Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso is a wonderful representation of a musicians view of the world. Filled with competitions and the inevitable failure, but also the taste of success. This show does well in various aspects and is a great show to watch. The drama builds up each episode, the soundtrack leaves you with goosebumps, and the characters make you want to cheer them on.\\n\r\n\tThis story follows the lives of two extremely talented musicians. Both have their own difficulties, but at the same time manage to push each other forward.\\n\\n\r\n     The world of Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso is wonderfully drawn. The art and used throughout the series was stunning. The backgrounds as well as the characters were well designed with a focus on every detail. For an anime made in 2014 this quality definitely stands out for its unique art, attention to details and its own style of characters. \\n\r\n     As the title suggest Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso, Your Lie in April; this anime takes place around spring. With sakura petals dancing through the air as well as the overall atmosphere in which the anime takes place in really embodies the artwork. Just by watching a single episode one can tell a lot of time was spent on every detail. \\n\\n\r\n     As for the character designs, they were all well done. Each was particularly well drawn and represented their personality and style perfectly. What was even more impressive was that every detail was well articulated, showing every motion when playing their instruments, every pull of the bow and tap of the key, really makes you feel the passion and everything they put into their style of playing. The CGI used was not overbearing in fact it was nicely integrated into parts of the anime. The amount of time and effort A-1 studios put in really shines through.\\n\\n\r\n     However time and effort was not just spent on art, the music played was also an amazing addition to the anime; as it is to any music anime genre. But the music particularly stands out due to its special renditions of classics. Playing even music from iconic composers like Mozarts Moonlight Sonata or Chopin\u2019s Etudes. Even if you\u2019re not interested in classical music the pieces are definitely interesting due to its unique flare and renditions that the characters add on. The pieces chosen were definitely a worthy addition to the anime.\\n\\n\r\n     The soundtrack is also an amazing fit to this anime. The background music played throughout the series can be described as light but overall fitting with the mood and ambiance of the story. The music though not greatly noticeable definitely helps portray the emotions that the characters are feeling. Overall the music and sound presented in this series was wonderful and people who decide to watch this anime should definitely pay attention to it.\\n\\n\r\n     The characters presented in this anime are both unique and interesting, each with their own backstories and unique quirks. There is Arima Kousei who is a talented pianist and Kaori Miyazono a unique violinist.  Both these characters were well designed as have completely different personalities. Because of this, the interactions with each other throughout the story becomes an interesting aspect to watch, both of them supporting each other and pushing each other forward. Not only are their characters interesting but they are also well developed, the progression of each character is nicely paced as viewers we can clearly see the motivation of each of their actions. Each episode is intriguing and builds up the next episode.\\n\\n\r\n    Overall Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso is a wonderful anime with quality story and animation. Those who also enjoy music with a bit of drama mixed in should definitely give this anime a try.\\n",

            "content": "A captivating vignette of that critical threshold between adolescence and adulthood, Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso masterfully captures the sheer sentimentality of one of the most formative periods of our lives, and does so with an astonishing sensitivity to the truly granular nuances which color human emotion and experience. \r\nWhile the work itself might be most readily categorized as a \"coming-of-age\" tale, it doubly operates as a thoroughly cathartic emotional surrogate  for those of us who have been fortunate enough to not yet have dealt with loss in our lives, as well as a penetrating inquiry into the notion of loss in general: whatare the various ways in which we can lose? can we recover that which has been lost, and how do we cope with loss?\\n\\n\r\nAs you will see in the series throughout, loss encompasses not only life, but feelings and perceptions about others, interests and passion in things, and also abides in the dynamic between victor and loser with respect to acknowledgement, affection, and adoration. In refrain, the series expertly explores the ways in which we tend to rationalize and respond to loss, whether it be through resignation, listlessness, anger, reprisal, or despair.\\n\\n\r\nOf course, the work as a whole is a visual and aural delight, and employs these elements as not merely representational niceties to the narrative, but as singularly evocative components which can just as easily stand on their own merits as they can come together to enhance the sum presentation into something truly spectacular. On the artwork, the series elegantly employs an alternating color palette and variable visual style to reflect character interiority: scenes of despondency are depicted with dull and overcast tones; those of bliss tend towards vibrant hues or impressionistic representation with soft and dream-like pastels; and, at the very end, moments of absolute understanding, clarity, and repose as expressed through lucid tones, diaphanous outlines, infinitely reflective surfaces and pristine planes. While I can't speak as authoritatively to the music, the choice of pieces seemed fantastically appropriate; the Saint-Saens was delightfully playful, while each of the Chopin compositions were sufficiently stylistically variegated to accurately reflect the depth of emotions informing the performances themselves, ranging from tender and plaintive sustained notes to dizzying and tempestuous cadenzas.\\n\\n\r\nWhile many question the appositeness of broad, soul-searching, introspective monologues from adolescents, some rather histrionic narrative devices, and the frequent fragmentation of visual and affective continuity with stylistically divergent humor scenes, it has been a wonderful opportunity to view what I believe has been one of the most poignant and cohesive endeavors at relating the totality of emotion which underlies those chance associations which color our experience: those necessarily fleeting moments which imbue us with sadness and strength, and the unanticipated and abrupt way in which these special encounters make us more whole in wholly unexpected ways.\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Your lie in April is one of those sappy Anime I thought I could just pass up. Not pay any mind to and go on to the next \"flavor of the month\". But after the first episode, it had been a while since an Anime had gotten me hooked. And honestly, i'm so glad that it did. For one thing, the Anime does take a dip on the second half of the show, and does start to stray away from what I (and i think you) would like about it in the beginning. But do not mistake this as a a good show gone bad,because it is a good show that just slumps, then ends on a bang. If that isn't enough reassurance, than take a look at a few snaps of art from the show (which is one of the best animated shows I have ever seen) and the great music to accompany it is really good. The characters for me are what you may expect from a Anime like Your lie in April, a underwhelming male character that falls for a attractive girl and becomes more confident and happy as the show continues, but in actuality, it isn't so much the case in this one. Sure our main character Kosei may seem that way at first, but then a subtle twist that keeps this show rolling through all 22 episodes is that he is a massively important young piano prodigy, who went missing for 2 years after an incredible reign among-st his young and talented rivals due to a tragic occurrence. Of course I won't mention what it was or how it occurred, but you have to watch until the end of the Anime, because this event foreshadows a-lot, which I highly respect. If you are wondering at this point whether or not you really want to watch another love story esc Anime, make it this one. It truly is a good one, and though I have a few minor gripes with the show (odd side stories and weird character arks to name a few) the show is good enough to justify watching in one or two sittings like I did. Not to mention, you may have another great opening song to get stuck in your head like I did after watching the first half of the show. Add it to your list, you will love Your lie in April.",

            "content": "First of all, let just say that I stopped watching this around episode 6, so my scores and final score are my judgement based on only those. \r\ntl;dr: I know I'm missing out. I just can't watch anymore. The show is probably very good later on, but I shouldn't have to slog through the terrible characterization of the first 10 episodes to get to that point.\r\nSecond, I am well aware of how generally well liked this show is, and how high scores it usually receives. I can see why, if I squint. The art is amazing, the music is on-point, and the show has severalfactors going for it, like dealing with themes of motivation, goals, child abuse, and more.\\n\\n\r\nThis wasn't enough, not by a long shot. The hints of actual plot were there, and I probably missed their culmination by stopping so early, but I just wasn't in a mood to slog through something I didn't enjoy.\\n\\n\r\nThat is to say, I enjoyed it at first. The first two, three episodes were kinda fun, but then I kept expecting the characters to grow a bit, for something at all to change their circumstances after they got to know each other, but nothing of the sort happened, to the point where I couldn't watch anymore.\\n\\n\r\nAnd I really wanted to like this. I did. I was really interested in the music tag and setting. The premise was very interesting, a retired master pianist with issues is forced to resurface by a violinist girl, etc etc.\\n\\n\r\nI'm not even gonna touch the dramatics or the pacing. Those have already been beaten to death by others, Instead, I'll talk about the characters.\\n\\n\r\nThe problem, to me, was the characters. I couldn't get behind them at all. The two main characters, at least. Out of a grand total of four that appeared by episode six. Kosei, Watari, Tsubaki and Kaori. Watari was okay when he showed up, which wasn't often.\\n\r\nTsubaki was my favorite in this show, but not because she was amazing or anything. She was good, but the others were just worse.\\n\\n\r\n Kosei is the typical doormat protagonist, who doesn't know anything, has almost zero backbone (unless he's been worked over by his 'friends'), accomplishes nothing by himself, and constantly needs the support of others in order to stand. None of his supposed friends respect him, but I can't blame then, because I couldn't respect him at all either, and I really wanted to, because I liked the idea of him. \\n\\n\r\nKaori, on the other hand, is is about 80% of the reason I had to stop watching. She's the most classic of classic examples of Mary-Sue. Incredibly skilled, amazingly beautiful, always (ALWAYS) right, has a somewhat mysterious/interesting(supposedly) backstory, everybody likes her and when she speaks everyone is hanging on her every word, even if she waxes poetic about stuff that rarely make sense or is getting repeated for the third time. Her dragging Kosei by the nose got old very, very fast, I saw no sign of this stopping by episode six, and I was thoroughly sick of it.\\n\\n\r\nI don't know. Maybe I can pick it up again when I'm in a more tolerant mood. For now, I think a 6/10 overall is more than generous enough.\\n\\n",

            "content": "This was without a doubt one of the most beautiful shows I\u00b4ve ever seen.\r\nI\u00b4m not the reviewing-type of person so this will be more my thoughts on this show.\r\nFirst I have to say that this series was from the visual and acoustical point brilliant. There is nothing as annoying as bad CGI ruining the mood of a scene, just because you\u00b4re so distracted that you can\u00b4t concentrate on the dialogue. Just recently I had a few shows I really liked, also from the animation point of view, but when it came to CGI they were quite a mess from time to time (like the backgroundpeople from parasyte). In this case it is the opposite. The merging from 3d to 2d was amazing and I enjoyed the animation of the fingers and keyboards really much. But the animation wasn\u00b4t the only visual aspect I loved. \u201cShigatsu wa Kimi no Uso\u201d always knew when to be bright and colourful, or when to be more dusty and dark. It had a unique art style that may not be for everyone but I personally liked very much.\\n\r\nSame goes for the music.\\n\\n\r\nThis is a music-anime so this is an important point. When you really dislike classical music, or when you can\u00b4t stand a whole episode just watching somebody playing piano, than this is definitely not the right show for you. But If you like it or even just don\u00b4t bother than you should give it a try. Personally I\u00b4ve never been so much into classical music, but I think in combination with movies or series it is a great instrument of support. Here we get characters who try to reach the emotions of their audience through the music. Hence they literally are what they are playing, because their souls became part of the music. So if you don\u00b4t like the music you obviously won\u00b4t get emotionally attached to this.\\n\\n\r\nThat leads us to the characters ...that\u00b4s a hard question. I\u00b4m not so much into romance as a genre because I\u00b4m not good at watching two people who actually love each other not getting together...it nearly physically hurts me. Considering this there is not so much character development. When you get to know a character ...you really know him. There aren\u00b4t many twists or changes in them or their actions, but that is neither a flaw nor is something missing through this in my opinion, because I personally liked the characters as they were. They felt natural and that is something I don\u00b4t say very often in anime.\\n\\n\r\nI haven\u00b4t mentioned the plot yet, but there is not so much to mention without major spoilers...so we get our bunch of high school kids, who are really close friends, but with different goals for the future and our protagonist is a pianist, who quit playing a while ago...so guess what will happen....But that was also not a flaw in my opinion because in this anime the how counts much more than the what.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all this was absolutely beautiful. It gave me chills from the first to the last second and is absolutely worth a try (if you don\u00b4t have a problem with romance, drama and classical music). \\n",

            "content": "Classical music anime and romance combination is not new to the medium. I\u2019m pretty sure some here knows Nodame Cantabile. Then last year, another anime aired with similarities with Nodame Cantabile and probably might be a more tearjerker than anyone expected.\r\nThe first half of Shigatsu is most defining moments of the series. The violin and piano competitions backed by amazing direction is really memorable. Not only that, small moments and interactions between characters and individual monologues along with yet another amazing direction is carrying the series altogether. \r\nShigatsu\u2019s second half becomes more on romance but it went downhill. Melodrama was taken on a extreme leveland was misused. The problems of the second half does not only end in that, it has many redundant moments that makes pacing awfull Speaking of pacing, the second half is awfully slow. Comedic timing is misplaced and destroys the mood altogether. It ruins the supposed drama. Misused melodrama and misplaced comedic timing is a sick combination that can be seen in other anime like Angel Beats.\\n\\n\r\nAlthough the story suffers with flaws, Shigatsu humanizes its cast in the finest manner. Characters motives were revealed in their internal monologues. Some characters had a full episode to develop them. Kousei and Kaori are both archetypal characters but they manage to prove they are far deeper than that. While Tsubaki has her own internal conflicts, some episodes gives insight to that conflict, because of this she managed to become a good character on her own right.\\n\\n\r\nShigatsu\u2019s driving strength is its endearing frames and amazing art direction. They have graceful effect on the plot that makes it better. Sometimes, I just watch Shigatsu for that. Shigatsu\u2019s soundtrack is amazing. HIkaru nara is really a unique piece of music and sets up the proper atmosphere. This is backed up by Nanairo Symphony, which is good in its own right.\\n\\n\r\nFinal Verdict:\\n\\n\r\nShigatsu started good but it\u2019s degrading by episode since the second half, but the last episodes came up for it. It\u2019s still a good show but it could be better. (+ for positive things and - for negative things)\\n\\n\r\n+ Beautiful frames and amazing art direction. Well-developed and humanized cast. Endearing soundtrack. \\n\\n\r\n- Awful comedic timing and weak second half. \\n\\n\r\nScore: 7/10",

            "content": "i am not a reviewer I was just inspired to write this at 5 am\r\nOf all the feels you can feel this anime will make you experience the happiest and the saddest of them. A piano prodigy who has lost his way meets a wildly mysterious violinist who plays with no holds barred.\r\nSTORY:\r\nThis is a great story about love, music, and tragedy. This story will make your heart soar one moment and then sink in the next. Because this is a spoiler free review I cannot go into details but I believe it will suffice to say that the story alone is a reason towatch this anime it is well paced and even in the slowest moments it is not boring.\\n\\n\r\nART:\\n\r\nThe vibrant colors and softly drawn characters are up to par or above most anime. This show is just beautiful and dose not leave any room for wanting in the visuals department. The animation does not look cheap or as if they needed to pinch pennies it is top notch.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND:\\n\r\nIf you like classical music you will love this show, I myself am not a huge fan but this show gave me new respect for the genre and actually had me looking up and listening to the songs from the show. Although I'm still not a major fan but it worked really well in this anime and I want to see more like this one.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS:\\n\r\nThe world in Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso is not very dynamic there are no moving parts to the world to drive the plot thus the characters are the vehicle and driving force for the anime. So this anime sinks or swims on how good the characters are... and they deliver. These characters are not based on archetypes like in a lot of anime, although the tsundere childhood friend does happen to be in this anime, but she is not unbearable and she does have character development and backstory that really help out making her likable. The other characters are fairly fresh and original feeling and that is a major plus in my book.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT:\\n\r\nI really liked this anime, not favorite of all time but it has a good story and very little to complain about, it's the kind of show that if watched weekly will leave you wanting more and if marathoned makes you go without sleep. And when you finish will really leave you with a heavy heart and a lump in the throat.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL:\\n\r\nShigatsu wa Kimi no Uso is a great anime not just watch it once and never again great but buy it and watch it over and over great, though you probably will be pretty emotional while watching it.",

            "content": "Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso has a nice art & great music. I really like them. The anime has been raved as one of the best tear-jerker anime. Which I find hard to agree on. The story is about a girl who helped a music prodigy to continue pursuing his music career after a tragic lost which traumatized him enough to stop him from playing. Although she seems like an angel sent by the gods, not many of us are impressed. This was mainly because of the ending; when the secret to her lies revealed but doesn't gives any real impact. \r\nThere was no realconnection between the main protagonist & the female character. They were not childhood friends, nor were they rivals who despised each other. They never shared special memories together. They were nothing. The backstory doesn't help set the mood. I feel nothing. It felt like it was made to fish for viewers sympathy for the female character who had terrible misfortune. I feel sorry for her. But not Sad. How can anyone feels anything about someone they have zero connection? The backstory really feels empty and one-sided. I find the female character  unattractive. Yes she is beautiful, yes she is good with her instrument. But as a character, not so much. She was a stalker! She imposed her ideas on the guy. Sly her way into his group of friends. Using the best friend to get close. The protagonist may fall for her from her beauty, her determination, her caring, her being his best duet.. but I really felt nothing. The 'Lie' really fail to bring me to tears. I was left with a big empty hole in my heart. dissatisfied.",

            "content": "When this anime aired, I just lost it, really, I was busy doing other things, watching other things.\r\nNow after I opened my profile here, someone that was a friend recommended it to me, as I asked for their favorite anime.\r\nTo begin with, this anime was spoiled to me over time by the very reviews here on MAL, but that's not a big deal I guess. I saw many fights over this, and I understand why. \r\nHere's the thing with this anime: It does have something to say, but it have so many bad things, like the beautiful art for instance, that while beautiful, looks likeone of a thousand catchy animes, It lacks that subtlety that separates shows made with heart ( art ) from those made to be enjoyed by everyone ( pure business ).\\n\\n\r\nIt have great moments, and a one single significant thing on it's story, but it have way too many scenes that are just your average forced cringe pushing drama, and a constant attempt at humor that is one if not the worst cases of failed humor I've ever seen (really, no hyperbole here, it is that bad).\\n\\n\r\nBut the thing is, I don't watch animes considering why they were made, people need to make a living in the anime business, and here we have a kind of beautiful show, with some rare beautiful musical pieces, pretty bad everything else, and one singular point worth of notice, though made many times before with more subtlety and care.\\n\\n\r\nIt's an enjoyable one if you can watch it with your open heart, meaning to take what it offers for what it is, even if in most parts it tries so hard and fail that it is ugly to see. In the end, animes are a business, and while there is artistry in many, and in some points (even here) in all of them, some animes are made with a clear intent to be catchy, they have a clear demographic spectrum in focus, (this case being teens to young adults with artistic illiteracy, that are easily swayed), that while being made mechanically to appeal to that demographic, loses any real creative intent amidst the methods.\\n\\n\r\nBottom line: do you have free time to spare ? have you watched say... Mushishi, or Haibane Renmei ? If yes on both, and you are a bored and craving some cheap drama, try your luck with this, who knows, you might become one of those that gave a 10 score to it, further driving the anime industry into the pits of pure mechanical business, otherwise, don't lose your time here, and go watch those 2 animes I just mentioned.\\n\\n\r\nThe one that recommended this one to me for instance, is one of those. While I recommended him a rare gem of this artistic media we all love, called \"Simoun\" (watch that one and see if you can point me one anime that look or sound like that ^^) He, while badmouthing it, very calmly disclosed that \"he may come to hate an anime in spite of the person who recommended it\".... really, let that sink in gents so you can judge for yourself, the level of intellect of those that come here and give this thing a 10/10...\\n\\n\r\nIt's a show that at all times, \"tell the viewer what to feel\", and in such a poor and cheesy way, that it almost makes the whole thing lose it's value completely. \\n\\n\r\n... The thing is just disrespectful really, its like kicking a dog away then trowing him a sausage and watch him happily come closer to be kicked again...\\n\r\nIt's just sad, but it is what it is.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 4\\n\r\nArt: 8\\n\r\nSound: 8\\n\r\nCharacters: 3\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 5\\n\r\nOverall: 3 \\n\\n",

            "content": "I've never been on such an emotional journey in my life, ever.\r\nYour Lie In April is one anime I will never forget, and for good reason. The story is simply about a boy who lost his touch with music, but slowly developed over time into something astonishing. It's a slow start as you get to know the characters and understand the story, but when you finally reach the precipice, it all makes sense. Being a musician myself, I truly resonate with this story. It shows that not only do you have to have connection with your music, but it shows that you need to havedrive in order to make something magical. Seeing Kaori & Kousei play together is like a symphony within itself, it shows a true bond between man, and his music. It's a true journey.\\n\\n\r\nThe art and sound were both staggering. The compositions, as well as the scores they introduced were simply brilliant. They show that weakness can lie in music, and you really hear it here. I admit that I watched the dub opposed from the sub, and I must say that they did an excellent job with the voice-over's. The art was to be expected, I really felt that I was in the room with them as they played the piano, or as they were walking outside. The art here is no singe.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters were outstanding. I love how Kaori is so uplifting and gives everything a second try, even if she may not like it. Her carefree nature really gives this show a different vibe that is quite nice. And Kousei, with his broken past is given a new thanks to her. The show really works in harmony with it's characters, and they all have a very specific place that they fit. And that works out very well.\\n\\n\r\nIn the end, I was at loss for words. You will laugh, you will cry, and you WILL be confused whether to do both, or none. This show has so many interwoven emotions that are present you often wonder if you're watching a show, or living in their lives as a ghost. I highly recommend this anime to anyone who likes music, or just likes to sink their teeth into some emotional stuff.",

            "content": "Shigatsu wa Kimi no Osu, otherwise known as Your Lie in April was a breathtaking series which bordered on the edge of perfection. The show excellently displayed the passion and emotions carried by musical art and left the viewer with a different outlook on musical performance as a whole. Your Lie in April does a fantastic job of immersing it's audience through captivating and beautiful art combined with exemplary music choice and placement. This immersion is a core component of the show and is also the reason I felt it deserved a perfect score. \r\nThe story of Your Lie in April isn't too elaborate, noris it fanciful like that of many other animes. The story presented is both plausible and realistic; it's a great story and makes for an interesting watch, though nothing about it stands out enough to define it as exemplary. \\n\\n\r\nThe show truly stands out when reviewing it's art and sound. The art throughout the show was very well done and quite consistent; some scenes, particularly that of the final episode were entrancing and showed the true beauty of the show's artwork. I could not bring myself to give Your Lie in April any less than a perfect score for it's art. The musical composition of the show was also very well done. The show focused particularly on classical music; the only downfall of which may be an adverse affect on viewers who do not have a preference for such. It's sensible to believe however that even those who dislike classical music will find themselves immersed in the show through the art and emotional evocation alone. Though, for those who do enjoy classical music you will find the choice of music as well as it's placement throughout the series to be quite extraordinary. \\n\\n\r\nThe character development throughout the show was superb. We watched Kousei (the protagonist) change as a person from start to end; we were allowed to witness him overcoming the struggle of losing someone important to him at a young age and as a result were able to see him grow as a person. Along with Kousei we were given an in-depth look at the past and present of both of his rivals: Takeshi and Emi, his childhood friend Tsubaki, and the heroine Kaori. Extensive understanding of each character is difficult to achieve in a twenty-two episode series, making Your Lie in April exceptional in terms of character development. There were a few characters who did not receive the same level of development; though not enough was left out to demerit the viewers emotional relation to each character. \\n\\n\r\nAs a whole, Your Lie in April was an exceptional show which I would avidly recommend to anyone who enjoys anime. If you decide to give the show a chance I hope you are able to enjoy the experience as I did. Thanks for reading! \\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Nodame Cantabile IV : The Ballad of the Spoiled brats is a sad show.Sad in a way that it didn't live up to its three preceding seasons of which obviously outclass this show in so many corners.Not that I didn't expect that because,as you can see, this show is actually not a direct sequel to the Nodame Cantabile Series but merely a sidestory about spoiled brats playing piano....and violin.\r\nMusic is freedom.Music is what makes life more colorful,more livelier and more meaningful.Emotions hidden within every notes is conveyed through music.Its reach is infinite.It can also heal one's wounded heart.Such is the power of music.Not that itmatters.This show is like a cheesecake with too much cheese.It's good already.Sadly, so much cheese ruined it.The animations are awesome,very consistent,so colorful and fluid.It's an eye candy.The sounds are great,or even perfect.I can live with this music in my ears forever.Characters are cute.What else? The story,I can't say anything about it because this show is fueled not by the plot but by the characters.And then I look deeper to it, delve in to its insides.After going out, I have to say that this show could be better if only the director was different.Most scenes were damn too cheesy.I love dramas but not this kind of drama.I understand that most drama shows always have cheesiness but some make up for it by lessening it or adding something to balance it.Man,most scenes are too unnatural or should I say forced that it made my hair raise.I was about to quit already but then, the performances came and it was like I was watching a different show.The performances were too fantastic and moving.I was impressed.Everything flowed smoothly during those plays and the next time I knew it, it's over already.Seriously,the performances should have been better with just music and no dialogues.The music and the scenes transitioning during the concerts were enough for me to understand what the characters are trying to convey.Most characters are likeable and quite realistic but the way they act feels unnatural.It's like the characters were told to act shamelessly but they didn't want to do it so Director-kun forced them to just do it or you get no pay and this was what happened --- \"super duper \"junior\" school cheesiness\".But exception,again, is during the performances.The characters during their plays were fantastic.It's like they became different people.They were natural and I feel connected to them.And then,after the play,they go cheesy again.Humor is also cheesy.Actually,everything in this show are cheesy except,again, the performances.This show,I expected too much and hoped too much,but expectations = shattered.My conclusion is well,obviously because of the cheesiness.I hate cheese.This show is not really bad.In fact, it's good and could have been made better if only the characters were more natural,touch-feely scenes made less cheesier,and more violin performance of Kaori(the last one is just me being selfish).Bottom line? The director tried too hard making a drama show but was just not cut out for that kind of genre.He should just make a show about cheese. \\n\\n\\n\r\nThe fourth season is just superfluous to the Nodame Cantabile franchise.It shouldn't have been made.Just kidding.I'm glad this show has been made.And of course, it's title is really Your lie in April.lol.I actually personally liked this show.In fact, I love it.But I'm mentally retarded so I aspire to become a scientist that conquers the world with her madness and then, I'll sleep. Oh god, I'm a genius.\\n",

            "content": "What a rollercoaster. \r\nI am not writing this in order to review every aspect of the series. It is mostly an opiniated, subjective review of what I felt was missed, loved, or completely went wrong. Sorry in advance if I sound like I'm a hater, because that is not what I am. I enjoyed this series to a certain extent, but ... just read it if you want to know. :T\r\nLet's start by my melodramatic rant of a series I had high expectations of at the first half and then let's go into what I liked. You could just skip to this part if youdon't feel like listening to a blob whine about stuff you most likely enjoyed since I'm so weird.\\n\\n\\n\r\nKids comforting each other - not legit : Since when do kids this age start up paragraphs of comfort when one feels down? Kids don't recognize this type of stuff. It'd be Tsubaki's parents telling Tsubaki to go see him - oh and don't forget an umbrella or you'll catch a cold! It's legit when you see videos of a kid caressing another in order to make it stop crying, because it just repeats what its own parents did for them in a similar situation... Starting to say complicated words of comfort and whatnot makes no sense in this situation.\\n\\n\r\nCat dying so randomly - could have been okay in a darker alternate reality where she dies, but Arima is depressed instead of elightened. Another life he would not have been able to save. It would later lead to him suiciding, or something dramatic as such (that's how I would have used the cat dying part, if needed to be inserted, so it could actually have an impact). \\n\\n\r\nNaivet\u00e9 with love. For Tsubaki it's okay, but for Arima it's not. He's suffering from the same cancer almost every main wuss male character suffers from in anime : obliviousity of girls loving them. 2-3 times it happens where she obviously blurts out she loves/likes him and then runs away (hitting him or not) and he just looks at her and thinks it's normal??? Then we expect him to do something about it, but it the scene just cuts and they pass on to another day... uhm... lame?\\n\\n\r\nNo motive Kaori-Arima : There should not really be a motive for Kaori to force this dude that didn't play a performance for 10 years over and over again. I watched the part with the letter. He got her motivated to get into the music department... at 5 years old? I don't know, I feel it wasn't executed well; I just can't get my hands on how to express it.\\n\\n\r\nArima is a drag. To everyone - even a little friking girl. This is a trait that contradicts other people's relations to him. He's a lame ass guy that doesn't do anything unless told and it makes no sense for people to get around him in this manner. Unless he had a mental disease, maybe.\\n\\n\r\nDeserve praise? For all you did for me? I don't get these words said by both Tsubaki and Kaori towards Arima. What did he do for them? Perform for Kaori after she used up so much effort that even a sloth would act faster in order to get him to do it? Or for saying that Tsubaki was not an actual gorilla and a girl... Okay, so romantic for a 5 y-o.\\n\\n\r\nAttention whore. Need I mention his name? He loves being cuddled and recomforted so hard, like a cat. Is he a cat? Is this done on purpose? It completely missed the mark for me. Praise him and he scratches back (btw I love cats, just not this depressed one).\\n\\n\r\nLast minute resorts - shounen phenomenon. Why? Why does it have to be last second? It happens every time Arima is performing. Why can't it be that he feels this way BEFORE performing, instead of as he is currently in session? It makes it so much less realistic than it should be...\\n\\n\r\nDidn't use her death properly. They should have made Kousei learn of her death after the performance he would have been glad of. It would have impacted him a lot more. After such a great performance just for her, he would hear about her condition and be seized by the news. Also, if not this situation and keeping the same scenario that happened, then it should have ended in her repeating the EXACT same motions she air-violin'ed on the hospital roof top while it was snowing; not to mention I felt he was sad instead of depressed to get her back in the end. I think depression would have matched his extreme piano playing more for that part of the song.\\n\\n\r\nThere should be no confusion nor bad guys, or so that's what the author wants the image to be, but the image that was portrayed to me was not this wanted one. What I mean by this is that Arima is a complete jerk, but none of the other side characters seemed to have felt this way, except for Tsubaki that mentions it, but I doubt she really means it. She sees him as a liar, because that's what he is, but it feels like nagging from an over compulsive childhood friend more than anything.\\n\\n\r\nEliminating competition is super convenient for this series. I feel like if eliminating Kaori was the only way for the final scene to exist, where we see that Tsubaki reconciles with Arima and happily live ever after.\\n\\n\r\nInconsistent character in Arima Kousei. Instead of being depressed over any little thing like he's been all this series, he's living without any worries anymore. Actually, this is the type of feelings he should have had throughout the whole series, but he's always been so lame and curled up over every little thing. Now that she's finally dead, he manned up? I don't buy it. Similar to when he went into the hospital room. I mean, of course he has to feel sad, but at the moment he sees her, in front of him, alive. After seemingly thinking she was dead, she is alive. You'd expect a bit more happiness. But he's not a happy man... until the end when she actually dies. Idk, makes sense somewhat, but not after all this series has made me feel towards Arima and how they built him.\\n\\n\r\nTheir comedic relief sucks. Hard. Limited to Kousei getting lifted upside down by his sensei, thrown stuff at by Kaori/Tsubaki, or just serving as a punching bag for any girl since he's a wuss.\\n\\n\r\nKaori makes this whole story. So naturally, me being pissed about Kousei Arima is not really an issue if you consider he's just a shitty secondary character. Kaori is the one that brought Kousei back on his feet (like 5 times), sacrificed herself for both his and Tsubaki's feelings (and it doesn't matter if Watari suffers, because nobody cares about him, right?), and gives this whole story a goal.\\n\\n\r\nYou may have noticed that a lot of this rant is about the last episodes. I think I've said enough, but for a bonus about the whole series, I really despised the repetitiveness of them reminding us he can't hear and he sucks, as well as the fact his mother died. That part was extremely boring and tilted the series to be a lot less interesting than I had found it to be originally.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nNow, for the good stuff. Even I need to admit some stuff were really well made.\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe letter at the end. It was extremely necessary for it to exist. Else, it would have given no meaning to her death, after that bad use of time lapse (crap, I forgot to mention it), avoiding any sort of complicated expressions every character would have felt. And I also really loved Arima's (wow, you liked something about him afterall?) expressions as he read it, because those felt real and good.\\n\\n\r\nThe parallel to the first opening as Arima was performing his last piece. OH YEAH. I totally felt that, it was extremely brilliant and epic, for someone that really digs music in anime. I have not seen many other series do this so well, so I was really surprised. I also really love their soundtrack. I mean, the music they play is flawless in the \"concours\" and it's weird to give the trophy to any contestant since it's literally the song itself without mistakes, but the OPs/EDs and the song called \"Yuujin A-kun wo Watashi no Bansousha ni Ninmeishimasu\" are used brilliantly. Not to mention how great the images they give us during the OPs and EDs are.\\n\\n\r\nKaori's tears and person. She's so strong and powerful. She deserves better and is passion in person. I really loved this bright character and without her this story would be a complete mash up of Arima's mistakes and messes. So much potential and originality with how much maturity she gives off.\\n\\n\r\nThe concept. Music! I long for more complex series that distance themselves from classical pieces, since we already had the popular Nodame Cantabile, but it was really used well. More classical discoveries to be made and this time in a more piano-focused fashion (although I really love violins much more). It truly takes a lot of effort to play at this level and they portrayed that effort very well. \\n\\n\r\nThe art was well and modern (not to mention colorful, but still conservative, which I like - no pink or green haired people). Use of CGI was not overdone, as it was to mostly direct fingers while playing violin or piano. I don't dig it, but it was not in vain.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nWell, that's it for my review. I am mostly deceived about this series because I feel like it has let me down, but I have hopes that this series will bring forth even stronger ones, with great characters like Kaori.",

            "content": "I started this anime by telling myself \"I'm not going to cry.\"\r\nSurprise, I cried. \r\nI basically knew nothing going into this series, only knowing that it focused on music and was suppose to be very sad. There aren't very many \"plot twists\" that you can't really predict ahead of time, so I didn't find it a very unpredictable series, but the story is very enjoyable. [Well, as enjoyable as one that makes you cry can be I guess.] Overall I found it to be very real and very believable that this could happen. I suppose my one complaint would be that I felt asif it dragged in the middle, and I felt as if some subplots weren't really needed and rather distracting from the main storyline. Nothing major though.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation in this series is fantastic, particularly the backgrounds. The opening is actually one of the most beautiful openings I have seen in a long time, I never skipped it while I was watching the series. I also don't remember ever encountering a particular scene that I felt was oddly animated or lacked in attention to detail. I will complain that they intentionally chose not to show one character's hands when they were playing piano at one point, probably to cut down on expense, but the scene wasn't really noteworthy and I just thought it silly. I will also complain that they used 3D during piano scenes as well for the piano itself, but they never used 3D animation for characters, only objects.\\n\\n\r\nSo here is the double-edged sword associated with this series, the soundtrack. As you would probably somewhat expect from a series that centers around violin and piano performances, there are a lot of classical music numbers throughout the series. This is great! Wonderful music! But because you have these prominent pieces, every other song that was not a classic was completely overshadowed and overpowered. I can remember none of them other than the opening song. \\n\\n\r\nOkay so I found two of the main characters to be bland anime character archetypes. The childhood friend and the popular playboy. All characters get an adequate amount of screen time and character development, but aside from the main piano player and violinist, there wasn't anything that particularly stood out to me, nor was there anything about other characters that made them particularly memorable outside the series. Not bad, but not great.\\n\\n\r\nAs I mentioned previously, I found that the story lagged a bit in the middle. I really feel as if the series could of been 18-20 episodes long rather than 22. I also found some subplots to be rather irrelevant and distracting to the main storyline, and not really necessary. But hey, if you do enjoy all the main characters then you won't find them really a complete waste of time. Beauty is in the eye of the beholder and all that.\\n\\n\r\nWould I watch it again? I'm not sure. If it was shorter, probably. Would I recommend it to others? Definitely. It's a beautiful portrayal of friendship, young love, growing up, and how illness affects people. But it wasn't a flawless series in my opinion, and it had some room to improve. Overall 7/10.",
