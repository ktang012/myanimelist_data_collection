            "content": "Okay, let's get it out of the way: If your still watching at this point, you probably don't have a problem with ecchi, boobs, panty shots and ALMOST hentai. SO going on that basis, I'm not going to cater to the type of person wo's gonna whine about the obnoxious Boob/panty shots.\r\n This show is awesome. Seriously, it's the best ecchi show ever created (and believe me, I've seen a few). And why? Because it doesn't take itself seriously. Some shows, like Highschool of the Dead, would be good if not for the fanservice, but Dxd works in the opposite way. It would suck withoutthe comedy, fanservice and stupidity. Let's break this down:\\n\\n\r\nSTORY: For what it is, the plot of DXD new is actually fairly serious, without seeming dumb. . .much. The first arc is actually quite dark, and all in all I enjoyed the greater scale the second season had over the first. The best/worst point about the plot, depending on who you ask, is the fact that the writers always have a new plot device to the pull out of there ass to explain why something happened. Which is great if you can look past it, but some people can't. \\n\\n\r\nART: Probably the worst aspect of the show, the art is pretty standard, and the show basically goes at the basic level you would expect for an anime in 2013. Probably because the animators were too busy drawing boobs.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND: The music for this show is legit good, although I would say that neither of the openings in this season lived up to the awesome one from the first. That said, all the main themes that play through out are pretty good, both light-hearted tunes for the comical half of the show, and epic orchestra's and simple wind sections for the more dark/serious portions. \\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS: You either try and take them seriously, and hate them, or you don't, and love them. I think that Issei is great, because he's basically ME if I was in that situation, and all the new side characters are pretty great (Go IRENA!!!). And a couple of the original team get some fleshing out, namely Kiba and Akeno, so good times.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT: All said and done, this is why I gave the show a ten: It's fun. Highschool DxD is the best show to just relax and watch, with a box of chocolate/kleenex, depending on which way your inclined. And as Ecchi shows go, it's definitely at the top end of the scale. Can't wait for season 3!!!",

            "content": "Highschool DxD New! \r\nThe second season of \u201cHighschool DxD\u201d. As you may know, this is an anime series that actually has a story line. The anime consists of having ecchi, harem fan services, the same as the prequel. The story is involving a guy named Issei, who is seventeen years old. If you have watched the prequel of this anime, you would know that he is Rias Gremory\u2019s (King) Pawn covering up all eight pieces of the front strike army. Issei has a goal to be best harem king! \r\nStory : 10\r\nThe story of the second season is mainly about the characters and their past.We get to see how Yuuto Kiba was found by the beautiful captain, Rias Gremory to be her knight. Half of the series is about Yuuto and his sad-ning past. Akeno Himejima also gets screen time in this sequel and we reveal very eye opening secrets about her. We also get few characters to join us in the adventure.\\n\\n\r\nSound : 9\\n\r\nThe voice acting in Highschool DxD will not disappoint you one bit. The voice actor of Akeno, Shizuka Itou, did a wonderful job on keeping her voice to seductive as possible. The voice actor for Kiba, Kenji Nojima also did a great part for the emotional and sadness voice acting for Yuuto as we reveal his past. The OST, or the background music really hit the spot in the second season! The music was very well fitting with the theme of the anime at the specific moment. The opening song from Episode 1 to 6 was very disappointing in my opinion and didn\u2019t really touch or felt in contact with the song. However, the second opening song \u201cGekijouron\u201d by ZAQ lasted from episode 7 to 12 did a very fine job on the song and the music. The ending songs were very\u2026 weird\u2026 As it was \u201cChuro Churo Haye Haye, Churo Churo hey girls!\u201d I was disappointed but to harem and ecchi fans watching the screen will be not as it includes the female characters from DxD doing a dance and making very sexy poses.\\n\\n\r\nArt/Animation : 10\\n\r\nThe art in Season 2 is agreeable that, this season was better than the last. How you may ask? There were a lot of scenes that the club went in forests or parks that has trees. As the leaves on the tree block the sun\u2019s view and give you shade, it felt very realistic that on Issei (usually) there were some sun spots on his cheeks and shade on other half. The art of the animation was outstanding as there were more nudity in Season 2 and was enjoyable for a lot of ecchi and harem fans. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters : 8\\n\r\nThe main character is still very annoying and is surrounded by women with pretty faces and big breasts. He tries to be a hero and says \u201cHey! Don\u2019t talk about her like that, you bastard! I\u2019ll kill you!\u201d and gets beat eventually and embarrassed on his butt. The secondary characters in Highschool DxD are very interesting as we get to know more about Yuuto and Akeno-kun\u2019s past. Few more characters join us in this journey. I cannot describe it well without giving spoilers but the character is mistaken to be another gender while the other supporting character is a beautiful short-haired lady who is the enemy of Issei and the gang and later joins them. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment : 10\\n\r\nOverall I do think that the Season 2 is better than Season 1 and would highly recommend to anime lovers in the genres: Supernatural, Ecchi, Harem. It is now to the conclusion that I give my overall rating for this anime which would be a perfect, 10/10.\\n\\n\r\nThank you for reading my review; if you have come this far I will add something extra. \\n\r\nAnother Recommended Series in this type of genres : \\n\r\nRosario To Vampire\\n\r\nPrincess Lover\\n\r\nFreezing\\n\r\nOmamori Himari\\n",

            "content": "With the onslaught of ecchi titles that have come out this past year or so, there haven\u2019t been many of them that have the distinct charm or courage as some of the great ones. They are all devoid of any pleasure or wit in how fan-service can be portrayed as colorful and sometimes ascetically beautiful in its artistry and dialogue. However, with that said, there are occasionally great gems hidden in the genre that does provide great comedy and memorable characters. Enter High School DxD.\r\nThe series started with the first season as, in my mind, as a decent comedy/fan-service show with plenty of entertainment tobehold. Unfortunately, to its set-backs, most of the characters didn\u2019t get enough deep characterization except for Rias, Asia, and Issei. Now we have High School DxD New, with a new story, plenty of glorious fan-service that makes the previous series pale in comparison in this aspect, and plenty more character development that was lacking in the first season. It is because of these three examples that make this season the best one of the series so far.\\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s one thing if there are plenty of fan-service to your show to rank up with the great ones, but how does the art design fair with the show? By far, this series has some of the best character designs I\u2019ve ever seen in any ecchi anime. All of the girls are drawn exquisitely gorgeous and are very easy on the eyes. Typically in this type of genre, you have to talk about the breasts and whether if they are over-emphasized to the point where they don\u2019t compliment the girls\u2019 figures. While it may depend on what you feel is too much for your size, the breasts in this show compliment all of the girls\u2019 bodies and don\u2019t feel out-of-place at all given how they are beautifully drawn. It is also a huge plus for the studio\u2019s part to show the breasts in full uncensored glory and no annoying white fog.\\n\\n\r\nNow with the actual fan-service itself, there are plenty of reasons to like certain fan-service scenes in any show, but if you want to make it fun and exciting for someone like me who wants good writing put into his fan-service show, you can\u2019t always put one in every single minute. Contrary to popular belief, there can be an intelligent way of putting fan-service into your anime. The key is good pacing in-between each joke and good writing that is both quirky and funny that doesn\u2019t feel old after each continuing episode. In DxD New\u2019s case, they actually spread the fan-service far apart enough to where they all feel new and fresh every time you are shown one. From the first second of the show, you\u2019re already put into a situation where you have Rias\u2019s gorgeous naked body cuddling with Issei, and it\u2019s done with very smart intentions thanks to Issei\u2019s funny dialogue.\\n\\n\r\nOnto the actual characters themselves, they all are still lovable and charming as ever in this second installment. At first, Issei can seem a bit over-eccentric at times with his love of oppai, but it\u2019s one of those things where you can\u2019t help but love the guy for his pure passion for something that he loves. It does help that he is voiced by the always mystifying Yuki Kaji who seems to always pop up in the most random shows these days; I also consider him somewhat the king of perverted characters in this current age of anime at this point. The one and only Rias Gremory is back and isn\u2019t afraid to rev up the funny nature of the show up a notch with her fantastic body, and it doesn\u2019t help for us with poor hearts that the always sexy Yoko Hikasa voices her, which in mind is just perfect casting. However, the one character that has now shot up to new heights of greatness is Akeno who is given more development that she so desperately needed and good heavens were it an enjoyable experience seeing her hilarious seductive moments to Issei.\\n\\n\r\nSupporting cast is, unfortunately, hit and miss for this season. We\u2019ve already had Asia\u2019s development in the previous season so there\u2019s not much to talk about in her role here but it is nice to see her jealous moments here and there, always a nice laugh. The ones that are a hit are Xenovia and Yuuto who are good for different reasons. Yuuto\u2019s plot arc involving him and his role in the club is now fully developed in his plot arc in this season and it\u2019s actually done with good effect in his own personal struggles with coming to terms of his past. Xenovia is good in a different way. Not that her development was bad by any means, but her dialogue involving Issei is some of the funniest of the season by far. Her wanting to have a baby with Issei has to be the most brilliant comedic scene in the entire series in how it comes out of nowhere and how it is written so funny. The rest of the good characters in the season are definitely Rias\u2019s brother and father who I would love to shake their hand in showing us an embarrassed Rias.\\n\\n\r\nFor the ones that were a miss are the ones who don\u2019t leave much of an impression, unlike the ones I\u2019ve mentioned above. There are times where characters, one in particular Irina Shidou, seem like they are going to have a more significant impact with the show\u2019s story but they are hardly even there once the story progresses. It is a real shame because Irina seemed like she would be an excellent character see in funny situations with Issei. Koneko is another character that is hardly ever given anything to work for other than to show off her combat abilities and say disgusting remarks at Issei\u2019s perverted behavior. With the side characters, they aren\u2019t initially supposed to have a lot of material to heighten the plot and comedy, but the writers could\u2019ve at least come up with more exciting things for them to do so we can care for them.\\n\\n\r\nNow with the characters out-of-the-way, how is the plot fare with the fan-service? While the plot in the first season wasn\u2019t anything groundbreaking or unique, it was mostly driven through character interaction and with this new season it fares a little better in how they introduce interesting plot arcs. Luckily the melodramatic moments in the first season are hardly in this season, so it doesn\u2019t seem so hokey and eye-rolling in how undramatic it was. Not to say there aren\u2019t any serious moments, there are plenty of them, but they aren\u2019t done in a way where I would roll my eyes in how out-of-place it is with the tone of the show.\\n\\n\r\nSo with all that\u2019s said and done, High School DxD New is a welcoming sequel to the lovable franchise that shows no limits to censorship and great oppai. Unprofessional as I make it be, there\u2019s an underlying fact of life that we are all human and we love to look at pictures or videos that gives us pleasure and makes us happy to be alive. We all need to keep this in mind when judging shows such as High School DxD, whether you love it or hate it. If there is something we can all agree on, is giving us the existence of Rias-senpai; what more could you ask for?\\n\\n\r\nGrade: B+\\n",

            "content": "Let's get out of the most obvious factors first. For those already familiar with the High School DxD franchise, you're probably already familiar with some of its elements like the ecchi fanservice, harem building ethnics, and clothes tearing off through battles. More than that though, High School DxD New surprisingly has a plot. Can you believe it? An ecchi series with a plot! Well, if it means anything, it also involves a young man named Hyoudo Issei as he makes his goal to create his own harem and become a harem king. \r\nAs part of the continuing show from the original High School DxD thataired in 2012, High School School DxD New continues directly as a sequel series. It adapts material from the light novel (novel volumes 3 + 4) based off the same name written by Ichiei Ishibumi and illustrated by Miyama-Zero. The show returns with delicious fun and trouble for Issei and his friends as startling revelations are exposed and conflicts are established.\\n\\n\r\nFor a breath of refreshment, Issei Hyoudo is the typical high school kid who has no girlfriend but instead fantasizes about women (usually ones with big breasts). Then, he has this date after being asked out by a cute girl one day. If you thought your date ended up being terrible with the girl of your dreams blowing you off, then think again. Issei's date gets himself killed and in the worst way possible. But luckily, fate strikes as he is bought back as a devil and servant but the beautiful Rias Gremory. Now, Issei is part of a greater destiny. \\n\\n\r\nNow with that out of the way, we can move on because Issei has learned quite a bit since he was killed from the first season during his first date. For instance, he has been perfecting his 'Dress Break' skill to many degrees that tends to result in compromising moments against his female opponents. At the same time, Issei has also began to make new relationships whether friend of foe. There is a certain instinct in Issei throughout the series that makes him....desirable in a way for his female companions despite them seeing him as a pervert. For Issei though, he is still often despised as a pervert at school wherever he goes. It doesn't seem like the way other female students at school has changed his views on him since the first season either. To make factors worse, there are also rumors being spread between him and another fellow student \u2013 Yuuto Kiba. It's not the prettiest picture when rumors saturated with BL undertones are being spread around a co-ed school that was once a female only academy.\\n\\n\r\nBut with that being said though, it is surprising that Yuuto Kiba gets quite the highlight especially in the first half of the season. Normally in harem series like this, you'd expect the main guy to be the center of attention trying to hog all the girls. However for the first half of the anime, we get to see a different side of Kiba than his usual cherry self. This relates to an incident in the past as we get take a little trip down memory lane. From that path, Kiba's past is not only revealed but we also get to see many startling revelations. Along with that though, new characters also makes their appearances from the light novels. Plot-wise, the second half focuses more on the ongoing conflicts going throughout the world of High School DxD. These conflicts become more grim and grimmer as we encounter antagonists that puts nearly everyone's lives at danger. Even with Issei, Rias, and her servants on the good side, there's a sense of hopelessness and anger-like atmosphere present. That's definitely a lot worse than failing an exam during high school.\\n\\n\r\nAs this is the sequel of the original High School DxD, most of the main and supporting characters return while newer ones makes their appearances in the show. Of the most prominent female characters returning is Rias Gremory, the most admired beauty at school. However at the same time, we also can't forget the other girls like Asia, Koneko, and Akeno. This is especially true as Akeno herself also gets a spotlight and revelations are revealed about her. The certain degree in which her character shifts between flirtatious and moody makes viewers questions a bit about her past similar to Yuuto Kiba. It's from this sequel that we learn more about them as well as the new characters. \\n\\n\r\nAs more secrets are revealed, conflicts also emerges throughout the series. This time around, the Occult Research Club really has their hands full not just dealing with the typical assignments but also saving the world. It's about survival and various instances puts many characters' lives at risk. The risk involves the new antagonists with seemingly incredible abilities. They're faster, smarter, and stronger. Even the new supporting characters seemingly gets on the bad side of Ria's Occult Club that rises some angry eyebrows. \\n\\n\r\nJudging the action of this show, High School DxD New maintains balance of fighting and comedy the same time. It's surprising though since shows like this should be parodied with fighting especially with Issei's forbidden 'Dress Break' technique, a skill so lustful that any female getting a taste of it might not feel the same way again after its first experience. Maybe I'm exaggerating here but the show presents it in a way that is laughable but also the same time serious with its atmosphere. The majority of the main female cast all possesses skills in the arts of fighting with various degrees ranging from conducting electricity, healing, or throwing hardcore knockouts with a simple knuckles' fist. It's obviously by now that we realize the female characters of this show represents a sort of antithesis as to the typical feeble or frail girl. At the same time, Issei himself shows a bit of experience and determination whether it's in battle or conflicts. This is what earns him the respect and even admiration of his peers. \\n\\n\r\nThe show has fan service. This is obvious for those who are familiar with the first season. It doesn't go tame in any way in this sequel though. Even the first few seconds might raise some eyebrows with our beautiful Rias Gremory and her servant. There are many instances throughout the show that presents fan service in various ways whether it's the cliche pool episode with swimsuits, naked aprons, or just...nude in general.  Fans can take this in different ways but Issei takes it as the experience of a youth. Most if not all the fan-service incidents in this show involves Issei and a female character in some sort of compromising position. These aren't always accidental either but rather intentional. What makes a bit frustrating though is how dense Issei is despite obvious hints given by the female characters being interested in him. To put it a bit simply, he's the type of guy where you need to have billboard written out to get the message through him. The various teases and delicious bodies of the girls are sometimes right in front of him, not more than 3 feet away. However, his response is generally typical and so predictable that it hurts. \\n\\n\r\nVisual wise, fan service is out in the open. The majority of the female characters are designed with attractive curves, crystal clear eyes, and voluptuous figures. There's many direct references to their figures throughout the show by Issei and other characters that makes it distracting to watch. But taken on a more serious perspective, there are some decent design for the fighting transformations especially for some of our antagonists. They give off a dangerous look and presents that sense of hopelessness when confronting the heroes of this show. The new supporting character also give them a more holy-like aura while one other new character might be mistaken for its gender. Yuuto of course returns as a bishonen while Issei is colored with generic flavors. It's nothing extraordinary at all but for a show like this, it's to be expected. Just take a look at their uniforms with the obvious suggestive factors and you'll get a good idea.\\n\\n\r\nIt's uncommon these days to see a one core series getting two different OP/ED songs. This is featured for the first half and second half of High School DxD New. The OP songs has a similar premise giving the montage of the main and supporting characters with bits of foreshadowing. The OP song \"Sympathy\" by Larval Stage Planning has this eerie like tone to it while its second OP song \"Gekijouron\" by ZAQ expands a bit of its first half. If fans remember the original ED song from season 1 with the pole dancing and very suggestive poses, then the first ED song might be a bit of disappointment in terms of service. The second ED song  though brings back that delicious fan service factor fans might be hoping for. It's noticeable that both songs are performed by the voice actresses of the same characters in the show as well. (Yoko Hikasa, Shizuka Itou, Azumi Asakura, Ayana Taketatsu, Risa Taneda, Ayane Sakura). The OST is consistent enough but sometimes seems out of space. Well what do you expect though? The boobs are back.\\n\\n\r\nIn essence, High School DxD New is what fans of the original series may want with the fan-service, action, and plot progression. Yes, I said plot progression. Even for an ecchi show like this, there's development with certain characters that progresses the plot in its way. This series is definitely not the best show out there but it has its moments. If I had to describe this show, it would be sexy but also equally annoying to watch at some cases. Emphasis on the sexy.",

            "content": "Alright people, heres to the second season of demons accompanied by  boobs boobs more boobs and some stuff that almost crosses lines into the hentai realm, but hey, isn't that what we're all here for at this point?\r\nSure there are haters out there that are going to accuse anyone who enjoyed this show(or me for giving it a 10) of being an idiot who only cares about boobs, but that is not the case and I will explain why I think its a good show throughout the course of this review.\r\nStory: Issei is back trying to get all the women for his harem orwhatever, and while the show cant be entirely be carried by shots of boobs (god bless them for trying though) it has enough of a story to keep me interested. Basically like the last season theres a bunch of boobs with a story in the background threatening issei's future hopes of being surrounded by boobs, all ending in a semi anti-climactic battle where isseis only motivation is (you guessed it) boobs.\\n\\n\r\nThis isnt bad though, because one thing that ive learned is that you cant have ridiculous amounts of fanservice and an award winning story so i wont hold it against them for sacrificing one for the other.\\n\\n\r\nArt: Once again, if the animation team could draw circles and make them bounce, they were golden. Seriously though the art is very nice (very nice--said in a creeper voice) and i think it looks pretty friggin sweet.\\n\\n\r\nSound: You hear three things in this show: shit blowing up, a bouncing noise(i cant imagine what for), and the words \"ara ara\" as such, since those three things were done well enough, alls well in the sound department.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters: Yes yes yes we've seen the characters before: the perv, the bombshell, the loli, the man candy, the shy girl, and the lightning wielding sadist... okay well maybe not the last one so much. Frankly though, i dont care if ive seen these character types a bunch before because in this show they all are perfect for what theyre doing and I cant find flaws with any of this.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: lots, lots and lots of enjoyment. I just have alot of fun watching dxd and thats something that i cant say for many animes.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: I really have fun with this show, I know that theres a large fan base out there, and I think that thats what counts at the end of the day. If I didnt seem to say alot about the show in the review, its because I am writing this for those who have seen everything up to this point and need nothing more than this. Honestly though, those who have seen and enjoyed season one dont need me to tell them to watch this.\\n",

            "content": "Oh Pie, Oh my and Oh No, so what's my verdict for this 2nd season of High school DxD? Not good, and here's why:\r\nStory: Fair 6.\r\nThe genre was still the same genre, the plot was a bit new and a bit boring, the only thing that studio  TNK does was to add new characters for every climax that comes along. Then again the part where the harem becomes intense was nice to say the least and Rias getting serious with stupid Issei also adds spice to this anime's story plot, but it kinda annoys me that he's too hesitant to bang either one ofthem and let's not forget about Akeno and Xenovia whom has no reservations of being the guy's concubine. \\n\\n\r\nArt: Outstanding 10.\\n\\n\r\nOh PIIIIIEEEEEE! So I'm guilty of enjoying this anime's fanservice, in fact it wasn't a surprise that this is where studio TNK is banking. I also like the scene where Issei is with Rias and Asia.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound: Good 7.\\n\\n\r\n I like both the 1st opening theme and the 1st closing theme, but not much on the 2nd closing theme and the 2nd opening theme, in fact those 2 new themes came in too little too late.  \\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: Mediocre 5.\\n\\n\r\nWell, the character where still the same, we still have stupid Issei who still wants to be the \"Harem King\", Rias is still present and so as the rest of the 'Occult Club.\" however the introduction of new members aren't that of a surprise since there characteristics have been already featured from the manga, as for the vampire, Gasper Vladi I kinda find it disgusting that he has to be this cross dress, day walking, half vampire and half human thing, I would have been nice if he was presented as a she and become another competition for Issei's affection. As for the other support characters... I just don't have much to say about them.\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Very Good 8.\\n\\n\r\nI said it before that I enjoy the fanservice that comes with this anime and it is the fanservice where studio TNK is banking on, everything else was too annoying especially Issei who would do anything for sex and his dream of being a \"Harem King\", that is if he ever bangs anyone in his club, school and in his household since all of the clubs girls are now living with him, which is fair to say that such scenario does add to this anime's enjoyment.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall: Pathetic 1.\\n\\n\r\nIf I were to view this in an objective manner, I would say that season 1 was a bit fine compare to this sequel, co'z in this sequel the expected battle between the Welsh Dragon and the white dragon has ended in a draw when some new character from the Khaos Brigade came by to interrupt, and really Son Goku from \"Saiyuki\" have to be the interloper?????????Corny!!!!!!!!Also, the main character Issei is way too annoying and there isn't an episode where you don't hear him say OPPAI, OPPAI and more OPPAI, man, he should be banging Rias already, frankly, his annoying and horny character alone,really makes this sequel too pathetic.\\n\\n\r\nAdios amigos. \\n",

            "content": "Highschool DxD New has been a very popular series among the fans of Ecchi/School-life this season, but does it really live up to the hype? What follows are my honest opinions on it. \r\nLet me begin by saying that I don't wish to be flamed for what I write, and if you take what I say that seriously, than you should think of a decent way to refute my reasoning. \r\nTo begin: the story. The story was horribly executed, with any drama in it being written off for scenes where they could make the moral reasoning for the character be nothing more than: \"I wantto see Rias's tits\" The story had a bit more to it than what I originally expected, but it didn't do much better than the first season, and as such shouldn't be rated above it. Now, I will admit that the addition of a few new characters was interesting, but it didn't drive the plot quite enough. \\n\r\nNow, considering this is ecchi, the plot is definitely more than what I'd originally expect, but it's nothing special. A solid 3/10 \\n\\n\r\nNow onto the characters. Considering that I look for characters with depth, while many of you look for the outer image of them, I'll split it into two categories. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter Physicality: As always, Rias and Akeno's proportions are very exaggerated, and I cannot support those kind of appearances. However, the addition of new girls with average/realistic body-types was a plus. I enjoyed seeing the new types of girls that they produced, and the way they acted based on the tropes of the series. 6/10 \\n\\n\r\nOther Character Traits: The characters didn't really garner any more depth than they had in the first season, and the only real development was around Akeno. Not that quality in this regard. However, they did add a bit more depth to the characters they added, and as I mentioned Akeno, which leads the character development to not be awful, but still be sub-par. 3/10 \\n\\n\r\nAnimation: The animation is very basic, and is mostly made up of bland backgrounds and talking heads. However, seeing that it's basic for current animation, I will not rate it too poorly. Also, considering that they did crisp up a bit of a faulty bits of animation from the first season, and it did mature a bit in regards to how polished it looked. 4/10\\n\\n\r\nSound: The voice acting cast is not bad, but in no regards are they amazing. The music/soundtrack is fairly basic as well, but it's not bad. With the songs being made up of similar music to the first season, and the OST being set to only a few scenes each episode, there wasn't a lot to base this score off of. However, seeing as it wasn't terrible, the following score is fair. 6/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall (I added 1 point for enjoyment value): The story is better than a lot of other ecchi, but it pales in comparison to the first season, and other than a few better-characterized females joining the harem, the story didn't develop too much, and left far too much unanswered. By no regards is this show above-average. What they could have added based on the source material, they disregarded. They turned what could have been fights based on love and such (similar to the first season) into more intense duels, and yet they turned them into gimmicks to have Issei pray for Rias's tis. However, I couldn't really expect less from an Ecchi/Harem. 5/10",

            "content": "With the coming of High School DxD New (Second Season), it once again delivers on a high note, giving fans what they desire the most (No not just Oppais).High School DxD New concocts a remedy of action / comedy / supernatural / School Life and good ol harem. To top it all off, the audience gets a overly gracious amounts of fan service. This anime clearly is catered to the male audience, but however it possibly wouldn't deter females from also watching it as well for various reasons. Reasons such as having consistent enjoyable episodes, which are usually never dull, a rather above average storywith several plot twists, and lovable cast of characters with different personalities; whom actually have some type of character progression & back story.\\n\\n\r\nJust a warning to those who want to try out the High School DxD series, whether it be from the first or second season, there are truck loads of fan service / Ecchi (particularly Nudity) There are only a several of animes that actually can pull this off and be considered a pretty good anime.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nStory: 8.3 -\\n\\n\r\nThe story isn't particularly a very complex one just by reading the synopsis, but this anime provides twists and turns on a consistent basis. Pacing is right on the mark, for example a huge fan service episode (Typical beach episode) then suddenly it continues, with actual plot progression. That deserves some credit where its due. \\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: 8.5 - \\n\\n\r\nOverall animation is very well done, not over the top & fancy, but never below average. There's a great usage of neutral colors, because essentially it is sort of a dark premise. A lot of warm pinks and reds colors if you know what I mean are present as well. The action scenes are fluid and amazing to watch.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 8.5 -\\n\\n\r\nThe characters in High School DxD are all surprisingly and distinctively different from each other. I believe this is where  High School DxD New's strong suit lies, other than its over the top fan service. \\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nWow Factor: 8.5 -\\n\\n\r\nEvery episode is always enjoyable to watch and is delivered on a yes, consistent basis, the way they manage everything is amazing. Without a doubt High School DxD New keeps the audience thoroughly amused and wanting to know what happens in the next episode. A great anime with an over abundance of enjoyable fan service, very comedic / humurous, yet can switch gears nearly on a dime, to a more serious mood. High School DxD New is definitely worth a watch, you shall not be disappointed!\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nFinal Grade: 8.4 / 10 -> 8 (Anime List)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\n           + The balance between the plot & ultimate fan service\\n\r\n           + Overall Consistency\\n\r\n           + Angels, Demons, Swords and Oppais\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nReview by: AzurexSky of AniRaters",

            "content": "(This has been adapted from my reddit thread)\r\n(This is a review for both Season One and Season Two)\r\nIn anime, there are many types of shows, from dark fantasies focusing on action to romantic comedies with a splash of drama. One genre in particular, ecchi, is mainly aimed at providing more sexual themes/happenings than other genres. For many ecchi shows, their focus on \"fanservice\" tends to diminish the show greatly. However, with High School DxD, the fanservice is actually used in more ways than one.\r\nSTORY\r\nHigh School DxD stars Issei, a normal high school student who is famous for is extremely perverted sense of mind. After unfortunate(fortunate?) events, Issei becomes a devil and subsequently a part of the Occult Research Club. The club consists of Rias Gremory, the President, Akeno, the Vice President, Kiba, the pretty boy, and Koneko, the small-but-tough girl.\\n\\n\r\nOne of the things that I found most enjoyable about the show was the way in which it handled the fighting, or more specifically the class system. Essentially, each club member is a chess piece; Rias is the King, Akeno the Queen, Kiba the Knight, Koneko the Rook, and Issei the Pawn. It seems simple when writing it out, but the writers do a nice job of incorporating the games pieces into the actual lore of devils and the ways in which they fight. This is especially true in the second arc of the first season where even chess tactics are used to overcome the enemy.\\n\\n\r\nBesides the use of chess, I found the world-building itself to actually be pretty good. Nothing is overly-complicated or even completely original, but I liked the dynamic between the angels, fallen-angels, and devils throughout both seasons. They introduce different aspects, such as historical events and nice descriptions of what each side is fighting for or against.\\n\\n\r\nSeason one focused on introducing the characters, background lore, and Rias's relationship, whereas season two focused even more on characters, new story arcs, and giving our protagonist his \"final boss\". I think I found the stories for both seasons to be equally as good. I enjoyed season one since it focused a lot more on Rias. Season two was good as well because it not only increased the overall world in which the characters were taking part, but also because more of the characters were explored and introduced, ultimately leading to more shenanigans between the girls and Issei.\\n\\n\r\nAlso of note is how the fanservice within the show is actually used as a combat device. Issei's love for boobs and women in general (especially boobs) is used as a weapon not only against his opponents but as a way to increase the strength within him. Meaning, the fanservice really wasn't just for show; the plot was both plot and plot.\\n\\n\r\nANIMATION\\n\\n\r\nSurprisingly, the animation is actually pretty good. Many of the fight scenes are choreographed well enough, with fluid character movements and cool tricks used by all sides. I was actually somewhat taken aback during many of the fight scenes for how nicely they looked. Granted, the actual art style is not on the same level as something like Fate/Zero, but regardless the animation is still good.\\n\\n\r\nBeing ecchi, the show also puts in considerable effort to make the women of the show look beautiful, sexy, and many times even lewd as much as they can. Now, going into the show knowing this, I expected there to be some fanservice. However, the version I watched had no qualms with showing the women completely naked (minus their vaginas). Meanings, and if I am not mistaken, there was always at least one naked breast shot per episode. And again, the animation and even the art here is nicely done, with appropriate physics and appeal to match.\\n\\n\r\nThis is true for both seasons; the animation quality and amount of boobs never wavers.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS\\n\\n\r\nI think the characters within DxD tend to be a little tropey (loli-girl, sadist girl, super nice girl, tomboy girl, etc.) but I actually thought the show did a nice job of trying to provide good backgrounds for all of the characters. Now, some of them have yet to be fully explored, but I am sure with the coming season (and others?) they will to.\\n\\n\r\nSeason one took its time with Rias and Asia. Season two decided to go with Kiba, Xenovia, and Gasper (and slightly with Akeno). Also, the final boss character I also really like. He isn't just evil for the sake of being evil, but rather has his own goals and ambitions or things that he wants to accomplish. And as you learn, he is literally Issei's rival. In that regard, I think season two does a nicer job with the characterization, even if they didn't focus as much on Rias as I would have liked.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND\\n\\n\r\nThe OPs for both season one and two were not that good. However, season one's ED, which can be listened to here, and season two's ED, which can be listened to here, were both not only catchy but extremely pleasing to the eye. That is to say, visually the EDs are probably the most sexually suggestive things I have seen in anime (obviously not counting the show itself).\\n\\n\r\nI thought the voice acting was appropriate for their roles, but nothing in particular stood out to me performance-wise. I recognized some of the voices from some of the characters, but that is besides the point.\\n\\n\r\nI should note however the sound effects, specifically the one associated with each woman's pair of breasts. For the more endowed woman, there would occasionally be this \"squish\" noise associated with their boobs moving/colliding with one another. This isn't anything spectacular, but when I first started noticing it, I thought that it was quite interesting that the studio put that much detail towards the boobs. I think at this point, it should have been expected!\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT\\n\\n\r\nWhile the story is nice and the animation is good, in order to fully enjoy the show you have to like boobs. I'm not kidding, there are a lot of naked women that show up over the course of the show. From the OP to the ED and everything in-between, the show will not hesitate to show you boobs. And for me that was perfectly fine. Being a young man myself, I like naked women, so the show was definitely pleasing to watch.\\n\\n\r\nBut like I said, it is more than just naked women. There is actual world-building and character development that takes place. I would say that the show does a nice job of balancing the two sides.\\n\\n\r\nI wouldn't go so far as to say that the show is porn (there is no actual sexual activity, even if it is alluded to), but I haven't seen a show that was willing to go as far as it did with its women. I really don't mind fanservice, but if you do, then this show is definitely not the one for you.\\n\\n\r\nSUMMARY, SEASON 1\\n\\n\r\nStory: Fine, interesting lore and clever use of class mechanics\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: Good, good looking women and nice fighting scenes\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Fine, nothing groundbreaking but characters are explored\\n\\n\r\nSound: Bad, only the ED is worth listening to and even then you are probably only watching for the visuals\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Great, funny, nice lore, and plenty of boobs\\n\\n\r\nFinal Score: 6/10\\n\\n\r\nSUMMARY, SEASON 2\\n\\n\r\nStory: Fine, ups the ante while providing us with more lore to work with\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: Good, quality persists from season one but with even more girls to look at\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Good, more characters are introduced while previous ones are developed\\n\\n\r\nSound: Bad, again just the ED (but still for the visuals)\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Great, the story, characters, and boobs are in full-force once again\\n\\n\r\nFinal Score: 6/10",

This second season doesn't deviate much from the formula - everything you loved before is back, and probably better than ever before.\r\nStory: 9\r\nThe story here is even better and more complex than the first season's. The main characters are all back, and the first large story arc deals with Kiba's backstory and expands his character a great deal, while the second arc sheds more light into the whole demon-angel-fallen angel war. Both stories arepretty well thought-out and give the characters good development, all the while introducing new interesting characters who deepen the plot. The only weakness to the story is that it is still a bit predictable, especially the fight scenes, which play out kind of like Dragon Ball Z (strong villain shows up, friends get beaten up, main character gets insane power-up, villain is defeated, stronger villain comes out).\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8\\n\r\nThe fight scenes are pretty well animated and it is easy to tell what is going on. The characters are very well-designed, and girls all have pretty unique... um... \"features,\" if you know what I mean. The fanservice is once again on the heavier side, and it is something that, in my opinion, sometimes gets in the way of the rest of the scene. For the most part, though, it is something that doesn't harm the show. But you should already know what you're getting into if you've watched the first season.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8\\n\r\nThe openings and endings are all very well done, though only one or two of them are really memorable. The background music supplements all the scenes well and helps create or dissolve tension as necessary in the story, though none of them are stand-outs that I would want to listen to on my iPod over again.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10\\n\r\nThe biggest improvement to this season is the characters. We learn a lot more about all of them - their feelings, their histories, their families, their motivations, their problems, etc. Because of this, the characters have become even more endearing than they had been after Season 1. If you liked the series because of the characters, then you definitely won't be disappointed here. This season will make you want to watch more of the characters and their interactions and see their stories unfold.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9\\n\r\nOverall, I thoroughly enjoyed this series, despite a few mild problems here and there and a bit too much unnecessary fanservice on a few occasions. If you liked the first season, then there's no reason you won't like this one.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9\\n\\n\r\nIf you liked this series, you might also like:\\n\r\nBoku wa Tomodachi ga Sukunai (I Don't Have Many Friends)\\n\r\nBaka to Test to Shoukanjuu (Baka and Test: Summon the Beasts)\\n\r\nIchiban Ushiro no Daimaou (Demon King Daimao)\\n\r\nInfinite Stratos\\n\r\nDate A Live",

            "content": "If you are reading this review, then most likely you have seen the first season and gotten used to the high amount of panty shots/boobs. That being said, I'm going to jump right into the review of this boob-filled wonderland that we call High School DxD. \r\nStory 9/10\r\nMost harem anime have little to no story, however, High School DxD is the exception to that rule. The story that it has is a genuinely good one. In this season there is a lot of focus on characters other than Issei. A few of the episodes go into Kiba's past and how he was reborn as adevil, and also some very intriguing things about Akeno. It also introduces two new characters, Irina and Xenovia. This season introduces quite a few new characters that will play a part in future conflicts. However, there is still enough of Issei to go around. Whether it be him dealing with chicks, or fighting with his Sacred Gear. \\n\\n\r\nArt 8/10\\n\r\nThe art in season 2 is definitely superior to the first season, they pay a lot more attention to details. However, they still do put a lot of emphasis on boobs/panties, but that is to be expected. Overall I found the art to be very well done and detailed.\\n\\n\r\nSound 9/10\\n\r\nThe music for this season was awesome. And the voice acting was beautiful, what stuck out to me the most was Akeno's voice. They could not have picked a better person to voice her, it was cute and yet seductive at the same time. The other voice actors did a good job as well, such as Issei when he is raging or in full perv-mode. The emotion in the actors voices were very real and refreshing.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 9/10\\n\r\nThey went quite in-depth for the characters surrounding Issei. They gave quite a bit of information regarding Kiba, Akeno, Irina, and Xenovia, as well as other supporting characters. It made those characters that much more likable.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 10/10\\n\r\nI thoroughly enjoyed High School DxD New and can't wait for another season! There isn't much to not like in this show, it gives you the action of Issei kickin' ass, and all the Ecchi you could ask for. \\n\\n\r\nOverall 10/10\\n\r\nThis is definitely one of my all-time favorite anime. It has the Ecchi/harem I was looking for, and tops it all off with a powerful yet comical main character. Plus, their storyline isn't full of cliche's like most Ecchi/Harem type anime, which gave it a unique and more enjoyable feel to it.",

            "content": "I mean, this is a series about a guy who will turn into the universe's ultimate weapon just by thinking about tiddies. It's not exactly a cerebral concept, and yet at the same time it actually instills a sense of happiness that's way beyond what it should...and that's even before all the ecchi stuff.\r\nIn fact, what makes me appreciate DxD so much is the attention to Christian lore. Through the first two seasons we got references to Longinus, the Imperial Regalia, Roland, Saint George, pretty much the entire gamut of the Lemegeton, and probably more that I missed out on. The created world here drawson so much mythology that a production of lesser quality would have barfed a maelstrom of conflicting concepts on top of a mountain of kazongas. DxD makes it work in a clever manner that drives me to want to know more all the time--it teases without info dumping.\\n\\n\r\nThe second season draws far more out of the \"kid with superpowers loves huge bongas\" idea than the first while maintaining a fair amount of comedy and some fantastic depictions of friendship and adventure. My only real gripe is that hijinks and goofs obviously took a third wheel position behind worldbuilding and knocker worship. So, is it worth watching? If you're after a shitload of ecchi, fan service, and tatas that sound like jello when they bounce the answer is absolutely yes. If you're after a smart, sharp world with well-developed characters and a fun sense of adventure the answer is also absolutely yes. There's really no going wrong here unless you hate having a good time.",

            "content": "An English professor who once taught me argued that you could tell a lot about a work of fiction, whether a novel, movie, play or a TV show, by examining its first line. This is clearly true when examining the second season of Highschool Dxd, also called Highschool Dxd New. The season\u2019s first line is \u201cboobs\u201d, a line which pretty much sums up the entire show. Now don\u2019t get me wrong, Highschool Dxd is, at its core, an Ecchi about boobs and other naked female body parts. However, like its predecessor, it still manages to provide a somewhat interesting and coherent story with decentcharacters whose overtly sexual natures can be overlooked due to the shows genre and purpose. \\n\r\nThe story picks up shortly after the end of the first season with not much having changed. Primarily, this season focuses on the conflicts and interactions between the devils, angels and the fallen angels. Surprisingly, the devils continue to be the \u201cgood guys\u201d in this conflict with the sinister fallen angels being the source of most of the stories evil. This time around the plot is more compelling than in the first season, and comedic undertones continue to reappear. Honestly though, whether you\u2019re watching Issei employ his sacred \u201cpervert power\u201d or the absurd sexual logic of the main characters, this show is hilarious. With all this being said, the story, when compared to other anime, is somewhat weak, and one must recognize that Highschool Dxd New is a show that values nudity, fan service and ridiculous sexual situations more so than a compelling story.\\n\r\nThe characters are definitely more captivating this time around. In the first season, some characters such as Kiba and Akeno felt completely undeveloped and simply seemed to hang around in the background. Now, these secondary characters are portrayed in a new light, and actually have personalities detailed enough that one could actually discuss these characters in more depth than just by comparing their bodies. There are also some new characters added to the mix, such as Xenovia and Irina, two members of church, as well as other devils and fallen angels. These new characters result in some interesting subplots and even more comedic situations. This second season also acts as more of a traditional harem than the first, as an larger amount of the female cast becomes interested in Issei, unlike in the first season where it seemed that Issei had only two love interests. So, I suppose if you\u2019re into harems that\u2019s a plus for you. At the same time though, it becomes annoying for every character to randomly fall in love with the main character for little to no reason what so ever. Furthermore, it becomes downright silly when various unbelievably sexy girls come onto the main character, basically crawling on him naked, and he is unable to act for whatever stupid reason. This is just so unrealistic that it becomes bothersome. However, this is the kind of stuff that will occur in shows like this, so it is somewhat forgivable. In the end, in comparison to other movies and anime, the characters are quite lackluster, but in the realm of ecchi, there pretty good. There is a large variety of girls, all attractive for their own reasons, as to appeal to different tastes. One would be hard pressed to not find at least one suitable wiafu when watching this show.\\n\r\nThe art is great, and damn do the animators do a good job at making animated teenage girls so hot. The physics are also excellently done, resulting in fluid and believable bouncing of breasts with characters every movement. Aside from the characters, this is a fairly new anime with some great art, and overall everything is crisply animated.\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is similar in quality to the first two seasons, and the opening and closing credits are quite catchy. I watched the Japanese sub for season 2, unlike for the first season where I watched the dub. The Japanese dub is good (but not great) and is a significant step up in quality as opposed to the English dub.\\n\r\nObviously, if you\u2019re not a fan of the whole ecchi genre this is not a show for you. However, if you enjoyed the first season of Highschool Dxd, your likely going to enjoy the second season just as much, if not even more. Simply put, Highschool Dxd New is ecchi at its finest, a comedic tale that has an interesting story and good characters that does an excellent job of providing all of the fan service that anyone can dream of. \\n",

            "content": "*WARNING! THIS REVIEW MAY CONTAIN MINOR SPOILERS FOR SEASON 2 OF HIGH SCHOOL DxD* \r\nWhat do you think of while watching the Ecchi genre? For me, at least, I think about how corny the story line is and how boring the characters are. I'll admit it, Ecchi shows don't interest me. Then came High School DxD, a show with a lot going for it, but the execution wasn't exactly the best. How do you fix something like that? Add another season of course!\r\nStory: 7/10 - The story for the second season doesn't completely overhaul the foundation the first season laid out, but rather expands uponit, which is a good thing in my opinion. It can get a bit silly at times, and often times the show does not know when to take itself seriously or not, but overall High School DxD has proved that even borderline porn can have a plot. While I would like to go over the general storyline some more, it has multiple arcs to it so going over everything that season 2 has to offer will take a lot more time than needed.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: 10/10 - Wow... There is not a word I can say to describe how breathtaking the art is. When they are not flashing giant boobs in your face, they are displaying some of the most intense fight scenes that anime has to offer. I like to consider the fight scenes as \"Beautiful Destruction\", the world MAY be exploding... but it looks so damn awesome that you can't help to be amazed at the chaos. This is something High School DxD does best, it goes ALL OUT with the fight scenes, and it is truly a marvel to behold. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 8/10 - While the dub to this show (in my full opinion) is one of the strong points, the soundtrack could of been a lot more intense. To be honest, both of the intros to this show weren't exactly memorable, and the background music often leaves a lot to be desired.   \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9/10 - Wait, what?! An Ecchi show where the characters have personality? What is this? That's right. Something Season 2 did great on was expand upon Akeno and Kiba. Akeno became a lot more than just Rias' sidekick, and a lot of backstory was revealed about Akeno to prove that she isn't just a pretty sight. And as for our \"Prince Charming\", Kiba? He probably got the most character development this season than anyone else in the show. The thing that really made Kiba's back story depressing wasn't the fact the he abandoned his faith, but rather how his faith abandoned him. Also, there were a few characters that are new to this season. Let's start with Xenovia: Being a strong believer in the church, she set out with her best friend on obtaining the stolen pieces of Excalibur from a fallen angel, but in the process, she learned the ugly truth: God is dead. The church realized she has learned this and ex-communicated her, and with no where to run, she joined up with Rias and became a devil. One other character I would like to go over is the adorable vampire: Gasper. Gasper was born half-vampire and half-human, and as a consequence, he was stuck between both worlds. He wasn't strong enough to have the vampires respect him, however, he was also viewed as a \"monster\" by many of the humans. So our ol' friend Rias decides to take Gasper in to become her Bishop. The problem, however, is that Rias wasn't able to contain Gasper's powers and he was locked away, but now our shy little vampire makes his debut when his powers are truly needed. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10 - There is not much I can say to describe how much I enjoyed watching this show. When I wasn't laughing, I was engulfed by the insane amount of awesome fight scenes, or focused on Kiba's quest for revenge. Finding a boring point to this show is probably the second hardest thing the show will give you. If you catch my drift. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9/10 - Was it a bit cheesy? Yeah. But, with a passable storyline, INSANE animation, great dub, likable characters (who are more than just eye candy), and an intense amount of enjoyment,  High School DxD truly deserves it's title as the \"King of Ecchi.\"",

His pursuit of happiness can only be admired by the viewer and anyone who thinks its gross should get a life.\\n\r\nThat being said, every other character in this anime seems to play a pivotal role in making Issei look even more fking amazing.\\n\\n\r\nMusic: After listening to the amazing opening, ending, and in-anime music i can't help but question my existence and why i wasn't born in a parellel universe where life is depicted like anime, i had to punch a newborn child to come back to reality\\n\\n\r\nStory: The development of the story in this season so far is amazing and can only be described by 1 word, bust-a-nut-worthy\\n\\n\r\nPlot: Talking about the the PLOT would require more than 69 kazilionbillion words, lets leave it at nice, also, this season has many new introductions of mythology which really was surprising and adds another dimension to the storyline\\n\r\nMy will was tested and i lost, tears flowed down my cheeks, this season so far has everything, heart break, love, action and friendship.\\n\\n\r\nArt: The art causes a symptom known as tight pants-eritus, every shot, every scene, and every camera angle brings a new level of beauty and brings enjoyment level over 9000, the detail around the jugs of the girls are a step in the right direction and shows us how far we have gone in boob making technology as a species\\n\\n\r\nOverall: I thoroughly enjoyed it and I could never look at women in the same way, my expectations have skyrocketed\\n\\n\r\nMy review of probably one of the best harem, ecchi animes in recent and probably future history is completed. Highschool DxD is simple, it does not try to be the next Stiens Gate or Full Metal Alchemist, but plays to its strengths. This 3rd installment of the series is a MUST watch because of the reasons stated above, such as the Art and Music. We may take our body pillows on dates but our desire to find our Garden of EDEN will not be stopped, Highschool DxD is our gateway.\\n\r\nThat is why i believe Highschool DxD BoRN is Infinity/10!\\n\\n\r\nWhole Season : Even with a 10/10 score this season didn't feel the same compared the season 1 and 2, i can't pinpoint exactly why but it felt like something was missing and maybe this was because it deviated from the Light Novel. With that being said, even with a somewhat of a downhill ending, season 3 still managed to clear my stockpile in a matter of seconds",

            "content": "Here's my review of High School DxD New.\r\nThe story of High School DxD New follows the events of the first season when Rias moves in with Issei and his family. The plot centers around volumes 3 and 4 of the light novels. The first half show gives you a glimpse into Kiba's past and how he has the last survivor of The Holy Sword Project and how the leader of the project reemerges and wants to use the four holy swords to start a war. The second half of the show is about a truce between the angels, devils, and fallen angels. In addition, theclash between Issei, possessor of the Welsh Dragon Ddraig and Vali, possessor of the Vanishing Dragon Albion.\\n\\n\r\nSome of the characters are more fleshed out in this show for example Akeno. She starts having lustful desires for Issei and starts to fall in love with him. She is also revealed to be a reincarnated devil who was once half human and half fallen angel. Rias has more of a jealous personality when the other girls try to flirt with Issei. Also we get introduced to some new characters, but the three I am going to talk about are Gasper, Irina, and Xenovia. Gasper is a first year student at Kuoh Academy and is a cross dressing vampire who is timid and afraid of people, but gets development as the show goes on. Irina is a childhood friend of Issei and is a reincarnated angel. Finally, there's Xenovia a reincarnated angel who later joins Rias's peerage as her knight and wants to bear Issei's children.\\n\\n\r\nThe show isn't that much different from the first season. I still find it very entertaining. There are some pretty funny moments in this show. Overall I think the show is great and say that if you want to watch a show that you could just sit down and watch just for the hell of it I recommend this show and it's predecessor.",

            "content": "one thing I always believed in when it come to a sequel is that is has to be better than its predecessor. The first season of high-school dxd was fun and did help me go through a twelve hour time period where I could not speak. So going into this season the only things I was expecting was an overabundance of tits and, booty shots. I am glad to say that this wasn't the case.\r\nThe second season has two main story arcs the first revolves around the character of Kiba a knight of house Gremory who is the Finn Balor of the show meaning thathe was criminally underutilized. The arc follows him on his quest to destroy seven holy swords. I really liked this arc because it was compelling and, gave dept and, emotion to an otherwise forgettable character. The second arc built on the world of the show by introducing Azazel the ruler of the fallen angels as well as Saint Michael and, two women from the church called Xenovia and Irina. We are also, introduced to the white dragon emperor Vali the counter part to red dragon emperor Issei. I liked the world building in this and, I am defiantly intrigued for the future of the show. \\n\\n\r\nThe animation is still phenomenal and, the action sequences as as crisp as ever. The first opening to the show was pretty cool but, the rest of the music is either rehashed or forgettable.\\n\\n\r\nA lot of characters in the show receive much needed development, Issei while his motivation is still to become harem king is more relatable in this show, Rias gets a level of humanity added to her character which as both good and, bad as it was nice to see emotion from her but was a total 180 from her. Akeno was probably my favourite in terms of depth as we explore her back story and, learn that she is part fallen angel. We also, get a vampire devil known as Gasper who is essentially a plot device much like Asia was in the first season. \\n\\n\r\nThe fan service on the show was toned down significantly which was a much welcome surprise and, the fan service that was there didn't bother me and, id be lying if I said it wasn't kinda hot. But, still some of these girls look underage and, that is a line we shouldn't cross.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of underage the character of Asia is a strange character she appears shy and, timid in front of other characters but, becomes a raging whore when it comes to Issei. There is also, a jealousy subplot because, of course there is that goes no where. We get to know a bit more about the Gremory family but, not as much as we'd like to. Also, the battle between Issei and, Vali felt rushed as it didn't have much time dedicated to it even though it was absolutely badass.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, High School DxD New was an improvement over the initial season, there were moments of development, some amazing blends of comedy as well as drama. The set up for the future was laid out beautifully. However, the recycled music, meaningless subplots and, not going all in with some characters take this shown down a notch for me. Still this was a pretty fun and enjoyable show that I could see myself rewatching in the future. \\n",

            "content": "Before we start, this review is on the SHOW. As good as the oppai might be, it wouldn't be a proper review if we focused on dem tittays. Therefore we shall be talking about the plot, and not the \"plot\"\r\nHigh school DxD is what all ecchi should be. When a friend mentioned to anime to me I thought it was going to be a boobfest with little to no plot at all. I was wrong. I mean , the boobfest was still there but it was accompanied with a plot. A good plot. \r\nSTORY: now I won't be spoiling any of the plot here, buttrust me when I say that it's a solid story. Not the best but a story that goes deeper than you would think for a ecchi comedy. Not too deep though. Deep enough to enjoy but not deep enough for you to wake up at 2 am and scream \"I UNDERSTAND EVERYTHING NOW\".\\n\\n\r\nART: I mean, it's standard. Average. Yep.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND: Sound is actually not to bad. Not the best openings and closings I've seen. but I mean hey, it's pretty good. Dark parts of the anime have dark music and light parts have light music. Funny parts having funny music. Music does its job well.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER. I didn't hate a single one. Not even the villains. Okay maybe one or two villains but the characters are very enjoyable. Likable and realistic. To a degree. Because ya know. It's an ecchi.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT. Absolutely enjoyed this. This is one of those animes that really is solid once you get over the boobfest. \\n\\n\r\nOVERALL: story is great, art is average, sound does its job, characters are likable and solid. Really enjoyed it. It's a fun little anime that is worth a watch. \\n",

            "content": "Okay, let's get it out of the way: If your still watching at this point, you probably don't have a problem with ecchi, boobs, panty shots and ALMOST hentai. SO going on that basis, I'm not going to cater to the type of person wo's gonna whine about the obnoxious Boob/panty shots.\r\n This show is awesome. Seriously, it's the best ecchi show ever created (and believe me, I've seen a few). And why? Because it doesn't take itself seriously. Some shows, like Highschool of the Dead, would be good if not for the fanservice, but Dxd works in the opposite way. It would suck withoutthe comedy, fanservice and stupidity. Let's break this down:\\n\\n\r\nSTORY: For what it is, the plot of DXD new is actually fairly serious, without seeming dumb. . .much. The first arc is actually quite dark, and all in all I enjoyed the greater scale the second season had over the first. The best/worst point about the plot, depending on who you ask, is the fact that the writers always have a new plot device to the pull out of there ass to explain why something happened. Which is great if you can look past it, but some people can't. \\n\\n\r\nART: Probably the worst aspect of the show, the art is pretty standard, and the show basically goes at the basic level you would expect for an anime in 2013. Probably because the animators were too busy drawing boobs.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND: The music for this show is legit good, although I would say that neither of the openings in this season lived up to the awesome one from the first. That said, all the main themes that play through out are pretty good, both light-hearted tunes for the comical half of the show, and epic orchestra's and simple wind sections for the more dark/serious portions. \\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS: You either try and take them seriously, and hate them, or you don't, and love them. I think that Issei is great, because he's basically ME if I was in that situation, and all the new side characters are pretty great (Go IRENA!!!). And a couple of the original team get some fleshing out, namely Kiba and Akeno, so good times.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT: All said and done, this is why I gave the show a ten: It's fun. Highschool DxD is the best show to just relax and watch, with a box of chocolate/kleenex, depending on which way your inclined. And as Ecchi shows go, it's definitely at the top end of the scale. Can't wait for season 3!!!",

            "content": "Highschool DxD New! \r\nThe second season of \u201cHighschool DxD\u201d. As you may know, this is an anime series that actually has a story line. The anime consists of having ecchi, harem fan services, the same as the prequel. The story is involving a guy named Issei, who is seventeen years old. If you have watched the prequel of this anime, you would know that he is Rias Gremory\u2019s (King) Pawn covering up all eight pieces of the front strike army. Issei has a goal to be best harem king! \r\nStory : 10\r\nThe story of the second season is mainly about the characters and their past.We get to see how Yuuto Kiba was found by the beautiful captain, Rias Gremory to be her knight. Half of the series is about Yuuto and his sad-ning past. Akeno Himejima also gets screen time in this sequel and we reveal very eye opening secrets about her. We also get few characters to join us in the adventure.\\n\\n\r\nSound : 9\\n\r\nThe voice acting in Highschool DxD will not disappoint you one bit. The voice actor of Akeno, Shizuka Itou, did a wonderful job on keeping her voice to seductive as possible. The voice actor for Kiba, Kenji Nojima also did a great part for the emotional and sadness voice acting for Yuuto as we reveal his past. The OST, or the background music really hit the spot in the second season! The music was very well fitting with the theme of the anime at the specific moment. The opening song from Episode 1 to 6 was very disappointing in my opinion and didn\u2019t really touch or felt in contact with the song. However, the second opening song \u201cGekijouron\u201d by ZAQ lasted from episode 7 to 12 did a very fine job on the song and the music. The ending songs were very\u2026 weird\u2026 As it was \u201cChuro Churo Haye Haye, Churo Churo hey girls!\u201d I was disappointed but to harem and ecchi fans watching the screen will be not as it includes the female characters from DxD doing a dance and making very sexy poses.\\n\\n\r\nArt/Animation : 10\\n\r\nThe art in Season 2 is agreeable that, this season was better than the last. How you may ask? There were a lot of scenes that the club went in forests or parks that has trees. As the leaves on the tree block the sun\u2019s view and give you shade, it felt very realistic that on Issei (usually) there were some sun spots on his cheeks and shade on other half. The art of the animation was outstanding as there were more nudity in Season 2 and was enjoyable for a lot of ecchi and harem fans. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters : 8\\n\r\nThe main character is still very annoying and is surrounded by women with pretty faces and big breasts. He tries to be a hero and says \u201cHey! Don\u2019t talk about her like that, you bastard! I\u2019ll kill you!\u201d and gets beat eventually and embarrassed on his butt. The secondary characters in Highschool DxD are very interesting as we get to know more about Yuuto and Akeno-kun\u2019s past. Few more characters join us in this journey. I cannot describe it well without giving spoilers but the character is mistaken to be another gender while the other supporting character is a beautiful short-haired lady who is the enemy of Issei and the gang and later joins them. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment : 10\\n\r\nOverall I do think that the Season 2 is better than Season 1 and would highly recommend to anime lovers in the genres: Supernatural, Ecchi, Harem. It is now to the conclusion that I give my overall rating for this anime which would be a perfect, 10/10.\\n\\n\r\nThank you for reading my review; if you have come this far I will add something extra. \\n\r\nAnother Recommended Series in this type of genres : \\n\r\nRosario To Vampire\\n\r\nPrincess Lover\\n\r\nFreezing\\n\r\nOmamori Himari\\n",

            "content": "With the onslaught of ecchi titles that have come out this past year or so, there haven\u2019t been many of them that have the distinct charm or courage as some of the great ones. They are all devoid of any pleasure or wit in how fan-service can be portrayed as colorful and sometimes ascetically beautiful in its artistry and dialogue. However, with that said, there are occasionally great gems hidden in the genre that does provide great comedy and memorable characters. Enter High School DxD.\r\nThe series started with the first season as, in my mind, as a decent comedy/fan-service show with plenty of entertainment tobehold. Unfortunately, to its set-backs, most of the characters didn\u2019t get enough deep characterization except for Rias, Asia, and Issei. Now we have High School DxD New, with a new story, plenty of glorious fan-service that makes the previous series pale in comparison in this aspect, and plenty more character development that was lacking in the first season. It is because of these three examples that make this season the best one of the series so far.\\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s one thing if there are plenty of fan-service to your show to rank up with the great ones, but how does the art design fair with the show? By far, this series has some of the best character designs I\u2019ve ever seen in any ecchi anime. All of the girls are drawn exquisitely gorgeous and are very easy on the eyes. Typically in this type of genre, you have to talk about the breasts and whether if they are over-emphasized to the point where they don\u2019t compliment the girls\u2019 figures. While it may depend on what you feel is too much for your size, the breasts in this show compliment all of the girls\u2019 bodies and don\u2019t feel out-of-place at all given how they are beautifully drawn. It is also a huge plus for the studio\u2019s part to show the breasts in full uncensored glory and no annoying white fog.\\n\\n\r\nNow with the actual fan-service itself, there are plenty of reasons to like certain fan-service scenes in any show, but if you want to make it fun and exciting for someone like me who wants good writing put into his fan-service show, you can\u2019t always put one in every single minute. Contrary to popular belief, there can be an intelligent way of putting fan-service into your anime. The key is good pacing in-between each joke and good writing that is both quirky and funny that doesn\u2019t feel old after each continuing episode. In DxD New\u2019s case, they actually spread the fan-service far apart enough to where they all feel new and fresh every time you are shown one. From the first second of the show, you\u2019re already put into a situation where you have Rias\u2019s gorgeous naked body cuddling with Issei, and it\u2019s done with very smart intentions thanks to Issei\u2019s funny dialogue.\\n\\n\r\nOnto the actual characters themselves, they all are still lovable and charming as ever in this second installment. At first, Issei can seem a bit over-eccentric at times with his love of oppai, but it\u2019s one of those things where you can\u2019t help but love the guy for his pure passion for something that he loves. It does help that he is voiced by the always mystifying Yuki Kaji who seems to always pop up in the most random shows these days; I also consider him somewhat the king of perverted characters in this current age of anime at this point. The one and only Rias Gremory is back and isn\u2019t afraid to rev up the funny nature of the show up a notch with her fantastic body, and it doesn\u2019t help for us with poor hearts that the always sexy Yoko Hikasa voices her, which in mind is just perfect casting. However, the one character that has now shot up to new heights of greatness is Akeno who is given more development that she so desperately needed and good heavens were it an enjoyable experience seeing her hilarious seductive moments to Issei.\\n\\n\r\nSupporting cast is, unfortunately, hit and miss for this season. We\u2019ve already had Asia\u2019s development in the previous season so there\u2019s not much to talk about in her role here but it is nice to see her jealous moments here and there, always a nice laugh. The ones that are a hit are Xenovia and Yuuto who are good for different reasons. Yuuto\u2019s plot arc involving him and his role in the club is now fully developed in his plot arc in this season and it\u2019s actually done with good effect in his own personal struggles with coming to terms of his past. Xenovia is good in a different way. Not that her development was bad by any means, but her dialogue involving Issei is some of the funniest of the season by far. Her wanting to have a baby with Issei has to be the most brilliant comedic scene in the entire series in how it comes out of nowhere and how it is written so funny. The rest of the good characters in the season are definitely Rias\u2019s brother and father who I would love to shake their hand in showing us an embarrassed Rias.\\n\\n\r\nFor the ones that were a miss are the ones who don\u2019t leave much of an impression, unlike the ones I\u2019ve mentioned above. There are times where characters, one in particular Irina Shidou, seem like they are going to have a more significant impact with the show\u2019s story but they are hardly even there once the story progresses. It is a real shame because Irina seemed like she would be an excellent character see in funny situations with Issei. Koneko is another character that is hardly ever given anything to work for other than to show off her combat abilities and say disgusting remarks at Issei\u2019s perverted behavior. With the side characters, they aren\u2019t initially supposed to have a lot of material to heighten the plot and comedy, but the writers could\u2019ve at least come up with more exciting things for them to do so we can care for them.\\n\\n\r\nNow with the characters out-of-the-way, how is the plot fare with the fan-service? While the plot in the first season wasn\u2019t anything groundbreaking or unique, it was mostly driven through character interaction and with this new season it fares a little better in how they introduce interesting plot arcs. Luckily the melodramatic moments in the first season are hardly in this season, so it doesn\u2019t seem so hokey and eye-rolling in how undramatic it was. Not to say there aren\u2019t any serious moments, there are plenty of them, but they aren\u2019t done in a way where I would roll my eyes in how out-of-place it is with the tone of the show.\\n\\n\r\nSo with all that\u2019s said and done, High School DxD New is a welcoming sequel to the lovable franchise that shows no limits to censorship and great oppai. Unprofessional as I make it be, there\u2019s an underlying fact of life that we are all human and we love to look at pictures or videos that gives us pleasure and makes us happy to be alive. We all need to keep this in mind when judging shows such as High School DxD, whether you love it or hate it. If there is something we can all agree on, is giving us the existence of Rias-senpai; what more could you ask for?\\n\\n\r\nGrade: B+\\n",

            "content": "Let's get out of the most obvious factors first. For those already familiar with the High School DxD franchise, you're probably already familiar with some of its elements like the ecchi fanservice, harem building ethnics, and clothes tearing off through battles. More than that though, High School DxD New surprisingly has a plot. Can you believe it? An ecchi series with a plot! Well, if it means anything, it also involves a young man named Hyoudo Issei as he makes his goal to create his own harem and become a harem king. \r\nAs part of the continuing show from the original High School DxD thataired in 2012, High School School DxD New continues directly as a sequel series. It adapts material from the light novel (novel volumes 3 + 4) based off the same name written by Ichiei Ishibumi and illustrated by Miyama-Zero. The show returns with delicious fun and trouble for Issei and his friends as startling revelations are exposed and conflicts are established.\\n\\n\r\nFor a breath of refreshment, Issei Hyoudo is the typical high school kid who has no girlfriend but instead fantasizes about women (usually ones with big breasts). Then, he has this date after being asked out by a cute girl one day. If you thought your date ended up being terrible with the girl of your dreams blowing you off, then think again. Issei's date gets himself killed and in the worst way possible. But luckily, fate strikes as he is bought back as a devil and servant but the beautiful Rias Gremory. Now, Issei is part of a greater destiny. \\n\\n\r\nNow with that out of the way, we can move on because Issei has learned quite a bit since he was killed from the first season during his first date. For instance, he has been perfecting his 'Dress Break' skill to many degrees that tends to result in compromising moments against his female opponents. At the same time, Issei has also began to make new relationships whether friend of foe. There is a certain instinct in Issei throughout the series that makes him....desirable in a way for his female companions despite them seeing him as a pervert. For Issei though, he is still often despised as a pervert at school wherever he goes. It doesn't seem like the way other female students at school has changed his views on him since the first season either. To make factors worse, there are also rumors being spread between him and another fellow student \u2013 Yuuto Kiba. It's not the prettiest picture when rumors saturated with BL undertones are being spread around a co-ed school that was once a female only academy.\\n\\n\r\nBut with that being said though, it is surprising that Yuuto Kiba gets quite the highlight especially in the first half of the season. Normally in harem series like this, you'd expect the main guy to be the center of attention trying to hog all the girls. However for the first half of the anime, we get to see a different side of Kiba than his usual cherry self. This relates to an incident in the past as we get take a little trip down memory lane. From that path, Kiba's past is not only revealed but we also get to see many startling revelations. Along with that though, new characters also makes their appearances from the light novels. Plot-wise, the second half focuses more on the ongoing conflicts going throughout the world of High School DxD. These conflicts become more grim and grimmer as we encounter antagonists that puts nearly everyone's lives at danger. Even with Issei, Rias, and her servants on the good side, there's a sense of hopelessness and anger-like atmosphere present. That's definitely a lot worse than failing an exam during high school.\\n\\n\r\nAs this is the sequel of the original High School DxD, most of the main and supporting characters return while newer ones makes their appearances in the show. Of the most prominent female characters returning is Rias Gremory, the most admired beauty at school. However at the same time, we also can't forget the other girls like Asia, Koneko, and Akeno. This is especially true as Akeno herself also gets a spotlight and revelations are revealed about her. The certain degree in which her character shifts between flirtatious and moody makes viewers questions a bit about her past similar to Yuuto Kiba. It's from this sequel that we learn more about them as well as the new characters. \\n\\n\r\nAs more secrets are revealed, conflicts also emerges throughout the series. This time around, the Occult Research Club really has their hands full not just dealing with the typical assignments but also saving the world. It's about survival and various instances puts many characters' lives at risk. The risk involves the new antagonists with seemingly incredible abilities. They're faster, smarter, and stronger. Even the new supporting characters seemingly gets on the bad side of Ria's Occult Club that rises some angry eyebrows. \\n\\n\r\nJudging the action of this show, High School DxD New maintains balance of fighting and comedy the same time. It's surprising though since shows like this should be parodied with fighting especially with Issei's forbidden 'Dress Break' technique, a skill so lustful that any female getting a taste of it might not feel the same way again after its first experience. Maybe I'm exaggerating here but the show presents it in a way that is laughable but also the same time serious with its atmosphere. The majority of the main female cast all possesses skills in the arts of fighting with various degrees ranging from conducting electricity, healing, or throwing hardcore knockouts with a simple knuckles' fist. It's obviously by now that we realize the female characters of this show represents a sort of antithesis as to the typical feeble or frail girl. At the same time, Issei himself shows a bit of experience and determination whether it's in battle or conflicts. This is what earns him the respect and even admiration of his peers. \\n\\n\r\nThe show has fan service. This is obvious for those who are familiar with the first season. It doesn't go tame in any way in this sequel though. Even the first few seconds might raise some eyebrows with our beautiful Rias Gremory and her servant. There are many instances throughout the show that presents fan service in various ways whether it's the cliche pool episode with swimsuits, naked aprons, or just...nude in general.  Fans can take this in different ways but Issei takes it as the experience of a youth. Most if not all the fan-service incidents in this show involves Issei and a female character in some sort of compromising position. These aren't always accidental either but rather intentional. What makes a bit frustrating though is how dense Issei is despite obvious hints given by the female characters being interested in him. To put it a bit simply, he's the type of guy where you need to have billboard written out to get the message through him. The various teases and delicious bodies of the girls are sometimes right in front of him, not more than 3 feet away. However, his response is generally typical and so predictable that it hurts. \\n\\n\r\nVisual wise, fan service is out in the open. The majority of the female characters are designed with attractive curves, crystal clear eyes, and voluptuous figures. There's many direct references to their figures throughout the show by Issei and other characters that makes it distracting to watch. But taken on a more serious perspective, there are some decent design for the fighting transformations especially for some of our antagonists. They give off a dangerous look and presents that sense of hopelessness when confronting the heroes of this show. The new supporting character also give them a more holy-like aura while one other new character might be mistaken for its gender. Yuuto of course returns as a bishonen while Issei is colored with generic flavors. It's nothing extraordinary at all but for a show like this, it's to be expected. Just take a look at their uniforms with the obvious suggestive factors and you'll get a good idea.\\n\\n\r\nIt's uncommon these days to see a one core series getting two different OP/ED songs. This is featured for the first half and second half of High School DxD New. The OP songs has a similar premise giving the montage of the main and supporting characters with bits of foreshadowing. The OP song \"Sympathy\" by Larval Stage Planning has this eerie like tone to it while its second OP song \"Gekijouron\" by ZAQ expands a bit of its first half. If fans remember the original ED song from season 1 with the pole dancing and very suggestive poses, then the first ED song might be a bit of disappointment in terms of service. The second ED song  though brings back that delicious fan service factor fans might be hoping for. It's noticeable that both songs are performed by the voice actresses of the same characters in the show as well. (Yoko Hikasa, Shizuka Itou, Azumi Asakura, Ayana Taketatsu, Risa Taneda, Ayane Sakura). The OST is consistent enough but sometimes seems out of space. Well what do you expect though? The boobs are back.\\n\\n\r\nIn essence, High School DxD New is what fans of the original series may want with the fan-service, action, and plot progression. Yes, I said plot progression. Even for an ecchi show like this, there's development with certain characters that progresses the plot in its way. This series is definitely not the best show out there but it has its moments. If I had to describe this show, it would be sexy but also equally annoying to watch at some cases. Emphasis on the sexy.",

            "content": "Alright people, heres to the second season of demons accompanied by  boobs boobs more boobs and some stuff that almost crosses lines into the hentai realm, but hey, isn't that what we're all here for at this point?\r\nSure there are haters out there that are going to accuse anyone who enjoyed this show(or me for giving it a 10) of being an idiot who only cares about boobs, but that is not the case and I will explain why I think its a good show throughout the course of this review.\r\nStory: Issei is back trying to get all the women for his harem orwhatever, and while the show cant be entirely be carried by shots of boobs (god bless them for trying though) it has enough of a story to keep me interested. Basically like the last season theres a bunch of boobs with a story in the background threatening issei's future hopes of being surrounded by boobs, all ending in a semi anti-climactic battle where isseis only motivation is (you guessed it) boobs.\\n\\n\r\nThis isnt bad though, because one thing that ive learned is that you cant have ridiculous amounts of fanservice and an award winning story so i wont hold it against them for sacrificing one for the other.\\n\\n\r\nArt: Once again, if the animation team could draw circles and make them bounce, they were golden. Seriously though the art is very nice (very nice--said in a creeper voice) and i think it looks pretty friggin sweet.\\n\\n\r\nSound: You hear three things in this show: shit blowing up, a bouncing noise(i cant imagine what for), and the words \"ara ara\" as such, since those three things were done well enough, alls well in the sound department.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters: Yes yes yes we've seen the characters before: the perv, the bombshell, the loli, the man candy, the shy girl, and the lightning wielding sadist... okay well maybe not the last one so much. Frankly though, i dont care if ive seen these character types a bunch before because in this show they all are perfect for what theyre doing and I cant find flaws with any of this.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: lots, lots and lots of enjoyment. I just have alot of fun watching dxd and thats something that i cant say for many animes.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: I really have fun with this show, I know that theres a large fan base out there, and I think that thats what counts at the end of the day. If I didnt seem to say alot about the show in the review, its because I am writing this for those who have seen everything up to this point and need nothing more than this. Honestly though, those who have seen and enjoyed season one dont need me to tell them to watch this.\\n",

            "content": "Oh Pie, Oh my and Oh No, so what's my verdict for this 2nd season of High school DxD? Not good, and here's why:\r\nStory: Fair 6.\r\nThe genre was still the same genre, the plot was a bit new and a bit boring, the only thing that studio  TNK does was to add new characters for every climax that comes along. Then again the part where the harem becomes intense was nice to say the least and Rias getting serious with stupid Issei also adds spice to this anime's story plot, but it kinda annoys me that he's too hesitant to bang either one ofthem and let's not forget about Akeno and Xenovia whom has no reservations of being the guy's concubine. \\n\\n\r\nArt: Outstanding 10.\\n\\n\r\nOh PIIIIIEEEEEE! So I'm guilty of enjoying this anime's fanservice, in fact it wasn't a surprise that this is where studio TNK is banking. I also like the scene where Issei is with Rias and Asia.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound: Good 7.\\n\\n\r\n I like both the 1st opening theme and the 1st closing theme, but not much on the 2nd closing theme and the 2nd opening theme, in fact those 2 new themes came in too little too late.  \\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: Mediocre 5.\\n\\n\r\nWell, the character where still the same, we still have stupid Issei who still wants to be the \"Harem King\", Rias is still present and so as the rest of the 'Occult Club.\" however the introduction of new members aren't that of a surprise since there characteristics have been already featured from the manga, as for the vampire, Gasper Vladi I kinda find it disgusting that he has to be this cross dress, day walking, half vampire and half human thing, I would have been nice if he was presented as a she and become another competition for Issei's affection. As for the other support characters... I just don't have much to say about them.\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Very Good 8.\\n\\n\r\nI said it before that I enjoy the fanservice that comes with this anime and it is the fanservice where studio TNK is banking on, everything else was too annoying especially Issei who would do anything for sex and his dream of being a \"Harem King\", that is if he ever bangs anyone in his club, school and in his household since all of the clubs girls are now living with him, which is fair to say that such scenario does add to this anime's enjoyment.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall: Pathetic 1.\\n\\n\r\nIf I were to view this in an objective manner, I would say that season 1 was a bit fine compare to this sequel, co'z in this sequel the expected battle between the Welsh Dragon and the white dragon has ended in a draw when some new character from the Khaos Brigade came by to interrupt, and really Son Goku from \"Saiyuki\" have to be the interloper?????????Corny!!!!!!!!Also, the main character Issei is way too annoying and there isn't an episode where you don't hear him say OPPAI, OPPAI and more OPPAI, man, he should be banging Rias already, frankly, his annoying and horny character alone,really makes this sequel too pathetic.\\n\\n\r\nAdios amigos. \\n",

            "content": "Highschool DxD New has been a very popular series among the fans of Ecchi/School-life this season, but does it really live up to the hype? What follows are my honest opinions on it. \r\nLet me begin by saying that I don't wish to be flamed for what I write, and if you take what I say that seriously, than you should think of a decent way to refute my reasoning. \r\nTo begin: the story. The story was horribly executed, with any drama in it being written off for scenes where they could make the moral reasoning for the character be nothing more than: \"I wantto see Rias's tits\" The story had a bit more to it than what I originally expected, but it didn't do much better than the first season, and as such shouldn't be rated above it. Now, I will admit that the addition of a few new characters was interesting, but it didn't drive the plot quite enough. \\n\r\nNow, considering this is ecchi, the plot is definitely more than what I'd originally expect, but it's nothing special. A solid 3/10 \\n\\n\r\nNow onto the characters. Considering that I look for characters with depth, while many of you look for the outer image of them, I'll split it into two categories. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter Physicality: As always, Rias and Akeno's proportions are very exaggerated, and I cannot support those kind of appearances. However, the addition of new girls with average/realistic body-types was a plus. I enjoyed seeing the new types of girls that they produced, and the way they acted based on the tropes of the series. 6/10 \\n\\n\r\nOther Character Traits: The characters didn't really garner any more depth than they had in the first season, and the only real development was around Akeno. Not that quality in this regard. However, they did add a bit more depth to the characters they added, and as I mentioned Akeno, which leads the character development to not be awful, but still be sub-par. 3/10 \\n\\n\r\nAnimation: The animation is very basic, and is mostly made up of bland backgrounds and talking heads. However, seeing that it's basic for current animation, I will not rate it too poorly. Also, considering that they did crisp up a bit of a faulty bits of animation from the first season, and it did mature a bit in regards to how polished it looked. 4/10\\n\\n\r\nSound: The voice acting cast is not bad, but in no regards are they amazing. The music/soundtrack is fairly basic as well, but it's not bad. With the songs being made up of similar music to the first season, and the OST being set to only a few scenes each episode, there wasn't a lot to base this score off of. However, seeing as it wasn't terrible, the following score is fair. 6/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall (I added 1 point for enjoyment value): The story is better than a lot of other ecchi, but it pales in comparison to the first season, and other than a few better-characterized females joining the harem, the story didn't develop too much, and left far too much unanswered. By no regards is this show above-average. What they could have added based on the source material, they disregarded. They turned what could have been fights based on love and such (similar to the first season) into more intense duels, and yet they turned them into gimmicks to have Issei pray for Rias's tis. However, I couldn't really expect less from an Ecchi/Harem. 5/10",

This anime clearly is catered to the male audience, but however it possibly wouldn't deter females from also watching it as well for various reasons. Reasons such as having consistent enjoyable episodes, which are usually never dull, a rather above average storywith several plot twists, and lovable cast of characters with different personalities; whom actually have some type of character progression & back story.\\n\\n\r\nJust a warning to those who want to try out the High School DxD series, whether it be from the first or second season, there are truck loads of fan service / Ecchi (particularly Nudity) There are only a several of animes that actually can pull this off and be considered a pretty good anime.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nStory: 8.3 -\\n\\n\r\nThe story isn't particularly a very complex one just by reading the synopsis, but this anime provides twists and turns on a consistent basis. Pacing is right on the mark, for example a huge fan service episode (Typical beach episode) then suddenly it continues, with actual plot progression. That deserves some credit where its due. \\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: 8.5 - \\n\\n\r\nOverall animation is very well done, not over the top & fancy, but never below average. There's a great usage of neutral colors, because essentially it is sort of a dark premise. A lot of warm pinks and reds colors if you know what I mean are present as well. The action scenes are fluid and amazing to watch.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 8.5 -\\n\\n\r\nThe characters in High School DxD are all surprisingly and distinctively different from each other. I believe this is where  High School DxD New's strong suit lies, other than its over the top fan service. \\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nWow Factor: 8.5 -\\n\\n\r\nEvery episode is always enjoyable to watch and is delivered on a yes, consistent basis, the way they manage everything is amazing. Without a doubt High School DxD New keeps the audience thoroughly amused and wanting to know what happens in the next episode. A great anime with an over abundance of enjoyable fan service, very comedic / humurous, yet can switch gears nearly on a dime, to a more serious mood. High School DxD New is definitely worth a watch, you shall not be disappointed!\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nFinal Grade: 8.4 / 10 -> 8 (Anime List)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\n           + The balance between the plot & ultimate fan service\\n\r\n           + Overall Consistency\\n\r\n           + Angels, Demons, Swords and Oppais\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nReview by: AzurexSky of AniRaters",

            "content": "(This has been adapted from my reddit thread)\r\n(This is a review for both Season One and Season Two)\r\nIn anime, there are many types of shows, from dark fantasies focusing on action to romantic comedies with a splash of drama. One genre in particular, ecchi, is mainly aimed at providing more sexual themes/happenings than other genres. For many ecchi shows, their focus on \"fanservice\" tends to diminish the show greatly. However, with High School DxD, the fanservice is actually used in more ways than one.\r\nSTORY\r\nHigh School DxD stars Issei, a normal high school student who is famous for is extremely perverted sense of mind. After unfortunate(fortunate?) events, Issei becomes a devil and subsequently a part of the Occult Research Club. The club consists of Rias Gremory, the President, Akeno, the Vice President, Kiba, the pretty boy, and Koneko, the small-but-tough girl.\\n\\n\r\nOne of the things that I found most enjoyable about the show was the way in which it handled the fighting, or more specifically the class system. Essentially, each club member is a chess piece; Rias is the King, Akeno the Queen, Kiba the Knight, Koneko the Rook, and Issei the Pawn. It seems simple when writing it out, but the writers do a nice job of incorporating the games pieces into the actual lore of devils and the ways in which they fight. This is especially true in the second arc of the first season where even chess tactics are used to overcome the enemy.\\n\\n\r\nBesides the use of chess, I found the world-building itself to actually be pretty good. Nothing is overly-complicated or even completely original, but I liked the dynamic between the angels, fallen-angels, and devils throughout both seasons. They introduce different aspects, such as historical events and nice descriptions of what each side is fighting for or against.\\n\\n\r\nSeason one focused on introducing the characters, background lore, and Rias's relationship, whereas season two focused even more on characters, new story arcs, and giving our protagonist his \"final boss\". I think I found the stories for both seasons to be equally as good. I enjoyed season one since it focused a lot more on Rias. Season two was good as well because it not only increased the overall world in which the characters were taking part, but also because more of the characters were explored and introduced, ultimately leading to more shenanigans between the girls and Issei.\\n\\n\r\nAlso of note is how the fanservice within the show is actually used as a combat device. Issei's love for boobs and women in general (especially boobs) is used as a weapon not only against his opponents but as a way to increase the strength within him. Meaning, the fanservice really wasn't just for show; the plot was both plot and plot.\\n\\n\r\nANIMATION\\n\\n\r\nSurprisingly, the animation is actually pretty good. Many of the fight scenes are choreographed well enough, with fluid character movements and cool tricks used by all sides. I was actually somewhat taken aback during many of the fight scenes for how nicely they looked. Granted, the actual art style is not on the same level as something like Fate/Zero, but regardless the animation is still good.\\n\\n\r\nBeing ecchi, the show also puts in considerable effort to make the women of the show look beautiful, sexy, and many times even lewd as much as they can. Now, going into the show knowing this, I expected there to be some fanservice. However, the version I watched had no qualms with showing the women completely naked (minus their vaginas). Meanings, and if I am not mistaken, there was always at least one naked breast shot per episode. And again, the animation and even the art here is nicely done, with appropriate physics and appeal to match.\\n\\n\r\nThis is true for both seasons; the animation quality and amount of boobs never wavers.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS\\n\\n\r\nI think the characters within DxD tend to be a little tropey (loli-girl, sadist girl, super nice girl, tomboy girl, etc.) but I actually thought the show did a nice job of trying to provide good backgrounds for all of the characters. Now, some of them have yet to be fully explored, but I am sure with the coming season (and others?) they will to.\\n\\n\r\nSeason one took its time with Rias and Asia. Season two decided to go with Kiba, Xenovia, and Gasper (and slightly with Akeno). Also, the final boss character I also really like. He isn't just evil for the sake of being evil, but rather has his own goals and ambitions or things that he wants to accomplish. And as you learn, he is literally Issei's rival. In that regard, I think season two does a nicer job with the characterization, even if they didn't focus as much on Rias as I would have liked.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND\\n\\n\r\nThe OPs for both season one and two were not that good. However, season one's ED, which can be listened to here, and season two's ED, which can be listened to here, were both not only catchy but extremely pleasing to the eye. That is to say, visually the EDs are probably the most sexually suggestive things I have seen in anime (obviously not counting the show itself).\\n\\n\r\nI thought the voice acting was appropriate for their roles, but nothing in particular stood out to me performance-wise. I recognized some of the voices from some of the characters, but that is besides the point.\\n\\n\r\nI should note however the sound effects, specifically the one associated with each woman's pair of breasts. For the more endowed woman, there would occasionally be this \"squish\" noise associated with their boobs moving/colliding with one another. This isn't anything spectacular, but when I first started noticing it, I thought that it was quite interesting that the studio put that much detail towards the boobs. I think at this point, it should have been expected!\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT\\n\\n\r\nWhile the story is nice and the animation is good, in order to fully enjoy the show you have to like boobs. I'm not kidding, there are a lot of naked women that show up over the course of the show. From the OP to the ED and everything in-between, the show will not hesitate to show you boobs. And for me that was perfectly fine. Being a young man myself, I like naked women, so the show was definitely pleasing to watch.\\n\\n\r\nBut like I said, it is more than just naked women. There is actual world-building and character development that takes place. I would say that the show does a nice job of balancing the two sides.\\n\\n\r\nI wouldn't go so far as to say that the show is porn (there is no actual sexual activity, even if it is alluded to), but I haven't seen a show that was willing to go as far as it did with its women. I really don't mind fanservice, but if you do, then this show is definitely not the one for you.\\n\\n\r\nSUMMARY, SEASON 1\\n\\n\r\nStory: Fine, interesting lore and clever use of class mechanics\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: Good, good looking women and nice fighting scenes\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Fine, nothing groundbreaking but characters are explored\\n\\n\r\nSound: Bad, only the ED is worth listening to and even then you are probably only watching for the visuals\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Great, funny, nice lore, and plenty of boobs\\n\\n\r\nFinal Score: 6/10\\n\\n\r\nSUMMARY, SEASON 2\\n\\n\r\nStory: Fine, ups the ante while providing us with more lore to work with\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: Good, quality persists from season one but with even more girls to look at\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Good, more characters are introduced while previous ones are developed\\n\\n\r\nSound: Bad, again just the ED (but still for the visuals)\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Great, the story, characters, and boobs are in full-force once again\\n\\n\r\nFinal Score: 6/10",

            "content": "If you watched the first season of this series, then you already know what you're getting into: a very fanservice-heavy harem romantic comedy with good action, decent plot, and memorable characters. This second season doesn't deviate much from the formula - everything you loved before is back, and probably better than ever before.\r\nStory: 9\r\nThe story here is even better and more complex than the first season's. The main characters are all back, and the first large story arc deals with Kiba's backstory and expands his character a great deal, while the second arc sheds more light into the whole demon-angel-fallen angel war. Both stories arepretty well thought-out and give the characters good development, all the while introducing new interesting characters who deepen the plot. The only weakness to the story is that it is still a bit predictable, especially the fight scenes, which play out kind of like Dragon Ball Z (strong villain shows up, friends get beaten up, main character gets insane power-up, villain is defeated, stronger villain comes out).\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8\\n\r\nThe fight scenes are pretty well animated and it is easy to tell what is going on. The characters are very well-designed, and girls all have pretty unique... um... \"features,\" if you know what I mean. The fanservice is once again on the heavier side, and it is something that, in my opinion, sometimes gets in the way of the rest of the scene. For the most part, though, it is something that doesn't harm the show. But you should already know what you're getting into if you've watched the first season.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8\\n\r\nThe openings and endings are all very well done, though only one or two of them are really memorable. The background music supplements all the scenes well and helps create or dissolve tension as necessary in the story, though none of them are stand-outs that I would want to listen to on my iPod over again.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10\\n\r\nThe biggest improvement to this season is the characters. We learn a lot more about all of them - their feelings, their histories, their families, their motivations, their problems, etc. Because of this, the characters have become even more endearing than they had been after Season 1. If you liked the series because of the characters, then you definitely won't be disappointed here. This season will make you want to watch more of the characters and their interactions and see their stories unfold.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9\\n\r\nOverall, I thoroughly enjoyed this series, despite a few mild problems here and there and a bit too much unnecessary fanservice on a few occasions. If you liked the first season, then there's no reason you won't like this one.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9\\n\\n\r\nIf you liked this series, you might also like:\\n\r\nBoku wa Tomodachi ga Sukunai (I Don't Have Many Friends)\\n\r\nBaka to Test to Shoukanjuu (Baka and Test: Summon the Beasts)\\n\r\nIchiban Ushiro no Daimaou (Demon King Daimao)\\n\r\nInfinite Stratos\\n\r\nDate A Live",

            "content": "If you are reading this review, then most likely you have seen the first season and gotten used to the high amount of panty shots/boobs. That being said, I'm going to jump right into the review of this boob-filled wonderland that we call High School DxD. \r\nStory 9/10\r\nMost harem anime have little to no story, however, High School DxD is the exception to that rule. The story that it has is a genuinely good one. In this season there is a lot of focus on characters other than Issei. A few of the episodes go into Kiba's past and how he was reborn as adevil, and also some very intriguing things about Akeno. It also introduces two new characters, Irina and Xenovia. This season introduces quite a few new characters that will play a part in future conflicts. However, there is still enough of Issei to go around. Whether it be him dealing with chicks, or fighting with his Sacred Gear. \\n\\n\r\nArt 8/10\\n\r\nThe art in season 2 is definitely superior to the first season, they pay a lot more attention to details. However, they still do put a lot of emphasis on boobs/panties, but that is to be expected. Overall I found the art to be very well done and detailed.\\n\\n\r\nSound 9/10\\n\r\nThe music for this season was awesome. And the voice acting was beautiful, what stuck out to me the most was Akeno's voice. They could not have picked a better person to voice her, it was cute and yet seductive at the same time. The other voice actors did a good job as well, such as Issei when he is raging or in full perv-mode. The emotion in the actors voices were very real and refreshing.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 9/10\\n\r\nThey went quite in-depth for the characters surrounding Issei. They gave quite a bit of information regarding Kiba, Akeno, Irina, and Xenovia, as well as other supporting characters. It made those characters that much more likable.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 10/10\\n\r\nI thoroughly enjoyed High School DxD New and can't wait for another season! There isn't much to not like in this show, it gives you the action of Issei kickin' ass, and all the Ecchi you could ask for. \\n\\n\r\nOverall 10/10\\n\r\nThis is definitely one of my all-time favorite anime. It has the Ecchi/harem I was looking for, and tops it all off with a powerful yet comical main character. Plus, their storyline isn't full of cliche's like most Ecchi/Harem type anime, which gave it a unique and more enjoyable feel to it.",

It's not exactly a cerebral concept, and yet at the same time it actually instills a sense of happiness that's way beyond what it should...and that's even before all the ecchi stuff.\r\nIn fact, what makes me appreciate DxD so much is the attention to Christian lore. Through the first two seasons we got references to Longinus, the Imperial Regalia, Roland, Saint George, pretty much the entire gamut of the Lemegeton, and probably more that I missed out on. The created world here drawson so much mythology that a production of lesser quality would have barfed a maelstrom of conflicting concepts on top of a mountain of kazongas. DxD makes it work in a clever manner that drives me to want to know more all the time--it teases without info dumping.\\n\\n\r\nThe second season draws far more out of the \"kid with superpowers loves huge bongas\" idea than the first while maintaining a fair amount of comedy and some fantastic depictions of friendship and adventure. My only real gripe is that hijinks and goofs obviously took a third wheel position behind worldbuilding and knocker worship. So, is it worth watching? If you're after a shitload of ecchi, fan service, and tatas that sound like jello when they bounce the answer is absolutely yes. If you're after a smart, sharp world with well-developed characters and a fun sense of adventure the answer is also absolutely yes. There's really no going wrong here unless you hate having a good time.",

This is clearly true when examining the second season of Highschool Dxd, also called Highschool Dxd New. The season\u2019s first line is \u201cboobs\u201d, a line which pretty much sums up the entire show. Now don\u2019t get me wrong, Highschool Dxd is, at its core, an Ecchi about boobs and other naked female body parts. However, like its predecessor, it still manages to provide a somewhat interesting and coherent story with decentcharacters whose overtly sexual natures can be overlooked due to the shows genre and purpose. \\n\r\nThe story picks up shortly after the end of the first season with not much having changed. Primarily, this season focuses on the conflicts and interactions between the devils, angels and the fallen angels. Surprisingly, the devils continue to be the \u201cgood guys\u201d in this conflict with the sinister fallen angels being the source of most of the stories evil. This time around the plot is more compelling than in the first season, and comedic undertones continue to reappear. Honestly though, whether you\u2019re watching Issei employ his sacred \u201cpervert power\u201d or the absurd sexual logic of the main characters, this show is hilarious. With all this being said, the story, when compared to other anime, is somewhat weak, and one must recognize that Highschool Dxd New is a show that values nudity, fan service and ridiculous sexual situations more so than a compelling story.\\n\r\nThe characters are definitely more captivating this time around. In the first season, some characters such as Kiba and Akeno felt completely undeveloped and simply seemed to hang around in the background. Now, these secondary characters are portrayed in a new light, and actually have personalities detailed enough that one could actually discuss these characters in more depth than just by comparing their bodies. There are also some new characters added to the mix, such as Xenovia and Irina, two members of church, as well as other devils and fallen angels. These new characters result in some interesting subplots and even more comedic situations. This second season also acts as more of a traditional harem than the first, as an larger amount of the female cast becomes interested in Issei, unlike in the first season where it seemed that Issei had only two love interests. So, I suppose if you\u2019re into harems that\u2019s a plus for you. At the same time though, it becomes annoying for every character to randomly fall in love with the main character for little to no reason what so ever. Furthermore, it becomes downright silly when various unbelievably sexy girls come onto the main character, basically crawling on him naked, and he is unable to act for whatever stupid reason. This is just so unrealistic that it becomes bothersome. However, this is the kind of stuff that will occur in shows like this, so it is somewhat forgivable. In the end, in comparison to other movies and anime, the characters are quite lackluster, but in the realm of ecchi, there pretty good. There is a large variety of girls, all attractive for their own reasons, as to appeal to different tastes. One would be hard pressed to not find at least one suitable wiafu when watching this show.\\n\r\nThe art is great, and damn do the animators do a good job at making animated teenage girls so hot. The physics are also excellently done, resulting in fluid and believable bouncing of breasts with characters every movement. Aside from the characters, this is a fairly new anime with some great art, and overall everything is crisply animated.\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is similar in quality to the first two seasons, and the opening and closing credits are quite catchy. I watched the Japanese sub for season 2, unlike for the first season where I watched the dub. The Japanese dub is good (but not great) and is a significant step up in quality as opposed to the English dub.\\n\r\nObviously, if you\u2019re not a fan of the whole ecchi genre this is not a show for you. However, if you enjoyed the first season of Highschool Dxd, your likely going to enjoy the second season just as much, if not even more. Simply put, Highschool Dxd New is ecchi at its finest, a comedic tale that has an interesting story and good characters that does an excellent job of providing all of the fan service that anyone can dream of. \\n",

            "content": "*WARNING! THIS REVIEW MAY CONTAIN MINOR SPOILERS FOR SEASON 2 OF HIGH SCHOOL DxD* \r\nWhat do you think of while watching the Ecchi genre? For me, at least, I think about how corny the story line is and how boring the characters are. I'll admit it, Ecchi shows don't interest me. Then came High School DxD, a show with a lot going for it, but the execution wasn't exactly the best. How do you fix something like that? Add another season of course!\r\nStory: 7/10 - The story for the second season doesn't completely overhaul the foundation the first season laid out, but rather expands uponit, which is a good thing in my opinion. It can get a bit silly at times, and often times the show does not know when to take itself seriously or not, but overall High School DxD has proved that even borderline porn can have a plot. While I would like to go over the general storyline some more, it has multiple arcs to it so going over everything that season 2 has to offer will take a lot more time than needed.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: 10/10 - Wow... There is not a word I can say to describe how breathtaking the art is. When they are not flashing giant boobs in your face, they are displaying some of the most intense fight scenes that anime has to offer. I like to consider the fight scenes as \"Beautiful Destruction\", the world MAY be exploding... but it looks so damn awesome that you can't help to be amazed at the chaos. This is something High School DxD does best, it goes ALL OUT with the fight scenes, and it is truly a marvel to behold. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 8/10 - While the dub to this show (in my full opinion) is one of the strong points, the soundtrack could of been a lot more intense. To be honest, both of the intros to this show weren't exactly memorable, and the background music often leaves a lot to be desired.   \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9/10 - Wait, what?! An Ecchi show where the characters have personality? What is this? That's right. Something Season 2 did great on was expand upon Akeno and Kiba. Akeno became a lot more than just Rias' sidekick, and a lot of backstory was revealed about Akeno to prove that she isn't just a pretty sight. And as for our \"Prince Charming\", Kiba? He probably got the most character development this season than anyone else in the show. The thing that really made Kiba's back story depressing wasn't the fact the he abandoned his faith, but rather how his faith abandoned him. Also, there were a few characters that are new to this season. Let's start with Xenovia: Being a strong believer in the church, she set out with her best friend on obtaining the stolen pieces of Excalibur from a fallen angel, but in the process, she learned the ugly truth: God is dead. The church realized she has learned this and ex-communicated her, and with no where to run, she joined up with Rias and became a devil. One other character I would like to go over is the adorable vampire: Gasper. Gasper was born half-vampire and half-human, and as a consequence, he was stuck between both worlds. He wasn't strong enough to have the vampires respect him, however, he was also viewed as a \"monster\" by many of the humans. So our ol' friend Rias decides to take Gasper in to become her Bishop. The problem, however, is that Rias wasn't able to contain Gasper's powers and he was locked away, but now our shy little vampire makes his debut when his powers are truly needed. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10 - There is not much I can say to describe how much I enjoyed watching this show. When I wasn't laughing, I was engulfed by the insane amount of awesome fight scenes, or focused on Kiba's quest for revenge. Finding a boring point to this show is probably the second hardest thing the show will give you. If you catch my drift. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9/10 - Was it a bit cheesy? Yeah. But, with a passable storyline, INSANE animation, great dub, likable characters (who are more than just eye candy), and an intense amount of enjoyment,  High School DxD truly deserves it's title as the \"King of Ecchi.\"",

His pursuit of happiness can only be admired by the viewer and anyone who thinks its gross should get a life.\\n\r\nThat being said, every other character in this anime seems to play a pivotal role in making Issei look even more fking amazing.\\n\\n\r\nMusic: After listening to the amazing opening, ending, and in-anime music i can't help but question my existence and why i wasn't born in a parellel universe where life is depicted like anime, i had to punch a newborn child to come back to reality\\n\\n\r\nStory: The development of the story in this season so far is amazing and can only be described by 1 word, bust-a-nut-worthy\\n\\n\r\nPlot: Talking about the the PLOT would require more than 69 kazilionbillion words, lets leave it at nice, also, this season has many new introductions of mythology which really was surprising and adds another dimension to the storyline\\n\r\nMy will was tested and i lost, tears flowed down my cheeks, this season so far has everything, heart break, love, action and friendship.\\n\\n\r\nArt: The art causes a symptom known as tight pants-eritus, every shot, every scene, and every camera angle brings a new level of beauty and brings enjoyment level over 9000, the detail around the jugs of the girls are a step in the right direction and shows us how far we have gone in boob making technology as a species\\n\\n\r\nOverall: I thoroughly enjoyed it and I could never look at women in the same way, my expectations have skyrocketed\\n\\n\r\nMy review of probably one of the best harem, ecchi animes in recent and probably future history is completed. Highschool DxD is simple, it does not try to be the next Stiens Gate or Full Metal Alchemist, but plays to its strengths. This 3rd installment of the series is a MUST watch because of the reasons stated above, such as the Art and Music. We may take our body pillows on dates but our desire to find our Garden of EDEN will not be stopped, Highschool DxD is our gateway.\\n\r\nThat is why i believe Highschool DxD BoRN is Infinity/10!\\n\\n\r\nWhole Season : Even with a 10/10 score this season didn't feel the same compared the season 1 and 2, i can't pinpoint exactly why but it felt like something was missing and maybe this was because it deviated from the Light Novel. With that being said, even with a somewhat of a downhill ending, season 3 still managed to clear my stockpile in a matter of seconds",

            "content": "Here's my review of High School DxD New.\r\nThe story of High School DxD New follows the events of the first season when Rias moves in with Issei and his family. The plot centers around volumes 3 and 4 of the light novels. The first half show gives you a glimpse into Kiba's past and how he has the last survivor of The Holy Sword Project and how the leader of the project reemerges and wants to use the four holy swords to start a war. The second half of the show is about a truce between the angels, devils, and fallen angels. In addition, theclash between Issei, possessor of the Welsh Dragon Ddraig and Vali, possessor of the Vanishing Dragon Albion.\\n\\n\r\nSome of the characters are more fleshed out in this show for example Akeno. She starts having lustful desires for Issei and starts to fall in love with him. She is also revealed to be a reincarnated devil who was once half human and half fallen angel. Rias has more of a jealous personality when the other girls try to flirt with Issei. Also we get introduced to some new characters, but the three I am going to talk about are Gasper, Irina, and Xenovia. Gasper is a first year student at Kuoh Academy and is a cross dressing vampire who is timid and afraid of people, but gets development as the show goes on. Irina is a childhood friend of Issei and is a reincarnated angel. Finally, there's Xenovia a reincarnated angel who later joins Rias's peerage as her knight and wants to bear Issei's children.\\n\\n\r\nThe show isn't that much different from the first season. I still find it very entertaining. There are some pretty funny moments in this show. Overall I think the show is great and say that if you want to watch a show that you could just sit down and watch just for the hell of it I recommend this show and it's predecessor.",

            "content": "one thing I always believed in when it come to a sequel is that is has to be better than its predecessor. The first season of high-school dxd was fun and did help me go through a twelve hour time period where I could not speak. So going into this season the only things I was expecting was an overabundance of tits and, booty shots. I am glad to say that this wasn't the case.\r\nThe second season has two main story arcs the first revolves around the character of Kiba a knight of house Gremory who is the Finn Balor of the show meaning thathe was criminally underutilized. The arc follows him on his quest to destroy seven holy swords. I really liked this arc because it was compelling and, gave dept and, emotion to an otherwise forgettable character. The second arc built on the world of the show by introducing Azazel the ruler of the fallen angels as well as Saint Michael and, two women from the church called Xenovia and Irina. We are also, introduced to the white dragon emperor Vali the counter part to red dragon emperor Issei. I liked the world building in this and, I am defiantly intrigued for the future of the show. \\n\\n\r\nThe animation is still phenomenal and, the action sequences as as crisp as ever. The first opening to the show was pretty cool but, the rest of the music is either rehashed or forgettable.\\n\\n\r\nA lot of characters in the show receive much needed development, Issei while his motivation is still to become harem king is more relatable in this show, Rias gets a level of humanity added to her character which as both good and, bad as it was nice to see emotion from her but was a total 180 from her. Akeno was probably my favourite in terms of depth as we explore her back story and, learn that she is part fallen angel. We also, get a vampire devil known as Gasper who is essentially a plot device much like Asia was in the first season. \\n\\n\r\nThe fan service on the show was toned down significantly which was a much welcome surprise and, the fan service that was there didn't bother me and, id be lying if I said it wasn't kinda hot. But, still some of these girls look underage and, that is a line we shouldn't cross.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of underage the character of Asia is a strange character she appears shy and, timid in front of other characters but, becomes a raging whore when it comes to Issei. There is also, a jealousy subplot because, of course there is that goes no where. We get to know a bit more about the Gremory family but, not as much as we'd like to. Also, the battle between Issei and, Vali felt rushed as it didn't have much time dedicated to it even though it was absolutely badass.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, High School DxD New was an improvement over the initial season, there were moments of development, some amazing blends of comedy as well as drama. The set up for the future was laid out beautifully. However, the recycled music, meaningless subplots and, not going all in with some characters take this shown down a notch for me. Still this was a pretty fun and enjoyable show that I could see myself rewatching in the future. \\n",

Therefore we shall be talking about the plot, and not the \"plot\"\r\nHigh school DxD is what all ecchi should be. When a friend mentioned to anime to me I thought it was going to be a boobfest with little to no plot at all. I was wrong. I mean , the boobfest was still there but it was accompanied with a plot. A good plot. \r\nSTORY: now I won't be spoiling any of the plot here, buttrust me when I say that it's a solid story. Not the best but a story that goes deeper than you would think for a ecchi comedy. Not too deep though. Deep enough to enjoy but not deep enough for you to wake up at 2 am and scream \"I UNDERSTAND EVERYTHING NOW\".\\n\\n\r\nART: I mean, it's standard. Average. Yep.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND: Sound is actually not to bad. Not the best openings and closings I've seen. but I mean hey, it's pretty good. Dark parts of the anime have dark music and light parts have light music. Funny parts having funny music. Music does its job well.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER. I didn't hate a single one. Not even the villains. Okay maybe one or two villains but the characters are very enjoyable. Likable and realistic. To a degree. Because ya know. It's an ecchi.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT. Absolutely enjoyed this. This is one of those animes that really is solid once you get over the boobfest. \\n\\n\r\nOVERALL: story is great, art is average, sound does its job, characters are likable and solid. Really enjoyed it. It's a fun little anime that is worth a watch. \\n",

            "content": "\"Wow, it's like your depraved carnal desires give you some sort of crazy courage, I wish I could be as detached from reality as you!\"\r\nThis quote simultaneously sums up pretty well why I love this show so much and also ranks among the funniest fucking things I've ever heard in an anime and that's saying something. I came because I heard it was the quintessential ecchi show and I stayed because the characters are actually great, the world is cool, the story is fun and the fight scenes are pretty kick ass. Honestly wasn't expecting to care about what was happening as much as Idid in a show that feels the need to force gratuitous nudity in at least every 2 minutes, not that I'm complaining, but I did. \\n\\n\r\nThe self-aware aspect of the writing and humorous take that keeps it from ever being anything less than fun, but still allows for some great character moments is one of my favorite parts of the show, even alongside all of the incredibly well-realized and animated characters. I give the English dub actors a round of applause because this show legitimately had me rolling multiple times in almost every episode. Great show, can get a bit cheesy and very over the top at times, but well worth a watch if you're looking for a little bit of romantic/action/fantasy/comedy in your watchlist, HSDxD gets an 8 outta 10 from me.",

And YET...AND YET...We have here one of the better shows i've seen in a long time.\r\nThe first season was large on breasts, the second season was large on awesome ass kickage and powerups.  The story itself isn't going to win any literature awards, but the implementation of the elements was incredible.  So what the hell am i talking about?\r\nIssei is a perv who does pervy things.  He wants to be King of the Harems.  The storyrevolves around Issei's misadventures after he is betrayed by a buxom fallen angel.  He realizes his power and fights to protect his friends.  It's cheesy.  It's over the top, but its alot of fun.\\n\\n\r\nThe key ingredient that holds this sideshow up is the characters.  So varied and interesting, alot of powerful people with huge potentials make up the Occult Investigation Club at school, where Issei makes his home away from home.  The evolution of the characters, both in abilities and personalities make this season a smash hit for me.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is actually deep enough to make the struggles of Issei and frens worthwhile.  The dynamic of the characters and story fit very well for an ecchi fantasy powerup show.  The pacing is great, the music fits, the humor is always present but never overwhelming.  This is a masterpiece of titular anime.  You should watch this.",

Rias jellousy & akeno seduction of issei is fun to watch. The second arc which introduce the leader of the faction the summit of the 3 power have a lot of surprises & twist that keep you guessing what gonna happen next. The villians issei and the gang face this time is a step up from last season, kokabiel & vali is very  powerfull foes to overcome & that last episode fight is epic.

            "content": "The thing about Highschool DxD and it's sequels, OVA's etc. It uses lore from Europe. The white dragon/red dragon thing references the English/Welsh Conflict and the whole plot about Angels vs Demons (which are called Devils in Highschool DxD) is from Christianity, which is not a Japanese Cultural Staple. And since they are foreign to the culture they are using to create a story from, I get the feeling they don't understand it properly and therefore don't understand that what they are using is an important part of other people's heritage. This is not Restricted to Highschool DxD either as alot of Anime use WesternLore. If you are very easily offended then you may be distracted by the butchering of the red and white dragon lore. But the one that causes the real problem is that they are using the World's largest religion as a plot point that they control. Without spoiling anything  I'd say that if you are a Christian, you will have issues with this as it encourages you to support the Demons (Massively Taboo in western Culture). If you don't care about this then you'll love this manga. The reasons being that it has not ceased to have surprisingly good comedy for an Anime and the Ecchi (I could write for days about the Ecchi). Really if you like the Whole Harem/Ecchi thing then this is a near perfect series for it.",

            "content": "For my first review I decided to do DxD New.  High school DxD is one of my favorite Light novel series and I was pleased with the second season.  I actually do not like fan service one bit, in a matter of fact I think it ruins most series.  So what makes this series stand out of the bunch? well I am going to break in down.  I will look at it from the following angles, Story, art, sound, lore, world building, character, and overall.\r\nStory:  With solid lore, characters, and an expansive world to jump into it is not hardto tell a great story with all the tools here.  Its hard to say more about the story without ruining anything, but you are sure to get everything you want from a great epic.  Great plot twist, fulfilling climax, drama, excitement and anticipation it has everything you could ask for in a good story.  The big thing is, unlike in most stories all of these plot devices are executed perfectly and understandably, something that has been lost in most of today's anime.\\n\\n\r\nArt work: As a holder of an art degree myself, I look very carefully at everything.  Though this series doesn't bring anything new to the table, what it does have is executed perfectly.  Outfit design, weapon design, character design, even attack design is very well done.  Everything from the outfits to the weapons art crafted in a way that helps create a believable and comfortable environment for the viewer.  Everyone from the pervert to the high class artisan can enjoy various aspects of the art work done in this series.  I cannot go into any more information about the art work I enjoy without spoiling, so if anyone has question feel free to ask me.\\n\\n\r\nSound:  I have to say I think the sound in this series is underrated.  Rather than just choosing one sound style like rock, classical or j-pop this series uses it all.  Whether your listening to the classical violin during the romantic scenes, the j-pop opening or the heavy rock/alternative the sound helps set the mood to create a greater impact on the viewer.  When doing this it can be hard to not make all the sounds feel out of place, corny or just wrong.  Even with the many different moods and emotions flying around the sound track helps the strengthen and stabilize all of this.  Though the OST is not the greatest stand alone, the fact is it was used perfectly in the series.  This is not an OST review, this is how the sound was portrayed in the anime, and it was done perfectly.\\n\\n\r\nWorld Building:  World building refers to how and what the fantasy realm of the series is made, or made of.  The world of High school DxD is filled with many different factions, races and creatures to construct an interesting mythopia.  It is easy to get lost in the endless details of this world, and for lore junkies like myself the amount of information and research that went into this is so massive I have ended up spending hours researching it myself.  The fact is this series has pieced together many different Gods, myths, cultures, and religions from all around the world in order to create an original and fantastic world of its own.\\n\\n\\n\r\nLore:  With such a great world the lore of this series is absolutely amazing.  Taking from both myth and imagination this series weaves together different cultures and myths to create believable lore from this universe.  Everything from Voodoo and norse mythology are woven together here.  (I cannot say which ones are from what but if you wish to ask me what is norse origin and what is Voodoo origin in the season 2 of DxD I will tell you.)  This series weaves together its own unique story to create a masterful lore.  You could spend hours to studing the stories of the many factions, monsters, and weapons within this series, both historically and within the High School DxD universe.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:  Like most anime you can see a lot of the character archetypes here else where(though thats the nature of the beast) the uniqueness comes from their personality, character history, and how they interact with one and other.  Even with the use of archetypes these characters are far from shallow.  Characters have unique history ranging from battles with legendary dragons, to human experiments.  Each character possessing their own unique reason for what they do.  The depth within each characters carefully planned out past and psyche makes for great character interaction that is sure to entertain whether it is on the battle field or in the bed room.\\n\\n\\n\r\nImpact: This refers to the impact the series has both emotionally and mentally.  Even with some of the characters less intelligent reasons for doing this you often find yourself rooting for them, even if its for something like breast.  Not to mention the many other emotional impacts some of the characters most go through, went through or over come you can easily feel it push through the screen.  The fact of the matter is you can feel the impact of the events happening in the series accurately the way you were meant to, and you understand it to.  The are very few times you feel like what they hell is going on? and they times you do, your suppose to feel that way.  The fact is, there is a lot more going on here emotionally and mentally that fan service and it is not hard to realize it either.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall:  This is a fantastic series that tells the epic tale of a demon trying to become the strongest and get laid along the way.  To be fair this is the story of almost every guy out there, its not hard for anyone to understand the main characters feelings.  Even with so many things happening with this series, the story is executed flawlessly.  Rather than most anime now a days this series doesn't get its kicks from gimmicky fights or re-used plots, but a well rounded set of characters set in a unique and vibrate world demanding to be explored.",

            "content": "As shocked you'd be hearing it, and believe me, I would have never expected myself to say such a thing, this is an extreme harem/ecchi with a solid plot, this is a great sequel, this is a plot involving tale. I know it's hard to believe, nudity is everywhere, but I feel that the first season did its trick on us, and gave us our share of fanservice only to let us focus on the plot later with no distractions.\r\nHigh School DxD New improves on its prequel on so many levels, it's no longer about nasty perverted stuff, although that's what dragged us into theseries in the first place, this story turned out to be with a more involving plot that we might have anticipated.\\n\\n\r\n- Story (8.7/10):\\n\r\nThe first season was really weak in terms of storytelling, we got introduced to the three major factions yes, we did have the first club members introduced, I know, but it really was just a mess out of fanservice that didn't know when to end.\\n\r\nHigh School DxD New gave more attention to telling the actual story while also retaining a controllable amount of fanservice. in this second installment of the franchise we get to see more light spots on various characters, their origins, and motives, their dreams and relationships.\\n\r\nAlso, this time around, a more greater danger was approaching, and even more worldbuilding was made in terms of villains, allies. I would actually, finnaly be true to myself, and call Highschool DxD a good story with an insane lore ranking slightly below other amazing titles,  such as One Piece and No Game No Life.\\n\\n\r\n- Art (8.3/10):\\n\r\nNot the most amazing thing to say the least, but not as bad either, it certainly is better by a small margin than that of the first season but not so much noticeable.\\n\r\nWhat can I say really, in terms of anatomy, the female's are just as much or even more erotic that I can remember, I know you're in for some exciting body bumps, so have some high hopes, you won't be let down.\\n\r\nThe animation was decent, really, nothing compares to a high budget movie production, but there is really nothing that would make you go; \u201cEww\u201d or anything.\\n\\n\r\n- Sound (8.0/10):\\n\r\nThe installment had its share of amazing sound-work, the soundtracks are the same ones from the first season, and those were just spectacular, so no complaints here.\\n\r\nThe thing I wasn't quite pleasant here is the existent of 2 opening theme songs for a mere 12 episodes of content, while the first opening theme song was just amazing, very catchy (but not as good as the first season's), the second one didn't quite click to me. The ending theme songs were also great, especially the last one.\\n\r\nThe voice acting here remains as one of a high quality, I can't pick one above the other here, you get the feminine tone of voice when the females speak something erotic and also get intense performances on their respective moments.\\n\\n\r\n- Character (9.0/10):\\n\r\nThis is character development at its finest, I would even argue that great series like Fullmetal Alchemist and the likes of it pale in comparison, this is definitely a trophy winner.\\n\r\nWe get to meet a lot of cool characters in this season, surprisingly not only females but male characters, speaking about the great Azazel, such a cool design, and personality.\\n\r\nBack to our old character, take Kiba for instance, I would say, he got the most focus of this season, probably the most developed character in the series so far. I would bet that if there was somebody who didn't give Kiba any credits of attention at first would change his or her minds now that we got his backstory. The same can be told about Akeno that also had some play time here.\\n\\n\r\n- Enjoyment (9.4/10):\\n\r\nI'm being very honest here, I really liked this series, I never got this kind of feeling while watching a harem or ecchi before, those were to me like more of a pleasure and giggles than actual enjoyment, but this is a game changer, my balance breaker.\\n\r\nI got everything I wanted with extra, I really dug the story, and for that alone, I'd attempt to rewatch the whole series sometime in the future.\\n\r\nI enjoyed the characters way more in this season, they had a depth to themselves, especially the ones that didn't have that much focus on the first season.\\n\\n\r\n- Overall (8.7/10):\\n\r\nI've always been skeptical about recommending Harem/Ecchi series to friends, but not anymore, or at least, not with this one. I'm really thankful to that one guy who recommended this series, I didn't know I needed this at first, but it was a hell(pun intended) of a good watch. Yes, I would definitely recommend watching this if you've already seen the first season if you didn't enjoy the first that much, this one is absolutely an improvement that has more quality and distance between it and the first season than the iPhone smartphone brands.",

            "content": "My opinion of season 2 does not differ much from season 1, so I've used my review for season 1 below. There is one large difference though. Season 2 made a mistake of introducing a hyper-sexualized child as a character. In my opinion, this character archetype needs to be eradicated from anime. That is only my opinion. Because of this, the cast of characters as a whole has lost a little value for me, but the anime is still outstanding!\r\nHigh School DXD is an ecchi/harem icon. If you are a fan of good storytelling punctuated with fanservice then DXD is for you. Some opinions faultDXD for being non-canonical with the manga or have too little story. The ecchi/harlem tag can definitely create this illusion of a lack of storytelling, and sometimes critics are correct. However, DXD does an extremely good job at finding the right combination of content and fanservice making DXD very special. DXD found a way to advance its story in every episode instead of using filler episodes like most ecchis. It's also important to remember that an anime is an anime, and not a manga. Seperate animals should be treated and designed a bit differently. In this way, some deviation from the manga is permissible and understandable as coming too close to the manga could lead The animated version into pitfalls. All in all, DXD is a must watch.",

The story blazes through the visual novels like a wildfire, however mediates to the animation. Adding every small detail from the Light Novel would not really impact the story.\r\nArt (10):\r\nAs you watched through High School DxD, there is a visual upgrade in art in the BD from Season 1 to Season 2. (Obviously there has to be an upgrade over the years or else people will complain.)\r\nSound (9):\r\nThe S2 soundtrack is somewhat similarto S1, but lacks the depressing/tragic overtone I liked when hearing Rias' theme song Shinsou no, Ojou-sama desu. The classical music, I'm very fond of, trends to battle.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter (10):\\n\r\nThe appearance of Xenovia, Irina, Vali, and Azazel are critical in the progression  of the anime. Rias will still get screen time, more than the others, but the backstory is important. The development of the characters are not rapid.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (10):\\n\r\nI adore the series, even if it turned out this way.\\n\\n\r\nOverall (10):\\n\r\nIf you like your ecchi anime bundle, included with harem, and godlike powers, this is the perfect anime for you.\\n\\n\r\n//18OCT2015 #will update more later after I do more extensive research without spoiling anything as this is my first review.",

If you liked the first season in the series, then you'll like the 2nd season in the series. And, if I were to rate the anime on specific factors I would rate it like this: \r\nStory[7]: \r\nThe story isn't the best in the world and it has never been claimed to have the best story in the world. It does however have a story that can hold the anime together enough so it makessense, and the anime actually has a plot. \\n\\n\r\nSetting[8]: \\n\r\nThe setting for the anime is one of the more unique ones when it comes to dealing with devils. It doesn't immediately put the devils in the negative spotlight as many other animes would. The setting for the anime is also perfect for the genre of the anime.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters[7]: \\n\r\nCharacters aren't the best characters possible, but they also aren't the worst characters. You can see the different type of \"Moe\" characters and its characteristics in the different characters. So, overall the characters of the anime aren't anything new and can be seen in other animes. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment[9]:\\n\r\nI greatly enjoyed the anime for what it was set out to do and also create an anime that fits the genres of  Action, Comedy, Ecchi, Romance, and harem. The genres for the anime are really the main points that anyone chooses to initially watch the anime, or any anime for that matter. It lives up to all of the genres its included in and also creates and enjoyable experience while doing so. The Ecchi genre is one of the main genres for the season and if you don't like ecchi for tip toes on the borderline of full nudity, then you wont like this. However with that said, if you like or are looking for and ecchi anime of that caliber then this anime is worth the watch. \\n\\n\r\nOverall[8]: \\n\r\nThe overall rating of the anime gets is a 8 out of 10, because even though the anime doesn't excel particularly in any aspect besides the enjoyment, the enjoyment category is the only one that really matters. If you don't like the anime, the best story or characters won't mean anything. It is because of the overall package and enjoyment that, at least I got out of the anime, the anime gets the sore it does.",

            "content": "Warning possible Spoilers\r\nSo continuing a series is always a difficult objective because depending on what you do you don't whether it'll get better or worse reception than the first series well luckily High School DxD does just as brilliantly as the first series.\r\nThe story continues with Issei as he continues on his quest to become the most powerful Harem King however with the arrival of new enemies and new girls life is about to get even more hectic for our main Protagonist.\r\nJust like the last series this series is also split up into two arcs, the first concentrates on Kiba and a plot by thecatholic church that has connections to Kiba's past along with the addition of two new characters Xenovia Quarta and Irina Shidou.\\n\r\nThe second half concentrates on the three races Devils, Angels and Fallen Angels wanting to make peace along with another character being introduced and it also has some infighting among the girls as their feelings for Issei increases.\\n\r\nNow I thought that giving Kiba some screentime was actually a good step because he was pretty much the least popular character of the group in the first series so finding out more about his character was actually pretty interesting and also dark too considering he had to go through a lot of pain to get where he was plus he wasn't the only one who suffered which left a huge amount of guilt on his soul.\\n\r\nThe series goes into more depth about the Angels and Fallen Angels this season too which also brings about the big plot twist that both God and Saturn died during the Great war between the three factions, not only that it goes into more background between the Red and White Dragons continuous battle for dominance which brings in Issei's new rival Vali Lucifer.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters certainly get a lot more development during this series as some backstories and history are revealed.\\n\r\nIssei continues to get stronger in this series and becomes more respected amongst his teammates and the Devil community as his raid on Risers mansion made his popularity go up.\\n\r\nRia's along with Asia and eventually Akeno start getting to the point of fighting over Issei which brings about infighting with the group, Ria's does seem a bit selfish during these fight since she want's Issei to herself it doesn't affect her character as a whole, but it's funny how Asia the girl with the less developed body is willing to share Issei with the others while Ria's the much better looking girl is jealous of their affection for Issei.\\n\r\nAkeno gets some development too as she is revealed to be a half human and half fallen angel, but this doesn't affect Issei's view of her because he cares for who she is rather than what she is making her affection grow for him.\\n\r\nThe new characters that are introduced certainly make an impact on the series, Xenovia Quarta is one of the users of the Excalibur swords and is at first a quiet, but serious member of the church even to the point where she was disgusted that Asia joined the Devils, but she herself joins Ria's house she becomes an incredibly likeable character since like Asia she doesn't really have much of an understanding of living a free life so her confusion to some things made her pretty cute sometimes, but she can be an amazing sword wielder in battle and shouldn't be underestimated.\\n\r\nIrina Shidou is another user of Excalibur and a member of the church, unlike Xenovia she is a very hyper, positive and has an even stronger faith to the church than Xenovia does, she actually has a history with Issei once being his childhood friend, but finding out he is a devil obviously makes her viewpoint of him change.\\n\r\nGasper Vladi is a new character introduced to Ria's team that is actually a vampire, but he yes he since he is a trap doesn't like the taste of blood which makes him very afraid of everyone around him, but thanks to Issei he starts to trust the others and becomes another powerful member of the group.\\n\r\nAzazel is the leader of the Fallen Angels, but unlike the others Issei has fought against he isn't evil just really douchey, but the kind of douchey that's really funny plus he actually gives some pretty good advice to Issei from time to time.\\n\r\nVali Lucifer is the occupant of the White Dragon and is Issei's new rival as they will have to fight each other until one is victorious as has happened before in the past with other dragon occupants, Vali is actually a very detached person and is always looking for a good fight which gives him little time for others.\\n\\n\r\nThe artstyle continues to be done very well much, new powers are shown and they can be either devastating or life saving depending on the power, plus they certainly went a little overboard with the intensity of the battle scenes with beams and flashes being sent everywhere it was definitely a sight to see.\\n\\n\r\nThe fanservice is done just as well as the last season, it mixes correctly with the serious scenes and the female characters introduced in this season weren't too bad either especially Xenovia who became an instant favourite for me and the comedy that was brought in because of the fanservice lead to even more funny moments like Issei being tackled multiple times at a swimming pool or surprising moments when the girls were trying to seduce him with either what they were wearing or just they nude bodies.\\n\\n\r\nThe action definitely was done better this season with the battles feeling a lot bigger and more hectic there were still elements of strategy from the first season, but with the amount of powerful objects being introduced it made the room for strategy a lot less, however the fighting scenes were still very entertaining to watch.\\n\\n\r\nOverall the second season continued to do justice for the DxD franchise and it was just as fun and entertaining as the first season.",

For me, I found the fan service in the High School DXD is absurd, however that's what I love about it. Every episode of both of the seasons I've watched so far have never failed to make me laugh, hence my high rating of the franchise.\r\nCompared to the first season, High School DXD New had a bit more of a pronounced and solid storyline. Though it could be considered a bit clich\u00e9 with the holy swords, it doesreign back in the importance of the three way war between the angels, devils, and fallen angels (which the first season didn't really achieve).\\n\\n\r\nEverything was thought of carefully, balancing the story with the fan service effectively. Though it may not be quite there, this season in my mind does beat its predecessor. I look forward the High School DXD Born, and that Issei's dream of becoming a true Harem King will become a reality, seeing as he's so close now.",

            "content": "DxD returns for a second, action and fan-service packed season with a new engaging plot line. I'm going to assume that the reader has already gobbled up the first season and is back looking for more. If so, I'm happy to report that this is one of the best sequels I've seen in a while for the fan-service, harem-based ecchi genre. Looking for ecchi? Looking for action? Looking for girls who have semblances of personalities? Don't be fooled by the likes of other series such as Maken Ki, Maji Koi, or Dakara Boku wa, this is what you really want to watch.\r\nAnimation:\r\nDxD's revival includes afew animation touch ups including a slightly crisper look in addition to new characters. Expect a lot of scenes with a lot of emphasis on dark blues, purples, and magenta. The character styling is extremely similar to the first season and you can expect all major players to return. Looking back, tits aside, DxD really does have outstanding character designs.\\n\\n\r\nThis season feels almost as if it has even more action than the first. Now that character backgrounds are complete, the show focuses on quite a few fights. Expect a lot of magic attack spamming, divine circles everywhere, and, oh, ripped clothes everywhere; there are a lot of effects in this show, almost Valvrave levels of colored particles in many battles. The choreography isn't anything special but the battle progression keeps things interesting. I don't think there was as much death and blood as in the first season but I guess everyone is technically stronger at this point (foes included). Conveniently, defeated opponents simply \"vanish' into thin air rather than being reduced to a pile of bloody flesh. With all the additional action, don't think they've skimped on ecchi. They're giving you a two hit combo with this one, more action AND more ecchi. From the very first minute of the show all the way through the final climax, expect topless girls. Granted, Issei's power seems to be driven by his libido so it sort of makes sense. In summary, expect a lot of \"action\" and \"exposure\" to keep you amused and entertained throughout the show.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nInterestingly, they decided to go with two OPs and EDs for this season-long show. Unfortunately, this is one category in which I think the first season did a better job. Both the new OPs are lighter j-pop songs that don't feel like they reflect the show as much as the first season's OP. The series also has two EDs sung by the female cast, the second of which feels more playful and in line with what one would expect with this series. The BGM is supportive but, like the first season, completely forgettable.\\n\\n\r\nThe VA cast returns for another strong performance. There are too many good performances here to give shoutouts but the majority of the female cast in general are great and give ample personality to their respective characters. Likewise, you can expect a lot of Gurren Lagann-inspired shouting from the male cast.\\n\\n\r\nStory:\\n\r\nThe second season builds off the ending of the first season. Having saved Rias from an forced marriage, Issei is now even more the center of Rias's attention. Unfortunately, soon a confrontation between the three major powers (demons, angels, and fallen angels) forces Issei to hold off on his harem.\\n\\n\r\nLike the first season, we get two main arcs. The first arc focuses on Kiba's past and holy swords, which can severely damage demons with merely a slight cut. The second arc focuses on the mythical dragons contained within sacred gears like that of Issei. Each arc has its own rising action and climax though the second arc builds off of the first one to an extent.\\n\\n\r\nConsidering the wildly fiction-based story, I think the studio did a great job at making all the story elements accessible. While some of the antagonists are the standard, overused crazy power-hungry type, it doesn't feel too far off given that the protagonist is shallow and driven primarily by his lust for his female companions. Repeatedly hearing \"boost\" as a reaction to his drive to win battles so he can fondle boobs was quite entertaining. Few protagonists can proclaim such a simple, clear goal.\\n\\n\r\nWhile there is a clear conclusion for this action-packed season, it is pretty clear that the show is aiming for a third season. And if this season is any indication of what's to come, I'm looking forwards to it.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nThere isn't nearly as much development in this category as in the first season. This season focuses on Kiba primarily, in addition to setting the background for new characters that will probably play a big role in the next season. Issei does get a lot of quality time (and physical contact) with Rias and her female peerage members so you definitely get a fair amount of harem-play.\\n\\n\r\nIf there's anything to complain about, it's that some of the new characters feel kind of thrown in artificially as if it were a last minute decision to include them; they feel completely underutilized and underdeveloped. That aside, this series gives you a diverse and entertaining cast. And if you're tired of the nice, male lead archetype that has to rely on the girls to do everything for him, you'll definitely like Issei's \"just do it\" attitude.\\n\\n\r\nValue:\\n\r\nThis was a fun and entertaining watch that further develops DxD's story line and answers some of the questions I had at the end of the first season. Assuming you can deal with the partial nudity, this is probably as good a combo of likable characters, action, ecchi, and character development as you'll get from this genre. Highly recommended for fans of the first season.",

It might be weird for how much I love this anime but its a sad truth. This series to me was an anime that made me think \"God Damn, I wanna be in this anime so bad.\"\r\nStory: 10\r\nThe story actually continued on from Season 1 where they left off, and it continues on from there. They didn't stray from the parts from Season 1 where Ddraig warns Issei about \"The WhiteOne\", and that's really great. Also, we get to see the character developments of Kiba Yuuto as well as Akeno Himejima (though her development really pulls through in Season 3). Either way, the story was really well thought out.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 10\\n\r\nI can't get enough of these guys xD. There were never any dull moments even when we're going through Kiba's past. There was never a moment where I was watching and just thought that it was never interesting. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 9 \\n\r\nThe ending song \"Lovely Devils\" Catchy as hell. Enough said.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10\\n\r\nLike I said, I love this series xD. Its one of those ecchi series where the plot just doesn't include Tits over everything. Well, in Issei's mind, yes but, it still didn't stray from the plot.\\n\\n\r\nI have a lot of high hopes for this series. I really do. From the Anime to the Light Novels, its just very enjoyable. Season 3, even though I already spoiled it myself xD Im looking forward to it :)",

            "content": "The first season of High School DxD (a series based on the long running light novel of the same name) was more entertaining than it should have been. Its main character was an unlikeable pervert, every scene needed panties and boobs, and the comedy was pretty vulgar. But man was it funny. It contained great comedy, great action scenes, hot demon chicks, and enough plot to keep me interested. Going into the second season I assumed more of the same was in store, but this plot intensive (bear with me, please) season actually surpasses the first for the sheer reason the ideas presented within arecool and the comedy is still fresh.\\n\\n\r\nSecond seasons are usually where these type of anime lose their fan base, as well as whatever little bit of entertainment they had to offer. But High School DxD\u2019s second season is damn good for a number of reasons.\\n\\n\r\nFirst off, the story is so much better than it should be. The first six episodes focus on a fallen angel attempting to collect the pieces of Excalibur and club member Yuuto\u2019s vengeance on those who left him to die. And it very rarely strays from this story. The comedy of the series is there, but not as prevalent as it was in the first season. It\u2019s a character building arc that works pretty well and culminates in an entertaining final battle.\\n\\n\r\nThe last six episodes are about Issei\u2019s encounters with his new archrival as well as a peace meeting between the houses of Hell, the archangel Michael, and the fallen angel Azazel. Once again, the comedy remains pushed back quite a bit compared to the first season and the story shines through. I was in awe that a show like this could produce a story I wanted to see more of.\\n\\n\r\nDo take into account that I am a sucker for biblical urban fantasy kind of stuff.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter-wise, we\u2019re introduced to a few more members of Rias\u2019 house. Xenovia is pretty badass though I don\u2019t feel she was given enough time to actually have a character. All she wants is to have a child with Issei. Otherwise, she\u2019s good with hilariously oversized swords.\\n\\n\r\nAnd then there\u2019s Gasper, the prerequisite guy who looks like a little girl who dresses as a little girl. So despite the good story, the characters aren\u2019t much more than genre tropes.\\n\\n\r\nI didn\u2019t really give a lot of explanation on characters in my last review because I\u2019m kind of sick of explaining the same characters over and over in every review. I find Rias to be the exception to the tropes if only because she\u2019s a very strong female lead whose character isn\u2019t easily pinpointed. Akeno is sort of the same, but she\u2019s into the whole S and M thing and this season, she becomes Rias\u2019 romantic competitor.\\n\\n\r\nThis season, the characters remain pretty much the same though some pasts are revealed. Yuuto is about the only development we truly get. The main development comes with the harem as Akeno moves in on Issei and starts placing ranks on the girls. Once again proving that perverts always get what they want, and the anime world has never heard of sexual harassment charges.\\n\\n\r\nOther problems that DxD faces are a lackluster soundtrack with a lot of generic elements, character-wise, as I\u2019ve stated, it\u2019s not that stellar, and the way it presents the plot can be bad.\\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s what I consider \u201cPlot Device Syndrome\u201d, in which characters randomly bring up plot devices not for the benefit of pushing the plot forward, but for the benefit of the writer to have a reason to push the plot forward. Look at Gasper\u2019s entrance. He\u2019s been locked away in a room for the entire time Issei\u2019s been in the club yet nobody has even mentioned him. That\u2019s just\u2026dumb. Especially considering how much love he\u2019s given later on. Sure, Rias, you care so much about him you locked him away and never mentioned his name. I understand his power was unwieldy, but the least you can do is have people sit by the door and say hi to the kid.\\n\\n\r\nAnd bad presentation of the story is a given for this genre. Though that doesn\u2019t excuse it.\\n\\n\r\nI haven\u2019t really mentioned boobies yet because this season is not as boobylicious as the first. They\u2019re there, but the plot takes front stage.\\n\\n\r\nSo far (and I\u2019m sure this series is going to keep going, a third season is rumored to be in the works), DxD is my guiltiest of guilty pleasures. Hot chicks, good story, and lots and lots of jiggly boobs makes this the harem/ecchi story to beat all others, even Heaven\u2019s Lost Property.",

            "content": "Looks and sounds great, truly, but is marginally worse than the mediocre first season. From the story, to the characters, to the dialogue, it's a mess of inconsistencies if you can see past the bare breasts.\r\nPerhaps chief among the problems of this season is the haphazard way new characters are brought in and used. The introduction is one hinges entirely on coincidence (not unlike the nonsensical run-in with Asia), and conflicts with what we'd been led to believe about Issei's history. Another character is just an excuse to make gay jokes and make Rias look unnaturally inept. And a third new key character is justa product of lazy writing, which also happens to create a legit plothole based on previously established rules of the world. And, just as it was with the previous season, every antagonist is a one-dimensional trope whose motivations and actions make the worst James Bond villains look well written and thoughtful.\\n\\n\r\nMoving away from the individual characters, Christianity plays a larger role in this season than previously, but unfortunately it's made clear that the author knows next-to-nothing about different churches, what Christians believe on a basic level, or how they act and react when it comes to the faith. Matter of fact, until later in the novels, there are no indications that more than one denomination of Christianity even exists in Highschool DxD, and that instead everyone is under the same vague umbrella of \"The Church\". A twist that comes up could've been interesting enough, if it wasn't so poorly delivered and followed by reactions that make one wonder if the author's ever even met a religious person. Suffice it to say the author's only research seems to have been looking up mythological names and little else.\\n\\n\r\nUnarguably the second half, or second arc of the season, is the worst of all. A key part of the previous arc's grand and history-laden conflict is rendered nonsensical in a single afternoon. Further, characters are handed literal plot devices seemingly because the author couldn't think up anything better than just giving them \"just because\".\\n\\n\r\nWith writing like that, it's little surprise that, when it comes to dialogue, multiple characters slip into the same geek otaku-speak that should only be relegated to Issei. And if the criminal offender protagonist didn't endear himself to you in the first season, you're not going to like him any more in this one as he continues to be a mix of rude jerk and \"such a nice guy\" hero whose stilted, childlike words make girls' hearts flutter and loins moisten.\\n\\n\r\nAll that said, the artwork and animation are still very nice to look at, the music is intensely catchy, and there's no complaints to made of the voice work. If you took the action on its own, disregarding how new powers sprout up out of convenient nowhere, that's also a reasonable high point. The nudity is of course ridiculously gratuitous, but that's intentional and ought not be held against it. It's just a crying shame about the writing. Do yourself a favor: Stop here and proceed no further if you care about a sensible story and characters.",

So i'm writing this review to show you the aspect of this anime and why it's so amazing.\r\nFirst of all about the storyline. When i found this anime and saw the areas that is covering i was like \" Another ecchi anime with a lot of fan service nothing more\" \r\nCOMPLETLY WRONG! I'll admit that it has many characteristics of Fan service, but the storyline is so beautifull and it is expanding so perfect that can blow ur mind away. The plus fanservice comedy is there to give a nice touch to the storyline.\\n\\n\r\nSecond The Art used to the anime. Based to whatever i have saw from 2013 animes it's pretty good. All the characters were created with care and a divine touch to succed their purpose. Everyone of them has his own secret, his own beauty.\\n\\n\r\nThird the sound. Although the music covers didn't seem so special they were pretty nice and of  course perfectly matched to the anime. They weren't SUPER SUPER but they were simply nice.\\n\\n\\n\r\nAbout characters: An OUTSTANDING job from the creator, the second anime i  have seen those 2 years i'm watching anime and i'm immpressed from the connection between all of them and the personal touches on each. I'll simply say \" Characters with GLAMOUR\".\\n\\n\r\nAs far for the enjoyment i woud say only just see that Divine creation from the anime production and you won't waste your time. It worth every minute and more. Funny-Humoristic - Beautifull - Romantic - Erotic (with a good way ofc).\\n\\n\\n\r\nLast but not least i'm giving to this anime 10 of 10 and if could i would say 11 of 10, cause it earned with his beauty. Let's hope that it wil continue to give us in future months-year more precious moments of it's glamour!\\n\\n\r\n*I'm honored writing this review for one of the best anime of 2013!\\n\\n\r\nP.S I double checked the review for any Grammar mistakes i apologize and i ask for your understanding!",

            "content": "If you have seen the first season \"High School DxD,\" no \"New\", then you pretty much know what you are in for.  If you haven't then you are surprisingly not that lost either.  It explains the situation well enough in the first episode or with few lines of dialogue later on.  Not a full explanation, but a good enough one.\r\nStory 5/10.  Like the first season it follows a real basic story line.  Also as in the first season, it follows well enough then halfway through the season it drops whatever the story is then switches to something completely new.However, unlike the first season, this tries to take itself much more serious.  It kind of turned me off at one point and it did make for a lot more off humor.  It did make for bad jokes and I can't believe they went there moments, and there are a lot of those moments.  That being said it doesn't focuses as much to the story as the first season but more on the characters.  When it does focuses on the story is when it takes itself more serious.  But the story is a simple one.\\n\\n\r\nArt 8/10.  I think because they added a lot more to the story they were able to bring new lore or items they were able to go more detail with its art.  This anime has holy, demonic, and other fantasy theme items; they were able to give it special detail with it.  It helps make everything feel different for whatever reason it was being used.  Oh it also adds great detail to the boobs, boobs, boobs, boobs, woman rear ends, and more boobs.  However, that is to be expected in an ecchi anime.\\n\\n\r\nSound 5/10.  I almost didn't notice it but the music here isn't story driven but character driven.  It mainly follows the main protagonist feelings or emotions.  If Issei is trying to be funny, it adds a bit of a comedic beat to it.  If he is upset or sad the music takes a dramatic tone to it.  If he is feeling epic or action packed it takes a strong epic tone to it.  And if someone else says \"you\u2019re an idiot\" or breaks whatever he is feeling, the music just stops.  Also it doesn't use anything new; when you get to episode 3 you heard all that they have.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters 8/10.  Now this is what the show really tries to do.  Unlike the first season where it focuses on the main character and 2 supporting characters, this time it mainly focuses on the entire cast.  And I personally liked it.  We do find out more about everyone's past and they progress themselves in a meaningful way.  You can see their reasoning behind their actions, you can see why what they are feeling, and I really liked it.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 7/10.  It isn't the worst squeal there is, and I didn't like how they tried so hard to make the story a serious one, but I did like the art detail and characters of this show.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 7/10.  If you have seen the first season, you might enjoy this squeal.  If you haven't, you are still able to watch without being that lost as to what is happening and points for that at least.",

            "content": "This is a review for the entire series and not just this season. \r\nFirst, I would like to say that I am a straight girl who has enjoyed immensely from time to time some ecchi and harem series, like Rosario To Vampire, Highschool of The Dead, and B Gata H Kei.\r\nI absolutely hated this series. \r\nHarem as a genre is not exactly what you would call \"guarantee of quality\" but as it happens with all the genres, no matter what type of story you want to tell, its fine as long as you manage to tell it in a way that's decent and enjoyable. \r\nHighSchool DxD is the prime example of everything wrong with the harem genre, mashed up together and coming at you ten times worse than usual. It doesn't matter how many interesting ideas you have, or if you manage to write and present them in a way that will keep your viewer's interest, when your primary objective is the viewer's titillation. The most you will get out of this is an enraged viewer who will feel betrayed for actually expecting something out of you, because they know it's possible, but they never get anything worthwhile back. High School DxD is an interesting series, but it never manages to reward you for the interest it gets from you. Well, unless you are into soft porn and have a weird kink for this instead of hentai.\\n\\n\r\nThe reason for this is that, well, the character writing is simply abysmal. There is a genuinely interesting world to explore here, and High School DxD tries to persuade us of this while showing us nipples all around. Each time the characters are talking about something serious, or even when the stakes are high during a big fight, nipples will pop up in no time. There was even a scene where boobs were holding a conversation during a fight. Not the girls. Their boobs. This maybe, possibly, I guess could have been something resembling funny, but this series does not know how humor works. In Japanese comedy, we often see the boke/tsukkomi combo. High School DxD tries to be the fool (aka boke) all around but there is no tsukkomi or a punchline of any kind to support it. The MC goes around being so perverted that normal girls wouldn't even get near him, but the rest of the cast just sighs it away like he's just a troublesome child they still take pride in.  \\n\\n\r\nAnother very troublesome aspect is that this series apparently does not know what constitutes a sexual assault. Even worse, it doesn't seem to think that men can get sexually assaulted, especially if the attacker is an attractive female. Now, before you burn me at the stake for trying to sound \"politically correct\" or whatever, just think of this: If the MC was female, and this harem was a reverse harem of men, and they did to her exactly the same things the girls in High School DxD do to the MC... how would it look like to you then? I know that some people have a kink for that stuff, but the bad thing is catering to those people probably wasn't the intention here.\\n\\n\r\nEssentially, this is what High School DxD is all about: Kinks. It's a shame for the world and the plot writing that keeps it interesting. The character writing is abhorring. The girls all fall for the MC for exactly the same reason, (he likes them as they are!) and the main girl (Rias) is as bland as it goes, so that each viewer can imagine her being what he wants her the most to be.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, if you're a guy and you're into soft porn, High School DxD is the anime for you. If you are a girl... stay away from this. As far, far away from this as possible. Trust me, no matter how much it seems like there might be something here, all you'll find is boobs and forced, stupid \"romance\" that makes no sense. And not even that. In my list I gave it a 7/10 because I did reach the end without such wrecked nerves as I expected, but trying to be as much objective as I can here, a 5/10 is the best overall I can do.",
