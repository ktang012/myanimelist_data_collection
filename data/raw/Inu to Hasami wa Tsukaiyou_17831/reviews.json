            "content": "Dear Japan: \r\nIt seems almost every season, there\u2019s one of those shows from your country that plays on fetishes or a rather bizarre sequence in the anime world. This time, it involves a girl and its\u2026.dog. Then, it decides for some odd reason to add the concept of scissors to the mix because we know it\u2019s one of the dangerous gadgets suitable for \u201cpunishment\u201d. As for the punishment itself, the receiving end is none other than our dog of the series, Kazuhito Harumi.\r\nInu to Hasami wa Tsukaiyo (also known as Dogs & Scissors) is an animated series based off the light novel of the samename written by Shunsuke Sarai. For a series about books though, this show sure likes to play around its other angles. So now begins the story of a dog and its master. (one sadistic if I might even add)\\n\\n\r\nThe show\u2019s delivery essentially begins with its accurate delivery and promise. In fact, there\u2019s a feeling of seriousness in the beginning. Our main male protagonist Kazuhito (a bookworm) is eager to read books and novels. As a fan of Shinobu Akiyama's works, he is determined to get the inside scoop of those words written in those text. But then one faithful day, the unthinkable happened. To be honest, if you thought your day was bad, Kazuhito\u2019s day couldn\u2019t get any worse because of what happens next. He becomes something he never thought he\u2019d be and hence begins this strange tale.\\n\\n\r\nAs mentioned before, the show takes itself seriously at first. The scene involving Kazuhito and his fate is depicted as brutal and violent with even blood added in the mix. The aftermath however turns out to be much more humorous when we find out that the woman Kazuhito gets acquainted with adapts a sadistic nature to her personality. Dressed in black clad clothing and armed with a deadly pair of scissors, Kirhime Natsuno is a woman that delivers the punishment to our not-so-lucky protagonist. Because of the punishment he receives, the show itself leans towards borderline animal abuse at many stances. Although it seems to be humorous at many cases, the series itself becomes intolerable after many of those repetitive moments. It doesn\u2019t help by the fact that the dog also both intentionally and unintellionally provoke Kirihime at many occasion that results in those punishments. \\n\\n\r\nAs far as the plot goes, the series sticks with its premise at first. In fact, it takes its turns early on to finding out the culprit responding for Kazuhito\u2019s fate but more importantly to stick with its original plot. However, the series later on becomes a cluster of absurd comedy that makes little sense or no progression to the story at all. \\n\\n\r\nThe story itself also consists of many characters although the majority of the cast consists of female characters of different nature. There\u2019s a masochist, an idol, a maid, and even a yandere. These characters all connects to the tale of the sadist and the dog in some way although mostly depicted as complete nonsense. For instance, the idol (aka the Shining Girl) of the series known as Maxi Akizuki plays little role besides trying to take the spotlight while mostly failing to do so. Then, there\u2019s even a yandere character that clashes against Kirihime in almost borderline incest moments. Other characters later on in the series also presents absurd comedy in different nature related to the concept of competitions. \\n\\n\r\nThe relationship between Kazuhito and Kirihime is one of the more dynamic aspects of the series. Almost every episode focuses on them although the development between the duo is quite sour and sometimes way out of line. For the most part, Kirihime abuses Kazuhito at almost any time when she feels something doesn\u2019t go according to her way or when the latter says something that shouldn\u2019t of been said. However, if we look carefully, there\u2019s also cases where Kirihime does treasure Kazuhito and vice versa. Even more so, Kirihime seems to get jealous at times for the dog and acts on those frustrations to carry out her punishments. As for Kazuhito himself, there\u2019s a lot of humor revolving around his character with his new life as the dog. He doesn\u2019t go out to hunt or guard the house but instead still follows on his goals to read books. Even as a dog, his determination seems to become avid as ever.\\n\\n\r\nAs noted by its absurd comedy genre, this show doesn\u2019t loosen that style any bit at all. The comedy of this show is ridiculous, as in ridiculously bad. Kirihime\u2019s scissors is just one primary example as a weapon that\u2019s out of this world with inhuman capabilities. Kirihime herself often acts like the boss but she shows insecurity of herself especially in regards to her female body structure. This gag is made fun of nearly every episode because of her small breast size. (assumingly A-Cup). It doesn\u2019t stop there though because her physical nature is made fun of that result in undesired consequences for Kazuhito. This repetitive running gag feels almost like an endless loop at many occasions with the misunderstandings. Later on, a yandere type character also enters the story that formulates a triangle which spells out even more misunderstandings. There\u2019s case of fan services from here and there although it doesn\u2019t fall into the ecchi category. What it does fall under though is the seemingly endless and repetitive gags ranging from masochism to sadism to dog abuse. \\n\\n\r\nThere\u2019s some action as well but it\u2019s mostly carried out in a comical fashion. The way the characters move and fight makes it clear at first but the transformations and execution is painful to watch. It tries to follow its themes involving the seven deadly sins as well but most of this is downplayed as nothing more than a textbook of mistakes. At one point, I question myself why I watch this show. Perhaps it might be the small chance of a decent mystery as briefly shown in the beginning of the show but this later wavers down with nothing more than nonsense once again.  \\n\\n\r\nArtwork wise, the term generic is what comes to my mind at first glance. Even the dog is portrayed as being generic with its design. He doesn\u2019t look dangerous at all but instead of someone of frail nature. On the other hand, Kirihime\u2019s design does look a tad noticeable with her black clad outfit. Her scarlet eyes and long black hair gives her a more dangerous look. On other hand though, idol characters, maids, and yanderes are designed in this show exactly what you might expect. \\n\\n\r\nThe music aspect of this show is almost a joke like the show itself. The OP song \"Wan Wan Wan Wan N_1!!\" by Inu Musume Club is portrayed as comedy and does its job as such with its sequences. In the song, we see characters dancing while doing animal movements complete with some flashy outfits. The dog though? He\u2019s there in the background usually suffering the abuse. The ED song doesn\u2019t do any better either with bits of fan service and a similar style of its comedy genre. The OST is also hardly noticeable although we do see some of the more dramatic moments carried out in a serious fashion. Finally, I didn\u2019t feel like any of the VA portrayed their roles in an outstanding way. The only noticable voice though might be the voice of Kazuhito when he was once human. If we notice carefully, we never get to see his true face. In other words, the voice of his character when he was human gives off a sense of realism in this ridiculous comedy of nonsense.\\n\\n\r\nFor a comedy series, this show sure likes to play around with the genre; a bit too much perhaps. At many points, it feels like if you\u2019re watching not just a parody but a series crafted out of nonsense. By nonsense, I mean nonsense as in making no sense at all while defying the laws of a decent story. The story itself also had a strong promise at first but breaks itself apart with its random gags and repetitiveness. In short, this show is one of those anime series where it tries to be \u201cso bad, it\u2019s good\u201d. However, it just ends up with the first part as in \u2018bad\u2019. I know my expectations might be a bit high but being bad sometimes should have its limits.\\n\\n\r\nSincerely, a disappointed viewer.",

            "content": "Do you understand what is comedy?  Do you really value it? I am very sure you don't, not until you watch Dogs and Scissors. It is a series that will make you appreciate jokes, more than ever, because its pathetic, dreadful, and fan-service accompanied \"comedic\" plot will make you appreciate the math joke that you thought was stupid. \r\nThe plot is simple..you can read the summary anywhere, so I am not going to detail that. But yes, this is an extreme story of books..where you either write or die..you read or die. That was the opening sentence of the anime. Quite interesting right? Yeah,I wish it was like that. Not until you pass episode 2, when you will suddenly realize the deep, thoughtful ways of this anime, thoughtful ways of putting fan-service. This anime is a collection of \"weird\" otaku fetish: sadistic tsundere, extremely attached younger sister, voluptuous masochist, and most importantly, a complete harem of girls. Not to mention the \"flat-chest\" jokes, \"those\" dialogues....and whatever a loner otaku dreams to see. \\n\\n\r\nAt first it begins decently, guy loves books, he dies, and gets reincarnated as a dog to become the pet of his favorite author. And then starts the non-stop loop of \"flat-chested\" jokes, sadistic scissor scenes, younger sister pleading \"Kazu-nii\", girls appearing to satisfy harems and ends with hot-spring bath and beach scene near the ending of the anime. This anime, without a doubt, will satisfy if you're into \"these\" things. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters are simple. Protagonist is a straight-man (or dog) of the series, who gives commentary to every line spoken. He loves book more than anything. He is mostly in his dog form. The female lead (the scissor) is a 20 year old sadistic, flat-chested (where the jokes come from), tsundere and best-selling author, who although highly intelligent, limits her insults to \"perverted dog\" \"ero dog\" \"idiot\" and \"mongrel\"....yes, very intelligent insults she uses. \\n\\n\r\nSide characters include overly-attached imouto; a bookstore girl the protagonist loves;her younger sister who likes to \"play\" with the protagonist; a voluptuous and masochistic book editor; a maid who is overly attached to her mistress; a \"shining\" idol who is supported by overly attached men in black; and the girl who is always apologizing...and for comic relief afro guy, muscle men and whatever the anime industry needs to create comedy. \\n\\n\r\nSound tracks are average. Opening song, you know those songs where the singer changes pitches as she sings..with hyperactive attitude? Ending is rather decent, after first ten seconds. And overall, very decent, low-average music. \\n\\n\r\nArt. Average 2013 art. Animation is decent, the fight scenes are alright. It' just nothing to look forward to. And it's sad how every character must have colorful eyes and hair, certain types of figure and stereotypical appearance.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I began this anime because of how frequently it was recommended. This anime was made TO satisfy the audience, especially the guy stuck in his room 24/7. There are plot holes everywhere, non-sense characters and low average art and animation. It just takes pathetic on different level. I didn't enjoy it. \\n\\n\r\nRecommended only if you're interested in \"those\" matters I mentioned, or just want to watch every anime of the season. Otherwise, just save your time on something better. Seriously, I cried realizing the depth anime reached these days.",

            "content": "\u201cJapan never fails to surprise me with their anime\u201d\r\nAnime, without we realize has turned us into some people who likes weird things or even taboo in some society. We are getting used and even being desensitisized with japanese weird taste, Like ecchi that basically soft porn, incest that mostly all people in the world against it, and even turn us into a lolicon. Now, they even will make us turn into more weirder with the love between an animal and a human. Prepare for this?\r\nSTORY (4/10) - Inu to Hasami is basically your generic of romance comedy anime with some harem in it. The premiseof the story can be seen in MAL page. But its like what its said, its about a highschool boy who is being killed when he tried to save a girl and he\u2019s being resurrected as a dog. Now, he\u2019s turned into a pet for a girl that he saves before. Summary, this anime will be focussing on interaction between Kazuhito (the dog) and his master (Kirihime). The interaction that happen is not always about the romantic but also the funny. Usually, the jokes is about when Kirihime abusing her dog.FYI, she is sadistic and the punchline jokes that Kazuhito always do is pretty much makes the viewers at least gets smile or even laugh, though sometimes it isn\u2019t funny at all.\\n\\n\r\nIf you think the premise are absurd enough, then you\u2019re surely surprise what will you find in this anime. In Inu to Hasami, you will find many absurd things that even you wouldnt think before. From absurd battle, wracky story, and furthermore, nonsense comedy. Its feel like you put many things into one box. But aside from that, Inu to Hasami is pretty easy to follow. Even the story is absurd but atleast you will understand about what this anime about. Though, its still absurd. SO absurd.\\n\\n\r\nAside from all that aspects, Inu to Hasami is pretty enjoyable anime to watch despite of how absurd this anime is. The jokes is literally the one that keeps me still watching it until the end. Of course, there is sometimes that even the jokes isnt funny at all or even makes you wanna punch the character.\\n\\n\r\nART (8/10) \u2013 Aside from the absurd story, the art in this anime pretty much well made and the reason why i still keep watching it until the end.  The art is so vivid, colorful and the background itself is pretty detailed. Like in Kirihime\u2019s room, the way this anime draws the bookshelf within the books looks so realistic. Moreover, the colorful art makes this anime is more enchanting and didnt make our eyes being tired from watching it. Sometimes they using comical style, especially when it comes to punchline jokes from the dog aka Kazuhito. The art in the battle scenes are also quite good, The art drastically changes if the battle scenes were appear.From the colorful art they turned into more darker, the effects also is quite stunning and increasing the atmosphere of \u201cbattle feels\u201d. But, from the drastically itself it can makes the viewers feel uneasy, though its great they can change the art style and madely well done. but it makes the art itself didnt consistent. However, the art is stil great.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND (6/10) \u2013 First from the soundtrack, the opening song of this anime \u201cWan Wan Wan Wan\u201d by Inu Musume Club. This song is like the story itself, its absurd and didnt really catchy.  I always skip the song anyway, since the song is silly and not really attractive. But aside from my egoistical perspective, this song is suitable with the anime itself and really present the anime itself. But aside from non-catchy-music, The video music in the opening itself is quite funny and again, using comical fashion and some parody jokes this video is funny on its own way, even in the openin music video the dog is still get abused.Though the song is still bad..\\n\\n\r\nFor the voice, the seiyuu in this anime is great. I mean, they really suitable with their own roles and characters personality. Like Yayoi that being voiced by Hiromi Agarashi, Hiromi Agarashi is really suitable for child role since her voice is childish and have cute tunes. Her voice is totally makes Yayoi is so loveable and makes you wanna hug her. But not just Yayoi, all the seiyuus is  also did their job very well, though sometimes the voice feels seems off.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER (6/10) \u2013 First of all, i must say all the characters in this anime is unique. Its great to have so many unique person in one story. Great and unique characters are the key for making the story more interesting. But in this anime, they waste it all. Since this \u201call unique characters\u201d are like the side dish. Well, i know this anime is focussing on those weird couples but still...  Those characters beside Kazuhito and Kirihime, its just like a figure. They didnt have any space for developments. \\n\\n\r\nFor Kazuhito, he is a bookworm guy who loves book than anything in this world and like any MC in another harem that usually doesnt really care about their harem and also, dense. For Kirihime, she is a famous writer that being adored by Kazuhito and she is Kazuhito\u2019s master. Kirihime is also asadistic girl that usually abuse Kazuhito. But despite of all that abuse, she also have a dere personality and quite caring especially if its about Kazuhito. Despite of all that, this formula is pretty common in romance comedy harem today. Dense main character while the heroine falling in love with him. Though the one that makes this anime is different is your main character is....... a dog.\\n\\n\r\nCONCLUSION (6/10)\\n\r\nFunny things about this anime is no matter how absurd this show was, but its still watchable. Though we still didnt used to see a Love between a dog and a girl is pretty hard to been accepted, but if you like beastility of course this isnt a problem. Anyway, since this is fantasy we can forget about the taboo and anything else and i find this anime is entertaining and pretty nice anime to spend time with, though dont get your hopes too high in this anime.\\n",

            "content": "A dog as a protagonist?! Is what my reaction was when I first saw Inu to Hasami. And it made me think of how would the story revolve around that dog. So I tried watching it.\r\nI've never watched a series where an animal gets the main stage, so this will be the first one.\r\nSo the story revolves around Harumi Kazuhito, a bookworm. He's a die hard fan of Akiyama Shinobu's books. One day he got into a cafe which was about to be robbed by a guy who didn't make any sense later in the story. The robber took out his gun and pointed itat the bartender. After seeing Kazuhito and another customer across Kazuhito's table, he told them to stand up. Kazuhito willingly follows what the robber said. While the girl across him didn't even flinch. The robber points his gun at the girl, ready to shoot. Kazuhito then interfered, and got shot in the head. Which resulted in him dying(duuh?). He's desire to read Akiyama's books didn't let him die, instead, he came back to life. Only its in a body of a dog. And that's where his story starts. Well, there were quite a few cliche things to watch out in into it, but fear not! Since its bearable and not that deep too. I think its because they wanted to stick on the comedy part more. No deep meaning, just your average comical series.\\n\\n\r\nIt seems that every character in inu to hasami has serious mental problems, well I don't mean it in a bad way, since they were quite funny most of the time. And if you're looking for a cute dog, you definitely have to watch this. I mean, how often do you find a series which a cute miniature dachshund always hangs around. As if it that wasn't cute.\\n\\n\r\nBoth opening and ending theme were upbeat, complimenting on how comical the story is.\\n\\n\r\nI believe that inu to hasami is a good series in its own way, but I don't think it'll be bigger than what it has achieved by now. And it'll make me very happy to know if they decide to make another season. Since the amount of detail in the first one wasn't that good. So a lot of question will pop right into your head after watching it. But this series is a good watch, a comical series which doesn't have any deep story into it. Doesn't make you think how the plot will develop into. Just your average comedy series. Sometimes you don't need complicated whatso-shitty-complicated plot to be a fair series. There's not much to point out on Inu to Hasami so I'll end my BS here.\\n\\n\r\n(Overall Score : 8)",

            "content": "Snips, snails, and puppy dog tails\r\nThere are many anime shows out there. Some are serious, some are goofy, and some are both. Other shows enjoy dishing out ecchi, and then taking it away because it was all a trap to begin with (God, there's a lot of those). However eventually there is a show that is just really different. Bizarre. Plain weird. And just absurd. That show is Dog & Scissors.\r\nIt starts off simple enough as any other anime. It has a plot, and a reason. However those two get resolved pretty quickly, and then the show goes into Simpson-esc sitcom mode. Mostly because thisshow creates a mini universe type of feel. From a scarf wearing steroid user who loves to talk about muscles while jogging, all the way to an OCD pop model who loves to say \"SHINNY!\" every 2 seconds. There are a lot of weirdos to gawk at, at almost every corner here. The characters are mostly strange. Natsuno Kirihime is the most well rounded one here since she conveys more emotion than everybody else (Happy, sad, being evil, being crazy, being drunk, etc.). She does torture her dog (Kazuhito), however it is not brutal torture where she grabs her scissors, and digs into the dog (A sigh of relief for PETA right there). She just cuts his hair into weird shapes, occasionally threatens him, and calls him names. She has a good reason though. He's literally asking for it since Kazuhito resorts to making fun of her body all the time.\\n\\n\r\nMusic in this show is pretty generic, but it gets the job done. The opening theme is pretty fun to watch. And so is the ending theme. The singing is not bad. However the instrumental part is the reason why it does not sound so special. \\n\\n\r\nThe designs of the show are not bad at all. The eyes of all of the characters (Mostly the female ones) actually have a unique look to their irises, and eyelashes. Colors are spread around in the show giving off a nice palette. The backgrounds are standard anime protocol (Schools, cities, parks). However, back to the character design. A whole lot of them have a bit of a twist to the usual anime stereotypes (Mostly Maxi does, the \"SHINNY!\" pop idol mentioned earlier). And the animation is decent enough for an anime.\\n\\n\r\nOn A Personal Note: This show is pretty unpopular. I understand why. I mean pretend that someone went into a restaurant, read off the menu about a chocolate cake with garlic in it being sold (With the ingredient \"garlic\" written everywhere). Then that someone ate the whole cake, and then acts shocked, and then shouts \"Why does this have garlic in it!?\" at everybody. Then another guy is there at the same place, at the same time, and that person ate the same cake. And then that other guy loved it because it had garlic like promised. That is how I feel about this show. Im the guy that loved the garlic chocolate cake. Before I even started watching this show (And Im not being all high, and mighty here), but I knew from the get go because of the description what I was going to get. And that's what I got. And I liked it. The show is not bad. Give it a chance. Expect it to be absurd. \\n\\n\r\nIt's not like the show is promising the moon. It's promising a crazy girl who has scissors, and a talking dog going off on weird adventures. And it delivers.",

            "content": "This is a story about books.\r\nDog & Scissors starts somewhat promising on its own terms. Nowadays you don't happen to see a story like this unfold and there might be a good reason for this, because it's condemned to be an unsuccessful attempt at creating something unique.\r\nThere's acutally a story given to this series. The writer Akiyama Shinobu's trying to finish the last book of the collection of The Seven Deadly Sins. On the other hand the bookworm Kazuhito has a passion for every book and writer in the world, especially for Shinobu and he wants to read this last book badly. So badly, thatthe day he dies in a robbery where he protects a woman, he doesn't accept death and is resurrected as a dachshund dog. After coincidences occur he happens to live together with his favourite writer. The problem of the plot is that it's not going anywhere from that point on. Strange things happen and are resolved even stranger. The promise of an absurd and random comedy wasn't exaggerated, but it's just too random.\\n\\n\r\nThe first three episodes always introduce new things and aspects. Jokes, characters and a random diversion of the story. After this the anime goes on repeat and all these things don't change a lot. This might feel like an infinite loop of repetition that finishes after 12 episodes. So the only thing to expect in the next episode is how they repeated old jokes again.\\n\\n\r\nRarely the animation feels a little bit off, but overall the quality's good and fluent. At times there're even references to other animes and they're built in pretty well. The spectrum embraces cute illustrations with serious animation. Nothing more to say about the art here.\\n\\n\r\nEven less to say about the sound. The best thing about this anime is Marina Inoue and her performance, even though it's often forced at times that doesn't justify she's bad. She's awesome and a pleasure to hear. The OP song might be sinister, but I like to hear it and it's one of my favourites this season. Altogether the sound in the show's nothing special, though.\\n\\n\r\nThe shiniest aspects of Dog & Scissors are the characters and there're quite a few really singular personalities. But just because an anime has distinguishable characters won't make them any good or even likeable. So Akiyama Shinobu is revealed as Kirihime Natsuno, a 20 year old best selling author who lives alone and has a foible to torture other people with her scissors. Kazuhito ends up as a dog living in her apartment and even though he's a dog Natsume can read his mind. Why ? Because speaking dogs are terrifying, but however. There's about none character development ongoing and everyone seems to finish off as they were in the beginning. At last there's a really strange love story happening between them. I want to say see for yourself, but really don't.\\n\\n\r\nFrom episode to episode more characters join the story of those two. They truly differ as everyone has an unique personality, but most of this personality stays the same for everyone and is always the same in every single episode. It's like noone even wanted to give them proper development and thought this was a good idea. It was not. It's tremendously bad.\\n\\n\r\nYou can compare the enjoyment of this anime to your enjoyment of eating really hot wasabi. It's a really small pleasure to watch this weekly in a season, but if I imagine to watch more than one episode at a time I'd rather take the wasabi. This story was about books, but after watching it I don't feel any smarter or more educated about books. It's the opposite. I feel like I've forgotten books I read because of the plain stupidity. If you enjoy bad repetitive jokes, strange and awkward characters, a story with no plot and/or love between humans and dogs this might be something to watch for you. \\n\\n\r\nOverall Dog & Scissors's a bad example of a comedy in the big ocean of comedies. The strangest thing about it is the episodic structure like you find it in regular shows, but with an attempt to bring an ongoing story in it. So it's an episodic non-episodic anime and this could be good in a parallel universe where the issues of the story happen to be solved or revealed. In this one they aren't and there's a lot more better animes than this. Go watch them and don't bother with this failed experiment. If you already watched everything, you should rewatch Ginga Eiyuu Densetsu. Still better than watching a grown woman wanting the children of a dachshund dog.",

Though the plot is always focus on them the comedy genre did function wellwith the two, however it becomes more of drag when the anime always focuses on their misadventures especially when Baxter (Kazuhito) is constantly struggling to not get into Kirihime's bad side, there are a lot characters whom where seemly being ignored and would have added more body to this anime's story plot.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacter- poor 3, awooooo!\\n\\n\r\nI'm very much disgusted that Maxie Akizuki, SHINNNIG! and Himehagi Momiji's role were very limited, especially Maxie since her character would have added  more to this anime's comedy content that just limit her to a comic relief as for Himehagi Momiji , is also disgusted that she is just limited to a cameo role, also there is Afro and those muscle bums who would have contributed more to this anime's comedy. I really feel bad that studio Gonzo have to limit the mentioned characters a comic bit relief.\\n\\n\r\nArt, sound, enjoyment, overall- good 7 SHINNING!!!!\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\\n\r\nI like the way that every character's here where illustrated, there is that certain sexiness without the ecchi and each of the character's here are perfectly designs to match each of the character's characteristic, though I'm a bit disappointed that Kazuhito as a human wasn't given a face and instead the illustrator focus more the male character's dog designed (woof!) \\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\\n\r\nI like the way that Kirihime was played by Maria Inoue since she really did matched up as this sadistic girl that no man can mess with, also I like it that Kazuhito's VA played him as this pussy dog who is seemly afraid of what will his master, Kirihime will do next. Also, I like both the opening and the closing theme. But I'm a bit disappointed that Himehagi Momiji was never given any speaking lines.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\\n\r\nThough this anime may have some short comings, I'd say that it was still SHINNING to be enjoyed.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: \\n\\n\r\nWell, since there are indications of a possible season 2, I'm gonna leave this part with just one remark......SHINNING!!!!!!!",

Plus overall craziness with a depressing girl , masochistic manager and an over the top blonde girl showing up here and there not to talk about some samurai maid running wild making the dogs life even more crazy...\r\nAnd to top it up many random encounters , challenges, embarrassing moments and everything that romance comedy needs.\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt 8: I am quite adaptive when it comes to art in animes and this one got that fantasy touch with lights here and there , magic circles here or there , at some point ninja effects like Speed moving or at times dark alleys , night times and everything just looked nice.\\n\\n\r\nSound 8: I don't know i just don't care much for sounds in anime as long as the voicing is done good in which cases its done good most of the time and for this one the voices fit the characters and that is all i need.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters 9: Huge variety: Very young and enthusiastic , teens , older people , even animals...\\n\r\nEach got their own special skills like being an super masochist or depressed to the point of wanting to die and such.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 9: I laughed and laughed and said WTF so many times over and over because that kind of love story was something i couldn't watch seriously!\\n\\n\r\nOverall 8: I give it 8 because its just a random comedy and i think comedy animes should never go over 8...",

Randomness\r\n*Art/Sound* - Art is ok. Meh on the ED. OP is decent. Although don't expect me to go out of my way to get the songs on my iPhone/iPod Music anytime soon.\r\n*Characters* - Ugh... If it weren't for some of the character designs, I highly doubt these bland characters would have a chance in hell to stand out at all.\r\n99% of they do gets repetitive BEYOND BELIEF! \r\nAnd even the majority side characters have no importance or any level of, which even questions why they even deserve to be in the Opening Sequence of the show.\\n\\n\r\nTBH, the ONLY character I was interested in was Sachi Moribe - The maid that was singing and is very loyal to her mistress. Anytime she was on the scene, I actually wanted to know more about her, which unfortunately never happens...\\n\r\nAnd even Natsuno I cared about a little. The never-ending running gag of her having small breasts gets on my nerves. Because it's supposed to be a comedy bit even though its a constant dart to her character for no apparent reason at all. (FYI, her voice actor deserves way better than this. Especially since she did Yoko from Gurren Lagann...)\\n\\n\r\n*Enjoyment* - I find it to be offensively lazy, and offensively cliche', It feels like there's nothing that feels like I shouldn't forced myself to complete the series and dropped it earlier.\\n\\n\r\nI even feel like I'm taking too much time on bothering to reviewing this. Especially this being my 1st Anime Review on this site.\\n\\n\r\n*Overall* - All of the things I critisized about this anime would possibly acceptable, if it either:\\n\\n\r\nA) Have long-lasting characters to latch on to even forgive whatever the storyline/plot was to be.\\n\r\nB) Had the comedy effective rather than deteriorating into stale, overdone jokes.\\n\r\nC) Had something that held an interest to balance out its own faults. That would maintain your attention on the show than doze off.\\n\\n\r\nSo at the end of the day, I'm not sugar-coating my criticism. If it gets to the point of a series where I don't give a flying dog crap about almost anything that's going on, Episode to Episode on in, then that's a big problem.\\n\r\nIf you're looking for an anime that contains the similar genres as this, I'd prefer watching Panty and Stocking with Garterbelt. \\n\r\nOr if you're looking for a good comedy, watch The World God Only Knows on Crunchyroll.",

            "content": "Spoiler Free\r\nStory - 3\r\nThe introduction and the given premise was fairly interesting, showing potential as it seemed to deviate from the norm. The first 2 episodes show promise but beyond this point nothing particularly new is introduced into the story (other than new characters) and the plot becomes highly repetitive. After about 1/4 of the way in, you can generally derive a pattern in the the sequence of events. \r\nI understand that this anime is a comedy but the lack of variety results in the humour going stale very quickly. Though it is generally lighthearted, the transitions into serious scenes are poorly done (or justpop up out of the blue) that you can't help but feel awkward watching things unfold.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters - 3\\n\r\nNothing special or unique about the characters within this series. Most of them have only a single defining trait about them (ie sadistic, attention whore, insecure, masochist etc) that dictates almost if not all their actions and reasoning. As such, most events and interactions are predictable and repetitive.\\n\\n\r\nThere is very little character development occurring as the series tend to focus too much on having characters stick to their one defining trait, and cases where characters do something more will often feel out of place and forced.\\n\\n\r\nArt - 5\\n\r\nMediocre. Nothing about it stood out, but nothing about it was bad either.\\n\\n\r\nSound - 4\\n\r\nThe voice acting often feels strained horribly forced as if they're can't find appropriate lines for the characters, instead using whatever lines you'd typically get in certain situations. Other than this, it is very standard.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 6\\n\r\nThis anime has its funny moments, but they don't tend to last. The lack of anything outstanding or unique as well as the  many weak aspects of this series makes it easy for you to lose interest.\\n\\n\r\nI personally don't think this is worth the watch, there are many other anime out there that achieves the goals of this series, or at least performs better overall.",

            "content": "Seriously, I just don't even know what to say about this anime.\r\nSTORY (3):\r\nSo the story follows Harumi who protects Natsuno from the killer but in return he was killed and turned into a dog. So basically, this anime has a plethora of misunderstandings and wacky situations. I really thought that this anime is all about reading books but sadly this wasn't the case at all. This anime is all about random comedy. The comedy was not even funny. The story had potential to be awesome but on the 5th episode it starts to get repetitive and lost the essence of the entertainment. \r\nART & ANIMATION(4):\\n\\n\r\nThe art was nothing special because a lot of anime companies now have improved their art and animation style. \\n\\n\r\nSOUND (4):\\n\\n\r\nThere is nothing memorable about the opening and ending song.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER (1):\\n\\n\r\nI feel ashamed to say that there is no character development in this anime. Even when it comes to Natsuno's & Harumi's relationship. Their love story just goes nowhere. The characters never do anything productive and they just get very annoying. Let's take a look at the characters.\\n\\n\r\nHarumi Kazuhito:\\n\\n\r\nHe is just a bland character who just tugs along with Natsuno.\\n\\n\r\nNatsuno Kirihime:\\n\\n\r\nI was pulled into this anime because of her. She sort of reminded me like Yozora from Haganai due to her voice and accent. By the way, Marina Inoue voiced Yozora & this character here. However, in this anime, her character never gets better. She just treats Harumi like crap by cutting his skin off. She has no character depth at all unlike Yozora from Haganai. Seriously, she broke my heart. I thought that maybe her character development starts to kick in, but in the end I was wrong.\\n\\n\r\nMaxi Akizuki:\\n\\n\r\nSeriously, what was all this \"Shining, shining\"? Everytime when she appears on screen, she always says \"I'm shining, love me please, I love attention!\". After that, one of her guards dragged her away. This infuriates me a lot.\\n\\n\r\nThe rest of the cast range from annoying to bland characters. I am not going to list down everyone of them. The more I list down, the more I go crazy.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCONCLUSION:\\n\\n\r\nI just feel ashamed of myself for watching this anime. I thought that the anime might serve its purpose but sadly it didn't. This anime has no purpose. Normally, every anime has its goal and purpose in life. At least, this anime was not as boring as Amnesia. But I feel that this anime severely lacks in purpose, character development and a compelling story. \\n\\n\r\nSuch a waste of talent for Marina Inoue. She did very well in portraying the voice of Yozora. \\n\\n\r\nFor those of you who say that it is just comedy, I agree with your point. But that is just the start, and you need to develop your character to the point where the audience will get invested into them, and also the anime must serve its purpose well (i.e. compelling story) so that this will become a great comedy. But sadly, this anime never work on these items.\\n\\n\r\nI just feel heartbroken by how this turns out. Such wasted potential. \\n\\n\r\nI give this anime a 2/10.",

            "content": "Dog and Scissors had the opportunity to make something fairly interesting.... It had quite the unique plot, imagine if the dog could have occasionally turned human? see what I mean? Potential. Sadly he couldn't turn into a human and the anime exploded into a mass of small boob jokes and borderline bestiality/incest. The characters were actually DISGUSTING, they had overwhelming flaws which heavily outweighed the good making them static and truly just disturbing. Now not only does this anime have flaws with the characters but its plot? Just as bad. It starts off looking fairly promising, something fairly new to the harem industry but itquickly become repetitive and extremely boring. (no joke I would have rather watched Haruhi Suzumiya's endless eight twice in one day) So real quick back to the characters:\\n\\n\r\nKazuhito Harumi - the dog of the story. pretty much a bookworm forever alone, until he gets shot and turns into a dog of course. He is really the only (somewhat) enjoyable character in the entire anime, hit wit died at about episode 5 when he ran out of flat chest jokes; so from that point on he was pretty annoying.\\n\\n\r\nKirihime Natsuno- hated this bitch. The dog pp lover from hell, she is sadistic and just generally annoying and at the same time disturbing. You will also find out she's not a total bitch but also a worthless emo who happens to be a giant waste of space in the plot's extremely small living quarters\\n\\n\r\nMadoka Harumi- dog's little sister; total bitch\\n\\n\\n\r\nSuzuna Hiiragi- Worst character in this anime and that is REALLY saying something also a weird-ass masochist\\n\\n\r\nSo yeah those are the characters, they don't compliment one another, they don't have any dramatic tension going on; nothing. They are just there, withering with the already dead plot. Oh yeah the plot! To say the least it's quite forgettable you won't remember it for very long, nor will you want to. It starts out with Harumi getting killed and reincarnated as a dog while trying to save Natsuno from a runaway gunman. Natsuno manages to find him in his dog form at a local pet shop and takes him home. From that point on in slowly introduces more terrible characters to make you hate the anime more like his sister and the weird masochist lady who's name has already (unsurprisingly) slipped my mind. Don't waste your time on this anime guys, it really is garbage sit back and watch something good; like Kill la Kill!",

            "content": "Harumi Kazuhito isn\u2019t your ordinary bookworm.  His entire life revolves around books.  I know that may sound like hyperbole, but oh no, I mean that with complete sincerity.  I also mean it literally, but we\u2019ll get to that.  For now, Harumi is a high school boy who has dedicated his life to the pastime of reading.  He basically chain-reads, buying up books by the handfuls, burning through them at supernatural speeds, and hoarding every volume he finishes.  He even refused to live with his family, opting instead to live in an apartment by himself so he could go toschool in an area where the books he wants are able to come out slightly quicker.  One day, while he\u2019s reading in a cafe, a crazed robber bursts in and begins to wave a shotgun around.  He threatens a young woman who\u2019s distractedly writing away in another seat, and Harumi gets up to defend her...  Not because he\u2019s generally a nice person, but because he can\u2019t stand to see a fellow book-lover get hurt.  Yes, that\u2019s how his mind works...  Or, how it DID work, until the robber blew it out of his skull.\\n\\n\r\nNow freshly dead, Harumi decides he can\u2019t cross over to the land of the dead yet...  He has so many books he still wants to read, including the final book from his favorite author, Akiyama Shinobu.  He manages to pull himself back to the land of the living with the strength of this passion...  So, like I said, his life literally revolves around books...  But through some mix-up, he\u2019s reincarnated into the body of a dog.  A miniature dachshund, to be exact, who\u2019s kept in a small cage in a pet store even though he\u2019s not for sale(this is never explained).  He\u2019s soon adopted by the girl he rescued, as the connection they share has given her the ability to hear his thoughts(at least I think that\u2019s the reason?), and she takes him home...  To murder him.  Until he finds out she\u2019s really Akiyama Shinobu, she finds out he\u2019s a fan of her work, and she inexplicably becomes sexually attracted to him.  And as it turns out, these are not going to be the only extreme oddities in his life going forward, as the world around him just gets weirder and weirder.  Good god, let\u2019s just get this turkey over with already.\\n\\n\r\nStudio Gonzo may have some acclaimed titles under their belt, what with the Fullmetal Panic franchise and arguably Linkin Park\u2019s best music video having been produced by them, but when you tally their output together, the bad far outweighs the good.  They\u2019ve put out some visual wonders like Gankutsuou, but they\u2019ve also let out some real clunkers like Gantz, and while Dog and Scissors, may not be THAT far down the ladder, it\u2019s pretty close to the bottom.  The animation is stiff and cheap in a way that\u2019s honestly hard not to notice.  They\u2019re clearly able to save a lot of money with the fact that the central character, living in the body of a dog, is able to speak telepathically, without the burden of having to animate lip flaps, so all they have to do is repeat animation cycles when he\u2019s on screen...  Be it slight movements in his fur, or wagging the tuft of hair on his head...  But this advantage becomes stale very fast, as it\u2019s just a variation on the talking heads that make up the rest of the cast.\\n\\n\r\nAnd speaking of the cast, I\u2019ll be honest, the character designs look pretty good.  If you\u2019re just looking at still images, the series actually looks really crisp and pleasing to the eye.  A few of the designs look a bit cliched, and they all look a bit standard, but they\u2019re all pleasant to look at.  Harumi makes for an adorable little doggy(which makes up for how intentionally bland he looks as a human), and maybe this is a matter of personal taste, but I love the design of his chop-happy new owner Natsuno.  She\u2019s like a grown-up version of Ai Enma who walks around dressed up like an extra from the Matrix movies, and I dig it, she looks really cool.  I also really like the afro guy who runs the pet store.  not only does his apron feature a clever Jojo\u2019s bizarre Adventure easter egg, he just looks like he\u2019d be a really chill dude to hang out with.  The backgrounds are also immaculately detailed, with shelves full of diverse looking books giving our characters\u2019 collections their own sense of personality, and each character\u2019s living space is detailed enough to add a new dimension to their personalities, especially in the case of Natsuno.\\n\\n\r\nOf course, that doesn\u2019t excuse the animation.  Despite what the premise may have suggested, there\u2019s action in this series, but considering how well it moves, you may as well just read the damn light novels.  The only thing that looks like it had any real money put into it was the opening, which is fast moving, full of visual effects, and actually manages to translate the characters\u2019 awkward movements into some really fun dance cycles.  You\u2019ve probably seen an anime where characters imitate dogs or cats by moving their half-clenched fists in a certain way to resemble paws, haven\u2019t you?  This opening features nearly the entire cast doing step-dances that heavily incorporate that kind of movement, and it\u2019s so adorable you just can\u2019t help but smile when seeing it.  They also have doggy ears and tails, and as a possible result of the video\u2019s fast pace, it\u2019s disquietingly easy to not notice this the first time watching it.  This video has no right to be as fun as it is, but at least it was SOMETHING to look forward to.\\n\\n\r\nOf course, it probably helps that the song was also really catchy.  It\u2019s by Inu Musume Club, and it\u2019s called \u201cWan Wan Wan Wan N_1,\u201d and that may sound like gibberish at first glance, but there\u2019s a really popular Japanese pun behind it.  Wan is the Japanese onomatopoeia for the sound a dog makes, which any American would call Woof or Bark.  Wan also sounds like One, hence why the title begins with barking and ends with an obvious abbreviation for Number One.  This actually isn\u2019t even the only opening theme to employ this pun, hell, it\u2019s not even the best one, as Working!!! actually did it much better, but leaving that aside, it\u2019s a funny little footnote.  The ending theme is almost as delightful as it\u2019s op counterpart, with Natsuno flying a scissors-inspired private jet, her rival\u2019s black-suited bodyguards expressionlessly dancing in tandem, and generally just a bunch of creative and funny imagery gets paired to a slightly more low-key but still catchy song with the bizarre name Lemonade scandal.\\n\\n\r\nI wish I could tell you more about the music, but unfortunately, I barely noticed it at all during the show.  I guess that means it was doing it\u2019s job?  I can\u2019t remember ever hating the music...  At least not as much as generally everything else...  And I can vaguely recall tapping my foot to a few fun-sounding tunes.  This is normally where I\u2019d be looking up each individual track online, but I can only find one, by the name of Mieta Kibo, and god help me, it sounds absolutely divine.  I guess that shouldn\u2019t be a surprise, as it\u2019s credited to one Akito Matsuda, who Wikipedia says WAS in charge of the music of the series, but since there\u2019s only one track available online, I\u2019d have to rewatch the show to hear it\u2019s ost...  And I\u2019d rather stick a thumb-tack through my eyelid.  Thankfully, he\u2019s done the soundtracks to a lot of other recent anime, and now that I\u2019m hearing some of it, I suddenly REALLY want to watch Sound Euphorium.  His composition, as I\u2019ve heard, was the one and only interesting thing about Glasslip, so Dog and Scissors\u2019 music was probably just as solid.\\n\\n\r\nThe English dub is...  Well, it\u2019s weird, but hey, this is a weird show.  It\u2019s a mix of bizarrely enthusiastic standouts and adequate, okay performances, with thankfully no real duds to speak of.  At the very worst, some of the casting choices are standard, just the actors we know coming and doing their thing, catching an easy paycheck off of a role that they were suited for.  Chief among these is Blake Shepard, who I\u2019m normally not a huge fan of, playing the lead role of Harumi, and while his delivery skews the line between hammy and wooden whenever his character is excited, he manages to nail it whenever he\u2019s supposed to sound serious or sarcastic.  And then on the other end of the spectrum you have Jessica Calvello, an actor who...  Well, if you assign her to one of your characters, you\u2019re pretty much bringing out the big guns, because putting her in any role but the lead is fucking overkill.  Luckily, she\u2019s playing one half of the titular pair here, and her penchant for hitting a wide range within one single character adds a level of insanity that makes Natsuno far more tolerable than her disturbingly subtle Japanese portrayal.\\n\\n\r\nThere are other actors, of course, and I\u2019d like to bring up Luci Christian as a highlight because she put an absurd amount of effort into a suicidal self-blaming character...  And the adaptive script is really good at localizing the dialogue without straying too far from the original intent, although it does fuck up once towards the end and make i sound like someone's responding to Harumi's thought-comments...  But I really want to skip right to the second half of this review, because I have a lot to say about the writing and meat of this anime, and none of it is pleasant.  So let me just say that the dub is good, and I\u2019d highly recommend it over the sub, because the sub just sounds too grounded, which makes a lot of it\u2019s more problematic elements harder to stomach.  The dub gives it more of a wacky and bizarre personality, allowing you to mentally remove it from the harsher implications of a lot of it\u2019s so-called jokes.  Then again maybe that\u2019s just me being  dumb American and not appreciating the Japanese language or whatever.  If you\u2019re going to watch this, I recommend doing it in English.\\n\\n\r\nRight, now that that\u2019s over with, I\u2019ve been holding this in for far too long.  If I haven\u2019t already given this away, Dog and Scissors is bad.  Like, it\u2019s really, really bad.  It\u2019s not funny bad...  It\u2019s not interesting bad...  It\u2019s the kind of bad that I only place among the worst of the worst, which, for me, is a list that not even School Days has been able to crack.  I actually hesitated to write this review, and even thought about stopping a few times, because I honestly don\u2019t think a review is necessary.  This is the kind of show where you can immediately tell whether or not it\u2019s worth watching...  Yeah, it\u2019s ironic that an anime revolving around books would be so easy to judge from a glance at the cover.  In fact, here\u2019s all you really need to know to get a feel for the series:  A woman adopts a puppy because she wants to kill it, and then spares it because she wants to have sex with it.  I know that\u2019s not entirely fair, and it\u2019s taking the scenario out of context, but it\u2019s not inaccurate, either.  That literally happens, and further details don\u2019t do much to improve things.\\n\\n\r\nEverything about this series...  Well, aside from the music, dub and art...  Is either stupid, confusing or awful.  There is not one redeeming quality outside of those few production efforts.  I could do an entire Inconvenient Questions post about each individual episode, but I won\u2019t, because watching this show twice in my life was twice too many times, and I cancelled IQ for a good reason.  Thus, I\u2019m only going to focus on my biggest problems with this series.  For starters, I failed to mention until now what the biggest connection between Natsuno and Harumi is.  He can\u2019t talk, being a dog, but she can hear his thoughts.  This might not bother you, but it bugs the hell out of me...  His thoughts aren\u2019t treated like thoughts, but like regular conversation.  She hears him as though he\u2019s speaking.  That\u2019s not how thinking works.  You never stop thinking.  And yeah, you could SAY that she can only hear thoughts he sends to her, but this also isn\u2019t true, because the only reason they met is because his thoughts, from elsewhere in the city, were distracting her, and she tracked him down.\\n\\n\r\nRight there, it\u2019s established that not only can she hear his thoughts without his consent or knowledge, but that there\u2019s a long range, and she can\u2019t shut it out, but there are possibly thousands of instances in the series that directly contradict this.  Why does she ask him questions?  Why does she ever think he\u2019s lying about something?  You can hear his thoughts!  He shouldn\u2019t be able to lie to you!  Why do you each read a book at the same time, when you should just be able to hear him reading it?  Did his thoughts distracting you from writing just stop?  Did that problem go away the second you decided to not murder him?  If you were able to track him down to the pet store he was being kept in(like a parrot), why do you EVER have to look for him in order to find him?  I\u2019m sorry, I really am, but this entire premise is so frustratingly inconsistent that I honestly found it distracting throughout the series.  Even comedies...  No, especially comedies...  Have to take themselves seriously to enough of a degree that they pay attention to fucking detail.\\n\\n\r\nOh, and speaking of comedy, have you noticed how small Natsuno\u2019s breasts are?  Good, because I just spoiled at least 60% of this show\u2019s comedy.  The other 40% is largely made up of BDSM and animal cruelty.  I don\u2019t like speaking in absolutes, but I have to say this:  In anime, jokes about a character\u2019s bust size are never, ever funny.  I\u2019m not saying that because such humor is sexist, or mean-spirited...  although they are both of those things...  I\u2019m saying it because that is THE most overused joke in anime history.  Characters bringing up cup sizes happens more often than tsunderes over-reacting to misunderstandings, and that\u2019s saying something.  The only time I can ever remember a boob-size joke being funny was in Yamada\u2019s first time, when Yamada was imagining what her best friend\u2019s life must be like with big boobs, getting all jealous, but then we get a glimpse of said friend having to apply lotion to herself because of how much the damn things chafe.  See, that was a clever subversion of expectations, and it;\u2019s an example of how hard a boob-size joke has to work to even be kind of funny.\\n\\n\r\nDog and Scissors relies heavily on this idea, but it doesn\u2019t put anywhere near that level of effort into it.  Despite the fact that he\u2019s not into real live women, Harumi is constantly berating Natsuno on her bust, and even when he isn\u2019t, she\u2019s constantly seen obsessing over it.  It gets to the point where I was seriously wondering why Natsuno didn\u2019t just get a damn boob job already.  Yeah, I know I shouldn\u2019t promote a shallow image of beauty, and people look fine just as they are, but plastic surgery can help people who have confidence issues relating to their appearances.  Natsuno\u2019s a grown woman, she makes her own decisions, she lives independently off of her success, and she clearly has Seto Kaiba levels of disposable income lying around, so why doesn\u2019t she just get some work done?  oh, right, because that would take away the one lazy-ass joke that this series keeps on dragging out of the dumpster to try and amuse us, to the point that even a dead horse would tell them to stop beating a dead horse.\\n\\n\r\nAnd speaking of Natsuno, try to wrap your head around this;  She\u2019s twenty years old, hasn\u2019t written anything since she was 19, and is implied to have a bibliography that would make Stephen King jealous.  She\u2019s written a ton of novels spanning all types of genres, and at least six of her books are thick enough to contain at least a few thousand pages each.  By the time she was 19.  Not only is she considered one of the three top best-selling authors(the words \u201cIn Japan\u201d is never attached to this, so it\u2019s fair to say they mean worldwide), but the other two, who we meet in this series, are also young ladies of a similar age.  Hell, her most vocal rival spends most of her time as a pop idol!  Did any thought go into any of this?  Even her threats to kill Harumi don\u2019t add up to anything, as all she ever does is cut off portions of his fur, which grow back in less than five seconds...  And yet he still acts terrified of her, every single time she attacks him.  Hey, dumbass, she may say she\u2019s going to cut off one of your ears, but I think you\u2019re gonna be fine.\\n\\n\r\nAnd honestly, even it\u2019s focus on books and reading was completely shallow.  All dog and Scissors knows is that reading and writing are things.  Possibly fun things.  Possibly lucrative things.  It knows they exist, it knows they\u2019re important to people, but it has no deeper understanding of any of it.  Not only do we never find out anything about Natsuno\u2019s books outside of their titles and a seven deadly sins gimmick, we don\u2019t even technically know if they\u2019re fiction or non.  Hiromi is extremely pretentious, being that he loves to read, he deifies books, he defends books from critics, he judges people(even his own damn murderer) on whether or not they\u2019re readers, and get this;  He has no defined taste.  This moron would probably get his jollies off reading the ingredients on a packet of McDonalds ketchup.  This series knows as much about books as Adam Sandler knows about video games.  We never find out what literature means to anybody, but it wears it on it\u2019s sleeve.\\n\\n\r\nAnd if any of you are holding out hope that the plot and mystery aspect might have something to offer, don\u2019t.  Harumi\u2019s killer is found and dealt with so early that it can\u2019t even be considered a spoiler.  It turns out that after killing him, the killer had time to rob him before running away, and has been hiding in the second apartment that Harumi\u2019s been keeping secret from his family AND his landlady.  Chew on that for a moment.  They find him, they chase him down, and it turns out he\u2019s got Natsuno\u2019s six thickest books hiding in his coat(even though they\u2019d definitely be weighing him down and banging into his body while he was running), and he uses them as weapons in the worst anime fight scene since Master of Martial Hearts.  She beats him, and gives Harumi the choice to either kill or spare him, all while I\u2019m screaming \u201cNeither!  Call the fucking cops!\u201d  Oh, and we never meet his parents, we hear nothing of any funeral, he has no drive to get his life back, and we meet his sister, but...  Hoboy.  Had to dip into the incest shit, didn\u2019t you?  Bottom of the barrel wasn\u2019t low enough?\\n\\n\r\nDog and Scissors is available on both DVD and Bluray from Sentai Filmworks, and it\u2019s available both in dubbed and undubbed formats.  The manga and light novel are not available stateside.\\n\\n\r\nI\u2019m not gonna lie, guys, this was a tough one to get through.  The only reason I even bothered is because I\u2019ve been on hiatus for a few months, and I needed something especially bad to rage on.  Thus, I figured, why not an anime where one of the biggest running jokes is the main character commenting about shit not making sense, while completely missing the bigger picture each time?  Like I said before, the artwork and character designs are good, the music is serviceable and the opening and closing themes are awesome, but these are really the only things it has going for it, and they\u2019re the only qualities that pull it up from a possible 0 score, and I haven\u2019t even scratched the surface of what\u2019s wrong with it.  It falls apart if you give it even one seconds worth of thought, which is why I have to wonder if the people who enjoy and defend it checked their brains at the door, or at birth.  I don\u2019t condone threatening violence against dogs with a pair of scissors, but this is one tail that definitely should have been cut short.  I give Dog & Scissors a 1/10.",

If you are a fanboy of this anime then i suggest that you don't read further.\r\nA warning, I may explain how bad this anime is with a few warnings nothing big.\r\nThis anime starts of when the main character dies and turns into a dog. From the beginning that already sounds bad. This anime just has no story. The only resign why I watched it all the way was because I hoped that the story would at least get better, but it didn't. This dog man then lives with a girlbecause she could read his mind. That just doesn't make sense.\\n\r\nThe story gets a 1/10 because it has no story.\\n\\n\r\nArt and music is the only good point of the anime. The dog is so cute and there is very colorful characters. This is the only high point of the anime\\n\\n\r\nThe character development is so bad it almost made me cry. I watched all 12 episodes hoping, just hoping there would be some character development. There wasn't anything close except at the end were the girl wanted to marry the dog. The fact that she wanted to marry a animal is so disturbing. \\n\r\nBecause of no character development I will give this anime 1/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall the enjoyment is so bad because I find it so hard to enjoy this anime. I also find it so hard to believe someone used money to make this anime. This anime could have had potential.\\n\r\nI give the overall score a 2/10 it deserves a 1/10 but because of the art i gave it a extra point.\\n\\n\r\nIf you agree or disagree then let me know on my profile and leave a comment.

            "content": "Inu to Hasami wa Tsukaiyou review\r\n\"Painful barking\"\r\nThere are always protagonists that separates one from the other. In this case, what really stands out is a dog as the protagonist. Welcome to the world of Dogs and Scissors!\r\nStory: 5/10\r\nInu to Hasami wa Tsukaiyou follows the misadventures of Kazuhito Harumi, a booklover who consequently transformed into a dachshund dog; and Kirihime Natsuno, a sadistic yet famous book author.\r\nAfter watching the anime, I wondered if Kazuhito will ever turn into human again - guess not! But what did I get is that humans can actually fall in love with talking animals. Inu to Hasami wa Tsukaiyou is basicallycomedy with a tinge of romance. It's definitely a \"hoity-toity\" kind of anime. But for me, I really took the anime seriously, as I was always wondering how they can depict a story such as this. I wasn't all disappointed with the whole story since I actually find it amusing. As I mentioned before it has comedy where at some point will be enough to make you grin, however it can get too nonsensical that may leave a bad taste for some. As for the plot, I expected that Kazuhito would struggle to look for a way to return human. Although it did portray that for the beginning, as the story progresses, it consequently depicts the unfortunate life of Kazuhito as a dog under Kirihime's care, showing no development in the story from then on.\\n\\n\r\n So if your looking for an anime with a decent story to begin with, then Inu to Hasami wa Tsukaiyou will give you a good start in its premise but will leave you wanting if you linger.\\n\\n\r\nVisual and Audio quality: 7/10\\n\r\nVisual quality here seems generic as it has many iterations in many anime shows of the same ecosystem; nothing outstanding but still palpable enough to keep it away from looking bad. Animations run great and I can't really point anything worth of complaining.\\n\\n\r\nAs for audio, the seiyuus did great in their performance of livening up their selected characters in the show. Soundtrack is nice on both opening and ending themes as it reflects the almost everything what the show has to offer, but not really worth listening more than once. Sound effects also doesn't disappoint.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 7/10\\n\r\nThe characters in the story are almost like synonyms and antonyms with one another; e.g. tsundere and yandere; sadist and masochist; shy girl and outgoing girl, etc. Every individual are worth knowing since they make an impact in the story. But then again, there's barely any development in the story. Character design is also done great as every character has distinctive characteristics that make them stand out in the bunch like Kirihime's red eyes, black coat and long shears and even Kazuhito - the only dog in the show.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 7/10\\n\r\nInu to Hasami wa Tsukaiyou is an anime of interest that founds itself out of the norm of having an animal as a protagonist among the cast of human beings. Despite the absurdness of the story, I still found it enjoyable. But through better or for worse, it is still a watchable show.\\n\\n",

            "content": "Dear Japan: \r\nIt seems almost every season, there\u2019s one of those shows from your country that plays on fetishes or a rather bizarre sequence in the anime world. This time, it involves a girl and its\u2026.dog. Then, it decides for some odd reason to add the concept of scissors to the mix because we know it\u2019s one of the dangerous gadgets suitable for \u201cpunishment\u201d. As for the punishment itself, the receiving end is none other than our dog of the series, Kazuhito Harumi.\r\nInu to Hasami wa Tsukaiyo (also known as Dogs & Scissors) is an animated series based off the light novel of the samename written by Shunsuke Sarai. For a series about books though, this show sure likes to play around its other angles. So now begins the story of a dog and its master. (one sadistic if I might even add)\\n\\n\r\nThe show\u2019s delivery essentially begins with its accurate delivery and promise. In fact, there\u2019s a feeling of seriousness in the beginning. Our main male protagonist Kazuhito (a bookworm) is eager to read books and novels. As a fan of Shinobu Akiyama's works, he is determined to get the inside scoop of those words written in those text. But then one faithful day, the unthinkable happened. To be honest, if you thought your day was bad, Kazuhito\u2019s day couldn\u2019t get any worse because of what happens next. He becomes something he never thought he\u2019d be and hence begins this strange tale.\\n\\n\r\nAs mentioned before, the show takes itself seriously at first. The scene involving Kazuhito and his fate is depicted as brutal and violent with even blood added in the mix. The aftermath however turns out to be much more humorous when we find out that the woman Kazuhito gets acquainted with adapts a sadistic nature to her personality. Dressed in black clad clothing and armed with a deadly pair of scissors, Kirhime Natsuno is a woman that delivers the punishment to our not-so-lucky protagonist. Because of the punishment he receives, the show itself leans towards borderline animal abuse at many stances. Although it seems to be humorous at many cases, the series itself becomes intolerable after many of those repetitive moments. It doesn\u2019t help by the fact that the dog also both intentionally and unintellionally provoke Kirihime at many occasion that results in those punishments. \\n\\n\r\nAs far as the plot goes, the series sticks with its premise at first. In fact, it takes its turns early on to finding out the culprit responding for Kazuhito\u2019s fate but more importantly to stick with its original plot. However, the series later on becomes a cluster of absurd comedy that makes little sense or no progression to the story at all. \\n\\n\r\nThe story itself also consists of many characters although the majority of the cast consists of female characters of different nature. There\u2019s a masochist, an idol, a maid, and even a yandere. These characters all connects to the tale of the sadist and the dog in some way although mostly depicted as complete nonsense. For instance, the idol (aka the Shining Girl) of the series known as Maxi Akizuki plays little role besides trying to take the spotlight while mostly failing to do so. Then, there\u2019s even a yandere character that clashes against Kirihime in almost borderline incest moments. Other characters later on in the series also presents absurd comedy in different nature related to the concept of competitions. \\n\\n\r\nThe relationship between Kazuhito and Kirihime is one of the more dynamic aspects of the series. Almost every episode focuses on them although the development between the duo is quite sour and sometimes way out of line. For the most part, Kirihime abuses Kazuhito at almost any time when she feels something doesn\u2019t go according to her way or when the latter says something that shouldn\u2019t of been said. However, if we look carefully, there\u2019s also cases where Kirihime does treasure Kazuhito and vice versa. Even more so, Kirihime seems to get jealous at times for the dog and acts on those frustrations to carry out her punishments. As for Kazuhito himself, there\u2019s a lot of humor revolving around his character with his new life as the dog. He doesn\u2019t go out to hunt or guard the house but instead still follows on his goals to read books. Even as a dog, his determination seems to become avid as ever.\\n\\n\r\nAs noted by its absurd comedy genre, this show doesn\u2019t loosen that style any bit at all. The comedy of this show is ridiculous, as in ridiculously bad. Kirihime\u2019s scissors is just one primary example as a weapon that\u2019s out of this world with inhuman capabilities. Kirihime herself often acts like the boss but she shows insecurity of herself especially in regards to her female body structure. This gag is made fun of nearly every episode because of her small breast size. (assumingly A-Cup). It doesn\u2019t stop there though because her physical nature is made fun of that result in undesired consequences for Kazuhito. This repetitive running gag feels almost like an endless loop at many occasions with the misunderstandings. Later on, a yandere type character also enters the story that formulates a triangle which spells out even more misunderstandings. There\u2019s case of fan services from here and there although it doesn\u2019t fall into the ecchi category. What it does fall under though is the seemingly endless and repetitive gags ranging from masochism to sadism to dog abuse. \\n\\n\r\nThere\u2019s some action as well but it\u2019s mostly carried out in a comical fashion. The way the characters move and fight makes it clear at first but the transformations and execution is painful to watch. It tries to follow its themes involving the seven deadly sins as well but most of this is downplayed as nothing more than a textbook of mistakes. At one point, I question myself why I watch this show. Perhaps it might be the small chance of a decent mystery as briefly shown in the beginning of the show but this later wavers down with nothing more than nonsense once again.  \\n\\n\r\nArtwork wise, the term generic is what comes to my mind at first glance. Even the dog is portrayed as being generic with its design. He doesn\u2019t look dangerous at all but instead of someone of frail nature. On the other hand, Kirihime\u2019s design does look a tad noticeable with her black clad outfit. Her scarlet eyes and long black hair gives her a more dangerous look. On other hand though, idol characters, maids, and yanderes are designed in this show exactly what you might expect. \\n\\n\r\nThe music aspect of this show is almost a joke like the show itself. The OP song \"Wan Wan Wan Wan N_1!!\" by Inu Musume Club is portrayed as comedy and does its job as such with its sequences. In the song, we see characters dancing while doing animal movements complete with some flashy outfits. The dog though? He\u2019s there in the background usually suffering the abuse. The ED song doesn\u2019t do any better either with bits of fan service and a similar style of its comedy genre. The OST is also hardly noticeable although we do see some of the more dramatic moments carried out in a serious fashion. Finally, I didn\u2019t feel like any of the VA portrayed their roles in an outstanding way. The only noticable voice though might be the voice of Kazuhito when he was once human. If we notice carefully, we never get to see his true face. In other words, the voice of his character when he was human gives off a sense of realism in this ridiculous comedy of nonsense.\\n\\n\r\nFor a comedy series, this show sure likes to play around with the genre; a bit too much perhaps. At many points, it feels like if you\u2019re watching not just a parody but a series crafted out of nonsense. By nonsense, I mean nonsense as in making no sense at all while defying the laws of a decent story. The story itself also had a strong promise at first but breaks itself apart with its random gags and repetitiveness. In short, this show is one of those anime series where it tries to be \u201cso bad, it\u2019s good\u201d. However, it just ends up with the first part as in \u2018bad\u2019. I know my expectations might be a bit high but being bad sometimes should have its limits.\\n\\n\r\nSincerely, a disappointed viewer.",

            "content": "Do you understand what is comedy?  Do you really value it? I am very sure you don't, not until you watch Dogs and Scissors. It is a series that will make you appreciate jokes, more than ever, because its pathetic, dreadful, and fan-service accompanied \"comedic\" plot will make you appreciate the math joke that you thought was stupid. \r\nThe plot is simple..you can read the summary anywhere, so I am not going to detail that. But yes, this is an extreme story of books..where you either write or die..you read or die. That was the opening sentence of the anime. Quite interesting right? Yeah,I wish it was like that. Not until you pass episode 2, when you will suddenly realize the deep, thoughtful ways of this anime, thoughtful ways of putting fan-service. This anime is a collection of \"weird\" otaku fetish: sadistic tsundere, extremely attached younger sister, voluptuous masochist, and most importantly, a complete harem of girls. Not to mention the \"flat-chest\" jokes, \"those\" dialogues....and whatever a loner otaku dreams to see. \\n\\n\r\nAt first it begins decently, guy loves books, he dies, and gets reincarnated as a dog to become the pet of his favorite author. And then starts the non-stop loop of \"flat-chested\" jokes, sadistic scissor scenes, younger sister pleading \"Kazu-nii\", girls appearing to satisfy harems and ends with hot-spring bath and beach scene near the ending of the anime. This anime, without a doubt, will satisfy if you're into \"these\" things. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters are simple. Protagonist is a straight-man (or dog) of the series, who gives commentary to every line spoken. He loves book more than anything. He is mostly in his dog form. The female lead (the scissor) is a 20 year old sadistic, flat-chested (where the jokes come from), tsundere and best-selling author, who although highly intelligent, limits her insults to \"perverted dog\" \"ero dog\" \"idiot\" and \"mongrel\"....yes, very intelligent insults she uses. \\n\\n\r\nSide characters include overly-attached imouto; a bookstore girl the protagonist loves;her younger sister who likes to \"play\" with the protagonist; a voluptuous and masochistic book editor; a maid who is overly attached to her mistress; a \"shining\" idol who is supported by overly attached men in black; and the girl who is always apologizing...and for comic relief afro guy, muscle men and whatever the anime industry needs to create comedy. \\n\\n\r\nSound tracks are average. Opening song, you know those songs where the singer changes pitches as she sings..with hyperactive attitude? Ending is rather decent, after first ten seconds. And overall, very decent, low-average music. \\n\\n\r\nArt. Average 2013 art. Animation is decent, the fight scenes are alright. It' just nothing to look forward to. And it's sad how every character must have colorful eyes and hair, certain types of figure and stereotypical appearance.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I began this anime because of how frequently it was recommended. This anime was made TO satisfy the audience, especially the guy stuck in his room 24/7. There are plot holes everywhere, non-sense characters and low average art and animation. It just takes pathetic on different level. I didn't enjoy it. \\n\\n\r\nRecommended only if you're interested in \"those\" matters I mentioned, or just want to watch every anime of the season. Otherwise, just save your time on something better. Seriously, I cried realizing the depth anime reached these days.",

            "content": "\u201cJapan never fails to surprise me with their anime\u201d\r\nAnime, without we realize has turned us into some people who likes weird things or even taboo in some society. We are getting used and even being desensitisized with japanese weird taste, Like ecchi that basically soft porn, incest that mostly all people in the world against it, and even turn us into a lolicon. Now, they even will make us turn into more weirder with the love between an animal and a human. Prepare for this?\r\nSTORY (4/10) - Inu to Hasami is basically your generic of romance comedy anime with some harem in it. The premiseof the story can be seen in MAL page. But its like what its said, its about a highschool boy who is being killed when he tried to save a girl and he\u2019s being resurrected as a dog. Now, he\u2019s turned into a pet for a girl that he saves before. Summary, this anime will be focussing on interaction between Kazuhito (the dog) and his master (Kirihime). The interaction that happen is not always about the romantic but also the funny. Usually, the jokes is about when Kirihime abusing her dog.FYI, she is sadistic and the punchline jokes that Kazuhito always do is pretty much makes the viewers at least gets smile or even laugh, though sometimes it isn\u2019t funny at all.\\n\\n\r\nIf you think the premise are absurd enough, then you\u2019re surely surprise what will you find in this anime. In Inu to Hasami, you will find many absurd things that even you wouldnt think before. From absurd battle, wracky story, and furthermore, nonsense comedy. Its feel like you put many things into one box. But aside from that, Inu to Hasami is pretty easy to follow. Even the story is absurd but atleast you will understand about what this anime about. Though, its still absurd. SO absurd.\\n\\n\r\nAside from all that aspects, Inu to Hasami is pretty enjoyable anime to watch despite of how absurd this anime is. The jokes is literally the one that keeps me still watching it until the end. Of course, there is sometimes that even the jokes isnt funny at all or even makes you wanna punch the character.\\n\\n\r\nART (8/10) \u2013 Aside from the absurd story, the art in this anime pretty much well made and the reason why i still keep watching it until the end.  The art is so vivid, colorful and the background itself is pretty detailed. Like in Kirihime\u2019s room, the way this anime draws the bookshelf within the books looks so realistic. Moreover, the colorful art makes this anime is more enchanting and didnt make our eyes being tired from watching it. Sometimes they using comical style, especially when it comes to punchline jokes from the dog aka Kazuhito. The art in the battle scenes are also quite good, The art drastically changes if the battle scenes were appear.From the colorful art they turned into more darker, the effects also is quite stunning and increasing the atmosphere of \u201cbattle feels\u201d. But, from the drastically itself it can makes the viewers feel uneasy, though its great they can change the art style and madely well done. but it makes the art itself didnt consistent. However, the art is stil great.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND (6/10) \u2013 First from the soundtrack, the opening song of this anime \u201cWan Wan Wan Wan\u201d by Inu Musume Club. This song is like the story itself, its absurd and didnt really catchy.  I always skip the song anyway, since the song is silly and not really attractive. But aside from my egoistical perspective, this song is suitable with the anime itself and really present the anime itself. But aside from non-catchy-music, The video music in the opening itself is quite funny and again, using comical fashion and some parody jokes this video is funny on its own way, even in the openin music video the dog is still get abused.Though the song is still bad..\\n\\n\r\nFor the voice, the seiyuu in this anime is great. I mean, they really suitable with their own roles and characters personality. Like Yayoi that being voiced by Hiromi Agarashi, Hiromi Agarashi is really suitable for child role since her voice is childish and have cute tunes. Her voice is totally makes Yayoi is so loveable and makes you wanna hug her. But not just Yayoi, all the seiyuus is  also did their job very well, though sometimes the voice feels seems off.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER (6/10) \u2013 First of all, i must say all the characters in this anime is unique. Its great to have so many unique person in one story. Great and unique characters are the key for making the story more interesting. But in this anime, they waste it all. Since this \u201call unique characters\u201d are like the side dish. Well, i know this anime is focussing on those weird couples but still...  Those characters beside Kazuhito and Kirihime, its just like a figure. They didnt have any space for developments. \\n\\n\r\nFor Kazuhito, he is a bookworm guy who loves book than anything in this world and like any MC in another harem that usually doesnt really care about their harem and also, dense. For Kirihime, she is a famous writer that being adored by Kazuhito and she is Kazuhito\u2019s master. Kirihime is also asadistic girl that usually abuse Kazuhito. But despite of all that abuse, she also have a dere personality and quite caring especially if its about Kazuhito. Despite of all that, this formula is pretty common in romance comedy harem today. Dense main character while the heroine falling in love with him. Though the one that makes this anime is different is your main character is....... a dog.\\n\\n\r\nCONCLUSION (6/10)\\n\r\nFunny things about this anime is no matter how absurd this show was, but its still watchable. Though we still didnt used to see a Love between a dog and a girl is pretty hard to been accepted, but if you like beastility of course this isnt a problem. Anyway, since this is fantasy we can forget about the taboo and anything else and i find this anime is entertaining and pretty nice anime to spend time with, though dont get your hopes too high in this anime.\\n",

            "content": "A dog as a protagonist?! Is what my reaction was when I first saw Inu to Hasami. And it made me think of how would the story revolve around that dog. So I tried watching it.\r\nI've never watched a series where an animal gets the main stage, so this will be the first one.\r\nSo the story revolves around Harumi Kazuhito, a bookworm. He's a die hard fan of Akiyama Shinobu's books. One day he got into a cafe which was about to be robbed by a guy who didn't make any sense later in the story. The robber took out his gun and pointed itat the bartender. After seeing Kazuhito and another customer across Kazuhito's table, he told them to stand up. Kazuhito willingly follows what the robber said. While the girl across him didn't even flinch. The robber points his gun at the girl, ready to shoot. Kazuhito then interfered, and got shot in the head. Which resulted in him dying(duuh?). He's desire to read Akiyama's books didn't let him die, instead, he came back to life. Only its in a body of a dog. And that's where his story starts. Well, there were quite a few cliche things to watch out in into it, but fear not! Since its bearable and not that deep too. I think its because they wanted to stick on the comedy part more. No deep meaning, just your average comical series.\\n\\n\r\nIt seems that every character in inu to hasami has serious mental problems, well I don't mean it in a bad way, since they were quite funny most of the time. And if you're looking for a cute dog, you definitely have to watch this. I mean, how often do you find a series which a cute miniature dachshund always hangs around. As if it that wasn't cute.\\n\\n\r\nBoth opening and ending theme were upbeat, complimenting on how comical the story is.\\n\\n\r\nI believe that inu to hasami is a good series in its own way, but I don't think it'll be bigger than what it has achieved by now. And it'll make me very happy to know if they decide to make another season. Since the amount of detail in the first one wasn't that good. So a lot of question will pop right into your head after watching it. But this series is a good watch, a comical series which doesn't have any deep story into it. Doesn't make you think how the plot will develop into. Just your average comedy series. Sometimes you don't need complicated whatso-shitty-complicated plot to be a fair series. There's not much to point out on Inu to Hasami so I'll end my BS here.\\n\\n\r\n(Overall Score : 8)",

            "content": "Snips, snails, and puppy dog tails\r\nThere are many anime shows out there. Some are serious, some are goofy, and some are both. Other shows enjoy dishing out ecchi, and then taking it away because it was all a trap to begin with (God, there's a lot of those). However eventually there is a show that is just really different. Bizarre. Plain weird. And just absurd. That show is Dog & Scissors.\r\nIt starts off simple enough as any other anime. It has a plot, and a reason. However those two get resolved pretty quickly, and then the show goes into Simpson-esc sitcom mode. Mostly because thisshow creates a mini universe type of feel. From a scarf wearing steroid user who loves to talk about muscles while jogging, all the way to an OCD pop model who loves to say \"SHINNY!\" every 2 seconds. There are a lot of weirdos to gawk at, at almost every corner here. The characters are mostly strange. Natsuno Kirihime is the most well rounded one here since she conveys more emotion than everybody else (Happy, sad, being evil, being crazy, being drunk, etc.). She does torture her dog (Kazuhito), however it is not brutal torture where she grabs her scissors, and digs into the dog (A sigh of relief for PETA right there). She just cuts his hair into weird shapes, occasionally threatens him, and calls him names. She has a good reason though. He's literally asking for it since Kazuhito resorts to making fun of her body all the time.\\n\\n\r\nMusic in this show is pretty generic, but it gets the job done. The opening theme is pretty fun to watch. And so is the ending theme. The singing is not bad. However the instrumental part is the reason why it does not sound so special. \\n\\n\r\nThe designs of the show are not bad at all. The eyes of all of the characters (Mostly the female ones) actually have a unique look to their irises, and eyelashes. Colors are spread around in the show giving off a nice palette. The backgrounds are standard anime protocol (Schools, cities, parks). However, back to the character design. A whole lot of them have a bit of a twist to the usual anime stereotypes (Mostly Maxi does, the \"SHINNY!\" pop idol mentioned earlier). And the animation is decent enough for an anime.\\n\\n\r\nOn A Personal Note: This show is pretty unpopular. I understand why. I mean pretend that someone went into a restaurant, read off the menu about a chocolate cake with garlic in it being sold (With the ingredient \"garlic\" written everywhere). Then that someone ate the whole cake, and then acts shocked, and then shouts \"Why does this have garlic in it!?\" at everybody. Then another guy is there at the same place, at the same time, and that person ate the same cake. And then that other guy loved it because it had garlic like promised. That is how I feel about this show. Im the guy that loved the garlic chocolate cake. Before I even started watching this show (And Im not being all high, and mighty here), but I knew from the get go because of the description what I was going to get. And that's what I got. And I liked it. The show is not bad. Give it a chance. Expect it to be absurd. \\n\\n\r\nIt's not like the show is promising the moon. It's promising a crazy girl who has scissors, and a talking dog going off on weird adventures. And it delivers.",

            "content": "This is a story about books.\r\nDog & Scissors starts somewhat promising on its own terms. Nowadays you don't happen to see a story like this unfold and there might be a good reason for this, because it's condemned to be an unsuccessful attempt at creating something unique.\r\nThere's acutally a story given to this series. The writer Akiyama Shinobu's trying to finish the last book of the collection of The Seven Deadly Sins. On the other hand the bookworm Kazuhito has a passion for every book and writer in the world, especially for Shinobu and he wants to read this last book badly. So badly, thatthe day he dies in a robbery where he protects a woman, he doesn't accept death and is resurrected as a dachshund dog. After coincidences occur he happens to live together with his favourite writer. The problem of the plot is that it's not going anywhere from that point on. Strange things happen and are resolved even stranger. The promise of an absurd and random comedy wasn't exaggerated, but it's just too random.\\n\\n\r\nThe first three episodes always introduce new things and aspects. Jokes, characters and a random diversion of the story. After this the anime goes on repeat and all these things don't change a lot. This might feel like an infinite loop of repetition that finishes after 12 episodes. So the only thing to expect in the next episode is how they repeated old jokes again.\\n\\n\r\nRarely the animation feels a little bit off, but overall the quality's good and fluent. At times there're even references to other animes and they're built in pretty well. The spectrum embraces cute illustrations with serious animation. Nothing more to say about the art here.\\n\\n\r\nEven less to say about the sound. The best thing about this anime is Marina Inoue and her performance, even though it's often forced at times that doesn't justify she's bad. She's awesome and a pleasure to hear. The OP song might be sinister, but I like to hear it and it's one of my favourites this season. Altogether the sound in the show's nothing special, though.\\n\\n\r\nThe shiniest aspects of Dog & Scissors are the characters and there're quite a few really singular personalities. But just because an anime has distinguishable characters won't make them any good or even likeable. So Akiyama Shinobu is revealed as Kirihime Natsuno, a 20 year old best selling author who lives alone and has a foible to torture other people with her scissors. Kazuhito ends up as a dog living in her apartment and even though he's a dog Natsume can read his mind. Why ? Because speaking dogs are terrifying, but however. There's about none character development ongoing and everyone seems to finish off as they were in the beginning. At last there's a really strange love story happening between them. I want to say see for yourself, but really don't.\\n\\n\r\nFrom episode to episode more characters join the story of those two. They truly differ as everyone has an unique personality, but most of this personality stays the same for everyone and is always the same in every single episode. It's like noone even wanted to give them proper development and thought this was a good idea. It was not. It's tremendously bad.\\n\\n\r\nYou can compare the enjoyment of this anime to your enjoyment of eating really hot wasabi. It's a really small pleasure to watch this weekly in a season, but if I imagine to watch more than one episode at a time I'd rather take the wasabi. This story was about books, but after watching it I don't feel any smarter or more educated about books. It's the opposite. I feel like I've forgotten books I read because of the plain stupidity. If you enjoy bad repetitive jokes, strange and awkward characters, a story with no plot and/or love between humans and dogs this might be something to watch for you. \\n\\n\r\nOverall Dog & Scissors's a bad example of a comedy in the big ocean of comedies. The strangest thing about it is the episodic structure like you find it in regular shows, but with an attempt to bring an ongoing story in it. So it's an episodic non-episodic anime and this could be good in a parallel universe where the issues of the story happen to be solved or revealed. In this one they aren't and there's a lot more better animes than this. Go watch them and don't bother with this failed experiment. If you already watched everything, you should rewatch Ginga Eiyuu Densetsu. Still better than watching a grown woman wanting the children of a dachshund dog.",

Though the plot is always focus on them the comedy genre did function wellwith the two, however it becomes more of drag when the anime always focuses on their misadventures especially when Baxter (Kazuhito) is constantly struggling to not get into Kirihime's bad side, there are a lot characters whom where seemly being ignored and would have added more body to this anime's story plot.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacter- poor 3, awooooo!\\n\\n\r\nI'm very much disgusted that Maxie Akizuki, SHINNNIG! and Himehagi Momiji's role were very limited, especially Maxie since her character would have added  more to this anime's comedy content that just limit her to a comic relief as for Himehagi Momiji , is also disgusted that she is just limited to a cameo role, also there is Afro and those muscle bums who would have contributed more to this anime's comedy. I really feel bad that studio Gonzo have to limit the mentioned characters a comic bit relief.\\n\\n\r\nArt, sound, enjoyment, overall- good 7 SHINNING!!!!\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\\n\r\nI like the way that every character's here where illustrated, there is that certain sexiness without the ecchi and each of the character's here are perfectly designs to match each of the character's characteristic, though I'm a bit disappointed that Kazuhito as a human wasn't given a face and instead the illustrator focus more the male character's dog designed (woof!) \\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\\n\r\nI like the way that Kirihime was played by Maria Inoue since she really did matched up as this sadistic girl that no man can mess with, also I like it that Kazuhito's VA played him as this pussy dog who is seemly afraid of what will his master, Kirihime will do next. Also, I like both the opening and the closing theme. But I'm a bit disappointed that Himehagi Momiji was never given any speaking lines.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\\n\r\nThough this anime may have some short comings, I'd say that it was still SHINNING to be enjoyed.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: \\n\\n\r\nWell, since there are indications of a possible season 2, I'm gonna leave this part with just one remark......SHINNING!!!!!!!",

Plus overall craziness with a depressing girl , masochistic manager and an over the top blonde girl showing up here and there not to talk about some samurai maid running wild making the dogs life even more crazy...\r\nAnd to top it up many random encounters , challenges, embarrassing moments and everything that romance comedy needs.\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt 8: I am quite adaptive when it comes to art in animes and this one got that fantasy touch with lights here and there , magic circles here or there , at some point ninja effects like Speed moving or at times dark alleys , night times and everything just looked nice.\\n\\n\r\nSound 8: I don't know i just don't care much for sounds in anime as long as the voicing is done good in which cases its done good most of the time and for this one the voices fit the characters and that is all i need.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters 9: Huge variety: Very young and enthusiastic , teens , older people , even animals...\\n\r\nEach got their own special skills like being an super masochist or depressed to the point of wanting to die and such.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 9: I laughed and laughed and said WTF so many times over and over because that kind of love story was something i couldn't watch seriously!\\n\\n\r\nOverall 8: I give it 8 because its just a random comedy and i think comedy animes should never go over 8...",

Randomness\r\n*Art/Sound* - Art is ok. Meh on the ED. OP is decent. Although don't expect me to go out of my way to get the songs on my iPhone/iPod Music anytime soon.\r\n*Characters* - Ugh... If it weren't for some of the character designs, I highly doubt these bland characters would have a chance in hell to stand out at all.\r\n99% of they do gets repetitive BEYOND BELIEF! \r\nAnd even the majority side characters have no importance or any level of, which even questions why they even deserve to be in the Opening Sequence of the show.\\n\\n\r\nTBH, the ONLY character I was interested in was Sachi Moribe - The maid that was singing and is very loyal to her mistress. Anytime she was on the scene, I actually wanted to know more about her, which unfortunately never happens...\\n\r\nAnd even Natsuno I cared about a little. The never-ending running gag of her having small breasts gets on my nerves. Because it's supposed to be a comedy bit even though its a constant dart to her character for no apparent reason at all. (FYI, her voice actor deserves way better than this. Especially since she did Yoko from Gurren Lagann...)\\n\\n\r\n*Enjoyment* - I find it to be offensively lazy, and offensively cliche', It feels like there's nothing that feels like I shouldn't forced myself to complete the series and dropped it earlier.\\n\\n\r\nI even feel like I'm taking too much time on bothering to reviewing this. Especially this being my 1st Anime Review on this site.\\n\\n\r\n*Overall* - All of the things I critisized about this anime would possibly acceptable, if it either:\\n\\n\r\nA) Have long-lasting characters to latch on to even forgive whatever the storyline/plot was to be.\\n\r\nB) Had the comedy effective rather than deteriorating into stale, overdone jokes.\\n\r\nC) Had something that held an interest to balance out its own faults. That would maintain your attention on the show than doze off.\\n\\n\r\nSo at the end of the day, I'm not sugar-coating my criticism. If it gets to the point of a series where I don't give a flying dog crap about almost anything that's going on, Episode to Episode on in, then that's a big problem.\\n\r\nIf you're looking for an anime that contains the similar genres as this, I'd prefer watching Panty and Stocking with Garterbelt. \\n\r\nOr if you're looking for a good comedy, watch The World God Only Knows on Crunchyroll.",

At first, the story revolves around finding who the killer was then after that I thought they would go investigate how to turn him back to a normal boy, but the story changed it's path. Their next goal was to make the last sequel of her book named \"LUST\". And so it made me disappointed to see in the end that it looks like it's still not finished,it's like it lacks something, making it open for a season 2.\\n\\n\r\nThe style of it's art was good, just like the other animes, the sounds too. The characters, I can't say anything special about them. Enjoyment? A little bit, you won't enjoy so much with this. So overall, it's just good. It's such a waste, I'm expecting more out of it.",

            "content": "Spoiler Free\r\nStory - 3\r\nThe introduction and the given premise was fairly interesting, showing potential as it seemed to deviate from the norm. The first 2 episodes show promise but beyond this point nothing particularly new is introduced into the story (other than new characters) and the plot becomes highly repetitive. After about 1/4 of the way in, you can generally derive a pattern in the the sequence of events. \r\nI understand that this anime is a comedy but the lack of variety results in the humour going stale very quickly. Though it is generally lighthearted, the transitions into serious scenes are poorly done (or justpop up out of the blue) that you can't help but feel awkward watching things unfold.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters - 3\\n\r\nNothing special or unique about the characters within this series. Most of them have only a single defining trait about them (ie sadistic, attention whore, insecure, masochist etc) that dictates almost if not all their actions and reasoning. As such, most events and interactions are predictable and repetitive.\\n\\n\r\nThere is very little character development occurring as the series tend to focus too much on having characters stick to their one defining trait, and cases where characters do something more will often feel out of place and forced.\\n\\n\r\nArt - 5\\n\r\nMediocre. Nothing about it stood out, but nothing about it was bad either.\\n\\n\r\nSound - 4\\n\r\nThe voice acting often feels strained horribly forced as if they're can't find appropriate lines for the characters, instead using whatever lines you'd typically get in certain situations. Other than this, it is very standard.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 6\\n\r\nThis anime has its funny moments, but they don't tend to last. The lack of anything outstanding or unique as well as the  many weak aspects of this series makes it easy for you to lose interest.\\n\\n\r\nI personally don't think this is worth the watch, there are many other anime out there that achieves the goals of this series, or at least performs better overall.",

So basically, this anime has a plethora of misunderstandings and wacky situations. I really thought that this anime is all about reading books but sadly this wasn't the case at all. This anime is all about random comedy. The comedy was not even funny. The story had potential to be awesome but on the 5th episode it starts to get repetitive and lost the essence of the entertainment. \r\nART & ANIMATION(4):\\n\\n\r\nThe art was nothing special because a lot of anime companies now have improved their art and animation style. \\n\\n\r\nSOUND (4):\\n\\n\r\nThere is nothing memorable about the opening and ending song.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER (1):\\n\\n\r\nI feel ashamed to say that there is no character development in this anime. Even when it comes to Natsuno's & Harumi's relationship. Their love story just goes nowhere. The characters never do anything productive and they just get very annoying. Let's take a look at the characters.\\n\\n\r\nHarumi Kazuhito:\\n\\n\r\nHe is just a bland character who just tugs along with Natsuno.\\n\\n\r\nNatsuno Kirihime:\\n\\n\r\nI was pulled into this anime because of her. She sort of reminded me like Yozora from Haganai due to her voice and accent. By the way, Marina Inoue voiced Yozora & this character here. However, in this anime, her character never gets better. She just treats Harumi like crap by cutting his skin off. She has no character depth at all unlike Yozora from Haganai. Seriously, she broke my heart. I thought that maybe her character development starts to kick in, but in the end I was wrong.\\n\\n\r\nMaxi Akizuki:\\n\\n\r\nSeriously, what was all this \"Shining, shining\"? Everytime when she appears on screen, she always says \"I'm shining, love me please, I love attention!\". After that, one of her guards dragged her away. This infuriates me a lot.\\n\\n\r\nThe rest of the cast range from annoying to bland characters. I am not going to list down everyone of them. The more I list down, the more I go crazy.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCONCLUSION:\\n\\n\r\nI just feel ashamed of myself for watching this anime. I thought that the anime might serve its purpose but sadly it didn't. This anime has no purpose. Normally, every anime has its goal and purpose in life. At least, this anime was not as boring as Amnesia. But I feel that this anime severely lacks in purpose, character development and a compelling story. \\n\\n\r\nSuch a waste of talent for Marina Inoue. She did very well in portraying the voice of Yozora. \\n\\n\r\nFor those of you who say that it is just comedy, I agree with your point. But that is just the start, and you need to develop your character to the point where the audience will get invested into them, and also the anime must serve its purpose well (i.e. compelling story) so that this will become a great comedy. But sadly, this anime never work on these items.\\n\\n\r\nI just feel heartbroken by how this turns out. Such wasted potential. \\n\\n\r\nI give this anime a 2/10.",

            "content": "Dog and Scissors had the opportunity to make something fairly interesting.... It had quite the unique plot, imagine if the dog could have occasionally turned human? see what I mean? Potential. Sadly he couldn't turn into a human and the anime exploded into a mass of small boob jokes and borderline bestiality/incest. The characters were actually DISGUSTING, they had overwhelming flaws which heavily outweighed the good making them static and truly just disturbing. Now not only does this anime have flaws with the characters but its plot? Just as bad. It starts off looking fairly promising, something fairly new to the harem industry but itquickly become repetitive and extremely boring. (no joke I would have rather watched Haruhi Suzumiya's endless eight twice in one day) So real quick back to the characters:\\n\\n\r\nKazuhito Harumi - the dog of the story. pretty much a bookworm forever alone, until he gets shot and turns into a dog of course. He is really the only (somewhat) enjoyable character in the entire anime, hit wit died at about episode 5 when he ran out of flat chest jokes; so from that point on he was pretty annoying.\\n\\n\r\nKirihime Natsuno- hated this bitch. The dog pp lover from hell, she is sadistic and just generally annoying and at the same time disturbing. You will also find out she's not a total bitch but also a worthless emo who happens to be a giant waste of space in the plot's extremely small living quarters\\n\\n\r\nMadoka Harumi- dog's little sister; total bitch\\n\\n\\n\r\nSuzuna Hiiragi- Worst character in this anime and that is REALLY saying something also a weird-ass masochist\\n\\n\r\nSo yeah those are the characters, they don't compliment one another, they don't have any dramatic tension going on; nothing. They are just there, withering with the already dead plot. Oh yeah the plot! To say the least it's quite forgettable you won't remember it for very long, nor will you want to. It starts out with Harumi getting killed and reincarnated as a dog while trying to save Natsuno from a runaway gunman. Natsuno manages to find him in his dog form at a local pet shop and takes him home. From that point on in slowly introduces more terrible characters to make you hate the anime more like his sister and the weird masochist lady who's name has already (unsurprisingly) slipped my mind. Don't waste your time on this anime guys, it really is garbage sit back and watch something good; like Kill la Kill!",

            "content": "Harumi Kazuhito isn\u2019t your ordinary bookworm.  His entire life revolves around books.  I know that may sound like hyperbole, but oh no, I mean that with complete sincerity.  I also mean it literally, but we\u2019ll get to that.  For now, Harumi is a high school boy who has dedicated his life to the pastime of reading.  He basically chain-reads, buying up books by the handfuls, burning through them at supernatural speeds, and hoarding every volume he finishes.  He even refused to live with his family, opting instead to live in an apartment by himself so he could go toschool in an area where the books he wants are able to come out slightly quicker.  One day, while he\u2019s reading in a cafe, a crazed robber bursts in and begins to wave a shotgun around.  He threatens a young woman who\u2019s distractedly writing away in another seat, and Harumi gets up to defend her...  Not because he\u2019s generally a nice person, but because he can\u2019t stand to see a fellow book-lover get hurt.  Yes, that\u2019s how his mind works...  Or, how it DID work, until the robber blew it out of his skull.\\n\\n\r\nNow freshly dead, Harumi decides he can\u2019t cross over to the land of the dead yet...  He has so many books he still wants to read, including the final book from his favorite author, Akiyama Shinobu.  He manages to pull himself back to the land of the living with the strength of this passion...  So, like I said, his life literally revolves around books...  But through some mix-up, he\u2019s reincarnated into the body of a dog.  A miniature dachshund, to be exact, who\u2019s kept in a small cage in a pet store even though he\u2019s not for sale(this is never explained).  He\u2019s soon adopted by the girl he rescued, as the connection they share has given her the ability to hear his thoughts(at least I think that\u2019s the reason?), and she takes him home...  To murder him.  Until he finds out she\u2019s really Akiyama Shinobu, she finds out he\u2019s a fan of her work, and she inexplicably becomes sexually attracted to him.  And as it turns out, these are not going to be the only extreme oddities in his life going forward, as the world around him just gets weirder and weirder.  Good god, let\u2019s just get this turkey over with already.\\n\\n\r\nStudio Gonzo may have some acclaimed titles under their belt, what with the Fullmetal Panic franchise and arguably Linkin Park\u2019s best music video having been produced by them, but when you tally their output together, the bad far outweighs the good.  They\u2019ve put out some visual wonders like Gankutsuou, but they\u2019ve also let out some real clunkers like Gantz, and while Dog and Scissors, may not be THAT far down the ladder, it\u2019s pretty close to the bottom.  The animation is stiff and cheap in a way that\u2019s honestly hard not to notice.  They\u2019re clearly able to save a lot of money with the fact that the central character, living in the body of a dog, is able to speak telepathically, without the burden of having to animate lip flaps, so all they have to do is repeat animation cycles when he\u2019s on screen...  Be it slight movements in his fur, or wagging the tuft of hair on his head...  But this advantage becomes stale very fast, as it\u2019s just a variation on the talking heads that make up the rest of the cast.\\n\\n\r\nAnd speaking of the cast, I\u2019ll be honest, the character designs look pretty good.  If you\u2019re just looking at still images, the series actually looks really crisp and pleasing to the eye.  A few of the designs look a bit cliched, and they all look a bit standard, but they\u2019re all pleasant to look at.  Harumi makes for an adorable little doggy(which makes up for how intentionally bland he looks as a human), and maybe this is a matter of personal taste, but I love the design of his chop-happy new owner Natsuno.  She\u2019s like a grown-up version of Ai Enma who walks around dressed up like an extra from the Matrix movies, and I dig it, she looks really cool.  I also really like the afro guy who runs the pet store.  not only does his apron feature a clever Jojo\u2019s bizarre Adventure easter egg, he just looks like he\u2019d be a really chill dude to hang out with.  The backgrounds are also immaculately detailed, with shelves full of diverse looking books giving our characters\u2019 collections their own sense of personality, and each character\u2019s living space is detailed enough to add a new dimension to their personalities, especially in the case of Natsuno.\\n\\n\r\nOf course, that doesn\u2019t excuse the animation.  Despite what the premise may have suggested, there\u2019s action in this series, but considering how well it moves, you may as well just read the damn light novels.  The only thing that looks like it had any real money put into it was the opening, which is fast moving, full of visual effects, and actually manages to translate the characters\u2019 awkward movements into some really fun dance cycles.  You\u2019ve probably seen an anime where characters imitate dogs or cats by moving their half-clenched fists in a certain way to resemble paws, haven\u2019t you?  This opening features nearly the entire cast doing step-dances that heavily incorporate that kind of movement, and it\u2019s so adorable you just can\u2019t help but smile when seeing it.  They also have doggy ears and tails, and as a possible result of the video\u2019s fast pace, it\u2019s disquietingly easy to not notice this the first time watching it.  This video has no right to be as fun as it is, but at least it was SOMETHING to look forward to.\\n\\n\r\nOf course, it probably helps that the song was also really catchy.  It\u2019s by Inu Musume Club, and it\u2019s called \u201cWan Wan Wan Wan N_1,\u201d and that may sound like gibberish at first glance, but there\u2019s a really popular Japanese pun behind it.  Wan is the Japanese onomatopoeia for the sound a dog makes, which any American would call Woof or Bark.  Wan also sounds like One, hence why the title begins with barking and ends with an obvious abbreviation for Number One.  This actually isn\u2019t even the only opening theme to employ this pun, hell, it\u2019s not even the best one, as Working!!! actually did it much better, but leaving that aside, it\u2019s a funny little footnote.  The ending theme is almost as delightful as it\u2019s op counterpart, with Natsuno flying a scissors-inspired private jet, her rival\u2019s black-suited bodyguards expressionlessly dancing in tandem, and generally just a bunch of creative and funny imagery gets paired to a slightly more low-key but still catchy song with the bizarre name Lemonade scandal.\\n\\n\r\nI wish I could tell you more about the music, but unfortunately, I barely noticed it at all during the show.  I guess that means it was doing it\u2019s job?  I can\u2019t remember ever hating the music...  At least not as much as generally everything else...  And I can vaguely recall tapping my foot to a few fun-sounding tunes.  This is normally where I\u2019d be looking up each individual track online, but I can only find one, by the name of Mieta Kibo, and god help me, it sounds absolutely divine.  I guess that shouldn\u2019t be a surprise, as it\u2019s credited to one Akito Matsuda, who Wikipedia says WAS in charge of the music of the series, but since there\u2019s only one track available online, I\u2019d have to rewatch the show to hear it\u2019s ost...  And I\u2019d rather stick a thumb-tack through my eyelid.  Thankfully, he\u2019s done the soundtracks to a lot of other recent anime, and now that I\u2019m hearing some of it, I suddenly REALLY want to watch Sound Euphorium.  His composition, as I\u2019ve heard, was the one and only interesting thing about Glasslip, so Dog and Scissors\u2019 music was probably just as solid.\\n\\n\r\nThe English dub is...  Well, it\u2019s weird, but hey, this is a weird show.  It\u2019s a mix of bizarrely enthusiastic standouts and adequate, okay performances, with thankfully no real duds to speak of.  At the very worst, some of the casting choices are standard, just the actors we know coming and doing their thing, catching an easy paycheck off of a role that they were suited for.  Chief among these is Blake Shepard, who I\u2019m normally not a huge fan of, playing the lead role of Harumi, and while his delivery skews the line between hammy and wooden whenever his character is excited, he manages to nail it whenever he\u2019s supposed to sound serious or sarcastic.  And then on the other end of the spectrum you have Jessica Calvello, an actor who...  Well, if you assign her to one of your characters, you\u2019re pretty much bringing out the big guns, because putting her in any role but the lead is fucking overkill.  Luckily, she\u2019s playing one half of the titular pair here, and her penchant for hitting a wide range within one single character adds a level of insanity that makes Natsuno far more tolerable than her disturbingly subtle Japanese portrayal.\\n\\n\r\nThere are other actors, of course, and I\u2019d like to bring up Luci Christian as a highlight because she put an absurd amount of effort into a suicidal self-blaming character...  And the adaptive script is really good at localizing the dialogue without straying too far from the original intent, although it does fuck up once towards the end and make i sound like someone's responding to Harumi's thought-comments...  But I really want to skip right to the second half of this review, because I have a lot to say about the writing and meat of this anime, and none of it is pleasant.  So let me just say that the dub is good, and I\u2019d highly recommend it over the sub, because the sub just sounds too grounded, which makes a lot of it\u2019s more problematic elements harder to stomach.  The dub gives it more of a wacky and bizarre personality, allowing you to mentally remove it from the harsher implications of a lot of it\u2019s so-called jokes.  Then again maybe that\u2019s just me being  dumb American and not appreciating the Japanese language or whatever.  If you\u2019re going to watch this, I recommend doing it in English.\\n\\n\r\nRight, now that that\u2019s over with, I\u2019ve been holding this in for far too long.  If I haven\u2019t already given this away, Dog and Scissors is bad.  Like, it\u2019s really, really bad.  It\u2019s not funny bad...  It\u2019s not interesting bad...  It\u2019s the kind of bad that I only place among the worst of the worst, which, for me, is a list that not even School Days has been able to crack.  I actually hesitated to write this review, and even thought about stopping a few times, because I honestly don\u2019t think a review is necessary.  This is the kind of show where you can immediately tell whether or not it\u2019s worth watching...  Yeah, it\u2019s ironic that an anime revolving around books would be so easy to judge from a glance at the cover.  In fact, here\u2019s all you really need to know to get a feel for the series:  A woman adopts a puppy because she wants to kill it, and then spares it because she wants to have sex with it.  I know that\u2019s not entirely fair, and it\u2019s taking the scenario out of context, but it\u2019s not inaccurate, either.  That literally happens, and further details don\u2019t do much to improve things.\\n\\n\r\nEverything about this series...  Well, aside from the music, dub and art...  Is either stupid, confusing or awful.  There is not one redeeming quality outside of those few production efforts.  I could do an entire Inconvenient Questions post about each individual episode, but I won\u2019t, because watching this show twice in my life was twice too many times, and I cancelled IQ for a good reason.  Thus, I\u2019m only going to focus on my biggest problems with this series.  For starters, I failed to mention until now what the biggest connection between Natsuno and Harumi is.  He can\u2019t talk, being a dog, but she can hear his thoughts.  This might not bother you, but it bugs the hell out of me...  His thoughts aren\u2019t treated like thoughts, but like regular conversation.  She hears him as though he\u2019s speaking.  That\u2019s not how thinking works.  You never stop thinking.  And yeah, you could SAY that she can only hear thoughts he sends to her, but this also isn\u2019t true, because the only reason they met is because his thoughts, from elsewhere in the city, were distracting her, and she tracked him down.\\n\\n\r\nRight there, it\u2019s established that not only can she hear his thoughts without his consent or knowledge, but that there\u2019s a long range, and she can\u2019t shut it out, but there are possibly thousands of instances in the series that directly contradict this.  Why does she ask him questions?  Why does she ever think he\u2019s lying about something?  You can hear his thoughts!  He shouldn\u2019t be able to lie to you!  Why do you each read a book at the same time, when you should just be able to hear him reading it?  Did his thoughts distracting you from writing just stop?  Did that problem go away the second you decided to not murder him?  If you were able to track him down to the pet store he was being kept in(like a parrot), why do you EVER have to look for him in order to find him?  I\u2019m sorry, I really am, but this entire premise is so frustratingly inconsistent that I honestly found it distracting throughout the series.  Even comedies...  No, especially comedies...  Have to take themselves seriously to enough of a degree that they pay attention to fucking detail.\\n\\n\r\nOh, and speaking of comedy, have you noticed how small Natsuno\u2019s breasts are?  Good, because I just spoiled at least 60% of this show\u2019s comedy.  The other 40% is largely made up of BDSM and animal cruelty.  I don\u2019t like speaking in absolutes, but I have to say this:  In anime, jokes about a character\u2019s bust size are never, ever funny.  I\u2019m not saying that because such humor is sexist, or mean-spirited...  although they are both of those things...  I\u2019m saying it because that is THE most overused joke in anime history.  Characters bringing up cup sizes happens more often than tsunderes over-reacting to misunderstandings, and that\u2019s saying something.  The only time I can ever remember a boob-size joke being funny was in Yamada\u2019s first time, when Yamada was imagining what her best friend\u2019s life must be like with big boobs, getting all jealous, but then we get a glimpse of said friend having to apply lotion to herself because of how much the damn things chafe.  See, that was a clever subversion of expectations, and it;\u2019s an example of how hard a boob-size joke has to work to even be kind of funny.\\n\\n\r\nDog and Scissors relies heavily on this idea, but it doesn\u2019t put anywhere near that level of effort into it.  Despite the fact that he\u2019s not into real live women, Harumi is constantly berating Natsuno on her bust, and even when he isn\u2019t, she\u2019s constantly seen obsessing over it.  It gets to the point where I was seriously wondering why Natsuno didn\u2019t just get a damn boob job already.  Yeah, I know I shouldn\u2019t promote a shallow image of beauty, and people look fine just as they are, but plastic surgery can help people who have confidence issues relating to their appearances.  Natsuno\u2019s a grown woman, she makes her own decisions, she lives independently off of her success, and she clearly has Seto Kaiba levels of disposable income lying around, so why doesn\u2019t she just get some work done?  oh, right, because that would take away the one lazy-ass joke that this series keeps on dragging out of the dumpster to try and amuse us, to the point that even a dead horse would tell them to stop beating a dead horse.\\n\\n\r\nAnd speaking of Natsuno, try to wrap your head around this;  She\u2019s twenty years old, hasn\u2019t written anything since she was 19, and is implied to have a bibliography that would make Stephen King jealous.  She\u2019s written a ton of novels spanning all types of genres, and at least six of her books are thick enough to contain at least a few thousand pages each.  By the time she was 19.  Not only is she considered one of the three top best-selling authors(the words \u201cIn Japan\u201d is never attached to this, so it\u2019s fair to say they mean worldwide), but the other two, who we meet in this series, are also young ladies of a similar age.  Hell, her most vocal rival spends most of her time as a pop idol!  Did any thought go into any of this?  Even her threats to kill Harumi don\u2019t add up to anything, as all she ever does is cut off portions of his fur, which grow back in less than five seconds...  And yet he still acts terrified of her, every single time she attacks him.  Hey, dumbass, she may say she\u2019s going to cut off one of your ears, but I think you\u2019re gonna be fine.\\n\\n\r\nAnd honestly, even it\u2019s focus on books and reading was completely shallow.  All dog and Scissors knows is that reading and writing are things.  Possibly fun things.  Possibly lucrative things.  It knows they exist, it knows they\u2019re important to people, but it has no deeper understanding of any of it.  Not only do we never find out anything about Natsuno\u2019s books outside of their titles and a seven deadly sins gimmick, we don\u2019t even technically know if they\u2019re fiction or non.  Hiromi is extremely pretentious, being that he loves to read, he deifies books, he defends books from critics, he judges people(even his own damn murderer) on whether or not they\u2019re readers, and get this;  He has no defined taste.  This moron would probably get his jollies off reading the ingredients on a packet of McDonalds ketchup.  This series knows as much about books as Adam Sandler knows about video games.  We never find out what literature means to anybody, but it wears it on it\u2019s sleeve.\\n\\n\r\nAnd if any of you are holding out hope that the plot and mystery aspect might have something to offer, don\u2019t.  Harumi\u2019s killer is found and dealt with so early that it can\u2019t even be considered a spoiler.  It turns out that after killing him, the killer had time to rob him before running away, and has been hiding in the second apartment that Harumi\u2019s been keeping secret from his family AND his landlady.  Chew on that for a moment.  They find him, they chase him down, and it turns out he\u2019s got Natsuno\u2019s six thickest books hiding in his coat(even though they\u2019d definitely be weighing him down and banging into his body while he was running), and he uses them as weapons in the worst anime fight scene since Master of Martial Hearts.  She beats him, and gives Harumi the choice to either kill or spare him, all while I\u2019m screaming \u201cNeither!  Call the fucking cops!\u201d  Oh, and we never meet his parents, we hear nothing of any funeral, he has no drive to get his life back, and we meet his sister, but...  Hoboy.  Had to dip into the incest shit, didn\u2019t you?  Bottom of the barrel wasn\u2019t low enough?\\n\\n\r\nDog and Scissors is available on both DVD and Bluray from Sentai Filmworks, and it\u2019s available both in dubbed and undubbed formats.  The manga and light novel are not available stateside.\\n\\n\r\nI\u2019m not gonna lie, guys, this was a tough one to get through.  The only reason I even bothered is because I\u2019ve been on hiatus for a few months, and I needed something especially bad to rage on.  Thus, I figured, why not an anime where one of the biggest running jokes is the main character commenting about shit not making sense, while completely missing the bigger picture each time?  Like I said before, the artwork and character designs are good, the music is serviceable and the opening and closing themes are awesome, but these are really the only things it has going for it, and they\u2019re the only qualities that pull it up from a possible 0 score, and I haven\u2019t even scratched the surface of what\u2019s wrong with it.  It falls apart if you give it even one seconds worth of thought, which is why I have to wonder if the people who enjoy and defend it checked their brains at the door, or at birth.  I don\u2019t condone threatening violence against dogs with a pair of scissors, but this is one tail that definitely should have been cut short.  I give Dog & Scissors a 1/10.",

If you are a fanboy of this anime then i suggest that you don't read further.\r\nA warning, I may explain how bad this anime is with a few warnings nothing big.\r\nThis anime starts of when the main character dies and turns into a dog. From the beginning that already sounds bad. This anime just has no story. The only resign why I watched it all the way was because I hoped that the story would at least get better, but it didn't. This dog man then lives with a girlbecause she could read his mind. That just doesn't make sense.\\n\r\nThe story gets a 1/10 because it has no story.\\n\\n\r\nArt and music is the only good point of the anime. The dog is so cute and there is very colorful characters. This is the only high point of the anime\\n\\n\r\nThe character development is so bad it almost made me cry. I watched all 12 episodes hoping, just hoping there would be some character development. There wasn't anything close except at the end were the girl wanted to marry the dog. The fact that she wanted to marry a animal is so disturbing. \\n\r\nBecause of no character development I will give this anime 1/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall the enjoyment is so bad because I find it so hard to enjoy this anime. I also find it so hard to believe someone used money to make this anime. This anime could have had potential.\\n\r\nI give the overall score a 2/10 it deserves a 1/10 but because of the art i gave it a extra point.\\n\\n\r\nIf you agree or disagree then let me know on my profile and leave a comment. I love hearing feedback.",

The only thing that stood out was the opening which had somewhat catchy music. But the next time Iwatched it. It  angered me as What I once throughout it was funny but now I think its to stupid. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: The characters are over the top with most having some type of mental problem that border lines on insane with a murderous little sister a Suicidal bookish girl and a commando maid.\\n\\n\r\nKazu: The most scene-able one among these characters is a dog who functions as the strait man for the series. He himself is an okay character even if his only desire in life is to read. Throughout the show he mostly only reacts to the thing around him and doesn't change much as the series continues on.      \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: For this category i mostly enjoyed myself while watching dog x scissor with it's simple comedy good enough for you to chuckle or lol. But my enjoyment was hinder by the repetitiveness of some jokes and the logic bendingly ridiculous things that happen throughout the series.",

            "content": "Inu to Hasami wa Tsukaiyou review\r\n\"Painful barking\"\r\nThere are always protagonists that separates one from the other. In this case, what really stands out is a dog as the protagonist. Welcome to the world of Dogs and Scissors!\r\nStory: 5/10\r\nInu to Hasami wa Tsukaiyou follows the misadventures of Kazuhito Harumi, a booklover who consequently transformed into a dachshund dog; and Kirihime Natsuno, a sadistic yet famous book author.\r\nAfter watching the anime, I wondered if Kazuhito will ever turn into human again - guess not! But what did I get is that humans can actually fall in love with talking animals. Inu to Hasami wa Tsukaiyou is basicallycomedy with a tinge of romance. It's definitely a \"hoity-toity\" kind of anime. But for me, I really took the anime seriously, as I was always wondering how they can depict a story such as this. I wasn't all disappointed with the whole story since I actually find it amusing. As I mentioned before it has comedy where at some point will be enough to make you grin, however it can get too nonsensical that may leave a bad taste for some. As for the plot, I expected that Kazuhito would struggle to look for a way to return human. Although it did portray that for the beginning, as the story progresses, it consequently depicts the unfortunate life of Kazuhito as a dog under Kirihime's care, showing no development in the story from then on.\\n\\n\r\n So if your looking for an anime with a decent story to begin with, then Inu to Hasami wa Tsukaiyou will give you a good start in its premise but will leave you wanting if you linger.\\n\\n\r\nVisual and Audio quality: 7/10\\n\r\nVisual quality here seems generic as it has many iterations in many anime shows of the same ecosystem; nothing outstanding but still palpable enough to keep it away from looking bad. Animations run great and I can't really point anything worth of complaining.\\n\\n\r\nAs for audio, the seiyuus did great in their performance of livening up their selected characters in the show. Soundtrack is nice on both opening and ending themes as it reflects the almost everything what the show has to offer, but not really worth listening more than once. Sound effects also doesn't disappoint.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 7/10\\n\r\nThe characters in the story are almost like synonyms and antonyms with one another; e.g. tsundere and yandere; sadist and masochist; shy girl and outgoing girl, etc. Every individual are worth knowing since they make an impact in the story. But then again, there's barely any development in the story. Character design is also done great as every character has distinctive characteristics that make them stand out in the bunch like Kirihime's red eyes, black coat and long shears and even Kazuhito - the only dog in the show.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 7/10\\n\r\nInu to Hasami wa Tsukaiyou is an anime of interest that founds itself out of the norm of having an animal as a protagonist among the cast of human beings. Despite the absurdness of the story, I still found it enjoyable. But through better or for worse, it is still a watchable show.\\n\\n",

But also believe me when I say that this anime is really good, and in a completely non-conventional way!\r\nThe premise of the story is that Kazuhito, a HUGE bookwork, protects a young lady in a cafe from a hold-up by jumping in front of a crazy man with a shotgun, to have his head blown off! All the while lady is completely obliviousto what has happened as she is crazily scribbling away!\\n\\n\r\nKazuhito enters purgatory because he has something he has to complete in life, read the 7th book of the 7 Deadly Sins series by his favourite author, Shinobu Akiyama, and his desire to read this book is so strong that he is reincarnated...as a dog. PLOT TWIST, he is telepathically bound to the young lady that he saved, who just happens to be his favourite author! Who just happens to be a sadist!\\n\\n\r\nThis is all the first episode, and from here, it goes in a loop of serious and funny!\\n\\n\r\nWithout giving too much away, there is a very serious story going on for around the first half of the series, and then it goes a little haywire, but hey, its about a sadist author, and bookworm dog, and various other characters that are as crazy and lovable!\\n\\n\r\nThis anime is worth a shot and definitely go in with an open mind!\\n\\n\r\nNatsuno (Akiyama) is easily my favourite character, and makes the story quite fun, she was really well done by the original producers, and the english dubbing is quite good to.\\n\r\nNot really any character that I 'dislike', but maybe too much of an effort to introduce characters later in the series.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all this series is a solid 8/10, and I am definitely interested in a 2nd season!.",

            "content": "Dogs, scissors and crazy women. I believe I just summed up Inu To Hasami Wa Tsukaiyou in those three main words. Inu To Hasami Wa Tsukaiyou is one of those animes that builds itself a great story, gets slightly over ambitious with the direction of the story and then comes crashing down. Hoping it would go on a more serious direction, but that is just a fleeting dream. So much potential to be brought down to a mediocre level. \r\nEven early on one can already probably predict what direction the anime is heading and predict what type of problems / plot points/twists will most likelybe introduced. Then again it is a rather light hearted comedy and actually does a decent job at it. Although it gets pretty repetitive at times, especially when the protagonist gets \"punished\" almost for every other scene, sure its very funny at first.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nStory: 7\\n\\n\r\nAs mentioned before this story takes a backseat from being anything but serious, which would have dramatically helped the series achieve greater heights. Watching how the protagonist enjoys his life yields some great laughs here and there, but ultimately falls short and becomes very uninteresting.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt & Animation: 8\\n\\n\r\nThe characters and scenes are nicely done and can tell its an aspect that wanted to be focused on more than others. Standard animation of anime of 2013. I'll admit that's one cute dog they made, with all his facial expressions and movements.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 7\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are very basic at best, nothing really stands out to be memorable however, we are introduced to a variety of over the top characters such as a masochist, tsundere, Moe and etc. The interactions between the main character and the female lead are probably Inu To Hasami Wa Tsukaiyou's biggest strength looking at the anime as a whole. There is some character development in this anime, but it's displayed in a rather odd pace.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nWow Factor: 7.2\\n\\n\r\nInu To Hasami Wa Tsukaiyou begins with a very promising premier, then slowly dwindles downs until it becomes nothing more but another anime on the list. Don't get me wrong, watching the new life of the protagonist is truly enjoyable to watch and the light hearted comedy is definitely there, but essentially nothing seems to quite stand out.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nFinal Grade:  7.3 / 10\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nDo I recommend this series to watch? Perhaps, if you like a light hearted comedy with a hint of odd romance.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\n             + Good initial Premier\\n\r\n             + Funny at times\\n\r\n             + Shining!\\n\\n\r\n              - Wish the plot went in a different direction (disappointing)\\n\r\n              - one sided humor & slightly repetitive\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nReview by: AzurexSky of AniRaters",

The relationship dynamic between are two mains makes for a lot of funny slapstick moments, in fact there is a lot of adult-ish humour in this show, if anything it is at times very funny. Also, it the relationship between dog and owner(ish) is at times sweet and endearing, but mostly its just batshit insane. randomly jumping from mystery, to fight scenes to writing contests this anime is all over the place, don'ttry and apply logic, it wont work. Although you could say this is bad, i think its one of the strengths of the show, you genuinely have no idea what could happen at any point. If you have some time and you want to watch something which doesn't require much thought or investment and gives you some cheap laughs, watch this.",

            "content": "Plot: (5/10) To be honest if you are looking for a plot while watching this you would probably need a magnifying glass and a metal detector. Each episode feels episodic with little to none character development. After watching all 12 episodes I still don't know what the whole point of the anime was but nonetheless I still enjoyed it. The comedy and characters make up for the plot in a way\r\nCharacters: (7/10) If I was to describe all the characters in this anime with one word, I would have to say the are all a bunch of weirdoes with one or two normal people. Wehave an editor who is a member of the masochistic order, a sadist author, a talking dog, a bro-con yandere younger sister, a singing maid who's broom turns into a sword, a guy with an afro, random half naked guys and the list of weirdoes continues. But the characters give Inu to Hasami an original feel and add make the gags even funnier.\\n\\n\r\nSound: (8/10)The Opening Is Wan Wan Wan Wan sang by Inu Musume Club\\n\r\nThe Ending Is Lemonade Scandal sang by Yuu Serizawa who is also the voice actor for Maxi\\n\r\nI loved both the openings and endings and I ended up watching them most of the time instead of my usual habit of skipping through Ops and Eds. They have a catchy ring to them and falls under the list of the type of music I Like.\\n\\n\r\nArt (6/10)Art is better than something that came out in 2006 and such but to me it felt kind of dull. It wasn't anything special, It was just something you would expect in 2013. The art didn't really give it a boost in appeal but was ok to look at. It was average.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 7/10\\n\r\nOverall this is more of a gag anime with hilarious jokes. I laughed a lot during each episode and it was the only thing keeping me attached to this anime. I couldn't wait for the next episode to come out during the next week. It wasn't the best anime this season but I still found it enjoyable. I don't recommend this if you are looking for something with a strong plot or anything but if you like gag animes with a little romance this would be the perfect anime for you.",
