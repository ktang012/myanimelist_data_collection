            "content": "TL;DR: A disappointing second season that feels like the director & script writers had no idea where Mamare Touno is planning to go with the story of Log Horizon, so just adapted enough to pad out the 25 episode run time & hope that the audience figures out how it all connects together themselves.There are some good episodes & it explores interesting ideas (or brings them up, at least), but ultimately they don't add up to 25 episodes worth of content. Don't bother unless they announce a third season, & even then you'll probably be better off looking for an abridged version on youtube thanwatching all of this.\\n\\n\r\nThere are times when one wonders if the scriptwriters for a show & the author of the source material being adapted ever talk to each other. When series, particularly longer series, feel like they're becoming increasingly unfocused as the source material begins to run out, you'd think that the script writer & author would work together to at least come up with a framework for where the story is going so the adaptation knows what to focus on without deviating too much from where the author plans to go with their story. Sadly, it seems in Log Horizon 2's case, either nobody knows where things are going, or nobody is communicating it. (note this review assumes you've seen LH1)\\n\\n\r\nRemember how LH1 ended with a climactic battle against the goblin king's forces whilst also revealing a new, human threat in the form of Nureha, guild leader of Plant Hwyaden who seems as powerful a mage as Shiroe? Well it seems the author or script writers forgot, because none of that really matters in LH2. Instead, LH2 focuses on three events that all feel like they're setting the ground for something big, but they don't know what. First is a mysterious player killer in Akihabara, somehow able to get around the zone's rules against combat between players. Following on from that (although both events occur at the same time) Shiroe seeks to deal with the financial problems the round table are facing by leading an epic raid on an El Dorado mine where all the world's gold is alleged to come from. These things concluded, the characters finally get around preparing for the prospect of war by...sending the younger guild members on a fetch quest so they can make magic bags.\\n\\n\r\nAll these stories continue Log Horizons rather enjoyable combining of a fantasy adventure setting with MMO rules, & the interesting ways they come together. The first story arc occurs against a backdrop the sudden & destabalising event of all the flavour text for the games many items suddenly becoming real, resulting in, among other things, Crusty being sucked into apparent oblivion by his weapon. Other issues not raised in LH1 are explored, including the idea of mortality & what it's actually like for the adventurers to die & how different people are responding to their being trapped in this new world. We meet characters that we wouldn't expect, such as a Chinese farmbot & Shiroe's alt character Roe2, who also seem to have come to life. Friction between the People of the Land & adventurers continues & we also, finally, start getting a hint at why the players of Elder Tale were sucked into the game in the first place.\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately, LH2 tends to skip over the more interesting parts while doing very little to try & tie everything together. In LH1 you had a real sense of progression between the different story arcs. Things started with everyone just getting used to functioning in this new world, which led to the Akihabara adventurers trying to better organise themselves, which led to their becoming diplomatically involved with the nearby PotL kingdoms & so on. There's no such sense of one thing building into another in LH2. Each story just kind of happens & ends with no real apparent impact. We're told it's impactful, sure. But the point is we don't see it in the same way you could in LH1.\\n\\n\r\nIt doesn't help that LH2 is full of what can only be thought of as filler episodes. LH2 is adapting two less novels than LH1 did (3 & 5 respectively), & it really feels like they're trying to spread less content over the same number of episodes. One particularly egregious example comes in the El Dorado raid, which involves returning Silver Sword guild leader William giving an episode long speech that boils down to \"I'm a sad loser irl, but in Elder Tale I feel important.\" The raid itself is actually quite enjoyable, as it's fun watching Shiroe & the adventurers reacting to a raid zone that has been designed specifically to be unbeatable. The ending is a massive anticlimax, though.\\n\\n\r\nLH2 also has an annoying tendency to introduce interesting ideas only to ignore them. The aforementioned Chinese bot character just sorta shows up for a bit before wandering off. Kanami, the tits & fists former leader of the mythical Tea Party shows up completely at random, first in a story one of Plant Hwyaden's leaders is telling another which gets cut off with a convenient \"I don't know what happened after this\" just as his story (which is the most interesting thing to happen in LH2 up to this point) was in danger of running into two episodes. \\n\\n\r\nAdventurer mortality, & how adventurers see images of their real life in the time between dying & resurrecting, is touched on on a couple of occasions, most notably in the form of the Odyssey Knights; adventurers who seek out death so they can briefly glimpse their past lives before returning. Unfortunately, all the Odyssey knights are really used for is to let Touya give a boyscout speech about the importance of living. What the characters actually have to say about the subject is equally disappointing, the writing not being nearly up to expressing the complexities of the ideas being discussed.\\n\\n\r\nConversely, LH2 is happy to waste a lot of time on things I have no interest in. The magic bag fetch quest takes up something like eight episodes, almost all of which is spent just watching the kids of Log Horizon wander about being happy as Izuma learns to be more confident in her musicianship. We apparently only have five minutes for the round table to discuss ideas like how to deal with adventurers who can't cope with being trapped in Elder Tale, but there's time for an entire valentine's day episode. Considering the apparent impending war that was teased at the end of LH1, everything in LH2 just feels like it's trying to fill time & hopes you don't notice that for most of the season nothing really happens to progress the story.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of romance, LH continues having some of the most awful relationship writing in anime. Nyanta, everyone's favourite middle aged furvert, continues to groom little red moeblob Serara, which the other characters seem to find hilarious & sweet but I find disturbing & painful to watch. That oh so funny not-love triangle between a NEET (Shiroe) a shutin (Atatsuki) & an under-aged girl (Minori) continues to rear its ugly head as well. Oh & in case you thought the flirting between Naotsugu & Marie was too normal, worry not; for now there is Tetora, an idol who takes a liking to Naotsugu. This is apparently hilarious because Tetora is actually a guy but Naotsugu is the only character who doesn't realise. I guess it had to be made weirder because the relationship between Rudy & Isuzu has greater prominence in LH2 & there can only be room for one \"normal\" relationship.\\n\\n\r\nPlanet Hwyaden is a group that LH2 also completely fails to integrate into the story. Remember how Nureha seemed like she was going to become the antagonist of LH2? Well somewhere between that & the start of LH2 it seems something important got lost, because she is now the boot-licking bitch of some elf member of the guild, literally eating dirt off the floor. It strikes me that it would be quite an important piece of information to let us know how she went from one state to the other, but LH2 doesn't seem to think so. \\n\\n\r\nIndeed quite what Planet Hwyaden are supposed to be doing in LH2 isn't clear. At first they seem to be built up as an example of how adventurers have responded to the challenge of organising themselves in different ways, taking a more authoritarian approach to governing than the more mercantile oligarchy, round table of guilds in Akihabara. But as the season continues & the supposed showdown between the two recedes into memory, it feels like they just become a stand in for whenever the show needs a bad guy. That is until the final arc pretty much completely abandons the idea of war between adventurers in favour of a new enemy, at which point one wonders why Plant Hwyaden were introduced at all. \\n\\n\r\nBeyond that, I feel compelled to voice one personal gripe I have with LH, that being the continued degradation of Atatsuki as a character. It seems so long ago now that she started out in LH as a shy but pretty badass ninja. One of the things I didn't like about LH1 was how her development through the season felt like she was more & more being pushed into the role of the longing lover watching from the shadows. LH2 continues this with gusto, to the point that Shiroe can unironically say \"you're starting to become quite the ninja\" like it's not a massive insult. Between her & Nureha it's almost like the writers find the idea of powerful women as important characters too hard to comprehend. \\n\\n\r\nIt was perhaps a bit of a surprise to see LH2 come only a year after LH1 with the same number of episodes, given the comparative lack of source material to draw from. In addition to this, it kind of feels like LH2 either lacked the time & resources of LH1's production, or at least it doesn't seem to have been as well managed. Studio Deen don't have a Stirling reputation among anime fans, & while I can't say LH2 looks bad, it does feel a bit lackluster compared to LH1 (at least as I remember it), particularly towards the end where it feels they hadn't accounted for the action scenes that the story called for. Occasionally characters do go noticeably off model during combat or when viewed from an odd angle, which is always fun to spot. But given that LH is not as action focused as a lot of fantasy shows of it's ilk, one can forgive it for the the most part. \\n\\n\r\nLH2, then, is another example of a second season that struggles to maintain the momentum of the first. Stuck trying to stretch less material over the same episode count as LH1, it feels like the writers just grabbed whatever they could out of the books with no real idea of how it all fits together in the grand scheme things. Had they been able to wait another year for more books to be written, or gone with a 13 episode length instead of 25, I think they could have told a more focused, concise story that felt like it was worth picking up after LH1. As it is, unless & until they announce a third season I see no reason for anyone to watch LH2. Even then, you'd be better off just reading the cliffnotes or watching an abridged version than sitting through all 25 episodes.",

            "content": "Having finished the entire second season here are some of my opinions on how this season turned out. I have assumed anyone reading this has watched the first season. \r\nStory: 6 (Fair)\r\nThe first half of this season focused in a lot more on the element of MMORPG raiding and immediately the pace of the show slowed down. With each episode covering usually two different scenarios within the world for our beloved characters to face. Overall I would say that if you're a big MMORPG player you'll connect with the characters more but if you're not then it will just leave you confused. By the secondhalf we were given with a valentines day filler episode and an enjoyable Kanami episode to give an idea of what's going elsewhere in the world. Then the kids' arc... similar to the last season there was an arc to develop the younger members of Log Horizon and that was done pretty well. But here it just felt like they didn't grow much but rather helped reinforce their own ideals and morals in addition to giving very little back story to their lives in the real world. Overall it didn't add much to the story, however the inclusion of a certain character and introduction of another certainly helped but left me clueless as to their purpose of being there. However after that arc the story seemed to pick up but then felt drawn out with the addition of what felt like filler episodes. And then the final two episodes..... Oddly these felt like some of the more enjoyable and entertaining episodes of the entire season with elements left over that pointed towards a direction the story would take. This was what annoyed me the most since I enjoyed them so much I wanted a third season. \\n\\n\r\nLooking back  the same plot threads which were started were left unfinished (mainly because the anime has caught up to the source material therefore a third season is a long way off). The story followed a very heavily focused ''raid'' element and a few filler episodes. Overall enjoyable but with the filler episodes and poor pacing I give it a 6.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 7 (Good)\\n\\n\r\nI would give the art style a 7 because obviously there was a change in studio and possibly budget was an issue. In the end I got used to the changes. Animation was again not great but better in some places than others, the finale seemed to be where they did a better job at least. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 7.5 (Very Good/Good)\\n\\n\r\nThe OST for Log Horizon didn't change and since I enjoyed the first season OST as well, I didn't really have any gripes with it for the second season. Voice actors didn't change and the new seiyuu I felt fit their roles.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 7 (Good)\\n\\n\r\nThere were quite a few introductions to new characters we had never really met aside from cameos and then some from the weird jungle of the anime rainforest. I enjoyed the new characters and they were extremely entertaining but the development of the characters were rather disappointing compared to last season. We're still left with a question of, 'What are they trying to do within the world.' We also got a little taste as to who the ''villains'' of Elder Tale are but their inclusion to the story was very minor. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9 (Great)\\n\\n\r\nEven with the flaws of this season I still enjoyed it and being an MMOPG gamer I think it helped. I know many who would find this season to be a huge disappointment compared to the first season but considering what I suspect as being budget changes and a new studio I can see why. Comedic elements were still entertaining for me and the action and characters were still enjoyable.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8 (Very Good)\\n\\n\r\nWith the inclusion of my own enjoyment I gave it an 8. A third season doesn't look likely to be soon because the LNs have now been caught up. I felt that maybe there wasn't enough material from the LNs to make a second season. Let's just hope they receive a better budget and have more material to work with for a third season. \\n\\n\r\nThis is my first review I have done and any constructive criticism on how to better write my reviews would be welcomed.",

            "content": "I've watched the entirety of both seasons of Log Horizon and found the first season very enjoyable. It wasn't without its faults, but I felt that it made much much better use of its premise than Sword Art Online had, and avoided many of the character pitfalls that plagued SAO. However, I have to say that season 2 was a MASSIVE disappointment.\r\nStory 6/10\r\nThere are several story arcs throughout the 2nd season of Log Horizon, but the lasting impression that they left was minimal. The story arcs for the vast majority of the season feel like they carry no importance at all but even worse, theyprogress at a snail-like pace. Episode after episode of filler were shoved through the season while the main story arcs seemed to be shelved for many episodes without mention before being returned to.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, the season does tackle one of the problems that I thought was glaringly missing from the first season: the attempt to return home. However, this particularly story arc feels rushed because it's so short in comparison to all the filler episodes that came before it.\\n\\n\r\nAnother part of the story I had a massive problem with was when the show handed itself off entirely to the kids. This is my opinion, and some people may disagree, but I believe that the children in the show should be complementary characters at most. However, one story arc followed the children going on a quest by themselves for several episodes without any lookback at the others.\\n\\n\r\nArt 7/10\\n\\n\r\nI thought the first season of Log Horizon didn't look like anything special but I thought it was still very solid artwork. Some of the monsters looked really good and the action was great. While all that still remains for the most part, for some reason, many of the faces look very different. Nyanta, Serara, and several others look quite different from season 1 or even the first half of season 2. It may not be enough to be a deterrent, but it is quite noticeable.\\n\\n\r\nOther than some characters looking off, the action was pretty solid, and the raid bosses looked great. Some of the copy & paste for the hordes of creeps looked meh but that's understandable.\\n\\n\r\nSound 8/10\\n\\n\r\nNot really much to say here. Music is fine and voicework is fine as well.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 7/10\\n\\n\r\nThis is another part where I feel that season 2 falls short of season 1. It not only introduces many new characters, but also tries to retain every single character from season 1. This results in them really struggling to develop some of the characters meaningfully. One of the new characters, Tetra, doesn't really seem to have any characteristic besides obnoxiousness.\\n\\n\r\nAlso, of the villains, only one gets really significant screen time and explanations as to her motives. The motives of the other antagonists are left unexplained and it just seems like the show is struggling because it has too many characters.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 5/10\\n\\n\r\nThis was a personal thing, but I really loved Log Horizon season 1. I felt that it was everything SAO could and should have been. However, this 2nd season took a massive dip in quality. There were just too many story arcs that were unimportant and so many filler episodes just left me bored and uninterested. Also, there were way too many characters being introduced without proper development.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 5/10\\n\\n\r\nVery very disappointing. There were some bright spots and the very early parts of the 2nd season really lived up to the 1st season's quality, but then it takes a massive dip and becomes a boring snoozefest of endless filler episodes.",

            "content": "(This has been adapted from my reddit thread. Spoilers ahead!)\r\nSomething that Log Horizon 2nd Season does that is somewhat strange is bring us into another world. Not just a new world in the sense that the anime represents such a fiction, but a world within another. The people of Elder Tales experience this world and discover what anyone would: that perhaps their place among it isn't right. This feeling of not belonging is something that is found not only within our own lives but within the anime as well. Indeed, in more ways than one.\r\nSTORY\r\nLog Horizon 2 begins pretty much where the first season leftoff. There are still problems to be solved within the world they inhabit, with the \"Villain in Glasses\" doing everything he can to alleviate their worries.\\n\\n\r\nThis second season of Log Horizon moves away from the political subterfuge that the first season capitalized on for a somewhat simple reason: this is the continuation. The anime already has its setting, the characters, and a wide set of rules in place and therefore opted to focus on an actual narrative as opposed to using the politics as a vehicle for everything that was going on. Unfortunately, it doesn't work. And this is because Log Horizon 2 refuses to do anything with any of the outcomes or plot lines that it follows and establishes. For example, it brings up the idea of item effects becoming true -- a rather neat development. But why this is the case or ways in which this affects what is happening around them are left unexplained. A more prominent example is the civil war that occurs between the People of the Land and the Adventurers. It sounds like an interesting route to take, but is never looked at seriously and even discarded by season's end. This rational can be found with nearly all of what Log Horizon 2 has to offer -- the \"Geniuses,\" the Odyssey Knights, Roe 2, Kanami's events, training the People of the Land, death on the moon, etc. -- and only serves to make the plot seem incoherent in execution.\\n\\n\r\nIn order to have some kind of order, Log Horizon 2 splits itself up into essentially four different arcs: the Akatsuki arc, the Money arc, the Kids arc, and the Moth arc. Furthermore, each is categorized into two (given) themes: the first two are about \"rising once more\" while the last two are about \"running with friends.\" And for the most part, this kind of separation works in the show's favor. Akatsuki's arc showcases her struggle, her need to prove her worth not only to the people around her, not only to Shiroe, but also to herself. She gets beaten, learns from her mistakes, and even perishes at one point. But that doesn't deter her resolve; rather, it bolsters her fortitude and allows her to rise to a new level both in body and in spirit. The Money arc, in a similar fashion, follows Shiroe, Williams, and Williams' guild as they fought over and over, never giving up or in. They band together to beat the impossible, which acts as a nice segue into the anime's second half and second motif; the notion of camaraderie. The Kids arc demonstrates the need to understand and nurture relationships between both the people you love and those you may not even know. And the Moth arc clearly depicts the idea that one almost never has to deal with everything on his or her own. That is, there are people around you who are able and willing to provide the support you need; you just need to ask.\\n\\n\r\nLog Horizon 2 also manages to maintain a thematic presence between its respective arcs, too. And it's what was talked about in the introduction; not feeling like you belong. There are those times when it is difficult to understand the situation you are in or finding yourself questioning your own mindset, so you begin pondering what exactly the issue is. Log Horizon 2 does this for each of its partitions: Akatsuki wonders why she cannot be by Shiroe's side, Williams talks of finding solace in the gaming world, the kids witness a group of people who despise their position, and inkling feelings of wanting to return home loom large over many Adventurers. This kind of development is natural, especially in regards to that last point; literally being in a foreign land can cause any number of mixed emotions. But what each segment teaches is that it isn't so much worrying about belonging, but how you manage such a predicament in the first place. Which is what the previous themes aimed at doing; rising to the challenge and relying on the people around you. By following these two routes, belonging stops being an issue and starts being an afterthought. It doesn't happen instantaneously -- the Adventurers prove that finding one's place is a difficult process -- but when you do find that peace of mind, great happenings almost always await.\\n\\n\r\nANIMATION\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately for Log Horizon 2, the art and animation is severely lacking.\\n\\n\r\nThe art for the show, despite the world being so open and free, is filled with rather boring locales. Muddy caves, plain cities, and leafy forests are normally seen, but nothing is extraordinary. The real detriment, though, is the show's often distracting lack of quality. There are numerous occasions where characters are either malformed or given disproportionate features, causing their designs to be lacking in detail and attention.\\n\\n\r\nThe world within the anime lends itself well to interesting character designs, and therefore that is what's given here. Shiroe's signature white cloak, Akatsuki's ninja outfit, and Tetra's idol attire are easy examples of fun designs that fit the show's mood and provide the audience with the sense that these people really are just playing a video game.\\n\\n\r\nActual animation, though, is mostly below average. Many of the fights are given still frames or reduced actions that do not come off as appealing. And since a lot of what goes on within the show is dialogue between the characters, where only mouth movements are found, it only helps to accentuate the lack of animation during the battles that occur.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS\\n\\n\r\nLog Horizon 2 is an anime with a large cast, almost too large for its own good. It isn't able to adequately peer at every character individually and instead sets its sights on two. One makes sense and the other is interesting: Akatsuki and Isuzu, respectively.\\n\\n\r\nAkatsuki is a servant first and ninja second. As such, when she is left behind by her master, Shiroe, she feels conflicted. She cannot seem to understand why she has been delegated to such a role; that her place at Shiroe's side is almost unneeded. She feels completely weak, and when she is defeated in Akihabara it only helps to reaffirm this type of thinking. Yet, it's exactly what she required: within the dream-like world she meets up with the person she calls master. While there she learns that it isn't because she is weak that she was kept from fighting alongside him and the others, but because she is so strong, that only she could take up the task given to her, that Shiroe wanted her to remain at home. Upon reviving, she trains her heart out, and with the aide of those around her, she excels to new heights. She earns a special \"Teaching,\" protects the town, and most of all, is confident now more than ever in the abilities that she always had.\\n\\n\r\nDuring the second half of Log Horizon 2, during the Kids arc, the show actually chooses Isuzu of all people to really focus on. Her class as a Bard isn't just coincidence; her characterization reveals that, in the real world, not only was her father a renowned musician but she had taken up the guitar as well to follow in his wake. But she laments of her father's lost fame and of her own inadequacies as a guitarist. She feels that what she has to offer isn't worth much of anything, especially if the person she always looked up to, someone better than her, was always pushed to the side. But as Rudy, her close friend, describes to her, it isn't about being good or bad at whatever you do that counts. As long as you try, that you give it everything you have without any regrets, is what truly matters. For his people are not capable of creating the tunes she can; she is to them as her father is to her. Meaning what she can do is not only worthwhile but unique, more so than she ever thought possible. And with this newfound vigor, she does what she can for the people around her, supporting them in the way that only she is capable of doing.\\n\\n\r\nWhat both Akatsuki and Isuzu demonstrate, besides their respective developments, is something that many of the characters experience throughout the entirety of the season. And that is the notion of self-esteem. Having the confidence to do what needs to be done -- to get up when fallen, to rely on your friends, to do what is right -- doesn't always come naturally. For many people, it's a difficult feeling that isn't inherent and must instead be \"taught\" to those that don't have a lot of it to begin with. This occurs with the former two ladies. But there are also those who lose it after having acquired it -- Shiroe experiences such a dilemma near the end where he doesn't fully believe in the path he has chosen. Touya holds his ground against the suicidal knights, Nureha stands up for herself, and Demiqas swallows his pride to help the very man who humiliated him. Having the confidence to perform certain deeds can be difficult to obtain, but once it is found, and as the characters of the anime portray, it brings with it its own brand of goodness.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND\\n\\n\r\nThe OP for Log Horizon 2 remains the same, which is a wise decision. It's catchy, it's fun, and it's the database; it is literally Log Horizon's signature sound. The ED is fine, utilizing cute singing, a simple beat, and dainty piano playing. It can be quite catchy itself, especially with the ending \"la's\" that are used.\\n\\n\r\nThe rest of the soundtrack remains more or less the same from the first season as well. It contains uplifting battle tones with hard guitar, drums, and choirs -- the \"Main Theme\" is both the best track for this example and the best track that the show has to offer. It also uses mysterious tunes during explanatory moments, slow guitar playing during sadder ones, and flutes during the nonchalant times. It's a nice OST that captures the mood of the anime quite well.\\n\\n\r\nAs far as voice-acting is concerned, those involved give around average performances. A special shout-out goes to Yukiyo Fujii as Tetora for her cracking voice while speaking.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT\\n\\n\r\nI found myself not quite enjoying what this one was doing, mostly because it transitioned away from the politics and tried too hard to bring in as many different elements as it could. On top of this, many of the battles weren't very impressive to see despite them garnering so much focus. Furthermore, while the Kids arc was nicely executed, it was still quite boring to watch unfold.\\n\\n\r\nThe only characters that I had a fun time watching were Leonardo (the turtle) and Tetora (the idol). The former was just a really cool dude while the latter was always having fun, looking to bring a smile to both me and everyone else in the world. Leonardo hardly got any screen time, unfortunately; he was placed in the same spot as Nyanta -- really cool but underutilized. And Tetora couldn't always be around to bring about the laughs.\\n\\n\r\nLog Horizon 2nd Season attempts to continue what its predecessor started. Unfortunately, due to an awkward story, shoddy animation, and boring segments throughout, this tale seems to still be questioning its own sense of belonging.\\n\\n\r\nSUMMARY\\n\\n\r\nStory: Fine, thematically strong but coherently weak\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: Bad, low quality art style, good character designs, below average actual animation\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Good, Akatsuki, Isuzu, and the rest find the confidence to fight\\n\\n\r\nSound: Good, great OP, good ED, good soundtrack, average VA work\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Bad, lame fights, boring arcs, and only a few likable characters\\n\\n\r\nFinal Score: 5/10",

            "content": "Story:\r\nIs Log Horizon 2 filler? Now, let's stop right there. The very fact that I even considered leading off a review with this question doesn't bode well. But, to answer that question: No, Log Horizon 2 is not filler, but it feels like filler. Everything in the show is canon, covering 4 light novels and even going into some material that hasn't been officially released yet. Season 1 adapted 5 LNs, so we're already looking at slightly less source material. Within these 4 LNs + extras of material, Log Horizon 2 decides to adapt 1 of them to only 1 episode, so we're left with3 LNs + extras for 24 episodes.\\n\\n\r\nSo it should come to no surprise that the first point of contention is the dreadful pacing of the show. The plot moves extremely slow; there were multiple times that I got bored because I wanted the show to move a bit faster and get to the point. Log Horizon was never a fast paced show to begin with, but there were several episodes (especially in the 3rd arc) where it felt like virtually nothing happened. In fact, I might go so far as to say the first 21.5 episodes of Log Horizon 2 were a waste of time. We get 3 entire arcs during those episodes but we never actually see the results of those arcs. The plot feels contrived to the point of searching for something for the characters to do rather than them actually moving toward an obtainable goal. The last couple episodes sort of introduce an interesting goal, but by then it's too late. However, these episodes are actually good. Had we gotten a whole season of this it would have been much better.\\n\\n\r\nBut why don't we get any results? Because those arcs existed for the sake of character development. Log Horizon 2 develops Shiroe, Akatsuki, and the kids a little bit, but it takes way too long to do so. Log Horizon's strong suit was never its characters; it was the world and its MMO aspects that made the show interesting. So the fact that we spend so much time on one of the less interesting parts of Log Horizon hurts the show immensely.\\n\\n\r\nWhile it spends so much time developing the cast, it also introduces a bunch of interesting ideas to the world. But Log Horizon 2 never goes anywhere with these cool ideas. They're shrugged off in favor of character development. Any expansion of these ideas would have been great.\\n\\n\r\nNow I want to talk about the 3rd arc in particular. We follow the Log Horizon kids (colloquially called the Noob Squad) as they go on a quest. It's so boring and unrelatable that I wanted to drop the show, and I almost never drop shows. The Noob Squad is far and away the worst characters in the cast, and getting a second arc (they had a short one in S1) devoted to them is just too much. The slice of life \"comedy\" parts of this arc in particular are more cringe worthy than anything else.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\\n\r\nAgain, Log Horizon 2 tries its best to develop its characters. We learn about them a little more and maybe change a little bit, but it doesn't really add anything to the show. Again, Log Horizon's strength was never its characters. Perhaps the biggest fault in terms of the cast is its sheer size. With 41 characters listed on MAL, it's unsurprising that the viewer might forget about some of the minor ones, especially when it comes to stuff like guild affiliation. Now, a large cast is not necessarily a bad thing. Legend of the Galactic Heroes doesn't get bashed for its huge cast. But Log Horizon doesn't always know what to do with all its characters, so many of them fall by the wayside.\\n\\n\r\nShiroe is still the best character in the show, but his screen time is limited compared to the first season. It's really disappointing because Shiroe was the one who most drove the plot forward in the first season. Plus we only get a fraction of the glasses pushes.\\n\\n\r\nOh, remember Nyanta? Everyone's favorite cat swashbuckler chef shows up for an episode or two just to remind us he exists. Instead we get Tetra, who serves almost no purpose besides comic relief.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\\n\r\nLog Horizon 2's OST uses many of the same tracks from the first season, and there's nothing fundamentally wrong with that. The songs are good; they usually fit the mood fine and there's nothing really to complain about there. Log Horizon's OP, Database, also returns for another go. Database is a good song, but I don't think we needed 50 episodes of it. Log Horizon 2's OP also shamelessly spoils some stuff from the series again. The ED isn't bad, but the transition into the ED is awful. There are a few episodes that end on a somber or intense note, and then the super happy ED pops in just before the episode actually ends and destroys the mood. The voice acting is fine. The kids' voices can get annoying though.\\n\\n\r\nArt/Animation:\\n\\n\r\nLog Horizon switches animation studios for its second season, going to the infamous Studio Deen. The first thing you'll notice is that characters look slightly different. It's most noticeable on characters with long hair such as Marielle. The designs are more faithful to the original source material, but I personally found the slight redesigns in the first season to be aesthetically pleasing.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation itself is bad to the point of distraction. Characters' faces never quite look right. Tons of shortcuts were taken and it's completely noticeable and frustrating.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\\n\r\nNow, I could throw all this aside if the show manages to be fun to watch. For me, it wasn't. When my first thought week by week is \"Let's get this over with\" then that's a terrible sign. The show has a bunch of slice of life moments that are supposed to be funny or heartwarming or something, but they're tiresome and cringe worthy. The action scenes are all right, but they're few and far between and also take a few animation shortcuts that don't make them as fun as they could be. The plot isn't particularly engaging until the very end, but those last few episodes aren't enough to redeem the boredom that's before it. There are a few moments I genuinely enjoyed, but by and large it felt like a drag.\\n\\n\r\n2/10\\n\\n\r\nYes, this is a harsh score. But if I can't take much of any enjoyment from the show and it doesn't really succeed in any area, it's tough to give it points at all.",

            "content": "If there was one series that can focus down the MMORPG concept to its core, Log Horizon would be the first name to pop into my mind. The franchise based off of the light novel of the same name returns for a second season and remains consistent with exactly the way it was. Only this time, the sequel is operated by a different studio (DEEN rather than Satelight.). Still, some of the core concepts of the series remain and the sequel is by no means a mud puddle to be stepped on. \r\nAs a former MMORPG player from a popular online game, I was intriguedby the way Log Horizon is designed. The first season focused down on the world building and characters in a very concise way. When it came to mechanics, the show was like a professor on steroids with the info dumping and game concepts. Likewise, the sequel concentrates on world building just as precise as the first season with some other twists and turnabouts. A popular question that may come to mind is if it\u2019s required to watch the first season? My simple answer is: of course. Watching Log Horizon 2 without finishing the first season would be like taking a math test without studying for the formulas. While the consequences aren\u2019t disastrous, the sequel will be a much better experience if you completed the first season.\\n\\n\r\nTo freshen up a bit, Log Horizon takes place in the world of \u2018Elder Tale\u2019. The world itself is based on a  post-apocalyptic setting where fantasy defies reality. (that\u2019s actually a bit ironic considering the tagline of the show is \u2018this is our reality\u2019). But when you add in fantasy and magic, it becomes MMORPG in its most classic style. As you may expect, members of the famous Log Horizon guild returns. Characters you should be familiar with such as Shiroe, Akatsuki, Naotsugu, Nyanta, Tohya, and Minori are just a few to name. The sequel also opens doors to new characters such as the trap Tetra as well as conflicts that may change the story forever. What you should be familiar with Log Horizon should also be the style. In general, the series has a slow pacing. Some episodes will drag and ultimately will take patience to get through. There is also a much less focus on the real life counterparts of the characters as opposed to their online counterparts; do note that a few episodes does offer a glimpse at their past. Nonetheless, Log Horizon is a show more about its world and characters rather than just progressive story movement. It still retains its various political and survival conflicts but doesn\u2019t push that as its main course.\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of story, the sequel offers various glimpses at different sides of the series. From a bit of murder mystery to dungeon raids, the series adapts many gimmicks. It also stays true with many of MMORPG\u2019s mechanics such as gold farmers, bots, pkers, and of course death. And in similarity with the first season, the show continuously presents its mechanics in a way that should be straightforward to almost any viewer. Even if you have never experienced the thrills of a MMORPG game, Log Horizon should be like a sample to you for what it should be. Also more noticeable about the series revolves with the political affairs and economics mechanics. After all, the author (Mamare Touno) is also known for writing Maoyuu Maou Yuusha with its focus on a bit of those as part of the gimmick. But what Log Horizon does better here is the balance with its story. Each episode either tells its own story or transits into what it already has set up. It can also shift in many ways to convey various moods. An apex part of the story is during the first half when the series explores the concept death and its aftermath. At a more careful glance, it\u2019s evident that Log Horizon has an exotic way to portray such an event. It adapts emotions with realism despite taking place in the fantasy. It recreates human emotions in a world where nothing is really real. And in retrospect, death in MMORPG is one of the most debatable topics of controversy. In this sequel, it hit the nail in the coffin with that concept.\\n\\n\r\nWith a large cast of characters, it shouldn\u2019t be surprise if some gets neglected by characterization. The main purpose of the show isn\u2019t to give every single character their chance to shine but rather a way for them to play a role. It should therefore be clear that some characters\u2019 roles will have a larger impact than others. However, it should be treat that the sequel also focuses on other groups in Log Horizon besides just Shiroe\u2019s party. Unfortunately, Log Horizon\u2019s characterization can suffer a bit when it comes to dynamics. There\u2019s not much change from the first season with character relationships. Most of them still goes without much development. Take the example of Shiroe and Akatsuki. Although they share some special moments in the first half of the show, their relationship doesn\u2019t progress further than being close friends. Similarly, Tohya\u2019s team still retains their adventurous nature but without offering big chances for its members on an individual level in terms of characterization; except perhaps Tohya himself. That\u2019s not a huge issue overall for Log Horizon but may be a backstabber for some who are interested to see the development of certain characters. In retrospect, don\u2019t get your hopes high.\\n\\n\r\nA technical change between the first season and this sequel is the studio. DEEN makes it a mission to adapt this series and although makes some attempts, it\u2019s not overall impressive. Some character designs such as with Akatsuki looks slightly different while faces suffer a bit of disfiguration. It is less noticeable on some parts during this season while obvious at other times. Naturally though, the series retains its fantasy landscape with its fantastic features. DEEN does make a good attempt at that especially during some of the more intense dungeon raids. I think the trend the series follows sometimes with its fantasy elements is to bring out their cleverness. By this, it means that every aspect of the show needs to stay true to its mechanics because MMORPG should be creative and open minded with imaginatively. Precisely, the artwork for this to work needs to be adapted with a precision. By the end of the show, it can be a mixed bag on some parts with its hits and misses. \\n\\n\r\nSoundtrack also plays some key roles in the season. However, one might feel both excited and disappointed by the OP song. If you\u2019re a fan of Database, then this should be no problem. But if you were expecting some new, then news flash: the sequel doesn\u2019t get a new OP song. It\u2019s something you\u2019ll have to deal with this vulnerability when it comes to repetitiveness. Similarly, character voices return with their casting roles. Nothing much is changed although one particular character may rob more attention than meets the eye; or perhaps I should say a trap? But perhaps the most prominent key highlights of this season is the stronger usage of its OST. This is put into moments when the show really stands out at its best to portray a blending line between fiction and reality. The musical and soundtrack trends is effortlessly portrayed to adapt MMORPG. I couldn\u2019t say this with confidence as the first season didn\u2019t truly stand out in that field. But taking a closer look at the sequel, I can do now.\\n\\n\r\nSo what to think of Log Horizon 2? Is it better or worse? Well, there\u2019s a lot of ways to put it. If you\u2019re a fan of the first season (either the anime adaptation or novels, then this might be exciting news for you. However, the overall terms of this adaptation doesn\u2019t live up entirely to the hype. Like I mentioned before, Log Horizon is a fantasy show, one that combines MMORPG elements and characters with its storytelling. Each character has a sort of role that connect with the overall story. And while artwork isn\u2019t top notch by expectations, the soundtrack makes it up with its lovingly delivery. Yes, there will be some episodes that will make your face go awe while others will feel like a waste of time. But by this point, it should be clear at what that Log Horizon has more ways to go.",

            "content": "At the point of reading this review for the second season of Log Horizon, I'm going to go ahead and assume that you've already completed the first season of this anime series. Do note too that this review is written with no knowledge of the Light Novels. Some spoilers may be in the following review. You have been warned.\r\nLog Horizon Season 2, like its predecessor, has a storyline that has been re-used many times over in anime, and the setting of the anime is not a unique one, everyone is stuck in a game world due to several circumstances and are left trying to finda way out. Unlike other similar anime, however, the adventurers in this story are not desperate to find their way out of the game (at least, not all of them are,)  and for the most part, are content with remaining the in the game world and managing their time and the situations faced in the game world itself instead. The story touches upon many interesting concepts in a game world; the politics of a fantasy world, and how one man leads his organisation to maintain peace and prosperity in his \"town\", and deals with the various issues facing the world. From mysterious effects coming alive to the dissatisfaction of the NPCs native to the Log Horizon world, there are indeed many issues that the show explored briefly which led me to be interested in continuing to watch the series. However, the major flaw within this series also lies in this area, while the concepts touched on were interesting, they were explored way too briefly.\\n\\n\r\nThere was way too much uninteresting dialogues or even monologues among the characters about how they felt and what needs to be done, or how they should work together to become stronger, etc etc and the development was drawn out far too much to keep the viewer hooked to the show. Sure, there were some decent fight scenes throughout, but these were kept to a minimum, and most of the episodes were about discussion of feelings, how they feel absolutely worthless in real life and how being a gamer and never giving up gave their life meaning (seriously?) and so on.\\n\\n\r\nThroughout the plot, there was also various references to the threat of the Minami town (another player-controlled town) and that of another player-guild, Plant Hwyaden that was positioned to becoming the main antangonist of the story. However, much of that was left largely unexplained, and most of the confrontations between the protaganists and this guild was left to the user's imagination (the reasoning behind them, who they were, what they wanted to achieve, etc ). A war was constantly referred to, but there was no real indication that the war was about to begin anytime soon. Strange phenomenon occurred and a war is approaching is pretty much ubiquitous every episode, but fillers continue to drag the plot along mindlessly, with valentine festivals and stupid quests to make a magic bag, which bored me greatly. I ended up skipping through some of the more unbearable parts (will leave u to discover which). Towards the final two episodes, the plot began to pick up the pace, like the first season, but I knew two episodes could not be enough to give a satisfactory ending. Regardless, the interesting concepts explored were enough to make me want to finish the season (i had time), but it would probably be dropped were i any busier. To conclude, you would probably be better off watching an abridged version (or manually skipping fillers to the interesting parts.)\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nNothing to mention much here, decent art overall.\\n\\n\r\nSound: Hated the opening song, but some like it , so meh. Ending is cute though. OSTs were normal, nothing worth mentioning.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Interesting, but too little was done to develop them. Ironically, the one they focused a lot on, the bard and her musical past, was incredibly boring.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Given that you can endure the drag of the plot, it is fairly enjoyable.\\n\\n\r\nOverall Score: 6/10\\n",

But how can such an anime stoop to such a low level in second season. I mean in second season they spoiled almost everything that the first season upholded. Second season was so focused on shiroe that nothing else mattered. All the girls were swooning over him. The swooning was there also in the first season, but was limited and had so many other elements that made the anime stand out. I mean other characters played a significant role inthe first season, Whereas in the second season all the other characters were sidelined and Shiroe was a major part of the series. \\n\\n\r\nThis anime is a treat for five year old shiroe fan girl, For every one else its plain dreadful.

            "content": "Being a gamer myself, I'd always hoped for a decent MMORPG anime to be produced. Log Horizon S1 made itself clear that it was THE forerunner in the MMORPG genre. While it may not have been perfect, I believed it best and most realistically portrayed the experience of playing a MMORPG game. \r\nHowever, S2 could not achieved what LH had done in S1. It was packed with filler episodes. It even swept some important characters under the rug. \r\nStory: 5/10\r\nThe boss raid arc started strong. It mimicked what one would actually encounter while playing such a game.  The teamwork, strategising, and skills used wereenchanting. It actually made me want to play Log Horizon. However, Silver Sword guildmaster's(William) melodramatic breakdown was a tad too long for my liking - it felt like the producers purposely dragged that scene to fill up screen time. The raid also ended abruptly, and was rather anti-climatic. I thought that shiroe and the others would at least fight the last boss(some white winged angelic thingy) but was disappointed that it ended with just a verbal agreement between Shiroe and Kinjou. \\n\\n\r\nThe battle between Nelreth and Akiba was average. It did lead to Akatsuki's character development, but other than that this arc wasn't anything special.\\n\\n\r\nThen came a filler arc - The journey of the 5 young kids of LH. Many viewers disliked it and found it hard to watch. I myself found it neutral, though it wasn't as enjoyable as watching a full raid take place(1st arc). This arc dragged on for too long, emphasizing too much on Isuzu's musical development. They introduced Roe 2, and although she seemed like she would be an amazing character, not much was talked about her apart from the fact that she was a navigator. \\n\\n\r\nThe last arc was another raid, but this time it was within the compounds of Akiba. It felt rushed and underdeveloped. More could have been said about the Raid Boss/Genius Monster/Old Man. This arc showed that Shiroe wasn't the all-perfect-planner that we thought he would be, and I appreciated that fact. \\n\\n\r\nPLANT HWYADEN: What the hell happened to this guild??? The last episode of S1 ended with plant hwyaden potentially becoming a threat to the Akiba round table. Then it was swept under the rug for almost the entirety of this season. Thereafter, at the last few episodes, plant hwyaden suddenly wanted to collaborate with Akiba. What?? \\n\\n\r\nArt: 6/10\\n\r\nYou could tell that LH S2 was animated by a different studio because animation became subpar. Some skills and magic spells looked good but the animation sorely lacked the consistency throughou the show. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 7/10\\n\r\nReusing S1's OP made listening to the database chant a bit bothersome. I liked it at first, but after 50 episodes worth of such a chant, it became a bit mundane. I bet every one was hoping for a new OP made by the same band. Hell they should have used the song from Nanatsu No Taizai's second opening. It would have been awesomeeee.  OSTs and the ED were average at best. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 7/10\\n\r\nThere were characters that were given proper development in this season, namely Akatsuki, Isuzu, Serara, Demikas, Isaac, William, and Shiroe. However, some characters which I thought would be fleshed out weren't, including members of Plant Hwyaden, Roe 2, Nureha, Kanami, and those people that were in the China server. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7/10\\n\r\nSome may say that S2 was bad, because there were too many filler episodes. Be that as it may, even with noticeable flaws in this season, I thoroughly enjoyed myself. I look forward to season three in hopes that they would answer the many questions that were left unanswered in S2. \\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "The second season of Log Horizon brought more enjoyment to me than the last season. Sure, there were episodes that didn't contribute all that much to the storyline, and there is much less character development than I would have liked, but the character struggles are realistic and well placed. Very few times have I seen an anime that is as genuine as this one; most of the characters have something to fight for (which isn't the case for many anime). \r\nThe following may contain spoilers!\r\n\"it\u2019s natural to want all of humanity to be happy, but that, in the end, is the beginning of sorrow\". Thispowerful line illustrates one of the major thoughts brought up throughout the course of the episodes. Unlike the first season, where everybody seems to be content with the new world, season 2 introduces the dissatisfaction from many players about living in the world. The desire to return to the old world is contrasted with the desire to stay with the new friends made in the game world. In terms of new ideas, the second season does a fantastic job of introducing them at well placed intervals. 8/10\\n\\n\r\nThe story lags when the low level characters are sent to level up; for whatever reason, there is a focus on them that indicates their importance later on in Log Horizon. However, their importance was not revealed in this season, even with their participation in the final battle. The main story arcs (Akatsuki's teachings, the gold raid, and the radio tower raid) are fun to watch and somewhat advance the plot, but don't give a clear direction for the anime. The final battle leaves much to be desired, as the viewer may be left wondering what the past 25 episodes were even for. Story: 6/10\\n\\n\r\nThe art in this season is the same as the art in the first season, and is nothing spectacular (but also not bad). Art: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack to the second season was quite powerful in some parts, and managed to give me chills on some occasions. Better than most anime soundtracks and appropriately timed, sound: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacter development is lacking. In my opinion, this is the biggest problem with Log Horizon: the character development. Firstly, how can one be attached to the characters if they aren't developed? Secondly, it is hard to see how one can be concerned for the characters when they cannot be killed. The battles are not as intense as say, Sword Art Online simply due to the fact that nobody cares if the characters die. They simply come back as if nothing happened. This is made worse by the fact that the characters are poorly developed, and thus makes the players actually seem like NPCs. Characters: 5/10\\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed the second season of Log Horizon. However, the season is lacking in both story and character, both of which are vital parts of a good anime. My enjoyment peaked when Shiroe acted indecisively during the tower raid and Henriette slapped him; that's exactly what I wanted to do at that point. There was a level of satisfaction that was fulfilled in that moment, and that certainly gave me more reason to give a higher score to this season. Enjoyment: 6/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall, this season is better than the first; however, it still lacks in important areas. If there is a season 3, the story and character development must improve else I may just end up falling asleep in the 10-13 episode range. Glad that Akatsuki did better than the middle school girl with Shiroe. Overall: 6/10",

But some sites said that there'll be no 3rd season because the author will postpone the LN whatsoever and if there'll be a 3rd season, it will be around 2018-2019 which make me sad.\r\nThe story of this anime is 7/10 for me. There's some hidden character as well as the inventions of things become much more in this season. However, the bad thing is -THE ENDING- is not the ending but it is. it might be confusing but thats how the ending is. Its reallydissapointing to see when the MC and his friend finally find a way to achieve their goal, the season ended and no announcement of the next season.\\n\\n\r\nArt and sound sits pretty well in this anime. I dont really like the opening-ending music but the sound in battle is pretty good and the arc is awesome\\n\\n\r\nThe character is 6/10 for me, the reason are: \\n\r\n1.MC Harem with 2 girls\\n\r\n2.The kids always bugging me like how mature they are despite being a middle schoolers\\n\r\n3.Akatsuki, my fav become pretty useless in this season\\n\r\n2nd and 3rd point might be because of It's the story, but the 1st point is really unnecesary and make me cringe everytime\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 9/10. I enjoy this anime because its like SAO - REBORN kind of anime but being MUCH better (SAO is bad for me) and its so different than other anime\\n\r\nSo, overall i'd give this anime 8/10 point ,but i'd not recomend it to anyone untill season 3 is secured. bcs u know, i hate cliffhanger",

            "content": "First I have to say that I'm from Germany and my english isn't that good, but I try my best to make you understand.\r\nAnd this is my first review and I'm just telling you my opinion of this anime so let's get started.\r\nLog Horizon many people describe this sequel as bullshit but I don't get why, I guess they didn't think about the anime.\r\nFor me Log Horizon 2 is a good sequel, because it continues to the story and it shows you the mainstory at the last episode.\r\nSo at the beginning of the 2nd season Shiroe tried to get some more money for the budgetof the round table and so he did an raid with the guild \"Silver Sword\" and they had some troubles because they had to fight 3 Raid-bosses at the same time. They lost and didn't get an stragedy to win against them, that was Shiroes 1st dead and so we were able to see what happens if they die. After that the guild leader of Silver Sword hold an speech about him and his relation to the game, to make hopes for everyone so that they'll keep fighting even if it looks that they can't win. Seriously this speech was awesome as fuck, and the whole arc with the 3 raid bosses and the awesome stragedy based fights was awesome as shit.\\n\r\nThen the side arc with Akatsuki in the main-role and the NPC who stole the armor of these guard's who saved the peace in the cities. That wasn't that awesome as the previous arc but it was good as well and they focused on the character dev. of Akatsuki.\\n\r\nNow the arc with the kids of Log Horizon. They're on low levels and they don't have these one magical bag without a limit and so they went on a journey to get these bags.\\n\r\nAnother city started to cause some trouble and I still don't know what they tried to do or why they built that huge train for, this arc was just shit and I didn't get anything of it. This arc was a huge plotthole but let me see what this arc got. They told us something about the Odysee Knights and what happened to the other characters of the players, they met the 2nd character of Shiroe who was a woman and controlled by an bot and they're living on the moon. They focused on the character dev. of Suzu and Toya which was pretty interesting.\\n\r\nIn the last arc some monsters attacked the city and made the NPC's sleeping, so they tried to find out what happened. This arc was an perfect arc for the ending, because the end of that arc answered so many questions as example :\\n\r\nWho the fuck is this one girl who was shown in the opening of Log Horizon 1 already?\\n\r\nWhat happened to crusty?\\n\r\nAnd what is their goal in the main story?\\n\r\nThese are just examples what the last arc answered to us. \\n\r\nIn all the Anime wasn't as good as season one but it was a very good sequel to the first season. Because of this season we know more about the characters, we finally know what the main story is now. I seriously can't get why people rate this anime so bad but well hope you liked my review. If you watched the prequel just keep going and watch the 2nd season.\\n",

It was a poor representation of what was supposed to be a sequel of a top-notch anime. Instead they delivered too many plot holes, endless filler episodes that had little or nothing to do with the main storyline and deprecated the value of the shining star that was season 1.\r\nDon't get me wrong - season 2 had amazing episodes as well. But a few great episodes doesn't come as awesome as the first season. The atrocious thing aboutseason 2 is that I had hoped that many of the questions I had from season 1 would be answered to some degree. It appears that I was wrong, and not only I didn't get an answer but it left me with more cliff-hangers and did an open ending. And now I have to wonder if there is season 3 coming. Why should I wonder? From the 50 episodes they made, I feel half are wasted on pointless filler and annoying plot twists.\\n\\n\r\nIf this is the end to the anime and season 3 isn't coming, then I have to say that they pissed on the anime and left it to rot in the sun.",

            "content": "Log Horizon is an anime that has been completely overshadowed by the massive popularity of Sword Art Online. The first season was an admirable attempt at creating something worthwhile, but the second season fails to impress.\r\nStory: Log Horizon Season 1 was an intriguing geo-political chess match inside the framework of a cliche \"trapped in the game\" story. Log Horizon Season 2 abandons that premise in favor of more action and side character development, which undermines what the series had going for it. Particularly grating are the horrendously long and redundant external monologues where characters spout off meaningless exposition about \"friendship\" and \"struggle,\" as though thesethings weren't evident from what's happening. One instance of this takes up nearly an entire episode! Log Horizon has lost whatever magic it had.\\n\\n\r\nArt: Solid animations, character design, and background.\\n\\n\r\nSound: Serviceable (with the ridiculous intro song from the first season).\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: The core of Shiroe, Akatsuki, and Noatsugu is entertaining, while the majority of the side characters are obnoxious. The \"young group\" of characters: Minori, Touya, Serara, Isuzu, and Rudy, are a significant reason why season two falls below the first. They get roughly half of the 25 episodes dedicated to them, and their arcs were a slog to get through. The reason for this comes down to the sense that anything they do will ultimately prove to be pointless. Their romantic interests with people decades older than them will obviously amount to nothing, and their \"achievements\" include not dying or getting in the way. They were not nearly this bad in the first season - likely because they stuck close to the main cast (in fact, I remember enjoying them far more than Akatsuki).\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: My goodwill from the first season gave out around episode 18, and from then onward I forced myself to finish the rest of it. Something about season 2 was so draining, even while binge watching. I cannot imagine watching it week-by-week, that must have been torture. The \"payoff\" at the end of the season isn't much without a third season, which, even in late 2017, seems far away (or not happening at all). Part of me wishes I had continued to put off watching this, if only to preserve the satisfaction of the first season.",

            "content": "If you liked the first season you'll like this one well enough. It's worse, but only by a little bit, and while you may be a tad underwhelmed you won't come away from it feeling utterly disappointed either. It's basically a slightly worse version of more of the same.\r\nArt-\r\nIf you liked the art before, which I did, you'll like it again here. The animation is crisp and smooth, the \"halfway point of this episode\" screens are still awesome and it still looks fresh and modern. That said, they did mess around with a couple character designs and make a few changes between Season 1 andSeason 2, which is extremely noticeable if you're watching back to back, and as an in general I dislike when animes do this on principle and in this specific instance I don't overly care for it in practice either. Did Nyanta really, truly need a significantly bigger head? In my opinion, he didn't.\\n\\n\r\nSound-\\n\\n\r\nMy comments from my Season 1 review are all largely applicable here. In summary, the soundtrack is consistently better than good but worse than great, which in my mind is very solid and respectable. The voice acting is solid throughout. One or two characters are annoying but that's for reasons such as the character being young or the character being arrogant as opposed to a problem with the voice acting itself. I have no major complaints in this department.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter-\\n\\n\r\nCharacters and story are where this anime drops off the most from the previous season. It's not a night and day difference by any means but it is a clear step backwards. With an already considerably sizable cast all returning from Season 1, the show opts to introduce MANY MANY new characters and this finally catches up to it, as there just isn't enough time to properly develop them all. It hits a point where there are just too many people in too many locations to keep track of and it feels like you're bouncing back and forth a lot and just a bit all over the place.\\n\\n\r\nLikewise, unlike the previous season which had one pace and one pace only throughout (Slow, but it was consistent with it and I was fine with that), this season absolutely has some pacing issues. There are a couple of genuinely interesting arcs that I was really into (the serial killer arc and the raid on the Abyssal Shaft, both found quite early in the season, were my personal favorites) but there was also an episode where, quite literally, 20 ish of the 25 minutes was one single character giving a speech to the other party members and it was unbelievably dragged out, repetitive and boring. That particular episode is the worst in the entire series in my opinion. Also, the ending felt EXTREMELY rushed, which is a problem this anime did not have at any point up until then. They definitely could have cut some of the time off the slower, more boring stretches from earlier in the season and taken fewer shortcuts and logic leaps in the end.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment-\\n\\n\r\nAs a fan of Season 1 I found Season 2 \"good enough\", but nothing beyond that. The ending in particular was unbelievably rushed and needed a good 2-3 episodes more than it actually got and that left a bit of a sour taste in my mouth. Regardless, if you enjoyed Season 1 I'd still recommend you watch this, though I'd caution you to temper your expectations.\\n\\n\r\nOverall-\\n\\n\r\nA slightly less good more of the same with higher highs and lower lows, Log Horizon Season 2 is a decent ride, and it'll be good enough to make you want a Season 3, but it won't blow you away by any means.\\n\\n\r\n+A couple of great arcs and genuine high points\\n\r\n+Characters you already know and love developed further\\n\r\n+Same great sound and art from before, minus stupid character design changes\\n\\n\r\n-Pacing issues, culminating in an EXTREMELY rushed ending\\n\r\n-Too many characters in too many places doing too many things- simply too all over the place and too much to keep track of\\n\r\n-Markedly less consistent than Season 1\\n\\n\r\nOBJECTIVE RATING- Low end 7\\n\r\nPERSONAL ENJOYMENT RATING- 7",

Should one pay enough attention to the content, it will become clear that this can't be a mere coincidence.

More likely that, though unofficially, this was funded by people with not the least influence in japan food industry.\r\nYou like watching ads? Cooked with a pathetic pretense of a \"plot\"?

There was a crew of new interesting characters that they added that weren't hard to keep track at all.Following the story wasn't difficult at all despite the perspectives switching constantly.\r\nThe new people all had distinct personalities that differentiated them from the rest, while those that weren't really explored in the first season had their backgrounds and character fleshed out. The story was interesting enough to keep me watching BUT the whole season felt like a way to transition the story rather than real major plotdevelopment. The whole season had little progress in the actual story, but I believe things will be quicker in season 3 with the setting laid out. \\n\\n\r\nOne of log horizon's main attractions was it's setting in an mmo world. It did an adequate job in capturing the feel of MMORPGS with the backdrop feeling very natural, and it's plot smoothly connecting with it, while not forcing it into the environment.\\n\\n\r\nThe art and sound are up to par with the previous season so take that with what you will.\\n\\n\r\nSo all in all, this season was a slight disappointment, but given how high the standards were set, it's still very watchable.",

If had a lot of great plot developments and the scenario's had a feeling of how a chess match unfolds, of course with more intensity though. Everything was not just about adapting to the new life but the adventure of it and the jaw dropping stagnates that Shiroe could weave. That however all kind of feel through in season two. The stories did not have as much weight and momentum to them anymore. The pull that it had in the first season that grabbed your attention became verywatered down and diluted. It was pretty much a wash in the end in my opinion. I watch it all the way through hoping that it would at least give some decent sense of closure, yet that fell short of the strings of hope I held onto. It's like those blockbuster movies that do so great they decide to make a second. It's never as good as the first and always is a letdown in comparison. They have some good episode I give them that, so some may like to watch it. I suggest that for those of you that liked the first season a lot it would be best to just end with that and keep the memory of how good it was.",

            "content": "TL;DR: A disappointing second season that feels like the director & script writers had no idea where Mamare Touno is planning to go with the story of Log Horizon, so just adapted enough to pad out the 25 episode run time & hope that the audience figures out how it all connects together themselves.There are some good episodes & it explores interesting ideas (or brings them up, at least), but ultimately they don't add up to 25 episodes worth of content. Don't bother unless they announce a third season, & even then you'll probably be better off looking for an abridged version on youtube thanwatching all of this.\\n\\n\r\nThere are times when one wonders if the scriptwriters for a show & the author of the source material being adapted ever talk to each other. When series, particularly longer series, feel like they're becoming increasingly unfocused as the source material begins to run out, you'd think that the script writer & author would work together to at least come up with a framework for where the story is going so the adaptation knows what to focus on without deviating too much from where the author plans to go with their story. Sadly, it seems in Log Horizon 2's case, either nobody knows where things are going, or nobody is communicating it. (note this review assumes you've seen LH1)\\n\\n\r\nRemember how LH1 ended with a climactic battle against the goblin king's forces whilst also revealing a new, human threat in the form of Nureha, guild leader of Plant Hwyaden who seems as powerful a mage as Shiroe? Well it seems the author or script writers forgot, because none of that really matters in LH2. Instead, LH2 focuses on three events that all feel like they're setting the ground for something big, but they don't know what. First is a mysterious player killer in Akihabara, somehow able to get around the zone's rules against combat between players. Following on from that (although both events occur at the same time) Shiroe seeks to deal with the financial problems the round table are facing by leading an epic raid on an El Dorado mine where all the world's gold is alleged to come from. These things concluded, the characters finally get around preparing for the prospect of war by...sending the younger guild members on a fetch quest so they can make magic bags.\\n\\n\r\nAll these stories continue Log Horizons rather enjoyable combining of a fantasy adventure setting with MMO rules, & the interesting ways they come together. The first story arc occurs against a backdrop the sudden & destabalising event of all the flavour text for the games many items suddenly becoming real, resulting in, among other things, Crusty being sucked into apparent oblivion by his weapon. Other issues not raised in LH1 are explored, including the idea of mortality & what it's actually like for the adventurers to die & how different people are responding to their being trapped in this new world. We meet characters that we wouldn't expect, such as a Chinese farmbot & Shiroe's alt character Roe2, who also seem to have come to life. Friction between the People of the Land & adventurers continues & we also, finally, start getting a hint at why the players of Elder Tale were sucked into the game in the first place.\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately, LH2 tends to skip over the more interesting parts while doing very little to try & tie everything together. In LH1 you had a real sense of progression between the different story arcs. Things started with everyone just getting used to functioning in this new world, which led to the Akihabara adventurers trying to better organise themselves, which led to their becoming diplomatically involved with the nearby PotL kingdoms & so on. There's no such sense of one thing building into another in LH2. Each story just kind of happens & ends with no real apparent impact. We're told it's impactful, sure. But the point is we don't see it in the same way you could in LH1.\\n\\n\r\nIt doesn't help that LH2 is full of what can only be thought of as filler episodes. LH2 is adapting two less novels than LH1 did (3 & 5 respectively), & it really feels like they're trying to spread less content over the same number of episodes. One particularly egregious example comes in the El Dorado raid, which involves returning Silver Sword guild leader William giving an episode long speech that boils down to \"I'm a sad loser irl, but in Elder Tale I feel important.\" The raid itself is actually quite enjoyable, as it's fun watching Shiroe & the adventurers reacting to a raid zone that has been designed specifically to be unbeatable. The ending is a massive anticlimax, though.\\n\\n\r\nLH2 also has an annoying tendency to introduce interesting ideas only to ignore them. The aforementioned Chinese bot character just sorta shows up for a bit before wandering off. Kanami, the tits & fists former leader of the mythical Tea Party shows up completely at random, first in a story one of Plant Hwyaden's leaders is telling another which gets cut off with a convenient \"I don't know what happened after this\" just as his story (which is the most interesting thing to happen in LH2 up to this point) was in danger of running into two episodes. \\n\\n\r\nAdventurer mortality, & how adventurers see images of their real life in the time between dying & resurrecting, is touched on on a couple of occasions, most notably in the form of the Odyssey Knights; adventurers who seek out death so they can briefly glimpse their past lives before returning. Unfortunately, all the Odyssey knights are really used for is to let Touya give a boyscout speech about the importance of living. What the characters actually have to say about the subject is equally disappointing, the writing not being nearly up to expressing the complexities of the ideas being discussed.\\n\\n\r\nConversely, LH2 is happy to waste a lot of time on things I have no interest in. The magic bag fetch quest takes up something like eight episodes, almost all of which is spent just watching the kids of Log Horizon wander about being happy as Izuma learns to be more confident in her musicianship. We apparently only have five minutes for the round table to discuss ideas like how to deal with adventurers who can't cope with being trapped in Elder Tale, but there's time for an entire valentine's day episode. Considering the apparent impending war that was teased at the end of LH1, everything in LH2 just feels like it's trying to fill time & hopes you don't notice that for most of the season nothing really happens to progress the story.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of romance, LH continues having some of the most awful relationship writing in anime. Nyanta, everyone's favourite middle aged furvert, continues to groom little red moeblob Serara, which the other characters seem to find hilarious & sweet but I find disturbing & painful to watch. That oh so funny not-love triangle between a NEET (Shiroe) a shutin (Atatsuki) & an under-aged girl (Minori) continues to rear its ugly head as well. Oh & in case you thought the flirting between Naotsugu & Marie was too normal, worry not; for now there is Tetora, an idol who takes a liking to Naotsugu. This is apparently hilarious because Tetora is actually a guy but Naotsugu is the only character who doesn't realise. I guess it had to be made weirder because the relationship between Rudy & Isuzu has greater prominence in LH2 & there can only be room for one \"normal\" relationship.\\n\\n\r\nPlanet Hwyaden is a group that LH2 also completely fails to integrate into the story. Remember how Nureha seemed like she was going to become the antagonist of LH2? Well somewhere between that & the start of LH2 it seems something important got lost, because she is now the boot-licking bitch of some elf member of the guild, literally eating dirt off the floor. It strikes me that it would be quite an important piece of information to let us know how she went from one state to the other, but LH2 doesn't seem to think so. \\n\\n\r\nIndeed quite what Planet Hwyaden are supposed to be doing in LH2 isn't clear. At first they seem to be built up as an example of how adventurers have responded to the challenge of organising themselves in different ways, taking a more authoritarian approach to governing than the more mercantile oligarchy, round table of guilds in Akihabara. But as the season continues & the supposed showdown between the two recedes into memory, it feels like they just become a stand in for whenever the show needs a bad guy. That is until the final arc pretty much completely abandons the idea of war between adventurers in favour of a new enemy, at which point one wonders why Plant Hwyaden were introduced at all. \\n\\n\r\nBeyond that, I feel compelled to voice one personal gripe I have with LH, that being the continued degradation of Atatsuki as a character. It seems so long ago now that she started out in LH as a shy but pretty badass ninja. One of the things I didn't like about LH1 was how her development through the season felt like she was more & more being pushed into the role of the longing lover watching from the shadows. LH2 continues this with gusto, to the point that Shiroe can unironically say \"you're starting to become quite the ninja\" like it's not a massive insult. Between her & Nureha it's almost like the writers find the idea of powerful women as important characters too hard to comprehend. \\n\\n\r\nIt was perhaps a bit of a surprise to see LH2 come only a year after LH1 with the same number of episodes, given the comparative lack of source material to draw from. In addition to this, it kind of feels like LH2 either lacked the time & resources of LH1's production, or at least it doesn't seem to have been as well managed. Studio Deen don't have a Stirling reputation among anime fans, & while I can't say LH2 looks bad, it does feel a bit lackluster compared to LH1 (at least as I remember it), particularly towards the end where it feels they hadn't accounted for the action scenes that the story called for. Occasionally characters do go noticeably off model during combat or when viewed from an odd angle, which is always fun to spot. But given that LH is not as action focused as a lot of fantasy shows of it's ilk, one can forgive it for the the most part. \\n\\n\r\nLH2, then, is another example of a second season that struggles to maintain the momentum of the first. Stuck trying to stretch less material over the same episode count as LH1, it feels like the writers just grabbed whatever they could out of the books with no real idea of how it all fits together in the grand scheme things. Had they been able to wait another year for more books to be written, or gone with a 13 episode length instead of 25, I think they could have told a more focused, concise story that felt like it was worth picking up after LH1. As it is, unless & until they announce a third season I see no reason for anyone to watch LH2. Even then, you'd be better off just reading the cliffnotes or watching an abridged version than sitting through all 25 episodes.",

            "content": "Having finished the entire second season here are some of my opinions on how this season turned out. I have assumed anyone reading this has watched the first season. \r\nStory: 6 (Fair)\r\nThe first half of this season focused in a lot more on the element of MMORPG raiding and immediately the pace of the show slowed down. With each episode covering usually two different scenarios within the world for our beloved characters to face. Overall I would say that if you're a big MMORPG player you'll connect with the characters more but if you're not then it will just leave you confused. By the secondhalf we were given with a valentines day filler episode and an enjoyable Kanami episode to give an idea of what's going elsewhere in the world. Then the kids' arc... similar to the last season there was an arc to develop the younger members of Log Horizon and that was done pretty well. But here it just felt like they didn't grow much but rather helped reinforce their own ideals and morals in addition to giving very little back story to their lives in the real world. Overall it didn't add much to the story, however the inclusion of a certain character and introduction of another certainly helped but left me clueless as to their purpose of being there. However after that arc the story seemed to pick up but then felt drawn out with the addition of what felt like filler episodes. And then the final two episodes..... Oddly these felt like some of the more enjoyable and entertaining episodes of the entire season with elements left over that pointed towards a direction the story would take. This was what annoyed me the most since I enjoyed them so much I wanted a third season. \\n\\n\r\nLooking back  the same plot threads which were started were left unfinished (mainly because the anime has caught up to the source material therefore a third season is a long way off). The story followed a very heavily focused ''raid'' element and a few filler episodes. Overall enjoyable but with the filler episodes and poor pacing I give it a 6.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 7 (Good)\\n\\n\r\nI would give the art style a 7 because obviously there was a change in studio and possibly budget was an issue. In the end I got used to the changes. Animation was again not great but better in some places than others, the finale seemed to be where they did a better job at least. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 7.5 (Very Good/Good)\\n\\n\r\nThe OST for Log Horizon didn't change and since I enjoyed the first season OST as well, I didn't really have any gripes with it for the second season. Voice actors didn't change and the new seiyuu I felt fit their roles.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 7 (Good)\\n\\n\r\nThere were quite a few introductions to new characters we had never really met aside from cameos and then some from the weird jungle of the anime rainforest. I enjoyed the new characters and they were extremely entertaining but the development of the characters were rather disappointing compared to last season. We're still left with a question of, 'What are they trying to do within the world.' We also got a little taste as to who the ''villains'' of Elder Tale are but their inclusion to the story was very minor. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9 (Great)\\n\\n\r\nEven with the flaws of this season I still enjoyed it and being an MMOPG gamer I think it helped. I know many who would find this season to be a huge disappointment compared to the first season but considering what I suspect as being budget changes and a new studio I can see why. Comedic elements were still entertaining for me and the action and characters were still enjoyable.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8 (Very Good)\\n\\n\r\nWith the inclusion of my own enjoyment I gave it an 8. A third season doesn't look likely to be soon because the LNs have now been caught up. I felt that maybe there wasn't enough material from the LNs to make a second season. Let's just hope they receive a better budget and have more material to work with for a third season. \\n\\n\r\nThis is my first review I have done and any constructive criticism on how to better write my reviews would be welcomed.",

            "content": "I've watched the entirety of both seasons of Log Horizon and found the first season very enjoyable. It wasn't without its faults, but I felt that it made much much better use of its premise than Sword Art Online had, and avoided many of the character pitfalls that plagued SAO. However, I have to say that season 2 was a MASSIVE disappointment.\r\nStory 6/10\r\nThere are several story arcs throughout the 2nd season of Log Horizon, but the lasting impression that they left was minimal. The story arcs for the vast majority of the season feel like they carry no importance at all but even worse, theyprogress at a snail-like pace. Episode after episode of filler were shoved through the season while the main story arcs seemed to be shelved for many episodes without mention before being returned to.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, the season does tackle one of the problems that I thought was glaringly missing from the first season: the attempt to return home. However, this particularly story arc feels rushed because it's so short in comparison to all the filler episodes that came before it.\\n\\n\r\nAnother part of the story I had a massive problem with was when the show handed itself off entirely to the kids. This is my opinion, and some people may disagree, but I believe that the children in the show should be complementary characters at most. However, one story arc followed the children going on a quest by themselves for several episodes without any lookback at the others.\\n\\n\r\nArt 7/10\\n\\n\r\nI thought the first season of Log Horizon didn't look like anything special but I thought it was still very solid artwork. Some of the monsters looked really good and the action was great. While all that still remains for the most part, for some reason, many of the faces look very different. Nyanta, Serara, and several others look quite different from season 1 or even the first half of season 2. It may not be enough to be a deterrent, but it is quite noticeable.\\n\\n\r\nOther than some characters looking off, the action was pretty solid, and the raid bosses looked great. Some of the copy & paste for the hordes of creeps looked meh but that's understandable.\\n\\n\r\nSound 8/10\\n\\n\r\nNot really much to say here. Music is fine and voicework is fine as well.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 7/10\\n\\n\r\nThis is another part where I feel that season 2 falls short of season 1. It not only introduces many new characters, but also tries to retain every single character from season 1. This results in them really struggling to develop some of the characters meaningfully. One of the new characters, Tetra, doesn't really seem to have any characteristic besides obnoxiousness.\\n\\n\r\nAlso, of the villains, only one gets really significant screen time and explanations as to her motives. The motives of the other antagonists are left unexplained and it just seems like the show is struggling because it has too many characters.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 5/10\\n\\n\r\nThis was a personal thing, but I really loved Log Horizon season 1. I felt that it was everything SAO could and should have been. However, this 2nd season took a massive dip in quality. There were just too many story arcs that were unimportant and so many filler episodes just left me bored and uninterested. Also, there were way too many characters being introduced without proper development.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 5/10\\n\\n\r\nVery very disappointing. There were some bright spots and the very early parts of the 2nd season really lived up to the 1st season's quality, but then it takes a massive dip and becomes a boring snoozefest of endless filler episodes.",

            "content": "(This has been adapted from my reddit thread. Spoilers ahead!)\r\nSomething that Log Horizon 2nd Season does that is somewhat strange is bring us into another world. Not just a new world in the sense that the anime represents such a fiction, but a world within another. The people of Elder Tales experience this world and discover what anyone would: that perhaps their place among it isn't right. This feeling of not belonging is something that is found not only within our own lives but within the anime as well. Indeed, in more ways than one.\r\nSTORY\r\nLog Horizon 2 begins pretty much where the first season leftoff. There are still problems to be solved within the world they inhabit, with the \"Villain in Glasses\" doing everything he can to alleviate their worries.\\n\\n\r\nThis second season of Log Horizon moves away from the political subterfuge that the first season capitalized on for a somewhat simple reason: this is the continuation. The anime already has its setting, the characters, and a wide set of rules in place and therefore opted to focus on an actual narrative as opposed to using the politics as a vehicle for everything that was going on. Unfortunately, it doesn't work. And this is because Log Horizon 2 refuses to do anything with any of the outcomes or plot lines that it follows and establishes. For example, it brings up the idea of item effects becoming true -- a rather neat development. But why this is the case or ways in which this affects what is happening around them are left unexplained. A more prominent example is the civil war that occurs between the People of the Land and the Adventurers. It sounds like an interesting route to take, but is never looked at seriously and even discarded by season's end. This rational can be found with nearly all of what Log Horizon 2 has to offer -- the \"Geniuses,\" the Odyssey Knights, Roe 2, Kanami's events, training the People of the Land, death on the moon, etc. -- and only serves to make the plot seem incoherent in execution.\\n\\n\r\nIn order to have some kind of order, Log Horizon 2 splits itself up into essentially four different arcs: the Akatsuki arc, the Money arc, the Kids arc, and the Moth arc. Furthermore, each is categorized into two (given) themes: the first two are about \"rising once more\" while the last two are about \"running with friends.\" And for the most part, this kind of separation works in the show's favor. Akatsuki's arc showcases her struggle, her need to prove her worth not only to the people around her, not only to Shiroe, but also to herself. She gets beaten, learns from her mistakes, and even perishes at one point. But that doesn't deter her resolve; rather, it bolsters her fortitude and allows her to rise to a new level both in body and in spirit. The Money arc, in a similar fashion, follows Shiroe, Williams, and Williams' guild as they fought over and over, never giving up or in. They band together to beat the impossible, which acts as a nice segue into the anime's second half and second motif; the notion of camaraderie. The Kids arc demonstrates the need to understand and nurture relationships between both the people you love and those you may not even know. And the Moth arc clearly depicts the idea that one almost never has to deal with everything on his or her own. That is, there are people around you who are able and willing to provide the support you need; you just need to ask.\\n\\n\r\nLog Horizon 2 also manages to maintain a thematic presence between its respective arcs, too. And it's what was talked about in the introduction; not feeling like you belong. There are those times when it is difficult to understand the situation you are in or finding yourself questioning your own mindset, so you begin pondering what exactly the issue is. Log Horizon 2 does this for each of its partitions: Akatsuki wonders why she cannot be by Shiroe's side, Williams talks of finding solace in the gaming world, the kids witness a group of people who despise their position, and inkling feelings of wanting to return home loom large over many Adventurers. This kind of development is natural, especially in regards to that last point; literally being in a foreign land can cause any number of mixed emotions. But what each segment teaches is that it isn't so much worrying about belonging, but how you manage such a predicament in the first place. Which is what the previous themes aimed at doing; rising to the challenge and relying on the people around you. By following these two routes, belonging stops being an issue and starts being an afterthought. It doesn't happen instantaneously -- the Adventurers prove that finding one's place is a difficult process -- but when you do find that peace of mind, great happenings almost always await.\\n\\n\r\nANIMATION\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately for Log Horizon 2, the art and animation is severely lacking.\\n\\n\r\nThe art for the show, despite the world being so open and free, is filled with rather boring locales. Muddy caves, plain cities, and leafy forests are normally seen, but nothing is extraordinary. The real detriment, though, is the show's often distracting lack of quality. There are numerous occasions where characters are either malformed or given disproportionate features, causing their designs to be lacking in detail and attention.\\n\\n\r\nThe world within the anime lends itself well to interesting character designs, and therefore that is what's given here. Shiroe's signature white cloak, Akatsuki's ninja outfit, and Tetra's idol attire are easy examples of fun designs that fit the show's mood and provide the audience with the sense that these people really are just playing a video game.\\n\\n\r\nActual animation, though, is mostly below average. Many of the fights are given still frames or reduced actions that do not come off as appealing. And since a lot of what goes on within the show is dialogue between the characters, where only mouth movements are found, it only helps to accentuate the lack of animation during the battles that occur.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS\\n\\n\r\nLog Horizon 2 is an anime with a large cast, almost too large for its own good. It isn't able to adequately peer at every character individually and instead sets its sights on two. One makes sense and the other is interesting: Akatsuki and Isuzu, respectively.\\n\\n\r\nAkatsuki is a servant first and ninja second. As such, when she is left behind by her master, Shiroe, she feels conflicted. She cannot seem to understand why she has been delegated to such a role; that her place at Shiroe's side is almost unneeded. She feels completely weak, and when she is defeated in Akihabara it only helps to reaffirm this type of thinking. Yet, it's exactly what she required: within the dream-like world she meets up with the person she calls master. While there she learns that it isn't because she is weak that she was kept from fighting alongside him and the others, but because she is so strong, that only she could take up the task given to her, that Shiroe wanted her to remain at home. Upon reviving, she trains her heart out, and with the aide of those around her, she excels to new heights. She earns a special \"Teaching,\" protects the town, and most of all, is confident now more than ever in the abilities that she always had.\\n\\n\r\nDuring the second half of Log Horizon 2, during the Kids arc, the show actually chooses Isuzu of all people to really focus on. Her class as a Bard isn't just coincidence; her characterization reveals that, in the real world, not only was her father a renowned musician but she had taken up the guitar as well to follow in his wake. But she laments of her father's lost fame and of her own inadequacies as a guitarist. She feels that what she has to offer isn't worth much of anything, especially if the person she always looked up to, someone better than her, was always pushed to the side. But as Rudy, her close friend, describes to her, it isn't about being good or bad at whatever you do that counts. As long as you try, that you give it everything you have without any regrets, is what truly matters. For his people are not capable of creating the tunes she can; she is to them as her father is to her. Meaning what she can do is not only worthwhile but unique, more so than she ever thought possible. And with this newfound vigor, she does what she can for the people around her, supporting them in the way that only she is capable of doing.\\n\\n\r\nWhat both Akatsuki and Isuzu demonstrate, besides their respective developments, is something that many of the characters experience throughout the entirety of the season. And that is the notion of self-esteem. Having the confidence to do what needs to be done -- to get up when fallen, to rely on your friends, to do what is right -- doesn't always come naturally. For many people, it's a difficult feeling that isn't inherent and must instead be \"taught\" to those that don't have a lot of it to begin with. This occurs with the former two ladies. But there are also those who lose it after having acquired it -- Shiroe experiences such a dilemma near the end where he doesn't fully believe in the path he has chosen. Touya holds his ground against the suicidal knights, Nureha stands up for herself, and Demiqas swallows his pride to help the very man who humiliated him. Having the confidence to perform certain deeds can be difficult to obtain, but once it is found, and as the characters of the anime portray, it brings with it its own brand of goodness.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND\\n\\n\r\nThe OP for Log Horizon 2 remains the same, which is a wise decision. It's catchy, it's fun, and it's the database; it is literally Log Horizon's signature sound. The ED is fine, utilizing cute singing, a simple beat, and dainty piano playing. It can be quite catchy itself, especially with the ending \"la's\" that are used.\\n\\n\r\nThe rest of the soundtrack remains more or less the same from the first season as well. It contains uplifting battle tones with hard guitar, drums, and choirs -- the \"Main Theme\" is both the best track for this example and the best track that the show has to offer. It also uses mysterious tunes during explanatory moments, slow guitar playing during sadder ones, and flutes during the nonchalant times. It's a nice OST that captures the mood of the anime quite well.\\n\\n\r\nAs far as voice-acting is concerned, those involved give around average performances. A special shout-out goes to Yukiyo Fujii as Tetora for her cracking voice while speaking.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT\\n\\n\r\nI found myself not quite enjoying what this one was doing, mostly because it transitioned away from the politics and tried too hard to bring in as many different elements as it could. On top of this, many of the battles weren't very impressive to see despite them garnering so much focus. Furthermore, while the Kids arc was nicely executed, it was still quite boring to watch unfold.\\n\\n\r\nThe only characters that I had a fun time watching were Leonardo (the turtle) and Tetora (the idol). The former was just a really cool dude while the latter was always having fun, looking to bring a smile to both me and everyone else in the world. Leonardo hardly got any screen time, unfortunately; he was placed in the same spot as Nyanta -- really cool but underutilized. And Tetora couldn't always be around to bring about the laughs.\\n\\n\r\nLog Horizon 2nd Season attempts to continue what its predecessor started. Unfortunately, due to an awkward story, shoddy animation, and boring segments throughout, this tale seems to still be questioning its own sense of belonging.\\n\\n\r\nSUMMARY\\n\\n\r\nStory: Fine, thematically strong but coherently weak\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: Bad, low quality art style, good character designs, below average actual animation\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Good, Akatsuki, Isuzu, and the rest find the confidence to fight\\n\\n\r\nSound: Good, great OP, good ED, good soundtrack, average VA work\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Bad, lame fights, boring arcs, and only a few likable characters\\n\\n\r\nFinal Score: 5/10",

            "content": "Story:\r\nIs Log Horizon 2 filler? Now, let's stop right there. The very fact that I even considered leading off a review with this question doesn't bode well. But, to answer that question: No, Log Horizon 2 is not filler, but it feels like filler. Everything in the show is canon, covering 4 light novels and even going into some material that hasn't been officially released yet. Season 1 adapted 5 LNs, so we're already looking at slightly less source material. Within these 4 LNs + extras of material, Log Horizon 2 decides to adapt 1 of them to only 1 episode, so we're left with3 LNs + extras for 24 episodes.\\n\\n\r\nSo it should come to no surprise that the first point of contention is the dreadful pacing of the show. The plot moves extremely slow; there were multiple times that I got bored because I wanted the show to move a bit faster and get to the point. Log Horizon was never a fast paced show to begin with, but there were several episodes (especially in the 3rd arc) where it felt like virtually nothing happened. In fact, I might go so far as to say the first 21.5 episodes of Log Horizon 2 were a waste of time. We get 3 entire arcs during those episodes but we never actually see the results of those arcs. The plot feels contrived to the point of searching for something for the characters to do rather than them actually moving toward an obtainable goal. The last couple episodes sort of introduce an interesting goal, but by then it's too late. However, these episodes are actually good. Had we gotten a whole season of this it would have been much better.\\n\\n\r\nBut why don't we get any results? Because those arcs existed for the sake of character development. Log Horizon 2 develops Shiroe, Akatsuki, and the kids a little bit, but it takes way too long to do so. Log Horizon's strong suit was never its characters; it was the world and its MMO aspects that made the show interesting. So the fact that we spend so much time on one of the less interesting parts of Log Horizon hurts the show immensely.\\n\\n\r\nWhile it spends so much time developing the cast, it also introduces a bunch of interesting ideas to the world. But Log Horizon 2 never goes anywhere with these cool ideas. They're shrugged off in favor of character development. Any expansion of these ideas would have been great.\\n\\n\r\nNow I want to talk about the 3rd arc in particular. We follow the Log Horizon kids (colloquially called the Noob Squad) as they go on a quest. It's so boring and unrelatable that I wanted to drop the show, and I almost never drop shows. The Noob Squad is far and away the worst characters in the cast, and getting a second arc (they had a short one in S1) devoted to them is just too much. The slice of life \"comedy\" parts of this arc in particular are more cringe worthy than anything else.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\\n\r\nAgain, Log Horizon 2 tries its best to develop its characters. We learn about them a little more and maybe change a little bit, but it doesn't really add anything to the show. Again, Log Horizon's strength was never its characters. Perhaps the biggest fault in terms of the cast is its sheer size. With 41 characters listed on MAL, it's unsurprising that the viewer might forget about some of the minor ones, especially when it comes to stuff like guild affiliation. Now, a large cast is not necessarily a bad thing. Legend of the Galactic Heroes doesn't get bashed for its huge cast. But Log Horizon doesn't always know what to do with all its characters, so many of them fall by the wayside.\\n\\n\r\nShiroe is still the best character in the show, but his screen time is limited compared to the first season. It's really disappointing because Shiroe was the one who most drove the plot forward in the first season. Plus we only get a fraction of the glasses pushes.\\n\\n\r\nOh, remember Nyanta? Everyone's favorite cat swashbuckler chef shows up for an episode or two just to remind us he exists. Instead we get Tetra, who serves almost no purpose besides comic relief.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\\n\r\nLog Horizon 2's OST uses many of the same tracks from the first season, and there's nothing fundamentally wrong with that. The songs are good; they usually fit the mood fine and there's nothing really to complain about there. Log Horizon's OP, Database, also returns for another go. Database is a good song, but I don't think we needed 50 episodes of it. Log Horizon 2's OP also shamelessly spoils some stuff from the series again. The ED isn't bad, but the transition into the ED is awful. There are a few episodes that end on a somber or intense note, and then the super happy ED pops in just before the episode actually ends and destroys the mood. The voice acting is fine. The kids' voices can get annoying though.\\n\\n\r\nArt/Animation:\\n\\n\r\nLog Horizon switches animation studios for its second season, going to the infamous Studio Deen. The first thing you'll notice is that characters look slightly different. It's most noticeable on characters with long hair such as Marielle. The designs are more faithful to the original source material, but I personally found the slight redesigns in the first season to be aesthetically pleasing.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation itself is bad to the point of distraction. Characters' faces never quite look right. Tons of shortcuts were taken and it's completely noticeable and frustrating.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\\n\r\nNow, I could throw all this aside if the show manages to be fun to watch. For me, it wasn't. When my first thought week by week is \"Let's get this over with\" then that's a terrible sign. The show has a bunch of slice of life moments that are supposed to be funny or heartwarming or something, but they're tiresome and cringe worthy. The action scenes are all right, but they're few and far between and also take a few animation shortcuts that don't make them as fun as they could be. The plot isn't particularly engaging until the very end, but those last few episodes aren't enough to redeem the boredom that's before it. There are a few moments I genuinely enjoyed, but by and large it felt like a drag.\\n\\n\r\n2/10\\n\\n\r\nYes, this is a harsh score. But if I can't take much of any enjoyment from the show and it doesn't really succeed in any area, it's tough to give it points at all.",

            "content": "If there was one series that can focus down the MMORPG concept to its core, Log Horizon would be the first name to pop into my mind. The franchise based off of the light novel of the same name returns for a second season and remains consistent with exactly the way it was. Only this time, the sequel is operated by a different studio (DEEN rather than Satelight.). Still, some of the core concepts of the series remain and the sequel is by no means a mud puddle to be stepped on. \r\nAs a former MMORPG player from a popular online game, I was intriguedby the way Log Horizon is designed. The first season focused down on the world building and characters in a very concise way. When it came to mechanics, the show was like a professor on steroids with the info dumping and game concepts. Likewise, the sequel concentrates on world building just as precise as the first season with some other twists and turnabouts. A popular question that may come to mind is if it\u2019s required to watch the first season? My simple answer is: of course. Watching Log Horizon 2 without finishing the first season would be like taking a math test without studying for the formulas. While the consequences aren\u2019t disastrous, the sequel will be a much better experience if you completed the first season.\\n\\n\r\nTo freshen up a bit, Log Horizon takes place in the world of \u2018Elder Tale\u2019. The world itself is based on a  post-apocalyptic setting where fantasy defies reality. (that\u2019s actually a bit ironic considering the tagline of the show is \u2018this is our reality\u2019). But when you add in fantasy and magic, it becomes MMORPG in its most classic style. As you may expect, members of the famous Log Horizon guild returns. Characters you should be familiar with such as Shiroe, Akatsuki, Naotsugu, Nyanta, Tohya, and Minori are just a few to name. The sequel also opens doors to new characters such as the trap Tetra as well as conflicts that may change the story forever. What you should be familiar with Log Horizon should also be the style. In general, the series has a slow pacing. Some episodes will drag and ultimately will take patience to get through. There is also a much less focus on the real life counterparts of the characters as opposed to their online counterparts; do note that a few episodes does offer a glimpse at their past. Nonetheless, Log Horizon is a show more about its world and characters rather than just progressive story movement. It still retains its various political and survival conflicts but doesn\u2019t push that as its main course.\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of story, the sequel offers various glimpses at different sides of the series. From a bit of murder mystery to dungeon raids, the series adapts many gimmicks. It also stays true with many of MMORPG\u2019s mechanics such as gold farmers, bots, pkers, and of course death. And in similarity with the first season, the show continuously presents its mechanics in a way that should be straightforward to almost any viewer. Even if you have never experienced the thrills of a MMORPG game, Log Horizon should be like a sample to you for what it should be. Also more noticeable about the series revolves with the political affairs and economics mechanics. After all, the author (Mamare Touno) is also known for writing Maoyuu Maou Yuusha with its focus on a bit of those as part of the gimmick. But what Log Horizon does better here is the balance with its story. Each episode either tells its own story or transits into what it already has set up. It can also shift in many ways to convey various moods. An apex part of the story is during the first half when the series explores the concept death and its aftermath. At a more careful glance, it\u2019s evident that Log Horizon has an exotic way to portray such an event. It adapts emotions with realism despite taking place in the fantasy. It recreates human emotions in a world where nothing is really real. And in retrospect, death in MMORPG is one of the most debatable topics of controversy. In this sequel, it hit the nail in the coffin with that concept.\\n\\n\r\nWith a large cast of characters, it shouldn\u2019t be surprise if some gets neglected by characterization. The main purpose of the show isn\u2019t to give every single character their chance to shine but rather a way for them to play a role. It should therefore be clear that some characters\u2019 roles will have a larger impact than others. However, it should be treat that the sequel also focuses on other groups in Log Horizon besides just Shiroe\u2019s party. Unfortunately, Log Horizon\u2019s characterization can suffer a bit when it comes to dynamics. There\u2019s not much change from the first season with character relationships. Most of them still goes without much development. Take the example of Shiroe and Akatsuki. Although they share some special moments in the first half of the show, their relationship doesn\u2019t progress further than being close friends. Similarly, Tohya\u2019s team still retains their adventurous nature but without offering big chances for its members on an individual level in terms of characterization; except perhaps Tohya himself. That\u2019s not a huge issue overall for Log Horizon but may be a backstabber for some who are interested to see the development of certain characters. In retrospect, don\u2019t get your hopes high.\\n\\n\r\nA technical change between the first season and this sequel is the studio. DEEN makes it a mission to adapt this series and although makes some attempts, it\u2019s not overall impressive. Some character designs such as with Akatsuki looks slightly different while faces suffer a bit of disfiguration. It is less noticeable on some parts during this season while obvious at other times. Naturally though, the series retains its fantasy landscape with its fantastic features. DEEN does make a good attempt at that especially during some of the more intense dungeon raids. I think the trend the series follows sometimes with its fantasy elements is to bring out their cleverness. By this, it means that every aspect of the show needs to stay true to its mechanics because MMORPG should be creative and open minded with imaginatively. Precisely, the artwork for this to work needs to be adapted with a precision. By the end of the show, it can be a mixed bag on some parts with its hits and misses. \\n\\n\r\nSoundtrack also plays some key roles in the season. However, one might feel both excited and disappointed by the OP song. If you\u2019re a fan of Database, then this should be no problem. But if you were expecting some new, then news flash: the sequel doesn\u2019t get a new OP song. It\u2019s something you\u2019ll have to deal with this vulnerability when it comes to repetitiveness. Similarly, character voices return with their casting roles. Nothing much is changed although one particular character may rob more attention than meets the eye; or perhaps I should say a trap? But perhaps the most prominent key highlights of this season is the stronger usage of its OST. This is put into moments when the show really stands out at its best to portray a blending line between fiction and reality. The musical and soundtrack trends is effortlessly portrayed to adapt MMORPG. I couldn\u2019t say this with confidence as the first season didn\u2019t truly stand out in that field. But taking a closer look at the sequel, I can do now.\\n\\n\r\nSo what to think of Log Horizon 2? Is it better or worse? Well, there\u2019s a lot of ways to put it. If you\u2019re a fan of the first season (either the anime adaptation or novels, then this might be exciting news for you. However, the overall terms of this adaptation doesn\u2019t live up entirely to the hype. Like I mentioned before, Log Horizon is a fantasy show, one that combines MMORPG elements and characters with its storytelling. Each character has a sort of role that connect with the overall story. And while artwork isn\u2019t top notch by expectations, the soundtrack makes it up with its lovingly delivery. Yes, there will be some episodes that will make your face go awe while others will feel like a waste of time. But by this point, it should be clear at what that Log Horizon has more ways to go.",

            "content": "At the point of reading this review for the second season of Log Horizon, I'm going to go ahead and assume that you've already completed the first season of this anime series. Do note too that this review is written with no knowledge of the Light Novels. Some spoilers may be in the following review. You have been warned.\r\nLog Horizon Season 2, like its predecessor, has a storyline that has been re-used many times over in anime, and the setting of the anime is not a unique one, everyone is stuck in a game world due to several circumstances and are left trying to finda way out. Unlike other similar anime, however, the adventurers in this story are not desperate to find their way out of the game (at least, not all of them are,)  and for the most part, are content with remaining the in the game world and managing their time and the situations faced in the game world itself instead. The story touches upon many interesting concepts in a game world; the politics of a fantasy world, and how one man leads his organisation to maintain peace and prosperity in his \"town\", and deals with the various issues facing the world. From mysterious effects coming alive to the dissatisfaction of the NPCs native to the Log Horizon world, there are indeed many issues that the show explored briefly which led me to be interested in continuing to watch the series. However, the major flaw within this series also lies in this area, while the concepts touched on were interesting, they were explored way too briefly.\\n\\n\r\nThere was way too much uninteresting dialogues or even monologues among the characters about how they felt and what needs to be done, or how they should work together to become stronger, etc etc and the development was drawn out far too much to keep the viewer hooked to the show. Sure, there were some decent fight scenes throughout, but these were kept to a minimum, and most of the episodes were about discussion of feelings, how they feel absolutely worthless in real life and how being a gamer and never giving up gave their life meaning (seriously?) and so on.\\n\\n\r\nThroughout the plot, there was also various references to the threat of the Minami town (another player-controlled town) and that of another player-guild, Plant Hwyaden that was positioned to becoming the main antangonist of the story. However, much of that was left largely unexplained, and most of the confrontations between the protaganists and this guild was left to the user's imagination (the reasoning behind them, who they were, what they wanted to achieve, etc ). A war was constantly referred to, but there was no real indication that the war was about to begin anytime soon. Strange phenomenon occurred and a war is approaching is pretty much ubiquitous every episode, but fillers continue to drag the plot along mindlessly, with valentine festivals and stupid quests to make a magic bag, which bored me greatly. I ended up skipping through some of the more unbearable parts (will leave u to discover which). Towards the final two episodes, the plot began to pick up the pace, like the first season, but I knew two episodes could not be enough to give a satisfactory ending. Regardless, the interesting concepts explored were enough to make me want to finish the season (i had time), but it would probably be dropped were i any busier. To conclude, you would probably be better off watching an abridged version (or manually skipping fillers to the interesting parts.)\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nNothing to mention much here, decent art overall.\\n\\n\r\nSound: Hated the opening song, but some like it , so meh. Ending is cute though. OSTs were normal, nothing worth mentioning.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Interesting, but too little was done to develop them. Ironically, the one they focused a lot on, the bard and her musical past, was incredibly boring.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Given that you can endure the drag of the plot, it is fairly enjoyable.\\n\\n\r\nOverall Score: 6/10\\n",

But how can such an anime stoop to such a low level in second season. I mean in second season they spoiled almost everything that the first season upholded. Second season was so focused on shiroe that nothing else mattered. All the girls were swooning over him. The swooning was there also in the first season, but was limited and had so many other elements that made the anime stand out. I mean other characters played a significant role inthe first season, Whereas in the second season all the other characters were sidelined and Shiroe was a major part of the series. \\n\\n\r\nThis anime is a treat for five year old shiroe fan girl, For every one else its plain dreadful. It messed up so bad, I am considering SAO 1st season better than this.",

            "content": "Being a gamer myself, I'd always hoped for a decent MMORPG anime to be produced. Log Horizon S1 made itself clear that it was THE forerunner in the MMORPG genre. While it may not have been perfect, I believed it best and most realistically portrayed the experience of playing a MMORPG game. \r\nHowever, S2 could not achieved what LH had done in S1. It was packed with filler episodes. It even swept some important characters under the rug. \r\nStory: 5/10\r\nThe boss raid arc started strong. It mimicked what one would actually encounter while playing such a game.  The teamwork, strategising, and skills used wereenchanting. It actually made me want to play Log Horizon. However, Silver Sword guildmaster's(William) melodramatic breakdown was a tad too long for my liking - it felt like the producers purposely dragged that scene to fill up screen time. The raid also ended abruptly, and was rather anti-climatic. I thought that shiroe and the others would at least fight the last boss(some white winged angelic thingy) but was disappointed that it ended with just a verbal agreement between Shiroe and Kinjou. \\n\\n\r\nThe battle between Nelreth and Akiba was average. It did lead to Akatsuki's character development, but other than that this arc wasn't anything special.\\n\\n\r\nThen came a filler arc - The journey of the 5 young kids of LH. Many viewers disliked it and found it hard to watch. I myself found it neutral, though it wasn't as enjoyable as watching a full raid take place(1st arc). This arc dragged on for too long, emphasizing too much on Isuzu's musical development. They introduced Roe 2, and although she seemed like she would be an amazing character, not much was talked about her apart from the fact that she was a navigator. \\n\\n\r\nThe last arc was another raid, but this time it was within the compounds of Akiba. It felt rushed and underdeveloped. More could have been said about the Raid Boss/Genius Monster/Old Man. This arc showed that Shiroe wasn't the all-perfect-planner that we thought he would be, and I appreciated that fact. \\n\\n\r\nPLANT HWYADEN: What the hell happened to this guild??? The last episode of S1 ended with plant hwyaden potentially becoming a threat to the Akiba round table. Then it was swept under the rug for almost the entirety of this season. Thereafter, at the last few episodes, plant hwyaden suddenly wanted to collaborate with Akiba. What?? \\n\\n\r\nArt: 6/10\\n\r\nYou could tell that LH S2 was animated by a different studio because animation became subpar. Some skills and magic spells looked good but the animation sorely lacked the consistency throughou the show. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 7/10\\n\r\nReusing S1's OP made listening to the database chant a bit bothersome. I liked it at first, but after 50 episodes worth of such a chant, it became a bit mundane. I bet every one was hoping for a new OP made by the same band. Hell they should have used the song from Nanatsu No Taizai's second opening. It would have been awesomeeee.  OSTs and the ED were average at best. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 7/10\\n\r\nThere were characters that were given proper development in this season, namely Akatsuki, Isuzu, Serara, Demikas, Isaac, William, and Shiroe. However, some characters which I thought would be fleshed out weren't, including members of Plant Hwyaden, Roe 2, Nureha, Kanami, and those people that were in the China server. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7/10\\n\r\nSome may say that S2 was bad, because there were too many filler episodes. Be that as it may, even with noticeable flaws in this season, I thoroughly enjoyed myself. I look forward to season three in hopes that they would answer the many questions that were left unanswered in S2. \\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "The second season of Log Horizon brought more enjoyment to me than the last season. Sure, there were episodes that didn't contribute all that much to the storyline, and there is much less character development than I would have liked, but the character struggles are realistic and well placed. Very few times have I seen an anime that is as genuine as this one; most of the characters have something to fight for (which isn't the case for many anime). \r\nThe following may contain spoilers!\r\n\"it\u2019s natural to want all of humanity to be happy, but that, in the end, is the beginning of sorrow\". Thispowerful line illustrates one of the major thoughts brought up throughout the course of the episodes. Unlike the first season, where everybody seems to be content with the new world, season 2 introduces the dissatisfaction from many players about living in the world. The desire to return to the old world is contrasted with the desire to stay with the new friends made in the game world. In terms of new ideas, the second season does a fantastic job of introducing them at well placed intervals. 8/10\\n\\n\r\nThe story lags when the low level characters are sent to level up; for whatever reason, there is a focus on them that indicates their importance later on in Log Horizon. However, their importance was not revealed in this season, even with their participation in the final battle. The main story arcs (Akatsuki's teachings, the gold raid, and the radio tower raid) are fun to watch and somewhat advance the plot, but don't give a clear direction for the anime. The final battle leaves much to be desired, as the viewer may be left wondering what the past 25 episodes were even for. Story: 6/10\\n\\n\r\nThe art in this season is the same as the art in the first season, and is nothing spectacular (but also not bad). Art: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack to the second season was quite powerful in some parts, and managed to give me chills on some occasions. Better than most anime soundtracks and appropriately timed, sound: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacter development is lacking. In my opinion, this is the biggest problem with Log Horizon: the character development. Firstly, how can one be attached to the characters if they aren't developed? Secondly, it is hard to see how one can be concerned for the characters when they cannot be killed. The battles are not as intense as say, Sword Art Online simply due to the fact that nobody cares if the characters die. They simply come back as if nothing happened. This is made worse by the fact that the characters are poorly developed, and thus makes the players actually seem like NPCs. Characters: 5/10\\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed the second season of Log Horizon. However, the season is lacking in both story and character, both of which are vital parts of a good anime. My enjoyment peaked when Shiroe acted indecisively during the tower raid and Henriette slapped him; that's exactly what I wanted to do at that point. There was a level of satisfaction that was fulfilled in that moment, and that certainly gave me more reason to give a higher score to this season. Enjoyment: 6/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall, this season is better than the first; however, it still lacks in important areas. If there is a season 3, the story and character development must improve else I may just end up falling asleep in the 10-13 episode range. Glad that Akatsuki did better than the middle school girl with Shiroe. Overall: 6/10",

But some sites said that there'll be no 3rd season because the author will postpone the LN whatsoever and if there'll be a 3rd season, it will be around 2018-2019 which make me sad.\r\nThe story of this anime is 7/10 for me. There's some hidden character as well as the inventions of things become much more in this season. However, the bad thing is -THE ENDING- is not the ending but it is. it might be confusing but thats how the ending is. Its reallydissapointing to see when the MC and his friend finally find a way to achieve their goal, the season ended and no announcement of the next season.\\n\\n\r\nArt and sound sits pretty well in this anime. I dont really like the opening-ending music but the sound in battle is pretty good and the arc is awesome\\n\\n\r\nThe character is 6/10 for me, the reason are: \\n\r\n1.MC Harem with 2 girls\\n\r\n2.The kids always bugging me like how mature they are despite being a middle schoolers\\n\r\n3.Akatsuki, my fav become pretty useless in this season\\n\r\n2nd and 3rd point might be because of It's the story, but the 1st point is really unnecesary and make me cringe everytime\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 9/10. I enjoy this anime because its like SAO - REBORN kind of anime but being MUCH better (SAO is bad for me) and its so different than other anime\\n\r\nSo, overall i'd give this anime 8/10 point ,but i'd not recomend it to anyone untill season 3 is secured. bcs u know, i hate cliffhanger",

            "content": "First I have to say that I'm from Germany and my english isn't that good, but I try my best to make you understand.\r\nAnd this is my first review and I'm just telling you my opinion of this anime so let's get started.\r\nLog Horizon many people describe this sequel as bullshit but I don't get why, I guess they didn't think about the anime.\r\nFor me Log Horizon 2 is a good sequel, because it continues to the story and it shows you the mainstory at the last episode.\r\nSo at the beginning of the 2nd season Shiroe tried to get some more money for the budgetof the round table and so he did an raid with the guild \"Silver Sword\" and they had some troubles because they had to fight 3 Raid-bosses at the same time. They lost and didn't get an stragedy to win against them, that was Shiroes 1st dead and so we were able to see what happens if they die. After that the guild leader of Silver Sword hold an speech about him and his relation to the game, to make hopes for everyone so that they'll keep fighting even if it looks that they can't win. Seriously this speech was awesome as fuck, and the whole arc with the 3 raid bosses and the awesome stragedy based fights was awesome as shit.\\n\r\nThen the side arc with Akatsuki in the main-role and the NPC who stole the armor of these guard's who saved the peace in the cities. That wasn't that awesome as the previous arc but it was good as well and they focused on the character dev. of Akatsuki.\\n\r\nNow the arc with the kids of Log Horizon. They're on low levels and they don't have these one magical bag without a limit and so they went on a journey to get these bags.\\n\r\nAnother city started to cause some trouble and I still don't know what they tried to do or why they built that huge train for, this arc was just shit and I didn't get anything of it. This arc was a huge plotthole but let me see what this arc got. They told us something about the Odysee Knights and what happened to the other characters of the players, they met the 2nd character of Shiroe who was a woman and controlled by an bot and they're living on the moon. They focused on the character dev. of Suzu and Toya which was pretty interesting.\\n\r\nIn the last arc some monsters attacked the city and made the NPC's sleeping, so they tried to find out what happened. This arc was an perfect arc for the ending, because the end of that arc answered so many questions as example :\\n\r\nWho the fuck is this one girl who was shown in the opening of Log Horizon 1 already?\\n\r\nWhat happened to crusty?\\n\r\nAnd what is their goal in the main story?\\n\r\nThese are just examples what the last arc answered to us. \\n\r\nIn all the Anime wasn't as good as season one but it was a very good sequel to the first season. Because of this season we know more about the characters, we finally know what the main story is now. I seriously can't get why people rate this anime so bad but well hope you liked my review. If you watched the prequel just keep going and watch the 2nd season.\\n",

It was a poor representation of what was supposed to be a sequel of a top-notch anime. Instead they delivered too many plot holes, endless filler episodes that had little or nothing to do with the main storyline and deprecated the value of the shining star that was season 1.\r\nDon't get me wrong - season 2 had amazing episodes as well. But a few great episodes doesn't come as awesome as the first season. The atrocious thing aboutseason 2 is that I had hoped that many of the questions I had from season 1 would be answered to some degree. It appears that I was wrong, and not only I didn't get an answer but it left me with more cliff-hangers and did an open ending. And now I have to wonder if there is season 3 coming. Why should I wonder? From the 50 episodes they made, I feel half are wasted on pointless filler and annoying plot twists.\\n\\n\r\nIf this is the end to the anime and season 3 isn't coming, then I have to say that they pissed on the anime and left it to rot in the sun.",

            "content": "Log Horizon is an anime that has been completely overshadowed by the massive popularity of Sword Art Online. The first season was an admirable attempt at creating something worthwhile, but the second season fails to impress.\r\nStory: Log Horizon Season 1 was an intriguing geo-political chess match inside the framework of a cliche \"trapped in the game\" story. Log Horizon Season 2 abandons that premise in favor of more action and side character development, which undermines what the series had going for it. Particularly grating are the horrendously long and redundant external monologues where characters spout off meaningless exposition about \"friendship\" and \"struggle,\" as though thesethings weren't evident from what's happening. One instance of this takes up nearly an entire episode! Log Horizon has lost whatever magic it had.\\n\\n\r\nArt: Solid animations, character design, and background.\\n\\n\r\nSound: Serviceable (with the ridiculous intro song from the first season).\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: The core of Shiroe, Akatsuki, and Noatsugu is entertaining, while the majority of the side characters are obnoxious. The \"young group\" of characters: Minori, Touya, Serara, Isuzu, and Rudy, are a significant reason why season two falls below the first. They get roughly half of the 25 episodes dedicated to them, and their arcs were a slog to get through. The reason for this comes down to the sense that anything they do will ultimately prove to be pointless. Their romantic interests with people decades older than them will obviously amount to nothing, and their \"achievements\" include not dying or getting in the way. They were not nearly this bad in the first season - likely because they stuck close to the main cast (in fact, I remember enjoying them far more than Akatsuki).\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: My goodwill from the first season gave out around episode 18, and from then onward I forced myself to finish the rest of it. Something about season 2 was so draining, even while binge watching. I cannot imagine watching it week-by-week, that must have been torture. The \"payoff\" at the end of the season isn't much without a third season, which, even in late 2017, seems far away (or not happening at all). Part of me wishes I had continued to put off watching this, if only to preserve the satisfaction of the first season.",

            "content": "If you liked the first season you'll like this one well enough. It's worse, but only by a little bit, and while you may be a tad underwhelmed you won't come away from it feeling utterly disappointed either. It's basically a slightly worse version of more of the same.\r\nArt-\r\nIf you liked the art before, which I did, you'll like it again here. The animation is crisp and smooth, the \"halfway point of this episode\" screens are still awesome and it still looks fresh and modern. That said, they did mess around with a couple character designs and make a few changes between Season 1 andSeason 2, which is extremely noticeable if you're watching back to back, and as an in general I dislike when animes do this on principle and in this specific instance I don't overly care for it in practice either. Did Nyanta really, truly need a significantly bigger head? In my opinion, he didn't.\\n\\n\r\nSound-\\n\\n\r\nMy comments from my Season 1 review are all largely applicable here. In summary, the soundtrack is consistently better than good but worse than great, which in my mind is very solid and respectable. The voice acting is solid throughout. One or two characters are annoying but that's for reasons such as the character being young or the character being arrogant as opposed to a problem with the voice acting itself. I have no major complaints in this department.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter-\\n\\n\r\nCharacters and story are where this anime drops off the most from the previous season. It's not a night and day difference by any means but it is a clear step backwards. With an already considerably sizable cast all returning from Season 1, the show opts to introduce MANY MANY new characters and this finally catches up to it, as there just isn't enough time to properly develop them all. It hits a point where there are just too many people in too many locations to keep track of and it feels like you're bouncing back and forth a lot and just a bit all over the place.\\n\\n\r\nLikewise, unlike the previous season which had one pace and one pace only throughout (Slow, but it was consistent with it and I was fine with that), this season absolutely has some pacing issues. There are a couple of genuinely interesting arcs that I was really into (the serial killer arc and the raid on the Abyssal Shaft, both found quite early in the season, were my personal favorites) but there was also an episode where, quite literally, 20 ish of the 25 minutes was one single character giving a speech to the other party members and it was unbelievably dragged out, repetitive and boring. That particular episode is the worst in the entire series in my opinion. Also, the ending felt EXTREMELY rushed, which is a problem this anime did not have at any point up until then. They definitely could have cut some of the time off the slower, more boring stretches from earlier in the season and taken fewer shortcuts and logic leaps in the end.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment-\\n\\n\r\nAs a fan of Season 1 I found Season 2 \"good enough\", but nothing beyond that. The ending in particular was unbelievably rushed and needed a good 2-3 episodes more than it actually got and that left a bit of a sour taste in my mouth. Regardless, if you enjoyed Season 1 I'd still recommend you watch this, though I'd caution you to temper your expectations.\\n\\n\r\nOverall-\\n\\n\r\nA slightly less good more of the same with higher highs and lower lows, Log Horizon Season 2 is a decent ride, and it'll be good enough to make you want a Season 3, but it won't blow you away by any means.\\n\\n\r\n+A couple of great arcs and genuine high points\\n\r\n+Characters you already know and love developed further\\n\r\n+Same great sound and art from before, minus stupid character design changes\\n\\n\r\n-Pacing issues, culminating in an EXTREMELY rushed ending\\n\r\n-Too many characters in too many places doing too many things- simply too all over the place and too much to keep track of\\n\r\n-Markedly less consistent than Season 1\\n\\n\r\nOBJECTIVE RATING- Low end 7\\n\r\nPERSONAL ENJOYMENT RATING- 7",

The story was interesting enough to keep me watching BUT the whole season felt like a way to transition the story rather than real major plotdevelopment. The whole season had little progress in the actual story, but I believe things will be quicker in season 3 with the setting laid out. \\n\\n\r\nOne of log horizon's main attractions was it's setting in an mmo world. It did an adequate job in capturing the feel of MMORPGS with the backdrop feeling very natural, and it's plot smoothly connecting with it, while not forcing it into the environment.\\n\\n\r\nThe art and sound are up to par with the previous season so take that with what you will.\\n\\n\r\nSo all in all, this season was a slight disappointment, but given how high the standards were set, it's still very watchable.",

If had a lot of great plot developments and the scenario's had a feeling of how a chess match unfolds, of course with more intensity though. Everything was not just about adapting to the new life but the adventure of it and the jaw dropping stagnates that Shiroe could weave. That however all kind of feel through in season two. The stories did not have as much weight and momentum to them anymore. The pull that it had in the first season that grabbed your attention became verywatered down and diluted. It was pretty much a wash in the end in my opinion. I watch it all the way through hoping that it would at least give some decent sense of closure, yet that fell short of the strings of hope I held onto. It's like those blockbuster movies that do so great they decide to make a second. It's never as good as the first and always is a letdown in comparison. They have some good episode I give them that, so some may like to watch it. I suggest that for those of you that liked the first season a lot it would be best to just end with that and keep the memory of how good it was.",

            "content": "Dear O dear... I really liked the first season of Log Horizon (I gave it a 9/10) but I have to say, this is a major step back from that. Everything that I enjoyed from the first season is watered down by a bunch of standard MMO fodder that I honestly cannot stand. I loved how unique and intuitive the first season was but it scraps that for some really basic, uninteresting crap that's all split up by the writer's failed attempt to tell two stories at once.\r\nWhile this statement is relatively harsh given my score, do keep in mind that the only thing thatkeeps my score so high is the many things that the story and characters do right. However these things have all carried over from the first season so aren't really worth any independent merit as the whole point of a second season is to grow, innovate and most of all, improve from the first one.\\n\\n\\n\r\nStory -\\n\r\nI praised the story of the first season for being very unique in the sense that it would take advantage of the MMO environment in more ways than one. Additionally, the politics and mechanics of the game were called into question with some fun and engaging plot devices that were caused by the sentient NPCs and asshole players.\\n\\n\r\nWhat I just described was a 9/10 story in my eyes but now... Its f*cking non-existent! Rather than plays in politics we get dungeons and raidbossess. Also, I don't know about you, but I've never spent a month in a World of Warcraft dungeon and if I had to, I don't think it would require Lelouch Lamperouge to beat it.\\n\\n\r\n\"Oh but you're just complaining about realism... that doesn't really matter in this situation\".\\n\\n\r\nTrue... but this arc goes on for around half of the season and it only has a 5 minute payoff that doesn't even make a difference to the grand scheme of things. It's no better than filler material because the problem and solution is completely hypothetical, you don't see it, you don't notice it; the only way you can tell there is a situation is because the characters talk about it. Which is poor story telling to be honest.\\n\\n\r\nThe other half of the story is consumed by bland festivals and poor villains. Their only really excuse for there to be any threat is \"Oh well, you wouldn't do it in the real world\" which, when you consider the first season, is completely contradictory to everything the show initially stood for. I honestly hated the fact that we've barely scratched the surface of this show and we've already resorted to what is the equivalent of cheaters... Imaginative... right?\\n\\n\r\nAnother gripe I have with this seasons story is that a huge amount of significant plot is given to the children... THE CHILDREN. The most boring, standard, weak ass characters in the whole story. But I'll put that in the character section.\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt and Sound -\\n\r\nThe art is pretty much the same as the old season. However, the last season had one thing that this anime sorely lacks. Wonder. During the first seasons, we found our team going around to all these different places that had so much color and style but now we seem to be confined to the comfort zones of our animators. There are barely any new environments and any that ARE new are dark, dreary and generally uninteresting.\\n\\n\r\nSound wise, its pretty standard. Although I will make my obligatory comments such as 'the application was good' and 'it provided an extra layer to the environment', I actually thought it was actually kind of lazy. Especially the intro, which is the same one that they used in the first season... the whole first season. While it is kind of a badass song, it does get kind of tiring after a while. There aren't actually that many situations where I can praise the sound but It gets a decent score because I'm kind of a sucker for its style of music.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacter -\\n\r\nI have to say, the characters are very good in this show. Even if they aren't presented as regularly as I'd like, they are enjoyable none the less. Typically, the characters are very unique and are extremely entertaining, they each have this 'secret bad ass' vibe about them and in some cases it does pay off.\\n\\n\r\nOnto the issues I have with the characters: They have some extreme limitations in this season. Not only are they watered down to the extent that their awesome traits just seem like gimmicks but they also get pushed aside for some of the most infuriating 'shutterstock' characters on the face of the earth.\\n\\n\r\nSo. what with Krusty (one of my favs) f*cking off and Shiroe and his gang going off to fight the Balrog and his goon squad, we get left with all of the lame ass kids who decide to go on a road-trip. Nothing really happens here except for a small preview of the sh*ttiest excuse for character development that basically consists of 'I can walk'... cool. This entire section is put in so that we can get one small plot point that's equivalent to 'there is... no... Fedex...' and it just goes to show how everything in this season does a complete 1-80 on what we wanted after the first one.\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment -\\n\r\nI won't deny that I did enjoy watching Log Horizon 2. That's not to say that I appreciated the things that changed... just that I'll tolerate them and although I've been very harsh in my writing, do know that this show still has potential. However the only reason I really think that is because this genre is kind of a guilty pleasure of mine.\\n\\n\\n\r\nConclusion -\\n\r\nIf you really enjoyed season 1. Then go right ahead. However if you're not too sure about it then I would recommend that you review your options because the watered down story, distribution of the cast, development and all around structure of the whole thing turned out to be rather disappointing. However, that's not to say it's without merit. If you're still running on the highs that the previous season may or may not have given you, go for it. Just know that it doesn't really go anywhere",

The plot had a few different struggles that the Characters had to over come that didn't really have a connection. I feel like they could have either made a better/stronger sub plot that links everything that is happening together. Besides that the story was all right and I did Enjoy it.\r\n(if theres a season three maybe a sub plot that links everything will show/be explained)\r\nArt/Animation:9\r\nSo I am not really one to care about the arttoo much, but I don't like terrible animation. I thought the animation was smooth and art the was pretty good, but then again, thats not the main thing I care about.\\n\\n\r\nSound:9 \\n\r\n(btw I watched the dub)\\n\r\nI thought the music was done well and overall fit the style of the anime. The voices fit their characters and expressed emotion well.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:10\\n\\n\r\nI feel that they did a pretty good job of showing characters and how they developed. New Characters where introduced well and over all i didn't think them to be cliche or boring. The characters each had their own personalities that i enjoyed\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:8\\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed Log horizon the second season a lot and would definitely recommend it. It was intriguing and funny too. Besides the plot not being presented as well as it could have, I still liked it a lot.",

            "content": "Please see my review for Season 1 of Log Horizon for a somewhat brief synopsis of my background with MMORPG\u2019s. \r\nAs I \u201cfinish\u201d more anime, the style in which I intend to review is going to evolve and refine itself. As I will state in all of my reviews, I do not review with the intent of making someone else watch a show. Nor do I review with the expectation that ANYONE will agree with the conclusions and opinions laid out. My reviews are simply my experiences, reactions, feelings and most importantly my own opinions on whatever subject matter is being reviewed. If you readthis review, and then watch the show and find yourself disagreeing with what I have said, that is because everyone has different opinions. These are simply my own, take that how you will. \\n\\n\r\nI find that many Anime shows are doomed from the beginning. Every show that comes out now is constantly compared to any shows that came before it that are even remotely related. I\u2019ve often heard of the \u201cbest\u201d shows being referred to as a Meta, similar to MOBA games in where specific setups or characters are considered the \u201cbest\u201d by everyone. If the newly found shows do not succeed in the same areas or ways that other shows before have, then these shows are deemed as failures. Why can\u2019t each show be judged solely as its own entity without needless comparison to other series. I feel as though this is where I have an advantage thus far as I do not have a lot of experience to draw from. However, I intend to do my best to keep an open mind going into each and every new show that I watch. I would like to judge the show as it is, with all of its own components. Not what the show could have been, or should have been. I believe that each show is released in the state that the show creators wanted, if it wasn\u2019t they would have changed it. What\u2019s being portrayed to all of us through these works of art is the artists depictions of whatever story they want to tell. We should judge them as such. How we want a story to turn out, or how other shows have turned out should have no impact on whether or not the show is deemed as good. Disagreeing with an artists story is fine, but telling them their work is a failure because you wanted something different to happen is asinine. Try to look at it from the storytellers perspective, instead of what you want. \\n\\n\r\nFor me, Log Horizon\u2019s second season was never going to maintain the same highs as its first. In my eyes, season 1 was everything it could\u2019ve been and more. There was just too much happening and too many details that were vital for a first season to really let the show slow down at any point. However, as a continuation of the series, I find it hard to fathom that anyone who genuinely enjoyed the first season would not enjoy the second. The same complex details of the storyline and the depth of the MMORPG details are still present. While also committing to keeping each character that was already established interesting while introducing new characters as well. We see many of the very young and less mature characters really come into their own in season 2 and discover how capable they truly are. I find myself on the fence in that we don\u2019t get as much character development as we do inside of the game but outside, but I don\u2019t know if that is a good thing or not. I also find that every time I think I know who is pulling the strings behind the scenes or what\u2019s going to happen, I am wrong. The show continually finds ways to surprise me.\\n\\n\r\nThe entire world of Elder Tale starts to really shape up by the end of season 2. You can really see what impact and relevance the \u2018Adventurers\u2019 are having not only on the world of Elder Tale, but on the minds of the adventurers as well. Throughout the season there are many new twists and turns that, for me, leave me wanting to watch the next episode immediately. I never found myself bored, or losing interest. I was always curious to see where things went or how they turned out. \\n\\n\r\nSeason 2 really continued to provide me with the prolonged feelings of nostalgia and enjoyment that season 1 gave. In certain areas of the season, it gave me even more than season 1. At the end of each episode I still found myself longing for a return to my glory days of MMORPG\u2019s. I found myself leaving season 2 with little to really complain about or wish to see differently. However, I think that\u2019s solely because I just refuse to try to see what isn\u2019t there. I enjoyed what I was given by the creators, and whether or not Season 3 is an actuality I will be happy. I would love more Log Horizon as it has quickly become my new favorite Anime. \\n\\n\r\nWhen you watch a show with expectations of other shows, I really believe it drags down the viewers ability to really take in or enjoy what they are watching. In the same light, going into a show with predefined expectations set by others is also a good way to know you won\u2019t like it beforehand. I do my best to avoid any reviews, spoilers or opinions before embarking into a new show. I don\u2019t want any second-hand knowledge to influence any opinions I have about the show. Diving into the world of Elder tale has been some of the most enjoyable watching of any medium I have experienced in quite some time. I have no doubt that my lack of experience in Anime and my bias towards MMORPG\u2019s play a strong part in that. However, nothing can take away the enjoyment or satisfaction I got from this show. \\n\\n\r\nWhile it may be counter-intuitive to what I said earlier, in my opinion, if you enjoyed season 1, you should give season 2 a chance. The world is too deprived of good entertainment, and life is too short to be picky about every little thing. I am thankful to have watched this show before watching many other Anime. I can only hope enough people out there will enjoy this as much as I have and the show will be allowed to continue for at least 1 more season. \\n\\n\r\nThanks for taking the time to read my review. I am always available via message if you find it necessary to tell me how wrong I am or how terrible my taste is, etc. Or if you\u2019d like to discuss the show more, my past with MMO\u2019s or just make a new friend.",

            "content": "I take back anything I ever said about this writer actually being any good at writing. He just had a lucky strike with the first season, and even that has shitty writing on micro level, which amazing direction covered for perfectly. Reading those LNs enlightened me about that. \r\nSecond season should have been where the shit finally hits the fan, and where we learn and explore all about what's REALLY going on, quicken up the pacing, resolve character relationships, and then go a bit beyond and have an epic thematic wrap up. Instead we get what's essentially a bunch of fillers because author is toobig of a sissy to let go of his new cash cow. Where we should have at least gotten cool fights we got epic studio Deen budget of $10 per episode. Which also meant instead of cute characters we know and love, we got some deformed monsters take their place. Alright not quite THAT bad, but at places it felt like it. Not all of second season was horrible, but too much of it was for me, and the worst part is that it just kept spiraling downwards just further betraying my hopeful expectations. First season introduces best OTP Crusty and Lenessia, and then second season just entirely sidelines them. Oh, and why not return to the most unlikable character no one cares about, Demikas, and dedicate third of the season to his character development for no damn reason whatsoever. \\n\\n\r\nSo it might sound like a 1/10 raging review, somewhat in contrast with the grade I picked. This is mostly due to this still being Log Horizon world and cast from a loved show. There were some interesting developments like all the moon stuff, even though I would have preferred it see explored deeper and faster. Some of the raiding and action was fun as well, despite actual mechanics of the fights not even being near what first season offered in terms of clear stakes and well explained mechanics. Environments were their usual post apocalyptic overgrown prettiness I love so much. Also Tetra. At least until she devolved to a broken record of single joke character like so many others (I'm looking at you Naotsugu!)\\n\\n\r\n#TeamMinorin!",

            "content": "To start let me say that I believe my review of LH 2 is biased based on season 1, if it were a standalone show it probably would have rated better. That said, if you are watching season 2 you probably watched S1. So this is both a comparison and an individual analysis.\r\nStory: I found the story, while enjoyable, to be predictable and but with a few developments that kept it interesting. Just based on the premise alone I believe it would deserve a 4, while the developments on top of it add the additional two points making the story a 6. This season becomesmuch more involved with people of the land, but loses a lot of what made the story line important in the first season. If it weren't for our vampire onee-chan, the geniuses, and the final few episodes I would put the story at around a 5. -6\\n\\n\r\nArt: Good, but nothing exceptional, around what you expect from a mid->high tier budget anime these days. Not much changed since S1, but somehow it seemed more lackluster than in S1- 7\\n\\n\r\nSound: SFX are decent but nothing special, I generally skip OPs and EDs as I'd rather spend my time focusing on the show itself, but the ED does a good job of providing a reminiscent yet light hearted feel to the end of each episode. I liked the OPs more than the average show I watched, and felt that they gave an engaging entrance to the episodes, although neither the OP or ED were engaging enough to make me want to watch them every episode. -7\\n\\n\r\nCharacter development in S2 was lackluster compared to S1, and I felt that focusing so much on the children removed a lot of time that could have been better spent building plot. However The Addition of the geniuses, Isaac's progression, and the introduction of new characters with new architypes brought the otherwise mediocre 5 up to a 7, although I think a 6.5 would be more appropriate\\n\\n\r\nOverall it was very watchable, and I enjoyed it, but compared to S1 it was lacking in many areas. - 7\\n\\n\r\nReference scoring: I rate 5 as \"Average\" as in my threshold for a show being watchable, this is the minimum score to avoid me dropping a show instantly. while a 10 is either best of the season, or best of the year. Sometimes there may be no 10s in a season, or a year.",

            "content": "This is a direct continuation of the first season, though ultimately one that starts in a different direction for the most part. The first arc that focuses on\u00a0Akatsuki with\u00a0Shiroe and his raid going on in the background had a very different feel from the rest of the show. It maintains keeping multiple stories going on side by side. However, ultimately both of these begin to feel incredibly slow. Akatsuki's side seems to be very largely focused on developing her character. However, it takes far too long for things to happen, with her staying in a state of doubting herself and not really making any movementtowards growing stronger. There is a turning point regarding such, after which things speed up a bit, which is primarily due to how it drops looking at Shiroe's side entirely until her story is finished, but it still ended up feeling somewhat slow. Ultimately it's a pretty strong arc in terms of character development, but one that was greatly marred by pacing. On Shiroe's side, the set up to the raid and explanation of mechanics starting off was interesting, but afterwards showing off the scenes of proceeding through the dungeon became a bit of a slog, which wasn't helped by how slow Akatsuki's side was moving. His side also reaches it's turning point at the same time as Akatsuki's and begins in earnest after Akatsuki's arc is over. It's at this point there's a major turning point, in that it gets a lot more interesting, with Shiroe finally showing off the strategic ability that was one of the best parts from the first season as well as a lot of good moments from other characters, such as William's speech in episode 10. From there to the end the arc is quite fast, and comes to a close quite spectacularly. The following arc changes the set up entirely, and goes back to the set up that Log Horizon's first season had towards the middle, wherein the focus is on the newbie players at a character level, wherein they get some solid development, while the focus on the high leveled players is more at a world level, developing things such as world mechanics and politics, primarily a build up to an impending conflict with Minami. At this stage, the main five as I like to call them get a lot of solid development, while also setting up the next arc. Similarly, what's going on behind the scenes at a high level is also quite interesting. However, following all this, the build up at the high level seems to take a back seat to things that were set up with the main five. This results in an arc that feels very much like a climax arc, as opposed to the first season, wherein it gathers most of the main characters shown throughout the show in one epic raid. This one starts off feeling a bit awkward due to Shiroe's indecisiveness, however this isn't much of an issue due to how this phase goes by pretty quickly and sets up the next phase incredibly well, which ultimately comes to a really strong conclusion and a good way for the season to end.\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of more overarching comments, this one explores more so the mechanics of the world itself beyond the MMO mechanics, and even how the game mechanics and real world like mechanics seem to act quite strangely at times. Most interestingly was the beginning of exploration of why they were there in the first place, which wasn't even touched upon in the first season, and whether they should go back at all, which is a very interesting thing to look at, and something that's rarely looked at in series like this. In terms of character development, the main character development arc for Akatsuki while not being that good as an arc did have good character development, and the development of the other Log Horizon characters was also solid. The character development outside of that was slow similar to the first season, but due to how most of the characters are old they didn't feel as flat, and even the introduction of new characters didn't make the show feel bloated like the first season began to. Bonus points for having a guy literally role playing as a ninja turtle. In terms of the story, it resolved things pretty well, with most of the minor and major things that felt they had to be resolved in this season resolved. Sure, the conflict with Minami hasn't even begun and they still need to figure out the secrets of the world and the Genius's, but it felt like where it ended was fine and a good place to begin another season.\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of art and animation, I think it might have improved, though not by much, and it still felt not that great.\u00a0I appreciate the first season ED more now due to the insert with Isuzu. The new ED is pretty nice. With the OP, and it being the same as the first season, I went from being completely tired of it at first, to being fine with it by the end due to all the repetition.\\n\\n\r\nAnother solid season of Log Horizon, though one with a really slow start but a strong end.\\n\\n\r\n8/10",

            "content": "A season 2 of Log Horizon was much needed, but the second season at least for me, it wasn't..bad it just felt like it changed its \"theme.\" \r\nBut that's not too surprising considering a different studio picked it up (Studio Deen) so there's bound to be some differences. But anyway, main differences.\r\n~ A LOT LESS OF SHIROE'S WITTINESS WE KNOW AND LOVE\r\n~ A lot more random character development ( aka filler)\r\n~ A different feel to the series\r\n~ More mysteries ( that aren't solved)\r\nand other stuffs.\r\nThis series IS Log Horizon, but it didn't really feel like it. I mean the original season did manage to impressme because the characters were really enjoyable and engaging even without having that much development on their life out of Elder Tale, its just, I dunno, some of the development was good and I really liked it, but later on...eh.\\n\\n\r\nBut some of the little pet peeves that did bother me in the series was that \\n\r\n1. They used the same opening as the 1st season. (which is kinda ok I like it, but still thats lazy)\\n\r\n2. Some times the animations and stuff or just reeeaallly weird. You might not have noticed it but I did, I also just have these two screenshots on my computer, trust me its abnormal.\\n\r\n(Lol if you'd like to see them you can ask me)\\n\\n\\n\r\nBut overall, if we are not getting a season 3 of Log Horizon, and if we are and its getting adapted by Studio Deen again or even another different Studio...\\n\r\nI won't give up on the series I will just Expect the worst and hope for the best.\\n\r\n(And if it truly fails me I'm going to check out the manga)\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I think you should at least have a steady transition before completely changing the feel of a series (Unless its a change that reveals a shows actual genre, aka School Live, Madoka Magica)\\n\r\nThe way it changes is strange indeed, with the climactic ending of the first season and the apparent new antagonist being introduced it seems like the second season would be interesting, but no...it then keeps switching, at one point, seems like all fillers, then it goes to something interesting, then back to fillers again and so on.\\n\\n\r\nI didn't hate this season, it just didn't feel like Log Horizon. I even thought it was strange, I thought I lied to myself for a while because I thought all the characters getting development was great, but for some reason I guess I just didn't enjoy it. Many times I would be sitting through the \\n\r\n\"development moments\" in a uninterested manner.\\n\\n\r\nBut this shouldn't stop you from watching it. This series started off strong, and I hope it can continue, every series experiences its bumps in the road, that doesn't mean its completely ruined.\\n\\n\r\nSo again, Expect the worst, Hope for the best.\\n\\n\r\nThank you for reading!\\n\\n\r\nStory: 7\\n\r\nArt: 7\\n\r\nSound: 7\\n\r\nCharacter: 8\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 7\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL: 7\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

The main character goes through dramatic development that doesn't even go close to his character at one certain point that I won't spoil. The season 2 is great but the story is based all around 1 arc for a long time from what it seems whereas season 1 didn't have that and was more original in that regard. If anything you'll get enjoyment from it and it definitely beats SAO series.\r\nOther than that just be sure to watch closely from beginning to end as you will miss critical details on the long arc. The character development was okaybut if it involved more of the original duo team this season would've been a lot better.",

            "content": "I mostly enjoyed watching it, but it was such a disappointment compared to season 1. I don't know anything about what actually happened in production, but it feels like all of the writers quit before season 2 and were never properly replaced. There are a handful of particularly interesting and thought-provoking events and themes, but for the most part the plot is all over the place, often feeling contrived and nonsensical. Moreover, I was constantly feeling that plot events were undermining important overall themes set up in season 1.\r\nIt seems like they were just constantly running out of ideas, so they had to constantly changethe rules and throw crazy events at the characters. I very much wish that they had focused more on politics, interpersonal relationships, character growth, and realistic sorts of conflict rather than insane and unpredictable outside forces. A number of super interesting potential problems/conflicts were actually explicitly mentioned briefly, but then not properly explored. The biggest strength of season 1 in my opinion was how it set up a very interesting scenario and then let things play out in a fairly realistic/believable manner, without subjecting the viewer to too many deus ex machina surprises. In many episodes of season 1, I had fun imagining what I would do in the situation, thinking about all of the various factors involved. In season 2, it felt more like uncontrollable events kept being thrown at largely unchanging characters, which isn't nearly as fun.\\n\\n\r\nI loved the characters from season 1, and while I don't particularly dislike how a lot of time was spent on certain characters in season 2, I feel that a lot of time was wasted on unimportant and uninteresting things when we could've instead been exploring more of the characters, many of whom ended up largely forgotten. The characters at the end of season 1 remained largely unchanged by the end of season 2 -- there wasn't much character growth.\\n\\n\r\nI do think that from a narrower perspective, execution was OK. When characters did appear, season 2 remained pretty faithful to them; I didn't often feel that characters were being twisted. The settings and dialogue were usually OK. Individual episodes were usually interesting enough to keep my attention.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I have to say that I think it was decent. It's probably comparable in quality to popular shounen anime. I'm mainly just struck by massive disappointment compared to season 1, which was monumentally better. I really wish that some new continuation could be made from season 1, but that's probably not going to happen.",

Season2 just try to showcase friendship and BS that is obviously there to fill the time and try to produce a 25eps when I really think this can be cut to 18 maybe less. There are literately eps where you need to watch 2~4mins and that is what meaningful to the story. They made a calculating/ thoughtful story and fights into Friendship feast and unrealistic events in game world. \r\nSpoiler\r\nLets talk about the finale raid andhow stupid it was. I just want to know how does a low level players can do damage to 90lvl monsters? Why would you put low level characters in that raid? I remember them showing that in Season1 when they met the Chif Cat and the little girl when she tried to heal and her healing was little to none. So now with a lvl 58~59, they can heal lvl90 people and what is worse in a Raid where they stated before that normal monsters deal more damage than before? That and TON of other chat events in this season Took my immersion away. Eps turn into girls chatting and nothing happening at all. A full eps is for the girl to practice and then do Shonen crap on us in the Akihabara fight. A full eps was done just to show the Elf Guild Master encourage and REPEAT himself over and over. JUST cut it, I rather watch a 12 meaningful eps than an extended version of girls talk/encouragement talk/TALK TALK TALK/Valentine filler eps..for double the content. Quantity doesnt mean Quality and this season/anime proved that point. \\n\\n\r\nIt was painful to finish, and I honesty didn't want to say so. Focusing on stupid love fight between a middle school and a grown girl with middle school body is so annoying. Talking about friendship that can be done at least once and be done with, getting a lot of eps to show that is annoying. Making little girl skill in organising a Raid group of lvl90 when her experience doesnt pass lvl58 is annoying. This season was annoying to watch and takes you out of the immersion when the story breaks rules(game's rules) when they sit them before in previous season is annoying.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, this season made the story boring and the game setting even more boring than ever. Keep that up if there is a season3 because this is worth 5 At best when Season1 worth 8~9 with their game rules/story.",

            "content": "First season was better.\r\nThe story isn't as good as season one. I've never seen a flashforward that worked well, and this one killed any tension in the first half of the show. Additionally, a significant portion of the show is dedicated to worrying about love interests that is rarely reciprocated. Developing relationships is fine. If there isn't a confession/rejection, then it is wasted time. Time that could be spent doing more with the story. Season one accomplished a lot while world building and introducing characters. This season coasted off of the earlier hard work. Lastly, there was a little dissonance between the source material andthe anime. It comes off as a little jumpy or awkward conversation between characters near the end.  \\n\\n\r\nArt is about the same. Studio Deen took over for Satelight and I see no discernible change. \\n\\n\r\nSound was incredibly lazy. The opening was reused from season one. Also the bard Isuzu, sang the ending from season one as her performance plug in music. That's not ok. I need to see some originality from a aspiring musician. For all the talk about creating new music for the world of Elder Tale, it's awfully hypocritical to reuse songs. Side note: Do you know who's famous for playing music while watching a city burn? Emperor Nero. That's not someone I would want to be associated with, Isuzu.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter's don't really change or grow from season one. Akatsuki has the biggest change, but that's basically her becoming less of a loner. Several characters experienced moments of doubt and renewed resolve but this effectively changed nothing. As backstories are concerned, we learned part of Tohya's. It's not lengthy, but it explains some aspects of his character. Oh. We get to see a little bit of Kanami. That's a plus i guess.\\n\\n\r\nMy enjoyment fell off a bit. The first half felt slow and Shiroe and the gang didn't accomplish near as much as they did in season one. The half hearted romances also brought it down. Sadly, I thought the last episode was really good. It felt more exciting than the rest of the show did. And then there were credits.

            "content": "Finally getting around to cleaning out my database of old animes I lost interest in and came across Log Horizon S2 and thought I'd give it one more episode to get back on track.  Nope.  I don't know why they did it, but they built a cast of interesting characters in season 1, did a good job of focusing on the intricate details and politics of building up a new society, had a good amount of action and suspense, as well, and then, just decided to dump all of that to follow tertiary background kids through the forests to accomplish whatever...I forgot.\\n\\n\r\nIt was a stupid directorial decision that killed this anime for me.  No one gives a crap about what these minor characters are up to.  It would be like Gintama not covering Gintoki and Odd Jobs for half a season and just focusing solely on Hasegawa.  The only difference being, people actually give a crap about Hasegawa.  They just abandoned everything that made this anime great in the first season and only give it to you in snippets while they follow around kids you don't care about.  \\n\\n\r\nI dropped this at episode 17.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 1\\n\r\nArt: 5\\n\r\nSound: 5\\n\r\nCharacter: 3\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 2\\n\r\nOverall: 3",

            "content": "The first season of Log Horizon quickly became a personal favorite of mine. The show excelled at combining intelligent exploration of societal issues and how to apply them with a genuine sense of fun and enjoyment- a combination most shows struggle to achieve. Every episode was a true joy to watch, and the first season left off with the promise of more great things to come. Unfortunately, the second season suffers from a lack of purpose and poor pacing that left me disappointed.\r\nOne of the largest problems is that, as many others here have pointed out, this season largely feels like filler. There about fourmain arcs taking place during this season, and most of them are stretched out far more than they need to be. If this had been a twelve or thirteen episode season, these problems would likely not have been as much as an issue. As things are, there are entire episodes that seem to be simply repeating points already made in earlier episodes. When goals finally are accomplished, we are not really given a good sense of why those accomplishments matter most of the time. The first season always built on the previous actions of the characters, changing the dynamics of the world around them and giving them new challenges to face. In this season, we are sometimes told that we should care about something that has happened without being giving a tangible reason why. Some of these issues with filler and pacing are remedied in the final few episodes of the season, but the show still ends up going in a very different direction than was seemingly promised at the end of the first season. Plant Hwyaden, a totalitarian and dangerous guild who presented themselves as a real threat to the Round Table in the first season, do little more than occasionally talk about things they might do here. The season ends with no advancement along this plot point. Overall, when it comes to actual plot development, there are only a handful of episodes that contribute to this goal.\\n\\n\r\nAn additional failing of the second season is how it handles its characters. As much as I enjoyed the original Log Horizon, I can admit that its characters were certainly not the best part of the show. They were generally fun and endearing, but not deep. The second season attempts to develop the characters somewhat, but ends up doing so in ways that seem forced and unnatural. In addition, the main character development arcs I could pick up on seemed to be essentially exactly the same arc for each character. They were feeling insecure about their abilities and through a series of happenings learned to believe in themselves while still leaning on their friends. This is not necessarily a bad skeleton for a development arc, but it ended up feeling very forced and very samey very quickly when it was repeated for character after character.\\n\\n\r\nThe one area in which I would say Log Horizon season 2 is equal to the original would be in its soundtrack. Yasuharu Takanashi did a superb job on the soundtrack for the first season, and he did not fail to impress here. I have listened to the soundtrack apart from the show on many occasions and still get enjoyment out of it.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Log Horizon season 2 was a disappointment. It did not damage the show so badly that a good third season could not make up for the problems (if that ever happens), but I honestly wouldn't recommend it to fans of the original unless they were really desperate for more Log Horizon, regardless of quality. While the likelihood of a third season is dubious, I really hope that it does come around to give Log Horizon the continuation it really deserves rather than what we got here.",
