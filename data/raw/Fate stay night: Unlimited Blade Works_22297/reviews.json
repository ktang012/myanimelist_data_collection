            "content": "**THIS REVIEW CONTAINS MINOR SPOILERS**\r\nThis is the most overrated anime I have ever seen. If one is expecting a grand follow-up to Fate Zero, one is gravely mistaken. You are about to say \u20188.43?\u2019, \u2018How can this be?\u2019, and \u2018This is scandalous.\u2019 (Jojo reference). Well move closer to the screen and let senpai explain.\r\nStory=3\r\nThe story consists of tossing a teenage boy into the Holy Grail war (an Armageddon between masters (contemporary individuals who supposedly command their respective servants) and servants (summoned titans) for the sake of obtaining the Holy Grail). This should be a gruesome event with fights to the death, BUT . . .\u2018Fuck that,\u2019 Shirou brazenly proclaims. \u2018I am going to lead my harem life and ignore every peril.\u2019 As one may have guessed, this anime isn\u2019t really about the war. It\u2019s about the harem Shirou obliviously leads. Most of the anime is focused on the relational struggles of the protagonist and some high school girl. For 8 episodes, we are forced to endure Shirou\u2019s petty conversations with Rin inside his home or at school. Not much is done to contribute to the Holy Grail War as apparently\u2014going on a date is more important. \\n\\n\r\nProgress in this anime is almost non-existent. The characters are non-progressive as they are constantly engaged in purposeless chatter and dawdling. The story is littered with pseudo-drama, pseudo-fights, and cliff hangers, which are sometimes intriguing, that evokes utter disappointment and results in pointlessness. The fights are just random clashes with no deciding outcomes and little build-up. Oh, a few episodes later a servant dies. Due to the complete absence of characterisation, no one cared. \\n\\n\r\nThere are multiple flaws in the anime. One being Saber commenting on Berserker\u2019s ability to simultaneously solo all the servants. She then proceeds to 1v1 him as though they are of equal calibre. Then she moves to \u2019cover\u2019 (behind a little gravestone) and wrecks berserker. The most flagrant one is Shirou's plot armour that countlessly saves him.\\n\\n\r\nTrivium; for some reason, this anime was revered as a slice of life when it was airing. Upon inspection, these \u2019slice of life\u2019 moments were just fan service. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter=3\\n\r\nMost of the characters were scarcely developed and characterised. Literally nothing is known about them asides from their superficial identities. The characters that received most of it were abjectly cliche and mundane. \\n\\n\r\nShirou=1\\n\r\nShirou is the naivest and most idealistic cherry boy I have ever seen. His special ability is being impervious to anything macabre.\\n\\n\r\nShirou logic: I have almost been killed multiple times . . . Oh well, they must have their reasons. I forgive them.\\n\\n\r\nThese types of characters, the type that starts off naive and idealistic generally mature or at least develop but not Shirou. Despite all his near-death situations, he remains ignorant. What\u2019s annoying is Shirou\u2019s lack of concern for the war throughout the show as he seems to be preoccupied with maintaining his high school life. I just can\u2019t help but mirror his disinterest, while viewing this show. \\n\\n\r\nShirou can be described in three words, \u2018asinine and mundane\u2019. He is so often brushed by the verge of death but lives or is kept alive because he is \u2019interesting\u2019; however, that\u2019s just his naivety and incredible plot armour rather than anything interesting. He is also indecisive and mostly follows the instructions of others. Whenever he decides for himself, the outcome is boring, being completely predictable, and/or completely irrational. Their current route with Shirou seems to be:\\n\\n\r\n1. Protagonist has no experience and is completely rash.\\n\r\n2. Magically becomes shrewd and can pull off incredible moves in the most critical of situations. \\n\r\n3. Will soon surpass Rin despite being completely incompetent and useless.\\n\\n\r\nRin=2\\n\r\nRin is one capricious vixen. Her daily routine involves whining to and about Shirou and then having the biggest mood swings. \\n\\n\r\nRin: I am going to kill Shirou; Wait, time to team up again.\\n\\n\r\nRepeat this throughout the show, and it becomes annoying.\\n\\n\r\nHer character clashes with her backstory and motives. Her childhood was riddled with traumatic events, such as her parent\u2019s premature deaths and the early separation from her dear sister. She\u2019s also lived independently for most her life endeavouring to further herself as a mage. She explains an inherent character of a mage is being able to further one\u2019s goals despite the means. One would expect a more mature, traumatised, or troubled character, right? No, she\u2019s infantile, simple, and sometimes unduly cordial. Putting it in anime terms, \u2018I AM TSUNDERE INCARNATE!\u2019\\n\\n\r\nArcher=7\\n\r\nHe is one of the better character in the show but he lacks sufficient characterisation, development, and screen-time. He also seems to be the only one taking the war seriously on team Shirou.\\n\\n\r\nFor anyone who has seen Fate Zero, RIP Saber\u2019s character. There is almost a complete loss of her original character.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment=3\\n\r\nThe anime was initially somewhat enjoyable (6/10), but it just frivolously dragged on. As mentioned above, the fights were and the plot was largely meaningless. The anime fails to build the necessary tension and suspense to lead an engaging plot. The outcomes were predictable or completely irrational, and the story was somehow unreasonably slow paced. \\n\\n\r\nOverall=3\\n\r\nUnless one fanatically love shounens, avoid this show at all cost. It is a blender of cliches.",

            "content": "If there\u2019s one word that any anime fan can be familiar with, it may be \u2018Fate\u2019. The franchise adapted from the highly popular Type-Moon visual novel has been around for a decade. In 2006, an anime adaptation by studio DEEN was released in an attempt to adapt the visual novel. And while it included the characters from the series, there were controversy regarding the actual adaptation. Then, there was the movie titled \u2018Fate Stay Night: Unlimited Blade Works\u2019 movie that was released four years later. But even so, that only ran less than two full hours in a futile attempt to adapt the Unlimited BladeWorks route. To say the least, it\u2019s inefficient when attempting to craft a story in such a short time frame. Luckily, Ufotable decided to step up to the plate deliver what fans want \u2013 a faithful adaptation of the route in TV series medium.\\n\\n\r\nMake no mistake. This series runs a lot longer than 2 hours with the finale extended to fit the double the time of a single episode. So in a way, this series can be viewed indirectly as having more than 12 episodes in total time length. (total of 16 episodes actually if including episode 0) What\u2019s more though is how the series is set up. Because of the nature of MAL\u2019s database, this review will not cover the episode 0 that introduces the story from Rin\u2019s point of view. Rather, we are introduced to the young man known as Shirou Emiya. For people wondering about the series, it is not essential at all to watch Fate/Zero or the F/SN: Unlimited Blade Works movie. In fact, I would highly recommend skipping the latter and focus on this adaptation as that\u2019s more of a promotional product. This TV series adapts the route known as \u2018Unlimited Blade Works\u2019 with high level of anticipation.\\n\\n\r\nThere\u2019s little doubt the show has a variety of ideas whether it\u2019d be related to magecraft, the Holy Grail, or the mechanics of the Holy Grail War. Taking these ideas and presenting them can be quite a challenge but I do have confidence to say that this adaption did justice. The first episode introduces Shirou Emiya who we see a normal teenager attending high school with his friends. There\u2019s foreshadowing and hints thrown in the backgrounds already to show that not all is going normal around Shirou\u2019s neighborhood. It doesn\u2019t take long for the show to hit the supernatural realm when we see magic and otherworldly powers in Fate style. Shirou becomes the Master of a powerful Servant known as \u2018Saber\u2019 in a dangerous tournament (Holy Grails War) after nearly getting himself killed by another servant. Battle ensures and the series manages to craft a setup that will unanimously create more anticipation. The way the first few episodes are set up doesn\u2019t just create a thrilling mood but also spawn questions especially for new viewers. This is where the show shines as the adaption adequately explains the mechanics. Although some bits can feel like typical info dumping, there are comedic points thrown in to ease the bits of unsettling boredom. But do note that it\u2019s fairly important to listen to the explanations because it all connects to the characters and story.\\n\\n\r\nThe way the story is crafted involves the main cast, or specifically the Masters and the Servants. We already know who Shirou is but there\u2019s also another prominent Master that is introduced from episode 0. Her name is Rin Tosaka, the master of Archer. For those who have seen episode 0, it\u2019s likely that you\u2019ve got to know her a lot more than the previous Fate franchise. Nonetheless, she comes into conflict with Shirou and the other Masters in the Holy War. The servants play prominent roles as well especially involving the infamous Saber. She is more of the poster girl as well as the warrior who wishes to win the Grail War. On the other hand, Shirou represents the most human character in the series. Honest, loyal, and courageous are a few words to describe him. And although he may seem like a generic character, there\u2019s no doubt that he can influence others. What this first half of the series does is introduce the main players that the VN fans will be familiar with. For new fans of the series, they will be delighted to find out just how much the adaptation extends beyond the movie.  Characters such as Illya, Kirie, Shinji, Issei, Taiga, and Sakura are all introduced in clever ways. Even more so, we have the servants who make their debuts as well. Lancer for one makes quite an entrance to create the intensity of the war. What we also have are also other servants that contrasts with each other in terms of their personalities. Whether it\u2019d be Archer\u2019s ideals, Saber\u2019s chivalry, or Rider\u2019s cunning nature, every servant offers something new to the table. Or sometimes, you may just have a big grunt like Berserker who wants to rip everything to pieces.\\n\\n\r\nLike I mentioned before, the series offers variety. What that means is a balance of mood and pacing for the series to work. Yes, there\u2019s mystery going on in the background with the events of the show. Yes, there is also action to keep up the momentum. Then, there\u2019s also the slice of life-like atmosphere. Taking place in a high school setting, the series also finds time to lend comedy and even realism to what could have been an all-around action flick. While this may come as a mixed bag, the series does it cleverly to build narrative with the characters. Rather than just talking, they show what the main characters\u2019 lives are like with others. Even more so, this series makes it quite interesting considering that Servants and Masters aren\u2019t exactly similar with ideologies. Shirou is a prominent example unlike some others who wishes to win the Holy Grail war with their personal dark desires. What goes around comes around and this show proves a point when it crafts its story\u2019s relationships between characters. There\u2019s chemistry between certain characters that can easily been such as with Shirou and Saber or him and Rin. Unfortunately, not all of them get their spotlight and some are still shrouded in mystery (example: the mysterious blonde young man shown several times in the series). And mystery, that may be an overused word by some point. We don\u2019t find out too much about some characters\u2019 intentions such as priest Kirie Kotomine. But do we want to? For some, that\u2019s a certainly and is why the show will keep the audience at their feet. It makes the audience want to figure out the puzzle with the pieces. The dialogues are cryptic but provides hints while dreams (such as Rin\u2019s) create suspense. Then, there\u2019s also the more charming moments as some tense scenarios focuses on Shirou\u2019s own personal perspective. There\u2019s no doubt that he is becoming closer to Saber and the show portrays this with tiny packages of hints rather than explicit fatal attraction. Still, don\u2019t expect much romance for the first cour of this show. Treat it more as a setup with all the key characters bought into the series like players to a game. Because honestly, this Holy War is where winner takes all.\\n\\n\r\nThank you Ufotable. I\u2019ll say this twice because the studio really deserved the gratitude for their superior effort in adapting the animation quality of this series. The animation style of this series looks lavishly done whether it\u2019s the backgrounds, character designs, or the jaw-breaking action scenes. There is a good amount of action focused on all the fights that gives both the servant and their master a chance for spotlight. The action itself is well coordinated with rapid movement and clever camera angles. In short, Ufotable outdone themselves with the budget they have. And to be honest, there\u2019s little criticism to say when it comes to the artistic frontier of this adaptation. Mage spells are also cleverly demonstrated while violence create the brutal reality of the Grail War. There\u2019s minimal fan service except some suggestive camera angles. But judging exclusively, this series is almost flawless on the artwork.\\n\\n\r\nSoundtrack also plays a pivotal role although not as strong as the artwork department. The two most prominent aspects are the OST during the fight scenes and the character voice mannerisms. I give praise to Kirie Kotomine, Rin, and Caster for their character portrayals. It is very real to their personalities and to the point. Shirou even gets some praise at times when he makes his effort to what he has to say. Unfortunately, there\u2019s also some bits that can be irritating at times; namely Sakura and her repetitive dialogues or Shinji\u2019s narcissism. The OST is also a great comeback and treat for fans who are in favor of action. Every action sells with even tiny details being incorporated with the battles. This can be easily seen such as Saber being tossed into objects, Shirou being tortured by Rider, or Rin jumping several stories to avoid Lancer\u2019s blows. While not as fantastic as the visual realm, soundtrack is by no means a pushover.\\n\\n\r\nTrue to its hype, Fate Stay Night: Unlimited Blade Works is a must-see of the year whether you\u2019re a fan of the visual novel or coming into series as a newbie. There\u2019s much to adapt but the first half captures that very well with the setup. To say the least, this show has that sort of momentum every episode. It is set up and then delivery with the series capitalizing on every opportunity. Along the way, we also get breaks with useful info dumps, humorous gags, and relationship building. The action will no doubt leave you in awe thanks to Ufotable\u2019s technical qualities. Still, there are some characters you may like and some you\u2019ll despise; more people will probably have that decision by the second cour of the show. Characterization is not a masterpiece though and neither does the story offer perfection. There are parts in this series that sometimes will waver off with its mood and peculiar balance. Still, there\u2019s a saying that third time\u2019s a charm and Ufotable hit the bull\u2019s eye on this show. Now, the second half of the series awaits\u2026.\\n",

            "content": "Okay, So before I review the 1st half of this season,\r\nI like to state that I'm not really familiar about this franchise that much to my knowledge, so this is literally my first time watching this series from this point on along with episode 0 so keep that in mind. \r\nI've heard most people talk about this show during its airing so I decided to give it a shot.\r\nThe show starts off well enough given us introduction to the main characters including the plot about the holy grail having the power to grant any 1 wish to the master along with their servant in defeatingthe other 7 masters and their own servant. \\n\\n\r\nIn this 1st half of the show we follow our 4 main characters Rin, Archer, Shirou and Saber. \\n\r\nHowever I found this to be a problem, The main 4 characters \\n\r\n(well Mainly Rin and Shirou) I not saying these 2 characters are bad but their own depiction of their own personality were kinda boring and very tedious for the most part. \\n\\n\r\nThey pretty much have this generic chemistry between them that seems just like any other ordinary teenage couple set up like in any other anime show along the lines of a typical teen romance that has been done SO many times! which leaves me for the most part disinterested with their progression unfortunately, \\n\\n\r\nEspecially Shirou who seems to be quite a decent person at heart, willing to learn about magic involved in this series known as mana which is something a master must use in order to control and support their fellow servant in order to win the battle or survive. With Shirou that is just it, there is NO real unique trait upon viewing his character with this (''I'm a good guy'', I'm a hero nonsense) To me it just came off as being uninteresting and 1 dimensional for the rest of the time I was watching him on screen along with Rin also, since they both seem damaged from what happened in their past or something oh buuhoo. The process to this just seems too familiar.\\n\\n\r\nThe supporting cast as much as I like their character designs, they also don't really get thoroughly flushed out either which for me is a downer and its by far the weakest aspect of the 1st season I believe so far, It could of shown some knowledge and background about them rather than just\\n\r\nleaning towards Rin X Shirou. \\n\\n\r\nBut then you have both the other 2 main characters Archer and Saber that seem to hold a more depth to them and unlike the other 2, they at least show SOME interest to their personality and their character. but the sad thing is, it kinda feels overshadowed by Rin and Shirou at this point of the series which honestly didn't leave me with a good impression on the characters as a whole.\\n\\n\r\nI commend the anime for having a fantastic high budget animation with great fight scenes that were pulled off amazingly in this And I tell you It looks stunning!!. The fights with the master and servants in this are just jaw-dropping and very detailed.\\n\\n\r\nThe music is pretty decent also for the most part, but can be quite forgettable to me at times. I also enjoyed the scenery a lot in this show displaying different locations that looked really beautiful from up close and far away. \\n\\n\r\nBut as much as I love the story, plot, animation and some of its soundtracks I found few of the main leads Rin and Shirou to be just tedious despite what was going on in the episodes I was watching even if there were signs of possible foreshadowing to the 2nd half of this anime it still could of used better characterisation.\\n\\n\r\nThe ending cliffhanger to the second half looks interesting, almost like the series will get a lot better since it generally feels like a set up  and I cannot wait so hopefully it will give me some better enjoyment with the cast all round.\\n\\n\r\nOverall The 1st half of this will be is a well deserve 7 out of 10",

            "content": "(This has been adapted from my reddit thread)\r\nIn life, one thing is true for everyone: we all have desires. Wanting to be wealthy beyond imagining, finding the love of one's life, obtaining that dream job; there is always a goal, a wish that seems impossible to reach no matter how hard one tries. Aspirations bring about both the best and the worst in people, due to the very nature of what they bring. And if these wishes do happen to come to fruition, they affect not just the winner, but those closest, too. Fate/Stay Night: Unlimited Blade Works Season One is the beginning of sucha literal wish-fulfillment journey.\\n\\n\r\nSTORY\\n\\n\r\nThe story begins with Emiya, a high school boy who witnesses a strange fight in a nearby courtyard. After being cornered, he somehow summons Saber, a noble woman who calls him Master. Knowingly or not, Emiya officially joins the Holy Grail War.\\n\\n\r\nUBW (the acronym of choice from here on out) sits in a precarious position. It's not technically a sequel and, simultaneously, it is the first half of a two part adventure. As such, it takes the burden of introducing the characters and spearheading the world-building for what is to come. On this end, the anime holds its own. In order for the audience to completely understand what is really going on, it intersperses the battles it is known for with heavy dialogue and exposition. These moments craft the rules involved, the players of the game, the limitations, the terminology, the magic system, etc. A lot of it is mostly shoved towards the viewers because there isn't much time and the anime wants to focus on other aspects (i.e. the fighting).\\n\\n\r\nThe anime has a strange habit of allowing many of its characters to live through seemingly impossible situations. This type of behavior is fine if it's done within reason (no huge deus ex machina or logical reasoning exists). However, on numerous occasions, many cast members, and more specifically Shirou, are permitted to fight another day. Often times, the answer is frivolous: \"this was fun, let's do it again,\" \"you were entertaining, so leave,\" \"I can't kill on merit, so walk.\" The idea is obviously not to eliminate the characters so early, since they play roles later on down the line. But without proper explanations backing their escape, the effect is lost, and it becomes an eye-roll as time and again the battles involved amount to nothing more than pomp and flash.\\n\\n\r\nBeyond the world-building, past the fighting, UBW's core ideals are, in a phrase, less than ideal. Again, it's difficult: the anime is juggling multiple different facets at once, all within what is the first half. Essentially, the show looks at the idea of whether it is possible to fight for pure justice, and what that ultimately entails. What is justice to one person may be defined separately by another. How much of it is considered enough in a given situation? Who delivers the final judgement? These kinds of questions are, sadly, not looked at in-depth within UBW. It begins to present the idea, having two upholders of such morals against one another, but isn't explored enough to warrant it a conversational topic. Because, per usual, the fighting takes the spotlight, preventing any form of thematic merit.\\n\\n\r\nANIMATION\\n\\n\r\nThe art and animation within UBW is some of the best in the business.\\n\\n\r\nStarting with the art, the scenic backdrops and amount of detail found within them are usually breathtaking. Bustling cities, panoramic bridge shots, populated parks, and eerie cemeteries are just a sampling of the beautiful art pieces that the anime dishes out.\\n\\n\r\nThe character designs are distinct in their lack of facial detail. This seems strange, considering what the art itself has to offer. But this is done for a reason; it provides an accentuating difference between the characters' faces and the outfits they wear. Saber's blue regalia, Rin's red and black mage attire, Archer's trench coat, Emiya's scarf, and Illya's purple winter clothes appear simple in nature, but provide each character with an iconic look that makes them memorable outside of the show.\\n\\n\r\nThe actual animation does not falter. UBW contains, without a doubt, some of the best, most well-choreographed fight scenes in all of anime. And it should, considering how much attention it is given. The battles are incredibly detailed, with flying swords, dazzling effects, and a superb amount of variation between the duels. One can feel the immense power that the Servants have, and it is always a spectacle to watch on-screen. Outside of the battles, the show maintains an above average amount of quality. Characters move naturally and small details like the reflection of water, nuanced hair movements, and the 3D enemies bring about more of the animation that has made ufotable famous.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS\\n\\n\r\nAs a shounen and \"battle royale,\" the cast involved is large, with the more important among them garnering the most screen time. Reiterating myself, it is important to remember that this just the beginning of what UBW supposedly has to offer.\\n\\n\r\nThe most famous of Servants, Saber is a regal woman of nobility and honor. Fair in beauty, strong of will, and unrivaled in combat, she is considered by many to be the best subordinate any Master could hold. Like the other Servants, her past and namesake are shrouded in mystery, but it's unquestionable that her convictions take the form of exacting justice on the evil and bringing hope to the weak. Emiya is her Master, and their personalities fall in line hand-in-hand. She trusts him and he trusts her, bringing about a duo that, no matter the circumstances, have a bond that cannot be severed.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of Emiya, he is a high school teenager who was saved by a man named Kiritsugu ten years prior to the events. Level-headed and kind, he seemingly cannot deny helping those in need, regardless of their moral status. His status as Master is considered odd. Having only the ability to strengthen objects, one of the lowest forms of magic, he can do little besides lean on Saber and her insane abilities. It's an interesting dynamic, because the one who wants to be the savior, the justice bringer, must first be helped and supported himself. And not just by Saber, too. No, a lot of aid is provided to him by a certain \"tsundere.\"\\n\\n\r\nArguably the fan favorite of UBW, Rin is a high school girl who descends from a family of magic wielders. Having lost her father and mother, she has trained rigorously for the day the Holy Grail War would come about once more. Extremely playful yet easily embarrassed, she takes pride in not only her magic but also in her ability to manipulate Emiya so easily. Where Emiya wants nothing to do with the War but save others from it, Rin's reasons are more apt: she's in it to win it. She may put up a front, but it's only because she can't bear to lose anything precious to her any longer.\\n\\n\r\nArcher is Rin's Servant. Among the whole cast, he is the most interesting of them all. Seemingly devoid of emotion, he utilizes swords instead of arrows to inflict damage to his foes. His personality is mirrored with Rin's: calm, unapproachable, and chiding. While he follows his Master's orders, he freely speaks his mind. More often than not, he clashes with Emiya, who holds contrasting beliefs. Like a typical bowman, he usually sits on the sidelines, always watching and listening, until he is ready to \"fire.\"\\n\\n\r\nThese characterizations have somewhat shown a small connection: the Master's involved summon their initial Servant that best pertains to who they are as a person. Emiya has the kind and determined Saber, whereas Rin has the standoffish and direct Archer. But what of the others? Berserker's Master is menacing and cruel, Caster's goes about its business as she does, and Rider's is every bit as deranged as she is. It's as if each person's characteristics have manifested themselves in spirit form, with the ultimate victor proving just what type of human is deserving to win it all.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND\\n\\n\r\nThe OP is good. It contains a good mix of guitar and violin, with a nice set of vocals. The falling piano playing, catchy beat, and lyrics make it great to listen to both in and out of the anime.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the ED, it starts off with an eerie vocal piece. What follows is very float-y instrument playing and singing that seems to invoke hope within the listener. After the halfway mark, the drums and beat do the singer little justice.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is a mixed bag. It is filled with mysterious arrangements for the more \"hidden\" scenes and acoustic guitar playing for the more relaxed ones. Guitar pieces fill the more \"cool\" moments, with the battles containing intense choir-like singing. As a final note, the sound effects provided are unique and add further to the overall experience.\\n\\n\r\nVoice-acting wise, everyone involved gave average to above average performances. A special shout-out to Saber, voiced by Ayako Kawasumi, who continues to reprise her role as the top Servant, with the gracefulness and emotion needed during all the right moments.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT\\n\\n\r\nThe reason you, I, or anyone else watches this anime is for the battles. The awesome, killer, amazingly detailed fights that exist at a regular interval from start to finish. I wanted there to be that next fight when the characters were sitting around talking. I wanted to see Saber's Noble Phantasm, watch Berserker crush all matter before him, and view Caster's incredible witchcraft. The fights are the highlight, and they were delivered tenfold.\\n\\n\r\nDuring the downtime, the skirmishes gave way to talking and world-building. While it was fun to see Rin and Emiya converse, or see Saber acting as her refined yet curious self, my inner conscious was saying, \"Let's get back to those fights, now shall we?\" Both aspects are done well on their own, but when you are comparing the two within their own show, you really want them to ignore everything else, even if it is technically important.\\n\\n\r\nFor now, Fate/Stay Night: Unlimited Blade Works Season One contains an okay story, a starting set of characters, and insanely high production value. It's actually very reminiscent of Fate/Zero's first half. The popularity of the anime and the universe it depicts is immense, but this one is still far from a masterpiece. Hopefully the second half, like the prequel before it, can pick up the remaining pieces.\\n\\n\r\nSUMMARY\\n\\n\r\nStory: Fine, nice world-building, too many conveniences, unrefined ideals\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: Great, stellar across the board\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Good, Emiya and Rin begin their journey, with the Servants being more than just spirits\\n\\n\r\nSound: Good, good OP, okay ED, okay soundtrack, good VA work\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Good, all about the battles\\n\\n\r\nFinal Score: 7/10",

            "content": "As a note, I have not read/played any of the Type Moon visual novels from which this anime is based.  I did however find Fate/Zero to be excellent.  Coming off of Fate/Zero I was completely pumped to jump right back into the world in Fate/Stay Night.  After watching the entire first season I have to say that I'm slightly disappointed.\r\nStory: 6\r\nThe story itself is relatively generic as a battle-royale for the holy grail, but is made more complex by the interesting heroes that are summoned to fight and their interactions with their masters.  This season however was quite boring.  Therewere not nearly enough fights or interesting story elements to justify the amount of downright dull scenes of Shirou at school or at home.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9\\n\r\nUfotable sure didn't skimp out on the animation for this show.  Backgrounds are beautiful and character animations are solid.  Fight scenes are magnificent, but too few and far between to completely showcase the animation at its finest.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8\\n\r\nSound effects are great and the Japanese voice-over is well done.  Hideyuki Fukasawa's soundtrack is a bit lackluster in my opinion and lacks some of the impact that Yuki Kajiura's Fate/Zero soundtrack had, and while it certainly never detracts form the show, it isn't anything special.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 4\\n\r\nThis is where I was truly disappointed.  Shirou is one of the least interesting main characters that I've seen in an anime.  While his back-story is interesting enough to make you slightly sympathetic, his idiotic ideals and brash ignorance make him incredibly boring.  Equally disappointing is Saber's portrayal.  While she was characterized as a complex and tragic king striving to attain the grail in F/Z, In F/SN she is now a straight-up robot with hardly any personality.  Archer and Rin can be fun to watch in comparison, but neither accomplish anything in this season.  The show really wants you to care about Rin and Shirou's alliance so it hardly focuses on anything else happening with the other servants.  I understand that development of the other servants/masters will come with the 2nd season, but that doesn't excuse the fact that they were nearly non-existent this season.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 7\\n\r\nMy enjoyment of this show mostly came with it being a sequel to Fate/Zero and getting to see what happens after the events of F/Z.  Though the characters are boring thus far, I do have hope that they will develop more throughout the 2nd season which I am greatly looking forward to.  I just wasn't as attached to the show by the end of this season as I was at this point in F/Z.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7\\n\r\nIt's fine, but not spectacular.  Can't wait for things to pick up in season 2.",

            "content": "This review is coming someone who only has watched Fate/Zero. I've seen a tad of the 2006 version of Fate/Stay Night as well. \r\nNow I understand that fans of the visual novel must be thrilled. I've been told this adaptation has been completely faithful. Which is what I was afraid of.\r\nBy being faithful to the Fate/Stay Night canon are completely undoing everything the Zero canon set the table with. Now please grant me the time to explain why that is.\r\n;Story~!\r\nI've said it before I'll say it again. The Fate concept is one of the greatest I've seen. Previous to this series I thought it wasimpossible to mess up. That was before I knew how much typical shounen tropes and weird harems could wound such an amazing idea. \\n\\n\r\nThe idea itself isn't bad here. It is the execution, the way this all was handled left me scratching my head. Now I know that FSN came first but I was hoping this series would go a different route. I sincerely thought they'd do something fresh to accommodate the Zero canon. \\n\\n\r\nI was wrong.\\n\\n\r\nYou see instead of the groundbreaking storytelling that helped this genre immensely we got with Zero this time... Well. We got a slice of life show with some flashy fight scenes every episode or so. \\n\\n\r\nEven with that said I can admit there was some amazing dialogue, few and far between as it was it was there. Mostly from Archer.\\n\\n\r\nSurprisingly nothing memorable from Saber.... Oh we will get to that.\\n\\n\r\nI generously give this story a total rating of!\\n\\n\r\nRating: 4\\n\\n\r\n____\\n\\n\r\n;Art/Animation~!\\n\\n\r\nI don't really need to go in-depth here. Completely amazing stuff, breathtaking visuals, fantastic animation. \\n\\n\r\nWhen Illyasviel did the little sway as she said, \"Ba-Ser-Ka~!\" I died a little inside it was so good. \\n\\n\r\nThere was animation put to Rin Tohsaka fanservice as well which I hated. This series doesn't need it, but animation is animation and it looked pretty. \\n\\n\r\nAs always ufotable is top of the line.\\n\\n\r\nRating: 9\\n\r\n____\\n\\n\r\n;Soundtrack~!\\n\\n\r\nPretty average here, nothing really stands out. This isn't just be being negative, I would say the same thing about Zero. Average doesn't mean bad I just wasn't blown away.\\n\\n\r\nFor what it was it was good. The music tracks were placed at the correct times. It enjoyed it for what it was.\\n\\n\r\nRating: 6\\n\r\n____\\n\\n\r\n;Characters~!\\n\\n\r\nThis where we have out biggest problem ladies and gentlemen.\\n\\n\r\nI didn't hate all these characters, in fact I love some of them. The problem is the characters I enjoy the most don't get a lot of screen time. I suppose I should start with our protagonist and heroine.\\n\\n\r\nComing into this series I was most excited to see how Rin Tohsoka turned out.  I mean after all that has happened to her there has to be some lingering affects. At the very least inner conflict!\\n\\n\r\nAs of the first season there is none of that, not even one mention that I recall. Instead of the brave, headstrong young mage I remember from Fate/Zero this Rin is completely different. Annoying and clueless, also part of a ridiculous harem.\\n\\n\r\nLet's turn to her partner in crime Shirou Emiya! I wasn't as excited for him but carrying around the name Emiya I had hopes. All of those hopes were thoroughly crushed.\\n\\n\r\nShirou is what I would call the typical gary-sue targeted to young teenage boys who have powertrip fantasies. Flocked to by all the girls around him, overpowered to the point he can take on a servant. \\n\\n\r\nI don't care about the twist either, that is also stupid. It just strengthens my believe that Shirou is an overpowered gary-sue.\\n\\n\r\nSakura Matou showing no ill effects to the torture she was put through was completely ridiculous. Cooking for Shirou was far more important for her character than any actual development.\\n\\n\r\nLet us all turn to the most crushing blow of all, Saber. Fate/Zero was not only groundbreaking for the genre but also for women in anime and manga. Unfortunately this sequel has completely taken five steps back in that regard. Because you know women have to do dishes and make Shirou sandwiches.\\n\\n\r\n Saber was strong with internal battles and demons. Her dialogues were thought provoking on so many different levels with so many underlining themes. Saber was the figurehead of the Fate series. Every time someone thinks of Fate it is very likely Saber is the first thing that pops into their mind.\\n\\n\r\nThis series completely undoes all of that amazing dialogue in Zero. Saber the regal king is just another piece in Shirou's harem box. I was shocked when she could pass for a highschool student, I was always under the impression she was a lot older. \\n\\n\r\nIn those amazing conversations with Gilgamesh and Rider, Saber was completely unmoved. Apparently it takes the idealistic talk of a Japanese student to sway Saber. \\n\\n\r\nSaber goes on dates and even has fanservice throughout. Whether it be that a king forgot her manners and can't eat with getting stuff on her cheeks. There was even a fanservice scene involving glasses.\\n\\n\r\nThroughout all these shenanigans Saber feels a lot less special. Every time she spoke in the previous series it meant something, here it just feels like wasted breath. \\n\\n\r\nOne of my favorite characters was completely butchered. \\n\\n\r\nThere were rays of light throughout. Like Illyasviel and Archer, there were others not even worth mentioning since they had even less screen time. The bad greatly outweighs the good here.\\n\\n\r\nRating: 3\\n\\n\r\n____\\n\\n\r\n;Overall~!\\n\\n\r\nIf you are one of the people overjoyed with this series well... I'm so happy you were able to find enjoyment where I couldn't.\\n\\n\r\nI was so ridiculously excited for this series and so thoroughly let down it hurts. \\n\\n\r\nFate/Zero is one of my favorite animes of all time. The Zero canon while it is fantasy was grounded in a dark reality. FSN is just campy and completely ignorant. This sequel targets a completely different audience and it hurts itself for that.\\n\\n\r\nIn the end the Holy Grail War felt like a game for these kids. Hell, they were even comfortable enough to keep going to school. Even after finding out that someone was trying to put up barriers around it.\\n\\n\r\nFor some reason these two masters walk around like two kid detectives in a gag manga. Then when something actually escalates into a dangerous situation they are both shocked.\\n\\n\r\nThere were some amazing fight scenes in between all the silliest but that doesn't change anything for me. Flashy scenes without substance are nothing that special. Imagine that groundbreaking animation in Cowboy Bebop only with terrible dialogue and story in between, I don't think we'd be talking as fondly about it today.\\n\\n\r\nI expect the second season will step it up at least a little. I hope it fares better than this outing.\\n\\n\r\nThis one has been the biggest disappointment of 2014 for me. \\n\\n\r\nFinal Verdict: 3/10~!",

            "content": "The Fate franchise is among the most recognizable and highly lauded titles in the anime community. It should go without saying that this lofty praise is largely due to Ufotable's impeccable presentation and production values. When it comes to the Fate franchise and other Type-Moon adaptations, the studio pull out all the stops as evident with Kara no Kyoukai and the critically acclaimed Fate/Zero. \r\nIf there was ever a black sheep attached to the Fate franchise's name, many will without a doubt point to the 2006 lackluster adaptation of Fate/Stay Night and the 2010 Fate/stay night: Unlimited Blade Works movie by Studio DEEN. The Fatefranchise isn't new to multiple studio collaborations as Silver Link have already taken on the role of adapting Fate/kaleid liner Prisma\u2606Illya and has manage to keep a consistent presentation. But that still left Stay Night up in the air until now, as Ufotable tackles the adaption of the Unlimited Blade Works route, attempting to shine new light where DEEN have dragged it through the mud. \\n\r\nNow with all that said you may be wondering why the score is so low, did something go wrong? Well no not really, as far as production goes Ufotable's track record with Fate is still spotless but that doesn't mean what they adapt was. You see the Fate franchise always boast a \"battle royal\" and the closet thing we got to that came with Fate/Zero but it seems like no matter how you dress it, Stay Night when it all boils down to the inescapable facts, is simply another \"run of the mill\" story of empowered bishounen teens and silly cock fights that leads nowhere.  Today we'll break down the overlooked truths of this anime, a show with high production value but a subpar script. \\n\\n\r\n1st we'll get the positive aspects out of the way: Art/Animation: 9.5/10, Sound 8/10\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt/Animation: 9.5/10\\n\\n\r\nThere's good animation and then there's Ufotable animation. For many anime fans already familiar with the studio's work it should go without saying that it is absolutely gorgeous. The amount of heart and effort presented in every frame is clearly evident with richly saturated color palettes and smooth textured backgrounds. The attention to detail is worthy of immense praise, as it doesn't take long to be immersed into the show's setting. Every movement from our characters show consistent fluidity and just the little things like their hair moving as they walk or the ruffling of someone putting on a jacket brings a sense of realism. \\n\r\nThey also excel in cinematography showing unique camera angles and well crafted camera panning shots. It feels like you're watching a Shinkai film at times and that kind of consistent quality from a series is almost unheard of. But for most of us the greatest enjoyment comes from the solid fight choreography. This is where the studio really shows their stuff as they brilliantly use all the tricks they have up their sleeves, from contrasting color pallets to cinematic compositions making every action carry a sense of weigh behind it. You can feel every blow and strike from the characters, this is an eyegasm worthy of multiple rewatches. Although it isn't all perfect as little nitpicks like the CGI cars still feel out of place from the immense detail surrounding it but it certainly isn't a huge issue when compared to everything else it had going for it.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nto accompany the strong animation we're given a great song composition to boot. Brought to life by the highly praised Yuki Kajiura, a woman made famous for her gripping orchestic pieces and her atmospheric somber ballads. The soundtrack fits the show like a glove and really enhances every scene to new elevated highs. The only downside being that their was very little to distinguish this score from any of Kajiura's other works, as her signature style almost feel like carbon copies of each other. Despite that it is still a wonderful attachment and one welcomed any day.\\n\r\nThe voice actors were also good, many fitting into their roles without any qualms to speak of. Standouts being Suwabe's role as Archer, as he gives him that no nonsense aura and Ueda as Rin as the chemistry she brings between the other cast feel quite natural.\\n\\n\r\nNow with the praise out of the way let's address the elephant in the room: Story 5/10, Characters 5/10\\n\\n\r\nStory: 5/10\\n\\n\r\nDefinitely one of the biggest offenders, the story is noticeably flawed, even a casual viewer who pays little attention to it can easily spot the missteps. When it comes down to it the presentation and execution of the show is the only thing separating this from your \"run of the mill\" bishonen fighting show.  Hiding under the guise of a \"battle royal\" it seems like the only episodes that showed true progression were the 1st, one in the middle and the last. Everything else was obvious padding to reach the shows desired length, with lots of dead time and fights that lead nowhere. For a \"battle royal\" it seems like everyone is more concerned with chivalry and throwing praise at their opponents than actually eliminating them. Every fight seem to boil down to \"I'm going to kill you... wow I'm impressed with your skills... nevermine I won't kill you, let's fight some other time\".. Now this isn't always the case as the last confrontation in episode 12 actually yielded something other than the monotonous cycle. But that doesn't excuse the rest of the show from dicking around with needless slice of life moments, unnecessary harem-esc comedy and aimless fights. \\n\r\nAgain this isn't a fault with the studio but with the poor script they have to work with. It's one thing to stay faithful to your source material but it's another to let said material bog you down. This sense of stagnation lead to very tension-less encounters since all that comes out of it are wounded opponents that simply retreat to recuperate for the next empty encounter.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 5/10\\n\\n\r\nAs much as I like the cast of the Fate franchise it isn't hard to see them for what they truly are, which are simply characters. Only a few of them feel like actual people while the rest feel like simple 1 note puppet pieces dancing across the screen.\\n\r\nOur main protagonist Shirou isn't as offensively idealistic as portrayed in his DEENs counterpart but he isn't any better either. He still spouts naive ideologies found in your typical bishonen MCs. Your \"fight for what's right\" kind of archetype, one I'm sure many of us are tired of seeing. \\n\r\nthankfully Rin Tohsaka is more tolerable as she isn't your Asuka level of tsundere, but she feels more well rounded. However their is very little dimensions to her character, as it seems the show relies heavily on your prior knowledge of her placement in the Fate universe. \\n\r\nThe shows other biggest offenders come in the form of the supporting cast, with bombastically 1 dimensional characters like Shinji Matou and for the most part a majority of the Servants. Archer says it best, as he describes the servants as being nothing more than instruments for the masters to use and that's exactly what they feel like. Most of them exudes 1 note archetypal characteristics that defines them. May that be Archer's \"no nonsense\" archetype, Caster's \"big bad witch\" 1 dimensional villain representation or Saber's \"lady of honor\"  1 note portrayal. All the the servants show little to no layered characterization and depends to heavily on pseudo-history to hold any merit. They simply can't stand on their own as people and that keep them from being anything more than 1 note characters. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nAny qualms I have with the shows characters & story is easily washed away with the great presentation.  Ufotable is simply a studio that can't be faulted as they always succeed at bringing wonderful eye candy to the screen that will keep you hooked from beginning to end. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 6/10\\n\\n\r\nDespite its lackluster cast and story Unlimited Blade Works is truly pure entertainment. As popcorn material it is only rivaled by its predecessor Fate/Zero. For anyone seeking awesome fights, fluid animation and easy consumption look no further, this title is truly an addicting watch. There is something here for anyone, may you be a fan of the franchise or not. With that said I recommend giving this title a go.",

Oh shit wrong adaptation.\r\nStudio DEEN\u2019s horrible adaptation of Fate/Stay Night Unlimited Blade Works is one of the most dreaded adaptations in anime. Now ufotable, in all of its HD glory, will now adapt one of the most loved routes of the visual novel. And it turns out to be great.\r\nLet\u2019s us go to the specifics. \r\nThe story is different from the Fate route as it now focuses on Rin Tohsaka. As it goes on, ufotable manage to showcase masterful execution. It makes interesting premise and makes the audience want to know and watch more. This Fate/Stay Night fix the problems of itspredecessors, one of these is the exposition or info dumping. If there is two words to associate the Fate series, it must be gotta be \u201cboring exposition\u201d. Especially to a big verse, that is the Nasuverse, that has many terminologies and stuff to explain about magic. It takes all of the visual novels or its anime to interconnected it to form a one united verse. Like I said, its info dumping is less and separated into bits which makes the show more action and drama. \\n\\n\r\nAnother problem this show fixed is its characters. You remember Shirou? Forerunner of one of the most used memes related to anime. Remember we all hate him. Not now anymore. HIs character is less annoying and it is much more developed than his Fate side. The character interactions are better too and all characters are really more likeable and better written.And we see goddamn TsundeRin in all ufotable glory \\n\\n\r\nNow we talk about what made ufotable and the series so popular and hyped, its visual in HD glory and seemingly unlimited budget. I think this series wouldn't be the same without its blockbuster budget. Every episode is like you are watching a Pixar movie that is well animated. Thanks to the responsible planning of the staff. The music is glorious and exemplary. \\n\\n\r\nFate/Stay Night, due to these things, is now overhyped and overrated. I think Fate/Stay Night first cour does not deserve a 9 but it is still a exemplary adaptation and a interesting premise. Kudos to you ufotable.\\n\\n\r\nStory - 8/10\\n\r\nArt - 11/10\\n\r\nSound - 9/10\\n\r\nCharacter - 8/10\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 9/10\\n\r\nOverall - 8/10",

            "content": "**SPOILER FREE REVIEW OF BOTH SEASONS**\r\nIf anime history has taught us anything, it\u2019s that visual novels are an incredibly difficult medium to adapt into anime form. Whereas a VN can contain hours upon hours of dialogue in order to establish characters, the story, the setting, and the lore, anime do not have such a luxury. In addition, VN\u2019s offer the player the ability of interaction; they allow you to choose what path to go down and ultimately what \u201cending\u201d you will receive. Choosing a poor option can actually result in death, thus shattering the concept of plot armor and keeping the reader on edge. EnterFate/Stay Night; one of the most popular VNs of all time. Its story and characters are absolutely iconic as a result of its widespread fame. Would studio ufotable be able the capture the magic the source material is so widely praised for possessing? Unfortunately, the difficulties of transcending two very different mediums have never been more apparent than in this iteration to the Fate series. While I haven\u2019t read the original work myself, I can wholeheartedly say that Fate/Stay Night UBW is a mediocre at best anime and good for virtually nothing outside of its flashy animation.\\n\\n\r\nSynopsis: Seven \u201cmasters\u201d, who are powerful magic users, summon seven \u201cservants\u201d, who are iconic figures from throughout history and fiction, in order to fight it out for possession of the holy grail; a magical item that will grant the recipient\u2019s greatest wish. The story follows Shirou Emiya; a teenager with weak magical abilities who gets himself involved in the fray.\\n\\n\r\nUBW\u2019s story line has a plethora of issues, and a great deal of them stem from the fact that visual novels just don\u2019t work as anime more often than not. First of all, this show\u2019s amount of info-dumping and pacing in general is absolutely atrocious. Watching this show feels like watching Dragonball Z all over again; the characters just talk and talk and talk and repeat and repeat and repeat. Shut up and fight! Even when there is no fighting going on, all the characters know how to do is talk about the plot. There is So. Much. Explaining. I understand that the lore of Fate/Stay Night is important to the story, but have you ever heard of \u201cshow don\u2019t tell\u201d? Constant paragraphs of exposition may work in a visual novel, but not in an anime. \\n\\n\r\nEven worse than info-dumping is the direct consequence of it: The characters are all shallow. Because ufotable is trying so hard to cram as much of the backstory and dialogue as they possibly can into every episode, something is very clearly missing: characterization. Every side character in this show might as well be a cardboard cutout. You\u2019ve got Rin \u201cmost generic tsundere I\u2019ve ever seen\u201d Tohsaka, Illya \u201cI only exist to make you sad and serve no actual purpose\u201d Einzbern, Sakura \u201cThey completely forgot I existed\u201d Matou, Shinji \u201cimmersion-breakingly hammy\u201d Matou, and who could forget Saber, also known as \u201cMy route already happened, so I don\u2019t matter anymore\u201d. I can\u2019t stress enough how big of a problem this is. Many of the major characters who receive a significant portion of screen time don\u2019t even reach the 2nd dimension; a task that even completely incompetent writers can accomplish. They also fail to have even a slight amount of chemistry with each other, as every character relationship feels contrived and artificial. The only character this show seems interested in fleshing out is Shirou, and boy does that bring up a few issues\u2026\\n\\n\r\nFirst of all, how on Earth is anyone supposed to take Shirou Emiya seriously? Calling him an idiot would be an insult to idiots. This kid either has a death wish or the reasoning capabilities of an infant baboon. Or both. Before I even go into the number of times over he should have been killed and simply isn\u2019t for the convenience of the plot, let\u2019s talk about his \u201cI have to save everybody\u201d ideal system. Shirou: You realize that nearly 2 people die every second, right? You understand that it is not physically possible to LITERALLY save EVERYONE, right Shirou? You are a random teenager with absolutely no power, so surly you understand that you can only so much? No. No he doesn\u2019t understand that. Shirou\u2019s childish at best and completely insane at worst delusions are immersion breaking on the sole grounds of how mind-blowingly stupid they are. He unnecessarily endangers his own life and lives of countless others on a frequent basis even when there is absolutely nothing to gain from it (making him a hypocrite), he is unfathomably dense, and the very little personality he has is entirely unlikable. Shirou Emiya is one of the worst anime characters I\u2019ve ever encountered.\\n\\n\r\nAnd let\u2019s mention plot armor for a second: We\u2019ve established that in the VN, it is possible for Shirou to die if the player makes the wrong choice. This means there is no plot armor in the VN, which I\u2019m sure works very much to its benefit. In the anime, however, there is no outlet or excuse for the obviously fatal situations that Shirou and the others manage to walk away from every other episode. There is NO logical reason whatsoever that people with every incentive to kill Shirou NEVER do when they have the opportunity. Yet again, it\u2019s like watching Dragon Ball Z. We all know the hero is going to win, but can you at least put a little effort into creating logical reasons for WHY he is able to win rather than just having him miraculously surviving an encounter that should be fatal by the show\u2019s own assertion EVERY time? It\u2019s painful to watch.\\n\\n\r\nTo top off the disastrous writing and execution of this show, I feel the need to mention how downright edgy it is. That\u2019s right; \u201cedgy\u201d. Since that term has become a bit of a buzzword, here\u2019s what I mean by that: Something is edgy when it is dark, gritty, or shocking without any legitimate reason to be; it\u2019s just thrown in there for the sake of shocking the audience or attempting to appear more mature than it actually is. Giving specific examples would delve into spoiler territory, but it reached \u201cCraaaawling iiiiin my Skiiiiiin\u201d levels of bad. When you consider that this is a show clearly under the impression that it is intelligent and philosophical, these moments are absolutely cringe-worthy.\\n\\n\r\nI\u2019ve said before that the fight scenes are the best part about this show, but even those become hard to take seriously when the writing behind them is unbelievably childish. Every fight, and I do mean essentially EVERY fight gets resolved with a total asspull. Be it a last second save or a deus ex machina, this is some truly disgraceful writing. Is watching the protagonist getting predictably saved at the last second over and over and over and over again, as if he was ever in any real danger, REALLY fun for you guys? Seriously, is it? Does that honestly not suck every bit of suspense out of the entire plotline and make it impossible to take seriously? Because it certainly does for me. To make this comparison for a third time, it\u2019s like watching Dragonball Z.\\n\\n\r\nRegardless of how badly the plot and characters managed to fail in my opinion, it can\u2019t be denied that UBW has some pretty astonishing animation. The art style is nothing to write home about, but the fluidity of the actual motions as well as the choreography is nearly flawless. The action scenes will absolutely take your breath away, and the show really needed a lot more of them (and a lot less info-dumping). The settings and backdrops leave a bit to be desired, but the use of colorful gradients as magical attacks fly across the screen really gives the show a unique flair and keeps your eyes glued to screen. The music and voice acting is also good. Notice the emphasis on \u201cgood\u201d. Not \u201cgreat\u201d. There are no tracks that really blew me away and the sound design wasn\u2019t anything particularly impressive either, so while the overall use of sound is above average, it\u2019s not legendary or anything.\\n\\n\r\nI didn\u2019t really delve into how pretentious the show is, I could have been more harsh about EVERY fight ending with a god machine, and there are several plotholes I can\u2019t mention due to spoilers, but at this point, I think you get the idea. Fate/Stay Night UBW is a very, very flawed anime. The budget and cinematography is really the only thing that separates it from the rest of the crappy shounens, and I truly wish that wasn\u2019t the case. I was a fan of Fate/Zero and I wanted to believe that DEEN\u2019s 2006 disaster was just a fluke, but UBW has led me to believe that it was not. Fate/Stay Night is simply not going to work as an anime adaption, and this show\u2019s abject failures in spite of its massive budget provide more than enough proof of that.",

            "content": "On July 27th earlier this year, there was a public presentation held by Ufotable regarding what their long-awaited remake of Fate/stay night (F/SN for short) would actually cover as that had been unknown up to that point. When the preview was finally shown and it was revealed that they would be covering the Unlimited Blade Works route (UBW for short) as a full TV-series, there was a cry of relief and happiness resounding all throughout the fanbase of the franchise (if you were following the live stream at the time you'll know what I am talking about). Type-Moon's ten year old work of art hasgotten tons of exposure over the years, but somehow it had still never gotten a proper anime adaptation, a whole decade after the original visual novel was released. The only anime it ever received was the TV-series Studio DEEN provided back in 2006, as well as an attempted movie version of UBW in 2010. However both of these were complete butcherings of the source material, and thus the search for a legitimate F/SN anime continued all the way until this day; the day when we all turned our eyes in Ufotable's direction in hope that they would finally save the day. Of course, when it comes to visual novel adaptations, in all honesty less than 1% of them live up to their source material in terms of quality, but in this case however, I had no worries. I just knew that Ufotable would pull it off; it was like an aura lying in the air.\\n\\n\r\nAnd lo and behold, they actually did.\\n\\n\r\nNow before I get into this there's something I think needs clarifying: I will not make any comparisons or references to Fate/Zero in this review. It will be written as if this was in fact the first part of the Fate/ universe you watched. This is simply because despite the fact that Zero aired before this anime, its story goes under the assumption that the viewer is familiar with the events of F/SN first. In other words you are really supposed to watch UBW *before* Zero, unless you've played the original visual novel first of course in which case anything goes. Watching Zero first will sadly spoil numerous plot points of this anime's storyline. I will not go into further details on this subject however as it has been discussed to death, but will rather recommend people to check out the FAQ Sticky thread on the UBW subforum if you have any questions regarding viewing orders or anything else.\\n\\n\r\nAnd with that finally out of the way; let's get into this shall we?\\n\\n\r\n--Story--\\n\r\nIn a nutshell, Fate/stay night can be labeled as a supernatural battle royale.\\n\\n\r\nRoughly once in every 60 years, the one and only legendary artefact known as the Holy Grail will have gathered up enough magical energy from the Earth in order to allow an event called the Holy Grail War to commence. In this \"war\", seven mages (or maguses as they're called here) are chosen by the Grail to summon seven Heroic Spirits of legend. Heroic Spirits are people that have been labelled as heroes by the residents of the Earth after their death, and have consequently been taken to a place outside the flow of time where they can be summoned from by the Holy Grail.\\n\\n\r\nThe seven summoned Servants are by default divided into seven character classes: Saber, Lancer, Archer, Rider, Caster, Assassin and Berserker. Heroic Spirits can only be summoned as classes that would fit into the character setting that they had while they were still alive as humans, for example Robin Hood would surely be an Archer and Genghis Khan would most certainly be a Rider, etcetera. Once a Servant has been summoned, the responsible magus then takes command of him/her and takes on a role referred to as their \"Master\", and they join together as a team in order to try to bring down the other six teams of Master and Servant. The reason for all of this is that whoever wins the Holy Grail War gets possession of the Holy Grail itself, an artefact so powerful that it is said to be able to grant any wish its owner desires, and the Master and Servant get to share the reward if they're both alive at that point.\\n\\n\r\nAnd with that, the premise of the story is created. In the grand scheme of things it is fairly straightforward as a whole, albeit not without its fair share of twists and turns along the way. What I always liked about F/SN is how it manages to intertwine great storytelling and intense action scenes, as those two aspects are generally pretty hard to mingle. It has this aura that makes every fight between Servants feel epic in execution but still maintain a constant sense of reason and purpose.\\n\\n\r\nThe pacing is very consistent, and more or less perfect. It gives you just enough breathing room in-between every peak of activity in order to give the characters time to develop properly, but without slowing down the action so much as to ever get boring. You'll always be eagerly looking forward to the next major event in the story, but it never rushes along the in-between segments just in order to jump straight into the action. As a result, it succeeds at providing episodes that are both fantastic on their own, but still steadily progresses the overarching story in order to get one step closer to the eventual conclusion.\\n\\n\r\nIt should be noted however that this anime only covers half the story, as the conclusion of UBW will air in spring 2015, and that this first half in all honesty contains more world building, character introductions and foreshadowing than actual revelations. However this is merely the calm before the storm in that sense as the best is yet to come.\\n\\n\r\n--Characters--\\n\r\nThe character cast of Fate/stay night is rather large and as an inevitable result it varies in quality from amazing to absolutely craptastic. I am not going to go into detail for all of them as that'd take an entire essay, but rather leave it at the four most important ones.\\n\\n\r\nFirst and foremost, there's of course our ever so famous, lightly tsundere protagonist Emiya Shirou. He is one of the seven Masters of the war and has Saber as his Servant. Despite that fact, Shirou is actually not a fully trained magus, and is thus unable to provide Saber with enough magical energy to let her use her full strength. Shirou doesn't particularly care about any sort of reward the Holy Grail might be able to give him. He merely wants to make sure no one else gets it either just in case they'd use it for malicious purposes. To be perfectly honest, in a certain sense Shirou is a bit of an idiot. He has a certain idealism based around the idea that he has to be a superhero that he holds onto desperately which quite frankly can be extremely frustrating to watch at times because his actions tend to defy all common sense every so often. In this anime however, Shirou also has a huge amount of character development and his likability goes up constantly over the course of the story. Granted he's still definitely not the best protag you'll ever see but his role fits pretty well into the plotline of UBW so I can't really complain. Sometimes a character's true worth is not based on how much you might like him/her, but rather depending on how well written they are, and in that sense Shirou pulls it off just fine.\\n\\n\r\nSecondly, there is Tohsaka Rin: the noble rich girl who is hopeless with all modern-age technical gadgets. She goes to the same school as Shirou, and is generally treated as the best honor student and perfect woman of it by all the other students. She is also a fellow Master and thus officially one of Shirou's enemies, however the pair of them tend to (for the most part) let each other off the hook in order to primarily focus on other, more dangerous foes instead. In addition, Rin is an exceedingly rare case of a generally approved-of and extremely popular tsundere, probably because she is actually very well written and just plain entertaining to follow, despite her extreme naivety. Rin is not someone who is only there for appearances however, but rather is a very competent magus in reality, fully capable of holding her own against most enemies, and also hopelessly outclassing Shirou when it comes to magical capability.\\n\\n\r\nThirdly, we have the ever so illustrious Saber, the so-called \"strongest Servant\" who serves as Shirou's sword and knight. Oftentimes she comes off as a robot-like \"I'm so powerful and righteous I'll just beat everyone up without sweating a beat\" kind of holy warrior, though she can be pretty cute every once in a while when her dere side emerges. Unfortunately for her however, since her Master, Shirou, is unable to provide her with the normal amount of magical strength due to his incompetence as a magus, Saber has to do her best at holding her ground in combat despite being in a very weakened state. As a result she's unable to ever show off her full potential as a warrior, but even so she's still far from a weakling.\\n\\n\r\nAnd finally we have Rin's Servant, Archer. He is... well he's just badass throughout. I don't see how you could possibly dislike him. In all seriousness though, Archer is an extremely unpredictable, blunt and overall mysterious character in general, and trying to figure out what exactly he is thinking most of the time is a tall order. As far as combat goes, despite his name he normally fights with a pair of conjured short swords, dual-wield style (which I personally think is one of the coolest weapon setups you can use). Of course he has a bow as well but he only ever seems to use it when he gets really serious.\\n\\n\r\nNow in case you didn't know, UBW at heart is Rin's route in the original visual novel, and hence she's the main heroine in this anime. Diehard fans of Saber might find that fact somewhat disheartening, but you'll just have to deal with it. Of course since Saber and Archer are Shirou's and Rin's Servants respectively, they obviously hang around the pair of them almost all the time as well so as far as actual screen time goes then there's plenty of it for all of them. I think it fits the tone of the story very well when Saber is actually being treated as the character she is, I.E: a heroic swordswoman; not just reduced to some mere sappy love interest. Rin on the other hand has a lot of natural chemistry with Shirou that never feels forced as they're actually both humans in similar positions, not to mention that they're both tsundere for each other. Hence I think the \"main heroine\" privilege is in fact a lot more suitable for Rin than Saber could ever hope to have in that sense.\\n\\n\r\nThe rest of the cast consists of various schoolmates and general acquaintances of Shirou and Rin, all the other Masters and their respective Servants, as well as the illustrious priest Kotomine Kirei who is arguably the most impactful character of the entire franchise depending on who you ask. As always, some are better than others, but as a whole the character cast of Fate/stay night is very intriguing due to the very specific setting they all have, and as a result they are (for the most part) very captivating to watch.\\n\\n\r\n--Animation--\\n\r\nYou know what, there's not really any point in beating around the bush here so I'll just say it: excluding movies, this is quite likely the best looking anime ever made.\\n\\n\r\nUfotable have always had top notch production value, but what they brought out this time is just unreal. There's this specific aura surrounding the entire anime, namely the aura... of money. Whenever you watch UBW you can straight-up feel the insane amounts of pure cash that has been poured into creating this beast. Especially the CGI effects used for all the magical spells and superhuman fighting moves during Servant battles are completely out of this world. A single episode of this anime probably cost more to create than an entire season's worth of your average series (though I don't actually have any numbers on that). It's just that high quality. You might as well rename the whole thing to Unlimited Budget Works. Should only be watched in 1080p or you're seriously missing out.\\n\\n\r\n--Sound--\\n\r\nHonestly one of the best things about the fight scenes in the original F/SN visual novel was the soundtracks accompanying them. They livened up the atmosphere so much and made you pumped up and excited to find out what was going to happen next as a reader. When I look at the equivalent fight scenes in this anime though... I don't really get that kind of feeling, at least not to the same extent. Now instead since the animation in them is so out of this world gorgeous you don't really have time to think as much about the audio supporting it of course, but still as far as the audio itself goes it really doesn't have quite the same level of epicness that I remembered from the game. That being said, it's still Kajiura Yuki composing the whole thing so it's definitely very good for what it is, and by no means drags the series down if you don't give yourself any unreasonable expectations. It just could be even better.\\n\\n\r\nThe opening theme is called \"Ideal White\" by Mashiro Ayano, and the ending theme is called \"Believe\" by Kalafina. While they're both perfectly fine, neither are anything particularly special nor anything I would put into a music playlist.\\n\\n\r\nThe voice acting cast is the exact same one as it has always been for every other release from the Fate/ universe in the last decade across multiple mediums so at this point their voices are already burned into my brain and directly connected with the respective characters that they're voicing. Short version; while some are better than others of course, I can't think of anyone that doesn't live up to the respective character he/she is voicing. That in itself is enough reason for me to not complain about any of it.\\n\\n\r\n--Enjoyment--\\n\r\nFall 2014 was undoubtedly a great season for anime, but UBW was definitely the one series I always looked forward to the most every week. The fight scenes themselves look absolutely mesmerizing and are just a treat to witness every single time, and even when the anime has its more slice-of-life-esque segments it's still just as enjoyable to me, simply because of how likable the characters are. At the same time the overarching story keeps dropping subtle hints to you as a viewer, teasing you with what is yet to come in the second cour and making you curious about how things are going to turn out in the future.\\n\\n\r\nAs a whole, there's always this constant strive to keep watching as there are so many things just want to see unfold before you, be it for the sake of finding out what is really going on behind the scenes or just for getting to see more and more brilliant animation in potential upcoming Servant battles and similar. For myself at least, I like to say that one of the best ways to truly show the mark of a great anime, it's that whenever you finish watching an episode of it, you immediately want to see the next one, and then the next one, and then the next one etcetera, and UBW does this to the highest degree from start to finish. It's that ability to completely captivate you as a viewer that I'm always trying to find when it comes to anime.\\n\\n\r\n--Overall--\\n\\n\r\nI don't like to label myself as a Type-Moon fanboy. That would be an exaggeration. While I certainly like them they don't tend to completely blow me away. However I like to say that out of all their creations, Unlimited Blade Works is the one and only route that well and truly impressed me from start to finish back when I was reading the visual novel about a year ago. It has this constant atmosphere that makes you feel excited to see more, but it still maintains the pacing needed in order to not get ahead of itself. Ironically, sometimes this makes you a bit impatient as a viewer if you're desperately waiting for the next Servant fight or greater plot development to occur, but at the same time that exact feeling is what is going to make you stay captivated even during the most calm and relaxing moments. That being said if you are an impatient viewer, then I might recommend waiting with watching this anime until the second cour has aired in the spring as otherwise you'll be left hanging on a quite nasty cliffhanger at the end of this season.\\n\\n\r\nAs it is, \"perfect\" visual novel adaptations essentially do not exist, and make no mistake; UBW is not an exception to that rule. Despite everything there are still numerous things I could mention that could have been adapted better and made it easier for anime-only viewers to understand certain details of the overarching plot. That being said, UBW is still one of the absolute most faithful visual novel adaptations ever made, no doubt about it. I think it showcases once and for all that the most reliable formula for creating a magnificent anime is having a great (if possible finished) source material, a trustworthy animation studio and a shitload of money.\\n\\n\r\nAnd that's about all I have to say about this. Now granted this is only the first half of the story as the second part is airing in a few months' time but I have no doubt that it will be even better than the first one was. The conclusion of UBW in the visual novel was fantastic, and I have a ton of faith in Ufotable at this point after they've come this far. I can't imagine them messing it up at this point. However that is a story for another time.\\n\\n\r\nSpring can't come soon enough.",

            "content": "Please note: At the time of this review the second season for Fate/stay night: Unlimited Blade Works (TV) has not aired yet. \r\nAs a rather avid fan of Type-Moon, Nasuverse specifically, I was highly enthusiastic to watch the first season of Fate/stay night: Unlimited Blade Works (TV). I must say here and now that it did indeed meet, and partially exceed, my expectations. I knew it was going to be great. I knew it was going to be a true adaptation, which has never happened for the Unlimited Blade Works route (disregard that crappy DEEN movie). I mean, it's Ufotable. The same studio that broughtforth the anime adaptation of Fate/Zero and Kara no Kyoukai, which are both highly excellent anime. I'd be shocked if it was anything less that a great anime. Now, to start.\\n\\n\r\nStory - The basic premise for pretty much anything in the Fate franchise (minus Carnival Phantasm, although that's all of Nasuverse) is pretty well known: Set in the modern era, seven Magi summon seven Heroic Spirits, heroes of the past who have achieved great deeds in life, to fight in a battle royale of sorts to the death. The winning Master (the Magus) and Servant (the Heroic Spirit) will receive the Holy Grail - and omnipotent wish granting device. Pretty simple, right?Now, you may be thinking that it's just a clich\u00e9 shounen battle anime based off that premise, but that's far from the truth. Fate/stay night has always been a clash of ideals, it's never been just about fighting. It's about why a character takes up their blade to fight until the bitter end for what they believe to be right. Now, I won't go and say that the first season of Unlimited Blade Works is incredibly complex: it's not. For much of the first season, it's just building off the premise, setting the story up for season two. However, the actual story is still quite good if it was just that. It builds up plots for next season, and underlying hidden mysteries are hinted at. But Ufotable did more than just that, they went the extra mile. They added in new scenes that enhance the show as a whole. They likely did much of this to fill in some gaps from the Fate route, because that's the actual introduction arc of the visual novel for Fate/stay night. I'm also glad they referenced Fate/Zero more obviously than the visual novel did (as it wasn't written yet). You can see characters reactions to meeting other characters, just the subtle things that really stand out. That's why Ufotable is great, and that's why I give the story for this season of Unlimited Blade Works a 9/10.\\n\\n\r\nArt - I don't even need to say it, do I? It's damn near movie quality, if not already there. This is the best animated series I have ever seen. They even one-upped Fate/Zero, their previous work (which was already amazing). Ufotable has their CG flow so well with the 2D that it's just astounding. The vibrant colors and flashy animations are pretty damn good, too. And check this: they had to tone it down for TV. The blu-rays will be glorious. And the fight scenes, the gloriously amazing fight scenes are truly unique and amazing to behold. Seriously, if there's one animation studio that can do epic cinematic fights real well, I give it to Ufotable. I give the Art for Unlimited Blade Works a well deserved 10/10.\\n\\n\r\nSound - When I first watched Unlimited Blade Works, I didn't really care for the music. I think it's probably because I was used to Yuki Kajiura's Fate/Zero soundtrack. With that, I didn't notice that the music in this adaptation for Fate/stay night was actually quite fitting. It's actually quite similar to the background music in the visual novel. The music can really set the scene in this anime, and I truly did enjoy it. I give props to Hideyuki Fukasawa in regards to the music. Now, the voice acting was great, I don't think I really have to mention that. The opening song, Ideal White, was also quite fitting for this first season of Unlimited Blade Works. Although I wasn't too huge a fan of the ending song, I still thought it was acceptable. Now, one thing that made me love this soundtrack so much more? We got This Illusion. Fucking yes. Although it was the last episode of this season, episode 12, we got it. You see, This Illusion is rather iconic for the Fate franchise. It was in the original visual novel as the opening background song, also it was in there instrumentally as the soundtrack, and even in the DEEN anime for Fate/stay night it was the opening. With that, I give Sound for Unlimited Blade Works a solid 9/10.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - The characters for Fate/stay night have always been superb. I find a reason to like every one of them, minus maybe Shinji (though I love to hate him, so there's that). And Ufotable just brought those characters to live to their fullest. As stated previously, Fate/stay night has always been a clash of ideals, and in Unlimited Blade Works it's mostly between the protagonist, Shirou, and Rin's servant, Archer (not the Fate/Zero Archer). I'd rather not go too deep into it, as it's huge spoiler territory. However, I will say that if you were never interested in the Fate franchise because you heard that Shirou was a bad and clich\u00e9 protagonist, then I say that you were wrong. Likely one would hear that from someone who has only seen the DEEN anime, which Shirou is really clich\u00e9 in. However, that's because of the route that was being adapted in that anime was the Fate arc, which Shirou doesn't develop much, if at all in (it's an introduction route in the visual novel). However, Shirou grows a lot in this anime. Although it's incomplete, you can still see him growing. And I assure you he will grow further in season two. As for Rin, she's enjoyable, and if you like tsundere characters, you will like her. As for Saber, she remains best girl (sorry Tohsaka, but it's still Saber for me). Although there's plenty other intriguing characters, I'll let the viewer see that for themselves. Characters for Unlimited Blade Works gets a 9/10.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - Alright, if you've read through my review I'm sure you know that I freaking loved it. As a Nasuverse addict, I'd probably still love it even if it were lesser than the glory that it is. I also believed it was a great set up for the much more fast paced second season, which I am waiting for with pleasure. I would go to bed on Friday feeling like a kid waiting to watch the newest episode of UBW. Yes, I am biased. Get over it. It's pretty obvious I'd give it a recommendation and an Enjoyment of 9/10.\\n\\n\r\nOverall - As I stated earlier, Ufotable did great, and even partially exceeded my extremely high expectations. A total rating of 9.4, round that down and you get the final score of 9/10. I recommend this to any and all, and I'm impatiently awaiting for the glorious second season coming in April. Ufotable will not disappoint, I have my complete and total faith in them.\\n\\n\r\nViewing Order - Alright, this part of the review is mostly my opinion on how you should view Fate if you watch anime only (so, not including the visual novel, but if you can I'd recommend reading that in it's whole before watching any of the anime). So, I'll start off by saying that I believe that Fate/stay night should be viewed before Fate/Zero. The reasoning? Fate/Zero assumes you've read the visual novel. Not only that, but it spoils much of Fate/stay night. Fate/Zero is meant to tie up the loose ends in the visual novel story, but it should work just fine tying up the story of the anime as well. Speaking of Fate/stay night anime, should you watch the 2006 DEEN one or this one first? Well, just watch this honestly. Don't bother with the DEEN one unless you're really into it, and even then watch this first. You have to wait until the second season (unless it's already out when you're reading this), but even then it's worth it. Now, nothing against people who watched Fate/Zero first, I did of course. But, for new viewers I recommend the following: Fate/stay night: Unlimited Blade Works (TV) -> second season -> Fate/Zero anime -> anything else Fate that piques your interest. Of course, if you can I recommend reading the visual novel, then do the above in that order. \\n\\n\r\nThanks for reading, and Saber is still best girl :)\\n\\n",

            "content": "Let me give it to you straight: \r\nThis part of the Fate series is one of the weaker ones, it doesnt compare at all to Fate/Zero because pretty much what we get is a high school setting with our usual cliche hero saves the world storyline. \r\nThat being said, this particular season (as well as its prequel) has amazing animation, the motion of the fights are fluid and the effects are pretty darn good. What i was disappointed with was the story and the characters for the most part. \r\nFlaws:\r\nThe biggest flaw is how we dont really get much character development out of the characters,as well as how slowly the story of the whole thing moved. \\n\\n\r\nShirou is what you would expect from someone that wants to save the world but doesnt even know why he wants to do it in the first place, he is the very definition of a trope that has been present in anime since the last 30 years and the kind of character that needs development the most in order to be useful and not cliche. Even then, his character and his motivations are pretty boring, definitely a shadow of the main character on the prequel. \\n\\n\r\nTohsaka is what you would expect from your heroine and tsundere, then again if you are watching this anime, chances are you dont really care much about her because again, is just what you would expect because you have seen it before countless times. Her character if i had to define it with one word  would be bland. Much better than Shirou however, since she does go through some development, and we learn what her motivations are and why she has the motivations she has. \\n\\n\r\nThere is a little bit of redemption however, the heroes are actually the gem of this show, while we dont get much out of their story, we know that their motivations are nonexistent and as such, they have to fight or die since they were brought back to life without their consent. Because of this, we get some pretty interesting back stories and some go out of their way to change the path set out by them.\\n\\n\r\nConclusion:\\n\\n\r\nOverall, the first season of UBW is pretty much pretty bland compared to its predecessor, the story barely moves at all and we get cookie cutter characters which you dont expect or care much for because you realize they are just there for simplicity sake and as fillers and nothing else. To me, what made this show better were the heroes and how they carried the plot, well and the pretty animation. \\n\\n\r\nDont expect much story and character development out of this, although it is the first season after all. I expect the second season to pick up the pace however, and tie the knots of the whole thing. Definitely a step backwards when compared to its prequel in every aspect, but passable still due to the things it gets carried on. \\n\\n\r\n6.5/7.0\\n\\n",

            "content": "I\u2019ve been holding off on giving a definitive score for this show; mostly because I wanted to make sure the rating was accurate. Having now seen the series, I can confirm what many already know: Fate/Stay Night is a great anime. Both in terms of an adaptation of the original Visual Novel and as its own show, I think we can all be at ease in the knowledge that ufotable has done it again. Rejoice all who hath cometh, the adaptation you've been waiting for is here!\r\nFor anyone new to the Fate series, the series in essence revolves around seven masters who summon historical figuresin a fight to the death. The winner among these seven will be able to use the Holy Grail, which grants any wish. That\u2019s the barest description one can provide of the setting, so you\u2019ll have to watch in order to get all the details. Needless to say, anyone looking for a fictional world to get engrossed in will love the Fate series and the Type-Moon universe as a whole. There\u2019s a rich history here that one could easily get lost in. As a rule of thumb, the visual novel \u201cFate/Stay Night\u201d is the ideal starting point for anyone looking to experience this universe (though the choice ultimately falls on the person). \\n\\n\r\nAs for the anime itself, the first thing one is struck with is the animation. This is by far the easiest aspect of the show to review because it\u2019s simply brilliant. Anyone familiar with ufotable knows they have a reputation in this category, and they do not disappoint in the slightest. Backgrounds are detailed, characters are well drawn, animation is fluid, and CG is blended seamlessly throughout. There is the occasional misstep with how a character is drawn, and there might be one or two moments where the CG doesn\u2019t hold up quite so well, but overall this anime looks as sublime as one will encounter in a TV series. Some things to pay particular attention to when watching are the facial expressions and body language. Each is appropriately expressive and adds a wealth of character to everyone onscreen even before any dialogue has been communicated. I\u2019ll leave the reader to decide for themselves how well the fight scenes are executed - but from this viewer\u2019s point of view, I can\u2019t remember the last time I was so captivated by combat in an anime.\\n\\n\r\nSound is likewise impressive. Every effect from the ground exploding to Lancer\u2019s spear has a distinct quality that keeps you engaged. The voice acting is likewise well done, with each character giving emotional and believable performances. While I find the music a little unobtrusive at times, this improves over the series, and you\u2019ll likely find a few pieces that catch your ear when you hear them. Not too much more to say here, but nothing to complain about \u2013 it\u2019s all top quality.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters is one department that the visual novel excels in, and this is transferred nicely into the anime. You encounter an assorted cast of very colorful individuals; each with their own goals and agenda. Emiya Shirou is at the forefront of this cast, and over the course of this season you grow more attached to his goals and the actions he takes to achieve them. Rin Tohsaka acts as the secondary protagonist, and is an intriguing character in her own right (I found myself wishing that she was the main focus at times throughout this season). Needless to say, each is likable in their own way and add a degree of charm to the war they are participating in. Other characters such as Saber, Archer, and the numerous servant and masters encountered throughout the show also have unique personalities are interesting in their different ways. The one complaint I have in this area is that I wish more attention was given to the main characters than what we got. While the material available for Shirou and Rin was interesting, I felt just a little bit more was needed to make them better rounded. Side characters like Saber and Ilya also don\u2019t receive as much attention as you might think, but is the unfortunate consequence of having only one out of the three routes being adapted in the visual novel. A bit of a nitpick, but one I couldn't shake off. \\n\\n\r\nThe story is an area that shows the greatest potential, but is also the weakest here. The problem is that the first cour acts as a setup to the second cour, and in the end we will have to wait for the second season in April to see the plot truly kick in. That\u2019s not to say the story is bad here \u2013 far from it \u2013 but the real punch of Unlimited Blade Works comes in the second half; which means there is a lot of build up with the promise that better things are to come. If it\u2019s any consolation, I can assure you that the second half will indeed be incredible if properly executed. For what there is, you will certainly find enough that\u2019s hinted at to keep you intrigued and guessing as to where the story will go next.\\n\\n\r\nTo sum up, these 12 episodes are a lot like half of a great meal: You find yourself satisfied with what you have, but only want more. Minor flaws aside, this show carries a tone and sure-handedness in its story telling that keeps you in constant awe of how events unfold. Anyone expecting a rich and deep universe with good characters and an intriguing concept will not be disappointed. While your best bet for experiencing this story as a whole is through the visual novel, I feel comfortable recommending this anime as someone\u2019s entry into the Fate series. If you happen to be one of these newcomers and are searching for a new series to invest your attention in: have a seat, kick back, and prepare to experience one of the finer universes anime has to offer.\\n",

            "content": "Fate is without a doubt among one of the best Visual Novels out there but unfortunately at first it didn\u2019t have much luck in it\u2019s transition into an anime, that is until Ufotable partnered up with Type-Moon and with Garden of Sinners they proved they know how to handle Type-Moon works and with Fate/zero\u2019s success they jumped right into Fate/stay Night. In Fate\u2019s story there are three routes you can take and Ufotable chose the second route for their TV series while leaving the 3rd route for a movie.\r\nFor the second route(Unlimited Blade Works) there is already a movie done by Studio Deen. They alsohandled the adaptation of Fate/Stay Night\u2019s first TV series and they already proved it is too much for them to handle. while that movie has good animation and great soundtracks there is no other reason to watch it if you haven\u2019t other than to spoil yourself the important parts  without any right explanation so keep that in mind if you haven\u2019t watched that already. (on it\u2019s own their adaptations weren\u2019t really all that bad but when compared to the source material it really lacks the depth and lacks proper explanation so if you already read the visual Novel before watching them it can enrage you even more).\\n\\n\r\nJust like Fate/zero the anime is divided into two seasons, with the first one doing all the introductions and building up and with the second one showing the results. Sadly while fate/stay night\u2019s first half is amusing it can also get a little slow and tiring at some points but we get to that later. One of the most important parts of Fate/stay Night is Shirou\u2019s ideals and you are treated with it\u2019s evolution in each route. The second route brings balance to his ideals, that in real life you can\u2019t be a shounen hero and you can\u2019t expect to help/save everyone. Also in this route Shirou gets closer to Tohsaka and form a deeper bond with her. I was very glad to see from the very beginning Ufotable focused on Shirou\u2019s ideals, showing fans that they know what they are doing and bring some depth to the story along with it. It is details like these that Ufotable cares about and they know we care about them as well which make their works ultimately a great experience to watch.\\n\\n\r\nThere are of course some problems with the story as well,(nitpicking) granted it is all subjective and this mostly has nothing to do with Ufotable as they were trying to follow the source material(they added their own things as well which i liked not saying they 100% succeeded in their adaptation but i liked it) but of course they could improve some parts if they wanted to(like pacing) so time for nitpicking. for example Archer\u2019s convenient different \u201clook\u201d that helped him mask his identity always bugged me,(there is a reason for it like side effects of his Magecraft but I am not satisfied with stuff like this sadly, I rather if he had a burned face or had a mask) or one dimensional characters like Kuzuki(Caster\u2019s master) or even Shinji (for example Shinji is also a tragic character, sadly he still lacks depth and is just In the story to ironically get manipulated by others and to piss you off). Now back to what I wrote earlier about the show being slow in the first season, it seems Ufotable\u2019s faithful approach turned into a double edge blade for them. In this season the real deal starts only at the last episode, leaving the rest of important stuff for the second season and beside Shirou\u2019s ideals getting discussed we only get to see a handful of events(that of course foreshadow stuff) and for those that only follow the anime it is hard to care for the stuff that happened. (granted Shirou already started growing in this season and there are some hints of what\u2019s going on around already) Plus Ufotable tried to implement some of the comical scenes inside the atmosphere they created and in my opinion in that aspect they didn\u2019t exactly succeed but the lighthearted scenes in the last episodes served it's purpose very well since it gave you the \u201ccalm before the storm\u201d feeling and you actually see the start of that storm in that episode. Also while I understand that the three routes of novel are suppose to be seen as one story all together it is a shame that characters like Rider are not explored till the 3rd route. Last nitpick is the amount of all \u201cI beat you but I won\u2019t kill you\u201d moments that got out of control in Fate/Stay Night. One could rename this as \u201cFate/Stay Night: Unlimited -Can kill you but won\u2019t- Works\u201d Of course there are explanations for each(like characters having their own plan for later or because of their personality) but it doesn\u2019t mean getting lots of these moments is a good thing since it can take away from the tension. But enough about the story and the characters, these are all things of the past and Ufotable is just trying to be faithful by following them and i liked some of the things Ufotable did that added to the whole experience. I just mentioned all these so the review feels complete.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is as fantastic as ever, while it feels there are no real improvements in the animation it feels this time around without the previous budget limitations the true potential was realized and overall we got treated with lots of impressive scenes and thankfully there was no sudden drop in quality unlike the temporarily one in Fate/zero. The character designs are faithful to the visual novel as well as expected although some of them like Rin felt a little strange at first. This time there is no fully 3D berserker like in Fate/zero so the 3D focus shifted toward Caster\u2019s familiars and other small things (even Rin\u2019s hair at one point at least). The old voice actors are also back again for another Fate ride and it is enjoyable to hear their voices again. Sadly I didn\u2019t enjoy the Opening song of this season while I enjoyed the Ending song as I expected cause\u2026Kalafina. About the music, While the music is good and the new composer Hideyuki Fukasawa tried so hard to be unique while staying true to previous material it didn\u2019t feel as epic as it could be but there are lots of chances in the second season to make that right with all the emotional moments.(he already got one chance in the last episode and pulled it off at least to some extent)\\n\\n\r\nNow time for building up more hype for the next season. Of course without a doubt the second season is gonna be one hell of a show and I am sure everyone is eager to see it. April 2012 is gonna be repeated all over again which is awesome.(again this time Caster class is responsible for the closing act) As for this season the production value and the attention to details really held it up and turned it into an epic ride for both old and new fans. A big thanks to Ufotable and Type-moon for entertaining us with this level of quality.\\n\\n",

            "content": "In 7th grade, I stumbled across the original Fate/stay night TV series produced by Studio DEEN and it was one of my favourite programmes at the time. It had magic, legendary heroes, action, and all that guff. Of course, I got older and I watched other shows that had way more to offer on that front so the original Fate/stay night didn't really hold up for me that well over time. In fact, I can't bring myself to sit through the original Fate/stay night series nowadays since there's so much wrong with it. Then enters ufotable, Type-Moon's best friend when it comes down to adaptationspromising us a fresh remake of Fate/stay night that actually adheres to the visual novel's story closer and with incredible visuals. Did they deliver? Well, I can't say that they lied because they gave us exactly what they promised. However, my expectations were shattered for the most part as I found out that the ufotable remake of Fate/stay night is basically identical to the Studio DEEN version (barring a few differences here and there).\\n\\n\r\nufotable's amazing production values can't mask the fact that Fate/stay night at large is mediocre and is still a lacklustre sequel to Fate/Zero (which I seriously need to get around to finishing). What's more is that the pacing across this season is absolutely appalling. Action-heavy episodes get followed up by mundane slice-of-life stuff, which never failed to kill my buzz as I was watching the show and what's more is that if you count the prologue (aka Episode 0), this show has TWO back-to-back episodes that are 45 minutes in length. I don't care what you have to say about this, it's NEVER a good idea to have two back-to-back episodes that are damn near an hour long. As someone who marathons the stuff he watches, this just made Fate/stay night much more tedious than it needed to be.\\n\\n\r\nI'm sure that fans of the Fate series are gonna get at my throat for saying that I'm an idiot for expecting Fate/stay night to be anything like Fate/Zero. Well guess what? Fate/Zero is the prequel to Fate/stay night, and logic dictates that the sequel should at least hold up to its predecessor. Fate/stay night as a sequel to Fate/Zero is incredibly disappointing. Why? Well guess what? Fate/Zero was actually entertaining! There were high stakes, likeable characters, enthralling battles, and all that shit. Any time Fate/stay night comes anywhere close to being as entertaining as Fate/Zero was, there just HAS to be some mundane slice-of-life stuff to follow up the intense action and that just pisses me off to no possible end. Speaking of stuff that pisses me off, let's talk about Shirou and Tohsaka because they're the ones that I take umbrage with the most.\\n\\n\r\nI understand that Shirou wants to be a hero and is on the idealistic side of the spectrum, but there's a way to do the whole \"idealistic hero\" concept properly WITHOUT turning your character into an insufferable idiot.  Seriously, I don't think ANYONE who had a problem with this in the first series should disagree with me on this one. He's still an idiot who hasn't learned thus far that his ideals are NOT pragmatic whatsoever. He STILL insists on fighting Heroic Spirits whilst completely mortal and vulnerable, still insists of saving the lives of the few rather than looking at the big picture, etc. Come on, Shirou! Don't disgrace Kiritsugu's memory by not listening to one of his teachings. I understand that Fate/stay night is about Shirou, but I CANNOT stand the fact that he's thrust into situations where he should've logically died but then gets saved by Sabre/Tohsaka/Archer ex Machina or the guy/girl they're fighting decides to spare him because fuck it, why the hell not? I don't always mind plot armour, but Shirou just takes that shit to a whole new level. Hey writers, if you're going to do that kind of shit, DON'T FUCKING PUT HIM INTO SITUATIONS THAT ARE ALL BUT IMPOSSIBLE TO ESCAPE FROM!!!!! My suspension of disbelief can't take much more of this...\\n\\n\r\nOn the subject of Tohsaka, let's talk about her for a little bit. She's a tsundere in all the worst possible ways. She tried to kill Shirou three times, and yet she still blushes around him and wants to eat lunch with him. That alone should be more than enough to explain WHY she's such an infuriating character. I'm not the biggest fan of tsundere characters, and Tohsaka embodies all of the WORST possible tsundere traits that I've come to viscerally despise. If Tohsaka was a real person, she'd be committed to a mental institution because she's completely incapable of suppressing her homicidal tendencies toward the person that she apparently has a crush on. Tohsaka worst girl, Sabre best girl. That's the best way I can put it anyway. Can ANYONE explain to me why they like Tohsaka in the first place? I mean, she's far more competent than Shirou is but that's not really saying much.\\n\\n\r\nI really wanted to like Fate/stay night, I really did. In fact, I started out really liking the show but as it kept going and the tedium just kept making itself more and more obvious, it just killed off any joy that I would've gotten from the show otherwise. Will I watch the second season? It's hard to say because on the one hand, the show could get better but on the other hand, it could just be more of the same, inconsistent bullshit. With that said, I don't hate Fate/stay night. There are plenty of other things out there that are worth my ire but Fate/stay night isn't one of them. I still do like the Fate series as a whole, and Fate/stay night is just fine as far as casual entertainment goes. However, the amount of praise this series gets never ceases to make me laugh raucously. Seriously, who the fuck in their right minds would think a porn game adaptation is a masterpiece? That's all for now, though. Feedback's always welcome and with that, I'm out. Peace :)",

            "content": "Why is the FSN remake the savior of anime? Gee whiz, I hope the fan base ready their magic circuits and frap on their doushjins!\r\nOver hyped as it pierced into the heavens, because Ufotable are going to re-animate so the action scenes look even more amazingly artificial and I thought it was just going to be cool action fiction thing with sprinkled anime archetypes but it ended up being stupid and pretentious. \r\nFirstly, nothing is deeply complex of this show, there is a lack in themes or anything to think about because the show uses common story telling techniques to explain the known adventure. Nothingseems \u201ctotal\u201d bullocks *cough* Zankyou no Terror *cough* with Shiro's obsession of kindness beyond natural human altruism was a bit odd but there was at least a decent explanation on why he became that way, though we found it a bit silly, it was way, way better than just either making it vague, or unreasonable.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, this in turn makes the drama undramatic because no one really seems to develop as if Thosaka's nature was the Tsundere clich\u00e9, it never helps that this wasn't meant to be a cool action show, but we need more emphasis on giving this show higher value like making annoying Drama! As if the countless moments of Shiro just trying to further nail the fact: that his insane altruism forces him to help too many people and the viewers are supposed to sob and fear about this thought provoking theme because they presented it in an intense manner! There were character interactions and their trauma and their development and writers were trying too hard to make us sob and where sobbing so uber much! Oh every moment was on par with the trauma drama of Clannad and I am crying in heavenly tears!\\n\\n\r\n Has anyone killed each other for the sake of progressing the plot? No not the making  random gore-fest moments that was redeemed laughable, but for the plot to move onwards, why the hell is no one trying to kill each other already?! Oh, Caster managed to lure our heroes to her trap and does she take this perfect chance to kill them? If Caster has uber hack powers from the gathering of so many corpses, wouldn\u2019t that mean she can negate the magic to any of the Grail War participants? Its not like there were any flaws in that power (like over I don't know - over draining her mana) which practically as she was the only standing servant with her master meant that she wins the holy grail war within one episode, and actually \u201cEnd!\u201d The series!\\n\\n\r\nTo be honest, Ufotable's signature animation does'nt really appeal to me. It felt like they were simply throwing money like garbage just to blend and put so much CGI on to the hand drawn sections, that it makes everything feel more man-made and that there is nothing natural about it. Too much lighting made the wood look like plastic, and the action scenes looked holy sick.\\n\\n\r\nDo you know what happens when you cross breed a maid and a knight and Shiro? You get Saber! Being the most overrated character in existence, her personality all comes down to being as loyal as a retard and respecting anyone. She is basically knight stereotype with boobs! Why are we still worshiping her?!\\n\\n\r\nSCORES:\\n\r\nCharacters: 3.5/10\\n\r\nStory: 3/10\\n\r\nMusic: 7/10\\n\r\nAnimation: 7.5/10\\n\\n\r\nFINALE: 3.5/10",

            "content": "I'm not a very good writer, sorry if I'm not able to properly articulate my exact feelings on the show.\r\nThe art/animation is outstanding. Nothing really to say here. The one failing moment was their attempt at CG water during some of the scenes with Caster.\r\nThe sound track was a near copy of Fate/Zero. It would have been more appropriate to invent new songs. Instead we see recycling of old ones. This isn't necessarily a bad thing, but it would have been nice to have something entirely new for a new show.\r\nThe characters are were this starts to fall apart. Excluding the fact that each conversationfeels like a quick-time event, the 2 main characters Rin & Emiya lack proper depth. And by \"proper\" I mean something that is believable. It's one thing for a character to have flaws, it's a whole other for them to do something entirely out of character. They also have a tendency to \"flicker\" characters. We see them once at some random point, then never again. Or maybe a quick cameo. What happened to lancer? Who cares! What's berserker up to? Lol, like that even matters. It's fine if you don't evenly distribute attention to each character, but that's not what's happening here. This is simply ignoring something potentially interesting so we can watch Emiya spout his hero of justice thing again. His inner conflict is largely uninteresting as it has no real moral conundrum to it. \\n\\n\r\nThere were around 10 battles/fights in this season. More then half of them end with a nonsensical retreat from the winning side. The first time this happens (with Rin) I disregard it. The second time, okay a little odd. But by the time we get near the end of the season and it's still happening I can't help but laugh at it's ludicrousness. There's such powerful plot armor around Emiya nothing feels even remotely threatening.\\n\\n\r\nThe story was what really kill this for me. I fear that if I were to properly explain it I'd get angry and it wouldn't be worth it. What pisses me off the most is the inconsistencies. Sure, if you're a 12 year old you won't notice them, but anyone who has experience with plot interpretation would be banging their head near the end of the season.\\n\\n\r\nObjectively this is probably a 6/10. It's an above amazing animation with below average characters and plot resulting in a slightly above average anime as a whole.\\n\\n\r\nIf you like super flashy fight scenes and awkward facial expressions this anime is for you. \\n\\n\r\nIf you're looking for complex character interactions and ideals that make you think you might want to skip this one.",

            "content": "\"I am the bone of my sword -- steel is my body and fire is my blood\"\r\nIf you have so much as set a single foot into the anime community since 2006, you have most likely heard of the Fate series by now. And even though its first anime adaptation (Modeled after the TypeMoon visual novel) propelled it down a critically ignored hill of decency, the series has come a very long way.\r\nFollowing the success of Fate/Zero, the prequel and first story in the Fate universe, studio ufotable announced that it was going to reinvent the original TV series. However, this time it would followthe route of Rin Tohsaka as opposed to the Saber version of the story. Needless to say, ufotable once again paints a beautiful image of exactly how the story of Fate should be depicted, while at the same time, adding new bits and pieces to renew the interest that readers of the visual novel once held in regards to the series.\\n\\n\r\nFate/Stay Night: Unlimited Blade Works follows both the aforementioned Rin Tohsaka (Smoking hot super-mage) as well as Shirou Emiya (Redheaded not-so-super mage guy). The two are tossed into a battle that occurs once every few centuries, in which seven mages each summon a \"Servant\" of a particular class in order to help them attain the legendary Holy Grail. However, the grail can not be obtained until only one mage is left alive.\\n\\n\r\nUnlimited Blade Works does an outstanding job blending action with the dark undertones of mortality, as well as friendship, betrayal, and the struggle of growing up and making the right decisions. Bloodshed paves the way to a new beginning (Or end) for each person fighting for the grail. Your attention will be fixed to the screen for literally every second of your time spent with this installment of Fate. Each episode's ending is overflowing with suspense, essentially beckoning you to spend more time with the show. In order to better describe what's in store for you, allow me to break this show up into a few key components.\\n\\n\r\nMusic: 10/10\\n\r\nAs always, ufotable brings you an onslaught of up and coming J-Pop/Rock artists, while bringing back the ones viewers loved from Fate/Zero (LiSA/Kalafina). And shall you make it to the final episode, a special surprise is in store for those who watched the first anime or played the VN. Never in my life have I had as many chills as I did hearing Disillusion come on as this first part of this story came to a close. It was like being hit by a literally tangible wave of nostalgia. And on top of the music, the original voice cast from the 2006 production returns once again. But this time, they are stronger and more emotional than ever. No complaints from me this time.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 10/10\\n\r\nI've always had a soft spot for the characters in the Fate universe. In fact, Rin is constantly fighting for the number one spot as my favorite character in all of anime every time she speaks. Each mage has a motive and ideals that keep them going as they put their life on the line for the entire duration of the show. Each servant is based on a historical icon (Fiction and non-fiction) that even history lovers would enjoy. They each bring to the table a so-called \"Noble Phantasm,\" accentuating a certain aspect of their past -- something that made them into icons. Even the characters you will wind up disliking are complex in their own ways. I'm going to go out on a limb here and say that the cast of the Fate series is the best cast in all of anime. And for that reason, they attain the highest possible score from me in this category.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 10/10\\n\r\nufotable is quickly becoming known for their beautiful artwork. People all over message-boards and forums in the anime community have even been talking and gossiping about their budgeting for a while now, considering they consistently deliver some of the best art to date. Fight scenes are easy to follow, but at the same time a spectacle composed of vivid color and speed rivaling that of a Boeing 747. Character design in spot-on and landscapes are a huge improvement from the prior production of Fate/Stay Night, as well as looking nearly identical to its prequel, Fate/Zero. Each image is not only captivating, but refreshing in knowing that there is a studio out there who is able to deliver beauty on such a consistent level. Once again, no complaints from me.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 10/10\\n\r\nTypeMoon has no qualms with telling dark stories. In fact, they love it. They build up each character almost perfectly and give them all their own time to stand in the spotlight. Character development is omnipresent and viewers go into each episode with open jaws and clenched fists, hoping their favorite master will come out on top. The Unlimited Blade Works route, which in my opinion is the weakest of the three different arcs, even comes out as mesmerizing. The story simply can't go wrong -- it just needed a studio who would be able to make everything else just as remarkable. It doesn't suffer from the same sporadic pacing issues that the 2006 Fate suffered from. ufotable picked a route and they stuck to it, adding many new flavors and new reasons to watch the series along the way.\\n\\n\r\nThere's always a shining star every anime season to emerge on top of its rivals. For Fall 2014, that show is Fate/Stay Night: Unlimited Blade Works. It closes the season with a bang and is already climbing the charts on various sites for \"Highest rated show\". It most likely won't wind up at the very top, but that doesn't take away from the fact that it was executed perfectly and deserves the score I am about to give it.\\n\\n\r\nUnlimited Blade Works picks back up for its second cours in April 2015. I'm looking forward to it more than you can imagine. You should be too.",

            "content": "Fate/stay night: Unlimited Blade Works (TV) is the most misleading anime since Higurashi no Naku Koro Ni, but instead of pretending to be a moe slice of life, it pretends to be a generic shounen. If you've only seen Fate/zero so far then you're most likely to be mislead and be disappointed, if you've read the visual novel then you're probably one of the many people who praise it like it's the second coming of Christ.\r\nCutting to the chase, this adaption of Fate/stay night is finally a faithful one, which is to 've expected from studio Ufotable. The dialogue has many hints about the protagonist'strue worldviews as well as other characters such as Archer. The story has a good pace that allows the viewer to question many things about, such as: why didn't Archer immediately attack Lancer when Rin was \"in danger\", how Archer know Saber from his past?, why does Saber not act as mature as she did in Fate/zero? why are there two of Rin's jewel that she used to save Shirou? why does Archer's ideals resemble those of Kiritsugu? why does Shirou blindly follow ideals that he might not believe in? what is the lesser grail and the greater grail? how exactly was Rider killed? how does Caster's master fight so well when he isn't a mage?\\n\r\nThe character development is mostly lacking, there are mainly subtle hints about certain characters and their true worldviews, but other than that, most of the development lies on the second half. Just like many people, I also hated Shirou at first, but by the end of Unlimited Blade Works he will be very tolerable and slightly likable, however, you must see the sequel Fate/stay night: Heaven's Feel in order to complete the story, discover the truth about Angra Mainyu, and even see Shirou become a mature and formidable badass.\\n\r\nThe art and sound is easily the best I've heard on any nime tv series, there's a good reason people call this show \"Unlimited Budget Works\", but even without the animation quality, this series is gold and should not be missed by those who want a deep and compelling story that requires major attention and a bit of thinking to truly enjoy.\\n",

The problem here is that the story is inconsistent in its pacing where 1 episode would be action packed and progressive and the next one would be boring talk about terms and history of thisanime's universe.\\n\\n\r\nArt-9\\n\r\nThis is where this anime really excells at. Art is simply amazing with every movement fluid and natural that it looks like you are watching an anime movie. My only complain is they use cgi models on some of the monsters summoned in fights which looks really weird and off for me.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter-5\\n\r\nPretty much a step down for me since I really don't find anyone interesting except for archer. The whole anime pretty much focuses on the development of Rin and Shirou and it almost completly forgets the other characters after introducing them in 1 episode. Nothing really bad about that except those two are fairly generic where one is a tsundere and the other the goody two shoes guy with naive morals and bad decision making.\\n\\n\r\nAnother thing that is  bad is the portrayal of saber. In Fate/Zero she was presented a tragic king with troubled morals/beliefs but in this anime she is nothing more than Shirou's bodyguard with a really shallow personality.\\n\\n\r\nSound-9\\n\r\nSound is great with everything in sync with the the movements/actions in the anime and it also has some catchy music.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment-7\\n\r\nThe anime is  slow and boring at times during its run because of the overly long talks which makes me question sometimes if I am watching shonen or slice of life, but it is really good when the plot finally progresses to the fight scenes\\n\\n\r\nOverall-7\\n\r\nAll in all this anime is still entertaining to watch if you are a fan of shonen anime.",

            "content": "**THIS REVIEW CONTAINS MINOR SPOILERS**\r\nThis is the most overrated anime I have ever seen. If one is expecting a grand follow-up to Fate Zero, one is gravely mistaken. You are about to say \u20188.43?\u2019, \u2018How can this be?\u2019, and \u2018This is scandalous.\u2019 (Jojo reference). Well move closer to the screen and let senpai explain.\r\nStory=3\r\nThe story consists of tossing a teenage boy into the Holy Grail war (an Armageddon between masters (contemporary individuals who supposedly command their respective servants) and servants (summoned titans) for the sake of obtaining the Holy Grail). This should be a gruesome event with fights to the death, BUT . . .\u2018Fuck that,\u2019 Shirou brazenly proclaims. \u2018I am going to lead my harem life and ignore every peril.\u2019 As one may have guessed, this anime isn\u2019t really about the war. It\u2019s about the harem Shirou obliviously leads. Most of the anime is focused on the relational struggles of the protagonist and some high school girl. For 8 episodes, we are forced to endure Shirou\u2019s petty conversations with Rin inside his home or at school. Not much is done to contribute to the Holy Grail War as apparently\u2014going on a date is more important. \\n\\n\r\nProgress in this anime is almost non-existent. The characters are non-progressive as they are constantly engaged in purposeless chatter and dawdling. The story is littered with pseudo-drama, pseudo-fights, and cliff hangers, which are sometimes intriguing, that evokes utter disappointment and results in pointlessness. The fights are just random clashes with no deciding outcomes and little build-up. Oh, a few episodes later a servant dies. Due to the complete absence of characterisation, no one cared. \\n\\n\r\nThere are multiple flaws in the anime. One being Saber commenting on Berserker\u2019s ability to simultaneously solo all the servants. She then proceeds to 1v1 him as though they are of equal calibre. Then she moves to \u2019cover\u2019 (behind a little gravestone) and wrecks berserker. The most flagrant one is Shirou's plot armour that countlessly saves him.\\n\\n\r\nTrivium; for some reason, this anime was revered as a slice of life when it was airing. Upon inspection, these \u2019slice of life\u2019 moments were just fan service. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter=3\\n\r\nMost of the characters were scarcely developed and characterised. Literally nothing is known about them asides from their superficial identities. The characters that received most of it were abjectly cliche and mundane. \\n\\n\r\nShirou=1\\n\r\nShirou is the naivest and most idealistic cherry boy I have ever seen. His special ability is being impervious to anything macabre.\\n\\n\r\nShirou logic: I have almost been killed multiple times . . . Oh well, they must have their reasons. I forgive them.\\n\\n\r\nThese types of characters, the type that starts off naive and idealistic generally mature or at least develop but not Shirou. Despite all his near-death situations, he remains ignorant. What\u2019s annoying is Shirou\u2019s lack of concern for the war throughout the show as he seems to be preoccupied with maintaining his high school life. I just can\u2019t help but mirror his disinterest, while viewing this show. \\n\\n\r\nShirou can be described in three words, \u2018asinine and mundane\u2019. He is so often brushed by the verge of death but lives or is kept alive because he is \u2019interesting\u2019; however, that\u2019s just his naivety and incredible plot armour rather than anything interesting. He is also indecisive and mostly follows the instructions of others. Whenever he decides for himself, the outcome is boring, being completely predictable, and/or completely irrational. Their current route with Shirou seems to be:\\n\\n\r\n1. Protagonist has no experience and is completely rash.\\n\r\n2. Magically becomes shrewd and can pull off incredible moves in the most critical of situations. \\n\r\n3. Will soon surpass Rin despite being completely incompetent and useless.\\n\\n\r\nRin=2\\n\r\nRin is one capricious vixen. Her daily routine involves whining to and about Shirou and then having the biggest mood swings. \\n\\n\r\nRin: I am going to kill Shirou; Wait, time to team up again.\\n\\n\r\nRepeat this throughout the show, and it becomes annoying.\\n\\n\r\nHer character clashes with her backstory and motives. Her childhood was riddled with traumatic events, such as her parent\u2019s premature deaths and the early separation from her dear sister. She\u2019s also lived independently for most her life endeavouring to further herself as a mage. She explains an inherent character of a mage is being able to further one\u2019s goals despite the means. One would expect a more mature, traumatised, or troubled character, right? No, she\u2019s infantile, simple, and sometimes unduly cordial. Putting it in anime terms, \u2018I AM TSUNDERE INCARNATE!\u2019\\n\\n\r\nArcher=7\\n\r\nHe is one of the better character in the show but he lacks sufficient characterisation, development, and screen-time. He also seems to be the only one taking the war seriously on team Shirou.\\n\\n\r\nFor anyone who has seen Fate Zero, RIP Saber\u2019s character. There is almost a complete loss of her original character.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment=3\\n\r\nThe anime was initially somewhat enjoyable (6/10), but it just frivolously dragged on. As mentioned above, the fights were and the plot was largely meaningless. The anime fails to build the necessary tension and suspense to lead an engaging plot. The outcomes were predictable or completely irrational, and the story was somehow unreasonably slow paced. \\n\\n\r\nOverall=3\\n\r\nUnless one fanatically love shounens, avoid this show at all cost. It is a blender of cliches.",

            "content": "If there\u2019s one word that any anime fan can be familiar with, it may be \u2018Fate\u2019. The franchise adapted from the highly popular Type-Moon visual novel has been around for a decade. In 2006, an anime adaptation by studio DEEN was released in an attempt to adapt the visual novel. And while it included the characters from the series, there were controversy regarding the actual adaptation. Then, there was the movie titled \u2018Fate Stay Night: Unlimited Blade Works\u2019 movie that was released four years later. But even so, that only ran less than two full hours in a futile attempt to adapt the Unlimited BladeWorks route. To say the least, it\u2019s inefficient when attempting to craft a story in such a short time frame. Luckily, Ufotable decided to step up to the plate deliver what fans want \u2013 a faithful adaptation of the route in TV series medium.\\n\\n\r\nMake no mistake. This series runs a lot longer than 2 hours with the finale extended to fit the double the time of a single episode. So in a way, this series can be viewed indirectly as having more than 12 episodes in total time length. (total of 16 episodes actually if including episode 0) What\u2019s more though is how the series is set up. Because of the nature of MAL\u2019s database, this review will not cover the episode 0 that introduces the story from Rin\u2019s point of view. Rather, we are introduced to the young man known as Shirou Emiya. For people wondering about the series, it is not essential at all to watch Fate/Zero or the F/SN: Unlimited Blade Works movie. In fact, I would highly recommend skipping the latter and focus on this adaptation as that\u2019s more of a promotional product. This TV series adapts the route known as \u2018Unlimited Blade Works\u2019 with high level of anticipation.\\n\\n\r\nThere\u2019s little doubt the show has a variety of ideas whether it\u2019d be related to magecraft, the Holy Grail, or the mechanics of the Holy Grail War. Taking these ideas and presenting them can be quite a challenge but I do have confidence to say that this adaption did justice. The first episode introduces Shirou Emiya who we see a normal teenager attending high school with his friends. There\u2019s foreshadowing and hints thrown in the backgrounds already to show that not all is going normal around Shirou\u2019s neighborhood. It doesn\u2019t take long for the show to hit the supernatural realm when we see magic and otherworldly powers in Fate style. Shirou becomes the Master of a powerful Servant known as \u2018Saber\u2019 in a dangerous tournament (Holy Grails War) after nearly getting himself killed by another servant. Battle ensures and the series manages to craft a setup that will unanimously create more anticipation. The way the first few episodes are set up doesn\u2019t just create a thrilling mood but also spawn questions especially for new viewers. This is where the show shines as the adaption adequately explains the mechanics. Although some bits can feel like typical info dumping, there are comedic points thrown in to ease the bits of unsettling boredom. But do note that it\u2019s fairly important to listen to the explanations because it all connects to the characters and story.\\n\\n\r\nThe way the story is crafted involves the main cast, or specifically the Masters and the Servants. We already know who Shirou is but there\u2019s also another prominent Master that is introduced from episode 0. Her name is Rin Tosaka, the master of Archer. For those who have seen episode 0, it\u2019s likely that you\u2019ve got to know her a lot more than the previous Fate franchise. Nonetheless, she comes into conflict with Shirou and the other Masters in the Holy War. The servants play prominent roles as well especially involving the infamous Saber. She is more of the poster girl as well as the warrior who wishes to win the Grail War. On the other hand, Shirou represents the most human character in the series. Honest, loyal, and courageous are a few words to describe him. And although he may seem like a generic character, there\u2019s no doubt that he can influence others. What this first half of the series does is introduce the main players that the VN fans will be familiar with. For new fans of the series, they will be delighted to find out just how much the adaptation extends beyond the movie.  Characters such as Illya, Kirie, Shinji, Issei, Taiga, and Sakura are all introduced in clever ways. Even more so, we have the servants who make their debuts as well. Lancer for one makes quite an entrance to create the intensity of the war. What we also have are also other servants that contrasts with each other in terms of their personalities. Whether it\u2019d be Archer\u2019s ideals, Saber\u2019s chivalry, or Rider\u2019s cunning nature, every servant offers something new to the table. Or sometimes, you may just have a big grunt like Berserker who wants to rip everything to pieces.\\n\\n\r\nLike I mentioned before, the series offers variety. What that means is a balance of mood and pacing for the series to work. Yes, there\u2019s mystery going on in the background with the events of the show. Yes, there is also action to keep up the momentum. Then, there\u2019s also the slice of life-like atmosphere. Taking place in a high school setting, the series also finds time to lend comedy and even realism to what could have been an all-around action flick. While this may come as a mixed bag, the series does it cleverly to build narrative with the characters. Rather than just talking, they show what the main characters\u2019 lives are like with others. Even more so, this series makes it quite interesting considering that Servants and Masters aren\u2019t exactly similar with ideologies. Shirou is a prominent example unlike some others who wishes to win the Holy Grail war with their personal dark desires. What goes around comes around and this show proves a point when it crafts its story\u2019s relationships between characters. There\u2019s chemistry between certain characters that can easily been such as with Shirou and Saber or him and Rin. Unfortunately, not all of them get their spotlight and some are still shrouded in mystery (example: the mysterious blonde young man shown several times in the series). And mystery, that may be an overused word by some point. We don\u2019t find out too much about some characters\u2019 intentions such as priest Kirie Kotomine. But do we want to? For some, that\u2019s a certainly and is why the show will keep the audience at their feet. It makes the audience want to figure out the puzzle with the pieces. The dialogues are cryptic but provides hints while dreams (such as Rin\u2019s) create suspense. Then, there\u2019s also the more charming moments as some tense scenarios focuses on Shirou\u2019s own personal perspective. There\u2019s no doubt that he is becoming closer to Saber and the show portrays this with tiny packages of hints rather than explicit fatal attraction. Still, don\u2019t expect much romance for the first cour of this show. Treat it more as a setup with all the key characters bought into the series like players to a game. Because honestly, this Holy War is where winner takes all.\\n\\n\r\nThank you Ufotable. I\u2019ll say this twice because the studio really deserved the gratitude for their superior effort in adapting the animation quality of this series. The animation style of this series looks lavishly done whether it\u2019s the backgrounds, character designs, or the jaw-breaking action scenes. There is a good amount of action focused on all the fights that gives both the servant and their master a chance for spotlight. The action itself is well coordinated with rapid movement and clever camera angles. In short, Ufotable outdone themselves with the budget they have. And to be honest, there\u2019s little criticism to say when it comes to the artistic frontier of this adaptation. Mage spells are also cleverly demonstrated while violence create the brutal reality of the Grail War. There\u2019s minimal fan service except some suggestive camera angles. But judging exclusively, this series is almost flawless on the artwork.\\n\\n\r\nSoundtrack also plays a pivotal role although not as strong as the artwork department. The two most prominent aspects are the OST during the fight scenes and the character voice mannerisms. I give praise to Kirie Kotomine, Rin, and Caster for their character portrayals. It is very real to their personalities and to the point. Shirou even gets some praise at times when he makes his effort to what he has to say. Unfortunately, there\u2019s also some bits that can be irritating at times; namely Sakura and her repetitive dialogues or Shinji\u2019s narcissism. The OST is also a great comeback and treat for fans who are in favor of action. Every action sells with even tiny details being incorporated with the battles. This can be easily seen such as Saber being tossed into objects, Shirou being tortured by Rider, or Rin jumping several stories to avoid Lancer\u2019s blows. While not as fantastic as the visual realm, soundtrack is by no means a pushover.\\n\\n\r\nTrue to its hype, Fate Stay Night: Unlimited Blade Works is a must-see of the year whether you\u2019re a fan of the visual novel or coming into series as a newbie. There\u2019s much to adapt but the first half captures that very well with the setup. To say the least, this show has that sort of momentum every episode. It is set up and then delivery with the series capitalizing on every opportunity. Along the way, we also get breaks with useful info dumps, humorous gags, and relationship building. The action will no doubt leave you in awe thanks to Ufotable\u2019s technical qualities. Still, there are some characters you may like and some you\u2019ll despise; more people will probably have that decision by the second cour of the show. Characterization is not a masterpiece though and neither does the story offer perfection. There are parts in this series that sometimes will waver off with its mood and peculiar balance. Still, there\u2019s a saying that third time\u2019s a charm and Ufotable hit the bull\u2019s eye on this show. Now, the second half of the series awaits\u2026.\\n",

            "content": "Okay, So before I review the 1st half of this season,\r\nI like to state that I'm not really familiar about this franchise that much to my knowledge, so this is literally my first time watching this series from this point on along with episode 0 so keep that in mind. \r\nI've heard most people talk about this show during its airing so I decided to give it a shot.\r\nThe show starts off well enough given us introduction to the main characters including the plot about the holy grail having the power to grant any 1 wish to the master along with their servant in defeatingthe other 7 masters and their own servant. \\n\\n\r\nIn this 1st half of the show we follow our 4 main characters Rin, Archer, Shirou and Saber. \\n\r\nHowever I found this to be a problem, The main 4 characters \\n\r\n(well Mainly Rin and Shirou) I not saying these 2 characters are bad but their own depiction of their own personality were kinda boring and very tedious for the most part. \\n\\n\r\nThey pretty much have this generic chemistry between them that seems just like any other ordinary teenage couple set up like in any other anime show along the lines of a typical teen romance that has been done SO many times! which leaves me for the most part disinterested with their progression unfortunately, \\n\\n\r\nEspecially Shirou who seems to be quite a decent person at heart, willing to learn about magic involved in this series known as mana which is something a master must use in order to control and support their fellow servant in order to win the battle or survive. With Shirou that is just it, there is NO real unique trait upon viewing his character with this (''I'm a good guy'', I'm a hero nonsense) To me it just came off as being uninteresting and 1 dimensional for the rest of the time I was watching him on screen along with Rin also, since they both seem damaged from what happened in their past or something oh buuhoo. The process to this just seems too familiar.\\n\\n\r\nThe supporting cast as much as I like their character designs, they also don't really get thoroughly flushed out either which for me is a downer and its by far the weakest aspect of the 1st season I believe so far, It could of shown some knowledge and background about them rather than just\\n\r\nleaning towards Rin X Shirou. \\n\\n\r\nBut then you have both the other 2 main characters Archer and Saber that seem to hold a more depth to them and unlike the other 2, they at least show SOME interest to their personality and their character. but the sad thing is, it kinda feels overshadowed by Rin and Shirou at this point of the series which honestly didn't leave me with a good impression on the characters as a whole.\\n\\n\r\nI commend the anime for having a fantastic high budget animation with great fight scenes that were pulled off amazingly in this And I tell you It looks stunning!!. The fights with the master and servants in this are just jaw-dropping and very detailed.\\n\\n\r\nThe music is pretty decent also for the most part, but can be quite forgettable to me at times. I also enjoyed the scenery a lot in this show displaying different locations that looked really beautiful from up close and far away. \\n\\n\r\nBut as much as I love the story, plot, animation and some of its soundtracks I found few of the main leads Rin and Shirou to be just tedious despite what was going on in the episodes I was watching even if there were signs of possible foreshadowing to the 2nd half of this anime it still could of used better characterisation.\\n\\n\r\nThe ending cliffhanger to the second half looks interesting, almost like the series will get a lot better since it generally feels like a set up  and I cannot wait so hopefully it will give me some better enjoyment with the cast all round.\\n\\n\r\nOverall The 1st half of this will be is a well deserve 7 out of 10",

            "content": "(This has been adapted from my reddit thread)\r\nIn life, one thing is true for everyone: we all have desires. Wanting to be wealthy beyond imagining, finding the love of one's life, obtaining that dream job; there is always a goal, a wish that seems impossible to reach no matter how hard one tries. Aspirations bring about both the best and the worst in people, due to the very nature of what they bring. And if these wishes do happen to come to fruition, they affect not just the winner, but those closest, too. Fate/Stay Night: Unlimited Blade Works Season One is the beginning of sucha literal wish-fulfillment journey.\\n\\n\r\nSTORY\\n\\n\r\nThe story begins with Emiya, a high school boy who witnesses a strange fight in a nearby courtyard. After being cornered, he somehow summons Saber, a noble woman who calls him Master. Knowingly or not, Emiya officially joins the Holy Grail War.\\n\\n\r\nUBW (the acronym of choice from here on out) sits in a precarious position. It's not technically a sequel and, simultaneously, it is the first half of a two part adventure. As such, it takes the burden of introducing the characters and spearheading the world-building for what is to come. On this end, the anime holds its own. In order for the audience to completely understand what is really going on, it intersperses the battles it is known for with heavy dialogue and exposition. These moments craft the rules involved, the players of the game, the limitations, the terminology, the magic system, etc. A lot of it is mostly shoved towards the viewers because there isn't much time and the anime wants to focus on other aspects (i.e. the fighting).\\n\\n\r\nThe anime has a strange habit of allowing many of its characters to live through seemingly impossible situations. This type of behavior is fine if it's done within reason (no huge deus ex machina or logical reasoning exists). However, on numerous occasions, many cast members, and more specifically Shirou, are permitted to fight another day. Often times, the answer is frivolous: \"this was fun, let's do it again,\" \"you were entertaining, so leave,\" \"I can't kill on merit, so walk.\" The idea is obviously not to eliminate the characters so early, since they play roles later on down the line. But without proper explanations backing their escape, the effect is lost, and it becomes an eye-roll as time and again the battles involved amount to nothing more than pomp and flash.\\n\\n\r\nBeyond the world-building, past the fighting, UBW's core ideals are, in a phrase, less than ideal. Again, it's difficult: the anime is juggling multiple different facets at once, all within what is the first half. Essentially, the show looks at the idea of whether it is possible to fight for pure justice, and what that ultimately entails. What is justice to one person may be defined separately by another. How much of it is considered enough in a given situation? Who delivers the final judgement? These kinds of questions are, sadly, not looked at in-depth within UBW. It begins to present the idea, having two upholders of such morals against one another, but isn't explored enough to warrant it a conversational topic. Because, per usual, the fighting takes the spotlight, preventing any form of thematic merit.\\n\\n\r\nANIMATION\\n\\n\r\nThe art and animation within UBW is some of the best in the business.\\n\\n\r\nStarting with the art, the scenic backdrops and amount of detail found within them are usually breathtaking. Bustling cities, panoramic bridge shots, populated parks, and eerie cemeteries are just a sampling of the beautiful art pieces that the anime dishes out.\\n\\n\r\nThe character designs are distinct in their lack of facial detail. This seems strange, considering what the art itself has to offer. But this is done for a reason; it provides an accentuating difference between the characters' faces and the outfits they wear. Saber's blue regalia, Rin's red and black mage attire, Archer's trench coat, Emiya's scarf, and Illya's purple winter clothes appear simple in nature, but provide each character with an iconic look that makes them memorable outside of the show.\\n\\n\r\nThe actual animation does not falter. UBW contains, without a doubt, some of the best, most well-choreographed fight scenes in all of anime. And it should, considering how much attention it is given. The battles are incredibly detailed, with flying swords, dazzling effects, and a superb amount of variation between the duels. One can feel the immense power that the Servants have, and it is always a spectacle to watch on-screen. Outside of the battles, the show maintains an above average amount of quality. Characters move naturally and small details like the reflection of water, nuanced hair movements, and the 3D enemies bring about more of the animation that has made ufotable famous.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS\\n\\n\r\nAs a shounen and \"battle royale,\" the cast involved is large, with the more important among them garnering the most screen time. Reiterating myself, it is important to remember that this just the beginning of what UBW supposedly has to offer.\\n\\n\r\nThe most famous of Servants, Saber is a regal woman of nobility and honor. Fair in beauty, strong of will, and unrivaled in combat, she is considered by many to be the best subordinate any Master could hold. Like the other Servants, her past and namesake are shrouded in mystery, but it's unquestionable that her convictions take the form of exacting justice on the evil and bringing hope to the weak. Emiya is her Master, and their personalities fall in line hand-in-hand. She trusts him and he trusts her, bringing about a duo that, no matter the circumstances, have a bond that cannot be severed.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of Emiya, he is a high school teenager who was saved by a man named Kiritsugu ten years prior to the events. Level-headed and kind, he seemingly cannot deny helping those in need, regardless of their moral status. His status as Master is considered odd. Having only the ability to strengthen objects, one of the lowest forms of magic, he can do little besides lean on Saber and her insane abilities. It's an interesting dynamic, because the one who wants to be the savior, the justice bringer, must first be helped and supported himself. And not just by Saber, too. No, a lot of aid is provided to him by a certain \"tsundere.\"\\n\\n\r\nArguably the fan favorite of UBW, Rin is a high school girl who descends from a family of magic wielders. Having lost her father and mother, she has trained rigorously for the day the Holy Grail War would come about once more. Extremely playful yet easily embarrassed, she takes pride in not only her magic but also in her ability to manipulate Emiya so easily. Where Emiya wants nothing to do with the War but save others from it, Rin's reasons are more apt: she's in it to win it. She may put up a front, but it's only because she can't bear to lose anything precious to her any longer.\\n\\n\r\nArcher is Rin's Servant. Among the whole cast, he is the most interesting of them all. Seemingly devoid of emotion, he utilizes swords instead of arrows to inflict damage to his foes. His personality is mirrored with Rin's: calm, unapproachable, and chiding. While he follows his Master's orders, he freely speaks his mind. More often than not, he clashes with Emiya, who holds contrasting beliefs. Like a typical bowman, he usually sits on the sidelines, always watching and listening, until he is ready to \"fire.\"\\n\\n\r\nThese characterizations have somewhat shown a small connection: the Master's involved summon their initial Servant that best pertains to who they are as a person. Emiya has the kind and determined Saber, whereas Rin has the standoffish and direct Archer. But what of the others? Berserker's Master is menacing and cruel, Caster's goes about its business as she does, and Rider's is every bit as deranged as she is. It's as if each person's characteristics have manifested themselves in spirit form, with the ultimate victor proving just what type of human is deserving to win it all.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND\\n\\n\r\nThe OP is good. It contains a good mix of guitar and violin, with a nice set of vocals. The falling piano playing, catchy beat, and lyrics make it great to listen to both in and out of the anime.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the ED, it starts off with an eerie vocal piece. What follows is very float-y instrument playing and singing that seems to invoke hope within the listener. After the halfway mark, the drums and beat do the singer little justice.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is a mixed bag. It is filled with mysterious arrangements for the more \"hidden\" scenes and acoustic guitar playing for the more relaxed ones. Guitar pieces fill the more \"cool\" moments, with the battles containing intense choir-like singing. As a final note, the sound effects provided are unique and add further to the overall experience.\\n\\n\r\nVoice-acting wise, everyone involved gave average to above average performances. A special shout-out to Saber, voiced by Ayako Kawasumi, who continues to reprise her role as the top Servant, with the gracefulness and emotion needed during all the right moments.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT\\n\\n\r\nThe reason you, I, or anyone else watches this anime is for the battles. The awesome, killer, amazingly detailed fights that exist at a regular interval from start to finish. I wanted there to be that next fight when the characters were sitting around talking. I wanted to see Saber's Noble Phantasm, watch Berserker crush all matter before him, and view Caster's incredible witchcraft. The fights are the highlight, and they were delivered tenfold.\\n\\n\r\nDuring the downtime, the skirmishes gave way to talking and world-building. While it was fun to see Rin and Emiya converse, or see Saber acting as her refined yet curious self, my inner conscious was saying, \"Let's get back to those fights, now shall we?\" Both aspects are done well on their own, but when you are comparing the two within their own show, you really want them to ignore everything else, even if it is technically important.\\n\\n\r\nFor now, Fate/Stay Night: Unlimited Blade Works Season One contains an okay story, a starting set of characters, and insanely high production value. It's actually very reminiscent of Fate/Zero's first half. The popularity of the anime and the universe it depicts is immense, but this one is still far from a masterpiece. Hopefully the second half, like the prequel before it, can pick up the remaining pieces.\\n\\n\r\nSUMMARY\\n\\n\r\nStory: Fine, nice world-building, too many conveniences, unrefined ideals\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: Great, stellar across the board\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Good, Emiya and Rin begin their journey, with the Servants being more than just spirits\\n\\n\r\nSound: Good, good OP, okay ED, okay soundtrack, good VA work\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Good, all about the battles\\n\\n\r\nFinal Score: 7/10",

            "content": "As a note, I have not read/played any of the Type Moon visual novels from which this anime is based.  I did however find Fate/Zero to be excellent.  Coming off of Fate/Zero I was completely pumped to jump right back into the world in Fate/Stay Night.  After watching the entire first season I have to say that I'm slightly disappointed.\r\nStory: 6\r\nThe story itself is relatively generic as a battle-royale for the holy grail, but is made more complex by the interesting heroes that are summoned to fight and their interactions with their masters.  This season however was quite boring.  Therewere not nearly enough fights or interesting story elements to justify the amount of downright dull scenes of Shirou at school or at home.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9\\n\r\nUfotable sure didn't skimp out on the animation for this show.  Backgrounds are beautiful and character animations are solid.  Fight scenes are magnificent, but too few and far between to completely showcase the animation at its finest.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8\\n\r\nSound effects are great and the Japanese voice-over is well done.  Hideyuki Fukasawa's soundtrack is a bit lackluster in my opinion and lacks some of the impact that Yuki Kajiura's Fate/Zero soundtrack had, and while it certainly never detracts form the show, it isn't anything special.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 4\\n\r\nThis is where I was truly disappointed.  Shirou is one of the least interesting main characters that I've seen in an anime.  While his back-story is interesting enough to make you slightly sympathetic, his idiotic ideals and brash ignorance make him incredibly boring.  Equally disappointing is Saber's portrayal.  While she was characterized as a complex and tragic king striving to attain the grail in F/Z, In F/SN she is now a straight-up robot with hardly any personality.  Archer and Rin can be fun to watch in comparison, but neither accomplish anything in this season.  The show really wants you to care about Rin and Shirou's alliance so it hardly focuses on anything else happening with the other servants.  I understand that development of the other servants/masters will come with the 2nd season, but that doesn't excuse the fact that they were nearly non-existent this season.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 7\\n\r\nMy enjoyment of this show mostly came with it being a sequel to Fate/Zero and getting to see what happens after the events of F/Z.  Though the characters are boring thus far, I do have hope that they will develop more throughout the 2nd season which I am greatly looking forward to.  I just wasn't as attached to the show by the end of this season as I was at this point in F/Z.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7\\n\r\nIt's fine, but not spectacular.  Can't wait for things to pick up in season 2.",

            "content": "This review is coming someone who only has watched Fate/Zero. I've seen a tad of the 2006 version of Fate/Stay Night as well. \r\nNow I understand that fans of the visual novel must be thrilled. I've been told this adaptation has been completely faithful. Which is what I was afraid of.\r\nBy being faithful to the Fate/Stay Night canon are completely undoing everything the Zero canon set the table with. Now please grant me the time to explain why that is.\r\n;Story~!\r\nI've said it before I'll say it again. The Fate concept is one of the greatest I've seen. Previous to this series I thought it wasimpossible to mess up. That was before I knew how much typical shounen tropes and weird harems could wound such an amazing idea. \\n\\n\r\nThe idea itself isn't bad here. It is the execution, the way this all was handled left me scratching my head. Now I know that FSN came first but I was hoping this series would go a different route. I sincerely thought they'd do something fresh to accommodate the Zero canon. \\n\\n\r\nI was wrong.\\n\\n\r\nYou see instead of the groundbreaking storytelling that helped this genre immensely we got with Zero this time... Well. We got a slice of life show with some flashy fight scenes every episode or so. \\n\\n\r\nEven with that said I can admit there was some amazing dialogue, few and far between as it was it was there. Mostly from Archer.\\n\\n\r\nSurprisingly nothing memorable from Saber.... Oh we will get to that.\\n\\n\r\nI generously give this story a total rating of!\\n\\n\r\nRating: 4\\n\\n\r\n____\\n\\n\r\n;Art/Animation~!\\n\\n\r\nI don't really need to go in-depth here. Completely amazing stuff, breathtaking visuals, fantastic animation. \\n\\n\r\nWhen Illyasviel did the little sway as she said, \"Ba-Ser-Ka~!\" I died a little inside it was so good. \\n\\n\r\nThere was animation put to Rin Tohsaka fanservice as well which I hated. This series doesn't need it, but animation is animation and it looked pretty. \\n\\n\r\nAs always ufotable is top of the line.\\n\\n\r\nRating: 9\\n\r\n____\\n\\n\r\n;Soundtrack~!\\n\\n\r\nPretty average here, nothing really stands out. This isn't just be being negative, I would say the same thing about Zero. Average doesn't mean bad I just wasn't blown away.\\n\\n\r\nFor what it was it was good. The music tracks were placed at the correct times. It enjoyed it for what it was.\\n\\n\r\nRating: 6\\n\r\n____\\n\\n\r\n;Characters~!\\n\\n\r\nThis where we have out biggest problem ladies and gentlemen.\\n\\n\r\nI didn't hate all these characters, in fact I love some of them. The problem is the characters I enjoy the most don't get a lot of screen time. I suppose I should start with our protagonist and heroine.\\n\\n\r\nComing into this series I was most excited to see how Rin Tohsoka turned out.  I mean after all that has happened to her there has to be some lingering affects. At the very least inner conflict!\\n\\n\r\nAs of the first season there is none of that, not even one mention that I recall. Instead of the brave, headstrong young mage I remember from Fate/Zero this Rin is completely different. Annoying and clueless, also part of a ridiculous harem.\\n\\n\r\nLet's turn to her partner in crime Shirou Emiya! I wasn't as excited for him but carrying around the name Emiya I had hopes. All of those hopes were thoroughly crushed.\\n\\n\r\nShirou is what I would call the typical gary-sue targeted to young teenage boys who have powertrip fantasies. Flocked to by all the girls around him, overpowered to the point he can take on a servant. \\n\\n\r\nI don't care about the twist either, that is also stupid. It just strengthens my believe that Shirou is an overpowered gary-sue.\\n\\n\r\nSakura Matou showing no ill effects to the torture she was put through was completely ridiculous. Cooking for Shirou was far more important for her character than any actual development.\\n\\n\r\nLet us all turn to the most crushing blow of all, Saber. Fate/Zero was not only groundbreaking for the genre but also for women in anime and manga. Unfortunately this sequel has completely taken five steps back in that regard. Because you know women have to do dishes and make Shirou sandwiches.\\n\\n\r\n Saber was strong with internal battles and demons. Her dialogues were thought provoking on so many different levels with so many underlining themes. Saber was the figurehead of the Fate series. Every time someone thinks of Fate it is very likely Saber is the first thing that pops into their mind.\\n\\n\r\nThis series completely undoes all of that amazing dialogue in Zero. Saber the regal king is just another piece in Shirou's harem box. I was shocked when she could pass for a highschool student, I was always under the impression she was a lot older. \\n\\n\r\nIn those amazing conversations with Gilgamesh and Rider, Saber was completely unmoved. Apparently it takes the idealistic talk of a Japanese student to sway Saber. \\n\\n\r\nSaber goes on dates and even has fanservice throughout. Whether it be that a king forgot her manners and can't eat with getting stuff on her cheeks. There was even a fanservice scene involving glasses.\\n\\n\r\nThroughout all these shenanigans Saber feels a lot less special. Every time she spoke in the previous series it meant something, here it just feels like wasted breath. \\n\\n\r\nOne of my favorite characters was completely butchered. \\n\\n\r\nThere were rays of light throughout. Like Illyasviel and Archer, there were others not even worth mentioning since they had even less screen time. The bad greatly outweighs the good here.\\n\\n\r\nRating: 3\\n\\n\r\n____\\n\\n\r\n;Overall~!\\n\\n\r\nIf you are one of the people overjoyed with this series well... I'm so happy you were able to find enjoyment where I couldn't.\\n\\n\r\nI was so ridiculously excited for this series and so thoroughly let down it hurts. \\n\\n\r\nFate/Zero is one of my favorite animes of all time. The Zero canon while it is fantasy was grounded in a dark reality. FSN is just campy and completely ignorant. This sequel targets a completely different audience and it hurts itself for that.\\n\\n\r\nIn the end the Holy Grail War felt like a game for these kids. Hell, they were even comfortable enough to keep going to school. Even after finding out that someone was trying to put up barriers around it.\\n\\n\r\nFor some reason these two masters walk around like two kid detectives in a gag manga. Then when something actually escalates into a dangerous situation they are both shocked.\\n\\n\r\nThere were some amazing fight scenes in between all the silliest but that doesn't change anything for me. Flashy scenes without substance are nothing that special. Imagine that groundbreaking animation in Cowboy Bebop only with terrible dialogue and story in between, I don't think we'd be talking as fondly about it today.\\n\\n\r\nI expect the second season will step it up at least a little. I hope it fares better than this outing.\\n\\n\r\nThis one has been the biggest disappointment of 2014 for me. \\n\\n\r\nFinal Verdict: 3/10~!",

            "content": "The Fate franchise is among the most recognizable and highly lauded titles in the anime community. It should go without saying that this lofty praise is largely due to Ufotable's impeccable presentation and production values. When it comes to the Fate franchise and other Type-Moon adaptations, the studio pull out all the stops as evident with Kara no Kyoukai and the critically acclaimed Fate/Zero. \r\nIf there was ever a black sheep attached to the Fate franchise's name, many will without a doubt point to the 2006 lackluster adaptation of Fate/Stay Night and the 2010 Fate/stay night: Unlimited Blade Works movie by Studio DEEN. The Fatefranchise isn't new to multiple studio collaborations as Silver Link have already taken on the role of adapting Fate/kaleid liner Prisma\u2606Illya and has manage to keep a consistent presentation. But that still left Stay Night up in the air until now, as Ufotable tackles the adaption of the Unlimited Blade Works route, attempting to shine new light where DEEN have dragged it through the mud. \\n\r\nNow with all that said you may be wondering why the score is so low, did something go wrong? Well no not really, as far as production goes Ufotable's track record with Fate is still spotless but that doesn't mean what they adapt was. You see the Fate franchise always boast a \"battle royal\" and the closet thing we got to that came with Fate/Zero but it seems like no matter how you dress it, Stay Night when it all boils down to the inescapable facts, is simply another \"run of the mill\" story of empowered bishounen teens and silly cock fights that leads nowhere.  Today we'll break down the overlooked truths of this anime, a show with high production value but a subpar script. \\n\\n\r\n1st we'll get the positive aspects out of the way: Art/Animation: 9.5/10, Sound 8/10\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt/Animation: 9.5/10\\n\\n\r\nThere's good animation and then there's Ufotable animation. For many anime fans already familiar with the studio's work it should go without saying that it is absolutely gorgeous. The amount of heart and effort presented in every frame is clearly evident with richly saturated color palettes and smooth textured backgrounds. The attention to detail is worthy of immense praise, as it doesn't take long to be immersed into the show's setting. Every movement from our characters show consistent fluidity and just the little things like their hair moving as they walk or the ruffling of someone putting on a jacket brings a sense of realism. \\n\r\nThey also excel in cinematography showing unique camera angles and well crafted camera panning shots. It feels like you're watching a Shinkai film at times and that kind of consistent quality from a series is almost unheard of. But for most of us the greatest enjoyment comes from the solid fight choreography. This is where the studio really shows their stuff as they brilliantly use all the tricks they have up their sleeves, from contrasting color pallets to cinematic compositions making every action carry a sense of weigh behind it. You can feel every blow and strike from the characters, this is an eyegasm worthy of multiple rewatches. Although it isn't all perfect as little nitpicks like the CGI cars still feel out of place from the immense detail surrounding it but it certainly isn't a huge issue when compared to everything else it had going for it.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nto accompany the strong animation we're given a great song composition to boot. Brought to life by the highly praised Yuki Kajiura, a woman made famous for her gripping orchestic pieces and her atmospheric somber ballads. The soundtrack fits the show like a glove and really enhances every scene to new elevated highs. The only downside being that their was very little to distinguish this score from any of Kajiura's other works, as her signature style almost feel like carbon copies of each other. Despite that it is still a wonderful attachment and one welcomed any day.\\n\r\nThe voice actors were also good, many fitting into their roles without any qualms to speak of. Standouts being Suwabe's role as Archer, as he gives him that no nonsense aura and Ueda as Rin as the chemistry she brings between the other cast feel quite natural.\\n\\n\r\nNow with the praise out of the way let's address the elephant in the room: Story 5/10, Characters 5/10\\n\\n\r\nStory: 5/10\\n\\n\r\nDefinitely one of the biggest offenders, the story is noticeably flawed, even a casual viewer who pays little attention to it can easily spot the missteps. When it comes down to it the presentation and execution of the show is the only thing separating this from your \"run of the mill\" bishonen fighting show.  Hiding under the guise of a \"battle royal\" it seems like the only episodes that showed true progression were the 1st, one in the middle and the last. Everything else was obvious padding to reach the shows desired length, with lots of dead time and fights that lead nowhere. For a \"battle royal\" it seems like everyone is more concerned with chivalry and throwing praise at their opponents than actually eliminating them. Every fight seem to boil down to \"I'm going to kill you... wow I'm impressed with your skills... nevermine I won't kill you, let's fight some other time\".. Now this isn't always the case as the last confrontation in episode 12 actually yielded something other than the monotonous cycle. But that doesn't excuse the rest of the show from dicking around with needless slice of life moments, unnecessary harem-esc comedy and aimless fights. \\n\r\nAgain this isn't a fault with the studio but with the poor script they have to work with. It's one thing to stay faithful to your source material but it's another to let said material bog you down. This sense of stagnation lead to very tension-less encounters since all that comes out of it are wounded opponents that simply retreat to recuperate for the next empty encounter.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 5/10\\n\\n\r\nAs much as I like the cast of the Fate franchise it isn't hard to see them for what they truly are, which are simply characters. Only a few of them feel like actual people while the rest feel like simple 1 note puppet pieces dancing across the screen.\\n\r\nOur main protagonist Shirou isn't as offensively idealistic as portrayed in his DEENs counterpart but he isn't any better either. He still spouts naive ideologies found in your typical bishonen MCs. Your \"fight for what's right\" kind of archetype, one I'm sure many of us are tired of seeing. \\n\r\nthankfully Rin Tohsaka is more tolerable as she isn't your Asuka level of tsundere, but she feels more well rounded. However their is very little dimensions to her character, as it seems the show relies heavily on your prior knowledge of her placement in the Fate universe. \\n\r\nThe shows other biggest offenders come in the form of the supporting cast, with bombastically 1 dimensional characters like Shinji Matou and for the most part a majority of the Servants. Archer says it best, as he describes the servants as being nothing more than instruments for the masters to use and that's exactly what they feel like. Most of them exudes 1 note archetypal characteristics that defines them. May that be Archer's \"no nonsense\" archetype, Caster's \"big bad witch\" 1 dimensional villain representation or Saber's \"lady of honor\"  1 note portrayal. All the the servants show little to no layered characterization and depends to heavily on pseudo-history to hold any merit. They simply can't stand on their own as people and that keep them from being anything more than 1 note characters. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nAny qualms I have with the shows characters & story is easily washed away with the great presentation.  Ufotable is simply a studio that can't be faulted as they always succeed at bringing wonderful eye candy to the screen that will keep you hooked from beginning to end. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 6/10\\n\\n\r\nDespite its lackluster cast and story Unlimited Blade Works is truly pure entertainment. As popcorn material it is only rivaled by its predecessor Fate/Zero. For anyone seeking awesome fights, fluid animation and easy consumption look no further, this title is truly an addicting watch. There is something here for anyone, may you be a fan of the franchise or not. With that said I recommend giving this title a go.",

Oh shit wrong adaptation.\r\nStudio DEEN\u2019s horrible adaptation of Fate/Stay Night Unlimited Blade Works is one of the most dreaded adaptations in anime. Now ufotable, in all of its HD glory, will now adapt one of the most loved routes of the visual novel. And it turns out to be great.\r\nLet\u2019s us go to the specifics. \r\nThe story is different from the Fate route as it now focuses on Rin Tohsaka. As it goes on, ufotable manage to showcase masterful execution. It makes interesting premise and makes the audience want to know and watch more. This Fate/Stay Night fix the problems of itspredecessors, one of these is the exposition or info dumping. If there is two words to associate the Fate series, it must be gotta be \u201cboring exposition\u201d. Especially to a big verse, that is the Nasuverse, that has many terminologies and stuff to explain about magic. It takes all of the visual novels or its anime to interconnected it to form a one united verse. Like I said, its info dumping is less and separated into bits which makes the show more action and drama. \\n\\n\r\nAnother problem this show fixed is its characters. You remember Shirou? Forerunner of one of the most used memes related to anime. Remember we all hate him. Not now anymore. HIs character is less annoying and it is much more developed than his Fate side. The character interactions are better too and all characters are really more likeable and better written.And we see goddamn TsundeRin in all ufotable glory \\n\\n\r\nNow we talk about what made ufotable and the series so popular and hyped, its visual in HD glory and seemingly unlimited budget. I think this series wouldn't be the same without its blockbuster budget. Every episode is like you are watching a Pixar movie that is well animated. Thanks to the responsible planning of the staff. The music is glorious and exemplary. \\n\\n\r\nFate/Stay Night, due to these things, is now overhyped and overrated. I think Fate/Stay Night first cour does not deserve a 9 but it is still a exemplary adaptation and a interesting premise. Kudos to you ufotable.\\n\\n\r\nStory - 8/10\\n\r\nArt - 11/10\\n\r\nSound - 9/10\\n\r\nCharacter - 8/10\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 9/10\\n\r\nOverall - 8/10",

            "content": "**SPOILER FREE REVIEW OF BOTH SEASONS**\r\nIf anime history has taught us anything, it\u2019s that visual novels are an incredibly difficult medium to adapt into anime form. Whereas a VN can contain hours upon hours of dialogue in order to establish characters, the story, the setting, and the lore, anime do not have such a luxury. In addition, VN\u2019s offer the player the ability of interaction; they allow you to choose what path to go down and ultimately what \u201cending\u201d you will receive. Choosing a poor option can actually result in death, thus shattering the concept of plot armor and keeping the reader on edge. EnterFate/Stay Night; one of the most popular VNs of all time. Its story and characters are absolutely iconic as a result of its widespread fame. Would studio ufotable be able the capture the magic the source material is so widely praised for possessing? Unfortunately, the difficulties of transcending two very different mediums have never been more apparent than in this iteration to the Fate series. While I haven\u2019t read the original work myself, I can wholeheartedly say that Fate/Stay Night UBW is a mediocre at best anime and good for virtually nothing outside of its flashy animation.\\n\\n\r\nSynopsis: Seven \u201cmasters\u201d, who are powerful magic users, summon seven \u201cservants\u201d, who are iconic figures from throughout history and fiction, in order to fight it out for possession of the holy grail; a magical item that will grant the recipient\u2019s greatest wish. The story follows Shirou Emiya; a teenager with weak magical abilities who gets himself involved in the fray.\\n\\n\r\nUBW\u2019s story line has a plethora of issues, and a great deal of them stem from the fact that visual novels just don\u2019t work as anime more often than not. First of all, this show\u2019s amount of info-dumping and pacing in general is absolutely atrocious. Watching this show feels like watching Dragonball Z all over again; the characters just talk and talk and talk and repeat and repeat and repeat. Shut up and fight! Even when there is no fighting going on, all the characters know how to do is talk about the plot. There is So. Much. Explaining. I understand that the lore of Fate/Stay Night is important to the story, but have you ever heard of \u201cshow don\u2019t tell\u201d? Constant paragraphs of exposition may work in a visual novel, but not in an anime. \\n\\n\r\nEven worse than info-dumping is the direct consequence of it: The characters are all shallow. Because ufotable is trying so hard to cram as much of the backstory and dialogue as they possibly can into every episode, something is very clearly missing: characterization. Every side character in this show might as well be a cardboard cutout. You\u2019ve got Rin \u201cmost generic tsundere I\u2019ve ever seen\u201d Tohsaka, Illya \u201cI only exist to make you sad and serve no actual purpose\u201d Einzbern, Sakura \u201cThey completely forgot I existed\u201d Matou, Shinji \u201cimmersion-breakingly hammy\u201d Matou, and who could forget Saber, also known as \u201cMy route already happened, so I don\u2019t matter anymore\u201d. I can\u2019t stress enough how big of a problem this is. Many of the major characters who receive a significant portion of screen time don\u2019t even reach the 2nd dimension; a task that even completely incompetent writers can accomplish. They also fail to have even a slight amount of chemistry with each other, as every character relationship feels contrived and artificial. The only character this show seems interested in fleshing out is Shirou, and boy does that bring up a few issues\u2026\\n\\n\r\nFirst of all, how on Earth is anyone supposed to take Shirou Emiya seriously? Calling him an idiot would be an insult to idiots. This kid either has a death wish or the reasoning capabilities of an infant baboon. Or both. Before I even go into the number of times over he should have been killed and simply isn\u2019t for the convenience of the plot, let\u2019s talk about his \u201cI have to save everybody\u201d ideal system. Shirou: You realize that nearly 2 people die every second, right? You understand that it is not physically possible to LITERALLY save EVERYONE, right Shirou? You are a random teenager with absolutely no power, so surly you understand that you can only so much? No. No he doesn\u2019t understand that. Shirou\u2019s childish at best and completely insane at worst delusions are immersion breaking on the sole grounds of how mind-blowingly stupid they are. He unnecessarily endangers his own life and lives of countless others on a frequent basis even when there is absolutely nothing to gain from it (making him a hypocrite), he is unfathomably dense, and the very little personality he has is entirely unlikable. Shirou Emiya is one of the worst anime characters I\u2019ve ever encountered.\\n\\n\r\nAnd let\u2019s mention plot armor for a second: We\u2019ve established that in the VN, it is possible for Shirou to die if the player makes the wrong choice. This means there is no plot armor in the VN, which I\u2019m sure works very much to its benefit. In the anime, however, there is no outlet or excuse for the obviously fatal situations that Shirou and the others manage to walk away from every other episode. There is NO logical reason whatsoever that people with every incentive to kill Shirou NEVER do when they have the opportunity. Yet again, it\u2019s like watching Dragon Ball Z. We all know the hero is going to win, but can you at least put a little effort into creating logical reasons for WHY he is able to win rather than just having him miraculously surviving an encounter that should be fatal by the show\u2019s own assertion EVERY time? It\u2019s painful to watch.\\n\\n\r\nTo top off the disastrous writing and execution of this show, I feel the need to mention how downright edgy it is. That\u2019s right; \u201cedgy\u201d. Since that term has become a bit of a buzzword, here\u2019s what I mean by that: Something is edgy when it is dark, gritty, or shocking without any legitimate reason to be; it\u2019s just thrown in there for the sake of shocking the audience or attempting to appear more mature than it actually is. Giving specific examples would delve into spoiler territory, but it reached \u201cCraaaawling iiiiin my Skiiiiiin\u201d levels of bad. When you consider that this is a show clearly under the impression that it is intelligent and philosophical, these moments are absolutely cringe-worthy.\\n\\n\r\nI\u2019ve said before that the fight scenes are the best part about this show, but even those become hard to take seriously when the writing behind them is unbelievably childish. Every fight, and I do mean essentially EVERY fight gets resolved with a total asspull. Be it a last second save or a deus ex machina, this is some truly disgraceful writing. Is watching the protagonist getting predictably saved at the last second over and over and over and over again, as if he was ever in any real danger, REALLY fun for you guys? Seriously, is it? Does that honestly not suck every bit of suspense out of the entire plotline and make it impossible to take seriously? Because it certainly does for me. To make this comparison for a third time, it\u2019s like watching Dragonball Z.\\n\\n\r\nRegardless of how badly the plot and characters managed to fail in my opinion, it can\u2019t be denied that UBW has some pretty astonishing animation. The art style is nothing to write home about, but the fluidity of the actual motions as well as the choreography is nearly flawless. The action scenes will absolutely take your breath away, and the show really needed a lot more of them (and a lot less info-dumping). The settings and backdrops leave a bit to be desired, but the use of colorful gradients as magical attacks fly across the screen really gives the show a unique flair and keeps your eyes glued to screen. The music and voice acting is also good. Notice the emphasis on \u201cgood\u201d. Not \u201cgreat\u201d. There are no tracks that really blew me away and the sound design wasn\u2019t anything particularly impressive either, so while the overall use of sound is above average, it\u2019s not legendary or anything.\\n\\n\r\nI didn\u2019t really delve into how pretentious the show is, I could have been more harsh about EVERY fight ending with a god machine, and there are several plotholes I can\u2019t mention due to spoilers, but at this point, I think you get the idea. Fate/Stay Night UBW is a very, very flawed anime. The budget and cinematography is really the only thing that separates it from the rest of the crappy shounens, and I truly wish that wasn\u2019t the case. I was a fan of Fate/Zero and I wanted to believe that DEEN\u2019s 2006 disaster was just a fluke, but UBW has led me to believe that it was not. Fate/Stay Night is simply not going to work as an anime adaption, and this show\u2019s abject failures in spite of its massive budget provide more than enough proof of that.",

            "content": "On July 27th earlier this year, there was a public presentation held by Ufotable regarding what their long-awaited remake of Fate/stay night (F/SN for short) would actually cover as that had been unknown up to that point. When the preview was finally shown and it was revealed that they would be covering the Unlimited Blade Works route (UBW for short) as a full TV-series, there was a cry of relief and happiness resounding all throughout the fanbase of the franchise (if you were following the live stream at the time you'll know what I am talking about). Type-Moon's ten year old work of art hasgotten tons of exposure over the years, but somehow it had still never gotten a proper anime adaptation, a whole decade after the original visual novel was released. The only anime it ever received was the TV-series Studio DEEN provided back in 2006, as well as an attempted movie version of UBW in 2010. However both of these were complete butcherings of the source material, and thus the search for a legitimate F/SN anime continued all the way until this day; the day when we all turned our eyes in Ufotable's direction in hope that they would finally save the day. Of course, when it comes to visual novel adaptations, in all honesty less than 1% of them live up to their source material in terms of quality, but in this case however, I had no worries. I just knew that Ufotable would pull it off; it was like an aura lying in the air.\\n\\n\r\nAnd lo and behold, they actually did.\\n\\n\r\nNow before I get into this there's something I think needs clarifying: I will not make any comparisons or references to Fate/Zero in this review. It will be written as if this was in fact the first part of the Fate/ universe you watched. This is simply because despite the fact that Zero aired before this anime, its story goes under the assumption that the viewer is familiar with the events of F/SN first. In other words you are really supposed to watch UBW *before* Zero, unless you've played the original visual novel first of course in which case anything goes. Watching Zero first will sadly spoil numerous plot points of this anime's storyline. I will not go into further details on this subject however as it has been discussed to death, but will rather recommend people to check out the FAQ Sticky thread on the UBW subforum if you have any questions regarding viewing orders or anything else.\\n\\n\r\nAnd with that finally out of the way; let's get into this shall we?\\n\\n\r\n--Story--\\n\r\nIn a nutshell, Fate/stay night can be labeled as a supernatural battle royale.\\n\\n\r\nRoughly once in every 60 years, the one and only legendary artefact known as the Holy Grail will have gathered up enough magical energy from the Earth in order to allow an event called the Holy Grail War to commence. In this \"war\", seven mages (or maguses as they're called here) are chosen by the Grail to summon seven Heroic Spirits of legend. Heroic Spirits are people that have been labelled as heroes by the residents of the Earth after their death, and have consequently been taken to a place outside the flow of time where they can be summoned from by the Holy Grail.\\n\\n\r\nThe seven summoned Servants are by default divided into seven character classes: Saber, Lancer, Archer, Rider, Caster, Assassin and Berserker. Heroic Spirits can only be summoned as classes that would fit into the character setting that they had while they were still alive as humans, for example Robin Hood would surely be an Archer and Genghis Khan would most certainly be a Rider, etcetera. Once a Servant has been summoned, the responsible magus then takes command of him/her and takes on a role referred to as their \"Master\", and they join together as a team in order to try to bring down the other six teams of Master and Servant. The reason for all of this is that whoever wins the Holy Grail War gets possession of the Holy Grail itself, an artefact so powerful that it is said to be able to grant any wish its owner desires, and the Master and Servant get to share the reward if they're both alive at that point.\\n\\n\r\nAnd with that, the premise of the story is created. In the grand scheme of things it is fairly straightforward as a whole, albeit not without its fair share of twists and turns along the way. What I always liked about F/SN is how it manages to intertwine great storytelling and intense action scenes, as those two aspects are generally pretty hard to mingle. It has this aura that makes every fight between Servants feel epic in execution but still maintain a constant sense of reason and purpose.\\n\\n\r\nThe pacing is very consistent, and more or less perfect. It gives you just enough breathing room in-between every peak of activity in order to give the characters time to develop properly, but without slowing down the action so much as to ever get boring. You'll always be eagerly looking forward to the next major event in the story, but it never rushes along the in-between segments just in order to jump straight into the action. As a result, it succeeds at providing episodes that are both fantastic on their own, but still steadily progresses the overarching story in order to get one step closer to the eventual conclusion.\\n\\n\r\nIt should be noted however that this anime only covers half the story, as the conclusion of UBW will air in spring 2015, and that this first half in all honesty contains more world building, character introductions and foreshadowing than actual revelations. However this is merely the calm before the storm in that sense as the best is yet to come.\\n\\n\r\n--Characters--\\n\r\nThe character cast of Fate/stay night is rather large and as an inevitable result it varies in quality from amazing to absolutely craptastic. I am not going to go into detail for all of them as that'd take an entire essay, but rather leave it at the four most important ones.\\n\\n\r\nFirst and foremost, there's of course our ever so famous, lightly tsundere protagonist Emiya Shirou. He is one of the seven Masters of the war and has Saber as his Servant. Despite that fact, Shirou is actually not a fully trained magus, and is thus unable to provide Saber with enough magical energy to let her use her full strength. Shirou doesn't particularly care about any sort of reward the Holy Grail might be able to give him. He merely wants to make sure no one else gets it either just in case they'd use it for malicious purposes. To be perfectly honest, in a certain sense Shirou is a bit of an idiot. He has a certain idealism based around the idea that he has to be a superhero that he holds onto desperately which quite frankly can be extremely frustrating to watch at times because his actions tend to defy all common sense every so often. In this anime however, Shirou also has a huge amount of character development and his likability goes up constantly over the course of the story. Granted he's still definitely not the best protag you'll ever see but his role fits pretty well into the plotline of UBW so I can't really complain. Sometimes a character's true worth is not based on how much you might like him/her, but rather depending on how well written they are, and in that sense Shirou pulls it off just fine.\\n\\n\r\nSecondly, there is Tohsaka Rin: the noble rich girl who is hopeless with all modern-age technical gadgets. She goes to the same school as Shirou, and is generally treated as the best honor student and perfect woman of it by all the other students. She is also a fellow Master and thus officially one of Shirou's enemies, however the pair of them tend to (for the most part) let each other off the hook in order to primarily focus on other, more dangerous foes instead. In addition, Rin is an exceedingly rare case of a generally approved-of and extremely popular tsundere, probably because she is actually very well written and just plain entertaining to follow, despite her extreme naivety. Rin is not someone who is only there for appearances however, but rather is a very competent magus in reality, fully capable of holding her own against most enemies, and also hopelessly outclassing Shirou when it comes to magical capability.\\n\\n\r\nThirdly, we have the ever so illustrious Saber, the so-called \"strongest Servant\" who serves as Shirou's sword and knight. Oftentimes she comes off as a robot-like \"I'm so powerful and righteous I'll just beat everyone up without sweating a beat\" kind of holy warrior, though she can be pretty cute every once in a while when her dere side emerges. Unfortunately for her however, since her Master, Shirou, is unable to provide her with the normal amount of magical strength due to his incompetence as a magus, Saber has to do her best at holding her ground in combat despite being in a very weakened state. As a result she's unable to ever show off her full potential as a warrior, but even so she's still far from a weakling.\\n\\n\r\nAnd finally we have Rin's Servant, Archer. He is... well he's just badass throughout. I don't see how you could possibly dislike him. In all seriousness though, Archer is an extremely unpredictable, blunt and overall mysterious character in general, and trying to figure out what exactly he is thinking most of the time is a tall order. As far as combat goes, despite his name he normally fights with a pair of conjured short swords, dual-wield style (which I personally think is one of the coolest weapon setups you can use). Of course he has a bow as well but he only ever seems to use it when he gets really serious.\\n\\n\r\nNow in case you didn't know, UBW at heart is Rin's route in the original visual novel, and hence she's the main heroine in this anime. Diehard fans of Saber might find that fact somewhat disheartening, but you'll just have to deal with it. Of course since Saber and Archer are Shirou's and Rin's Servants respectively, they obviously hang around the pair of them almost all the time as well so as far as actual screen time goes then there's plenty of it for all of them. I think it fits the tone of the story very well when Saber is actually being treated as the character she is, I.E: a heroic swordswoman; not just reduced to some mere sappy love interest. Rin on the other hand has a lot of natural chemistry with Shirou that never feels forced as they're actually both humans in similar positions, not to mention that they're both tsundere for each other. Hence I think the \"main heroine\" privilege is in fact a lot more suitable for Rin than Saber could ever hope to have in that sense.\\n\\n\r\nThe rest of the cast consists of various schoolmates and general acquaintances of Shirou and Rin, all the other Masters and their respective Servants, as well as the illustrious priest Kotomine Kirei who is arguably the most impactful character of the entire franchise depending on who you ask. As always, some are better than others, but as a whole the character cast of Fate/stay night is very intriguing due to the very specific setting they all have, and as a result they are (for the most part) very captivating to watch.\\n\\n\r\n--Animation--\\n\r\nYou know what, there's not really any point in beating around the bush here so I'll just say it: excluding movies, this is quite likely the best looking anime ever made.\\n\\n\r\nUfotable have always had top notch production value, but what they brought out this time is just unreal. There's this specific aura surrounding the entire anime, namely the aura... of money. Whenever you watch UBW you can straight-up feel the insane amounts of pure cash that has been poured into creating this beast. Especially the CGI effects used for all the magical spells and superhuman fighting moves during Servant battles are completely out of this world. A single episode of this anime probably cost more to create than an entire season's worth of your average series (though I don't actually have any numbers on that). It's just that high quality. You might as well rename the whole thing to Unlimited Budget Works. Should only be watched in 1080p or you're seriously missing out.\\n\\n\r\n--Sound--\\n\r\nHonestly one of the best things about the fight scenes in the original F/SN visual novel was the soundtracks accompanying them. They livened up the atmosphere so much and made you pumped up and excited to find out what was going to happen next as a reader. When I look at the equivalent fight scenes in this anime though... I don't really get that kind of feeling, at least not to the same extent. Now instead since the animation in them is so out of this world gorgeous you don't really have time to think as much about the audio supporting it of course, but still as far as the audio itself goes it really doesn't have quite the same level of epicness that I remembered from the game. That being said, it's still Kajiura Yuki composing the whole thing so it's definitely very good for what it is, and by no means drags the series down if you don't give yourself any unreasonable expectations. It just could be even better.\\n\\n\r\nThe opening theme is called \"Ideal White\" by Mashiro Ayano, and the ending theme is called \"Believe\" by Kalafina. While they're both perfectly fine, neither are anything particularly special nor anything I would put into a music playlist.\\n\\n\r\nThe voice acting cast is the exact same one as it has always been for every other release from the Fate/ universe in the last decade across multiple mediums so at this point their voices are already burned into my brain and directly connected with the respective characters that they're voicing. Short version; while some are better than others of course, I can't think of anyone that doesn't live up to the respective character he/she is voicing. That in itself is enough reason for me to not complain about any of it.\\n\\n\r\n--Enjoyment--\\n\r\nFall 2014 was undoubtedly a great season for anime, but UBW was definitely the one series I always looked forward to the most every week. The fight scenes themselves look absolutely mesmerizing and are just a treat to witness every single time, and even when the anime has its more slice-of-life-esque segments it's still just as enjoyable to me, simply because of how likable the characters are. At the same time the overarching story keeps dropping subtle hints to you as a viewer, teasing you with what is yet to come in the second cour and making you curious about how things are going to turn out in the future.\\n\\n\r\nAs a whole, there's always this constant strive to keep watching as there are so many things just want to see unfold before you, be it for the sake of finding out what is really going on behind the scenes or just for getting to see more and more brilliant animation in potential upcoming Servant battles and similar. For myself at least, I like to say that one of the best ways to truly show the mark of a great anime, it's that whenever you finish watching an episode of it, you immediately want to see the next one, and then the next one, and then the next one etcetera, and UBW does this to the highest degree from start to finish. It's that ability to completely captivate you as a viewer that I'm always trying to find when it comes to anime.\\n\\n\r\n--Overall--\\n\\n\r\nI don't like to label myself as a Type-Moon fanboy. That would be an exaggeration. While I certainly like them they don't tend to completely blow me away. However I like to say that out of all their creations, Unlimited Blade Works is the one and only route that well and truly impressed me from start to finish back when I was reading the visual novel about a year ago. It has this constant atmosphere that makes you feel excited to see more, but it still maintains the pacing needed in order to not get ahead of itself. Ironically, sometimes this makes you a bit impatient as a viewer if you're desperately waiting for the next Servant fight or greater plot development to occur, but at the same time that exact feeling is what is going to make you stay captivated even during the most calm and relaxing moments. That being said if you are an impatient viewer, then I might recommend waiting with watching this anime until the second cour has aired in the spring as otherwise you'll be left hanging on a quite nasty cliffhanger at the end of this season.\\n\\n\r\nAs it is, \"perfect\" visual novel adaptations essentially do not exist, and make no mistake; UBW is not an exception to that rule. Despite everything there are still numerous things I could mention that could have been adapted better and made it easier for anime-only viewers to understand certain details of the overarching plot. That being said, UBW is still one of the absolute most faithful visual novel adaptations ever made, no doubt about it. I think it showcases once and for all that the most reliable formula for creating a magnificent anime is having a great (if possible finished) source material, a trustworthy animation studio and a shitload of money.\\n\\n\r\nAnd that's about all I have to say about this. Now granted this is only the first half of the story as the second part is airing in a few months' time but I have no doubt that it will be even better than the first one was. The conclusion of UBW in the visual novel was fantastic, and I have a ton of faith in Ufotable at this point after they've come this far. I can't imagine them messing it up at this point. However that is a story for another time.\\n\\n\r\nSpring can't come soon enough.",

            "content": "Please note: At the time of this review the second season for Fate/stay night: Unlimited Blade Works (TV) has not aired yet. \r\nAs a rather avid fan of Type-Moon, Nasuverse specifically, I was highly enthusiastic to watch the first season of Fate/stay night: Unlimited Blade Works (TV). I must say here and now that it did indeed meet, and partially exceed, my expectations. I knew it was going to be great. I knew it was going to be a true adaptation, which has never happened for the Unlimited Blade Works route (disregard that crappy DEEN movie). I mean, it's Ufotable. The same studio that broughtforth the anime adaptation of Fate/Zero and Kara no Kyoukai, which are both highly excellent anime. I'd be shocked if it was anything less that a great anime. Now, to start.\\n\\n\r\nStory - The basic premise for pretty much anything in the Fate franchise (minus Carnival Phantasm, although that's all of Nasuverse) is pretty well known: Set in the modern era, seven Magi summon seven Heroic Spirits, heroes of the past who have achieved great deeds in life, to fight in a battle royale of sorts to the death. The winning Master (the Magus) and Servant (the Heroic Spirit) will receive the Holy Grail - and omnipotent wish granting device. Pretty simple, right?Now, you may be thinking that it's just a clich\u00e9 shounen battle anime based off that premise, but that's far from the truth. Fate/stay night has always been a clash of ideals, it's never been just about fighting. It's about why a character takes up their blade to fight until the bitter end for what they believe to be right. Now, I won't go and say that the first season of Unlimited Blade Works is incredibly complex: it's not. For much of the first season, it's just building off the premise, setting the story up for season two. However, the actual story is still quite good if it was just that. It builds up plots for next season, and underlying hidden mysteries are hinted at. But Ufotable did more than just that, they went the extra mile. They added in new scenes that enhance the show as a whole. They likely did much of this to fill in some gaps from the Fate route, because that's the actual introduction arc of the visual novel for Fate/stay night. I'm also glad they referenced Fate/Zero more obviously than the visual novel did (as it wasn't written yet). You can see characters reactions to meeting other characters, just the subtle things that really stand out. That's why Ufotable is great, and that's why I give the story for this season of Unlimited Blade Works a 9/10.\\n\\n\r\nArt - I don't even need to say it, do I? It's damn near movie quality, if not already there. This is the best animated series I have ever seen. They even one-upped Fate/Zero, their previous work (which was already amazing). Ufotable has their CG flow so well with the 2D that it's just astounding. The vibrant colors and flashy animations are pretty damn good, too. And check this: they had to tone it down for TV. The blu-rays will be glorious. And the fight scenes, the gloriously amazing fight scenes are truly unique and amazing to behold. Seriously, if there's one animation studio that can do epic cinematic fights real well, I give it to Ufotable. I give the Art for Unlimited Blade Works a well deserved 10/10.\\n\\n\r\nSound - When I first watched Unlimited Blade Works, I didn't really care for the music. I think it's probably because I was used to Yuki Kajiura's Fate/Zero soundtrack. With that, I didn't notice that the music in this adaptation for Fate/stay night was actually quite fitting. It's actually quite similar to the background music in the visual novel. The music can really set the scene in this anime, and I truly did enjoy it. I give props to Hideyuki Fukasawa in regards to the music. Now, the voice acting was great, I don't think I really have to mention that. The opening song, Ideal White, was also quite fitting for this first season of Unlimited Blade Works. Although I wasn't too huge a fan of the ending song, I still thought it was acceptable. Now, one thing that made me love this soundtrack so much more? We got This Illusion. Fucking yes. Although it was the last episode of this season, episode 12, we got it. You see, This Illusion is rather iconic for the Fate franchise. It was in the original visual novel as the opening background song, also it was in there instrumentally as the soundtrack, and even in the DEEN anime for Fate/stay night it was the opening. With that, I give Sound for Unlimited Blade Works a solid 9/10.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - The characters for Fate/stay night have always been superb. I find a reason to like every one of them, minus maybe Shinji (though I love to hate him, so there's that). And Ufotable just brought those characters to live to their fullest. As stated previously, Fate/stay night has always been a clash of ideals, and in Unlimited Blade Works it's mostly between the protagonist, Shirou, and Rin's servant, Archer (not the Fate/Zero Archer). I'd rather not go too deep into it, as it's huge spoiler territory. However, I will say that if you were never interested in the Fate franchise because you heard that Shirou was a bad and clich\u00e9 protagonist, then I say that you were wrong. Likely one would hear that from someone who has only seen the DEEN anime, which Shirou is really clich\u00e9 in. However, that's because of the route that was being adapted in that anime was the Fate arc, which Shirou doesn't develop much, if at all in (it's an introduction route in the visual novel). However, Shirou grows a lot in this anime. Although it's incomplete, you can still see him growing. And I assure you he will grow further in season two. As for Rin, she's enjoyable, and if you like tsundere characters, you will like her. As for Saber, she remains best girl (sorry Tohsaka, but it's still Saber for me). Although there's plenty other intriguing characters, I'll let the viewer see that for themselves. Characters for Unlimited Blade Works gets a 9/10.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - Alright, if you've read through my review I'm sure you know that I freaking loved it. As a Nasuverse addict, I'd probably still love it even if it were lesser than the glory that it is. I also believed it was a great set up for the much more fast paced second season, which I am waiting for with pleasure. I would go to bed on Friday feeling like a kid waiting to watch the newest episode of UBW. Yes, I am biased. Get over it. It's pretty obvious I'd give it a recommendation and an Enjoyment of 9/10.\\n\\n\r\nOverall - As I stated earlier, Ufotable did great, and even partially exceeded my extremely high expectations. A total rating of 9.4, round that down and you get the final score of 9/10. I recommend this to any and all, and I'm impatiently awaiting for the glorious second season coming in April. Ufotable will not disappoint, I have my complete and total faith in them.\\n\\n\r\nViewing Order - Alright, this part of the review is mostly my opinion on how you should view Fate if you watch anime only (so, not including the visual novel, but if you can I'd recommend reading that in it's whole before watching any of the anime). So, I'll start off by saying that I believe that Fate/stay night should be viewed before Fate/Zero. The reasoning? Fate/Zero assumes you've read the visual novel. Not only that, but it spoils much of Fate/stay night. Fate/Zero is meant to tie up the loose ends in the visual novel story, but it should work just fine tying up the story of the anime as well. Speaking of Fate/stay night anime, should you watch the 2006 DEEN one or this one first? Well, just watch this honestly. Don't bother with the DEEN one unless you're really into it, and even then watch this first. You have to wait until the second season (unless it's already out when you're reading this), but even then it's worth it. Now, nothing against people who watched Fate/Zero first, I did of course. But, for new viewers I recommend the following: Fate/stay night: Unlimited Blade Works (TV) -> second season -> Fate/Zero anime -> anything else Fate that piques your interest. Of course, if you can I recommend reading the visual novel, then do the above in that order. \\n\\n\r\nThanks for reading, and Saber is still best girl :)\\n\\n",

            "content": "Let me give it to you straight: \r\nThis part of the Fate series is one of the weaker ones, it doesnt compare at all to Fate/Zero because pretty much what we get is a high school setting with our usual cliche hero saves the world storyline. \r\nThat being said, this particular season (as well as its prequel) has amazing animation, the motion of the fights are fluid and the effects are pretty darn good. What i was disappointed with was the story and the characters for the most part. \r\nFlaws:\r\nThe biggest flaw is how we dont really get much character development out of the characters,as well as how slowly the story of the whole thing moved. \\n\\n\r\nShirou is what you would expect from someone that wants to save the world but doesnt even know why he wants to do it in the first place, he is the very definition of a trope that has been present in anime since the last 30 years and the kind of character that needs development the most in order to be useful and not cliche. Even then, his character and his motivations are pretty boring, definitely a shadow of the main character on the prequel. \\n\\n\r\nTohsaka is what you would expect from your heroine and tsundere, then again if you are watching this anime, chances are you dont really care much about her because again, is just what you would expect because you have seen it before countless times. Her character if i had to define it with one word  would be bland. Much better than Shirou however, since she does go through some development, and we learn what her motivations are and why she has the motivations she has. \\n\\n\r\nThere is a little bit of redemption however, the heroes are actually the gem of this show, while we dont get much out of their story, we know that their motivations are nonexistent and as such, they have to fight or die since they were brought back to life without their consent. Because of this, we get some pretty interesting back stories and some go out of their way to change the path set out by them.\\n\\n\r\nConclusion:\\n\\n\r\nOverall, the first season of UBW is pretty much pretty bland compared to its predecessor, the story barely moves at all and we get cookie cutter characters which you dont expect or care much for because you realize they are just there for simplicity sake and as fillers and nothing else. To me, what made this show better were the heroes and how they carried the plot, well and the pretty animation. \\n\\n\r\nDont expect much story and character development out of this, although it is the first season after all. I expect the second season to pick up the pace however, and tie the knots of the whole thing. Definitely a step backwards when compared to its prequel in every aspect, but passable still due to the things it gets carried on. \\n\\n\r\n6.5/7.0\\n\\n",

            "content": "I\u2019ve been holding off on giving a definitive score for this show; mostly because I wanted to make sure the rating was accurate. Having now seen the series, I can confirm what many already know: Fate/Stay Night is a great anime. Both in terms of an adaptation of the original Visual Novel and as its own show, I think we can all be at ease in the knowledge that ufotable has done it again. Rejoice all who hath cometh, the adaptation you've been waiting for is here!\r\nFor anyone new to the Fate series, the series in essence revolves around seven masters who summon historical figuresin a fight to the death. The winner among these seven will be able to use the Holy Grail, which grants any wish. That\u2019s the barest description one can provide of the setting, so you\u2019ll have to watch in order to get all the details. Needless to say, anyone looking for a fictional world to get engrossed in will love the Fate series and the Type-Moon universe as a whole. There\u2019s a rich history here that one could easily get lost in. As a rule of thumb, the visual novel \u201cFate/Stay Night\u201d is the ideal starting point for anyone looking to experience this universe (though the choice ultimately falls on the person). \\n\\n\r\nAs for the anime itself, the first thing one is struck with is the animation. This is by far the easiest aspect of the show to review because it\u2019s simply brilliant. Anyone familiar with ufotable knows they have a reputation in this category, and they do not disappoint in the slightest. Backgrounds are detailed, characters are well drawn, animation is fluid, and CG is blended seamlessly throughout. There is the occasional misstep with how a character is drawn, and there might be one or two moments where the CG doesn\u2019t hold up quite so well, but overall this anime looks as sublime as one will encounter in a TV series. Some things to pay particular attention to when watching are the facial expressions and body language. Each is appropriately expressive and adds a wealth of character to everyone onscreen even before any dialogue has been communicated. I\u2019ll leave the reader to decide for themselves how well the fight scenes are executed - but from this viewer\u2019s point of view, I can\u2019t remember the last time I was so captivated by combat in an anime.\\n\\n\r\nSound is likewise impressive. Every effect from the ground exploding to Lancer\u2019s spear has a distinct quality that keeps you engaged. The voice acting is likewise well done, with each character giving emotional and believable performances. While I find the music a little unobtrusive at times, this improves over the series, and you\u2019ll likely find a few pieces that catch your ear when you hear them. Not too much more to say here, but nothing to complain about \u2013 it\u2019s all top quality.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters is one department that the visual novel excels in, and this is transferred nicely into the anime. You encounter an assorted cast of very colorful individuals; each with their own goals and agenda. Emiya Shirou is at the forefront of this cast, and over the course of this season you grow more attached to his goals and the actions he takes to achieve them. Rin Tohsaka acts as the secondary protagonist, and is an intriguing character in her own right (I found myself wishing that she was the main focus at times throughout this season). Needless to say, each is likable in their own way and add a degree of charm to the war they are participating in. Other characters such as Saber, Archer, and the numerous servant and masters encountered throughout the show also have unique personalities are interesting in their different ways. The one complaint I have in this area is that I wish more attention was given to the main characters than what we got. While the material available for Shirou and Rin was interesting, I felt just a little bit more was needed to make them better rounded. Side characters like Saber and Ilya also don\u2019t receive as much attention as you might think, but is the unfortunate consequence of having only one out of the three routes being adapted in the visual novel. A bit of a nitpick, but one I couldn't shake off. \\n\\n\r\nThe story is an area that shows the greatest potential, but is also the weakest here. The problem is that the first cour acts as a setup to the second cour, and in the end we will have to wait for the second season in April to see the plot truly kick in. That\u2019s not to say the story is bad here \u2013 far from it \u2013 but the real punch of Unlimited Blade Works comes in the second half; which means there is a lot of build up with the promise that better things are to come. If it\u2019s any consolation, I can assure you that the second half will indeed be incredible if properly executed. For what there is, you will certainly find enough that\u2019s hinted at to keep you intrigued and guessing as to where the story will go next.\\n\\n\r\nTo sum up, these 12 episodes are a lot like half of a great meal: You find yourself satisfied with what you have, but only want more. Minor flaws aside, this show carries a tone and sure-handedness in its story telling that keeps you in constant awe of how events unfold. Anyone expecting a rich and deep universe with good characters and an intriguing concept will not be disappointed. While your best bet for experiencing this story as a whole is through the visual novel, I feel comfortable recommending this anime as someone\u2019s entry into the Fate series. If you happen to be one of these newcomers and are searching for a new series to invest your attention in: have a seat, kick back, and prepare to experience one of the finer universes anime has to offer.\\n",

            "content": "Fate is without a doubt among one of the best Visual Novels out there but unfortunately at first it didn\u2019t have much luck in it\u2019s transition into an anime, that is until Ufotable partnered up with Type-Moon and with Garden of Sinners they proved they know how to handle Type-Moon works and with Fate/zero\u2019s success they jumped right into Fate/stay Night. In Fate\u2019s story there are three routes you can take and Ufotable chose the second route for their TV series while leaving the 3rd route for a movie.\r\nFor the second route(Unlimited Blade Works) there is already a movie done by Studio Deen. They alsohandled the adaptation of Fate/Stay Night\u2019s first TV series and they already proved it is too much for them to handle. while that movie has good animation and great soundtracks there is no other reason to watch it if you haven\u2019t other than to spoil yourself the important parts  without any right explanation so keep that in mind if you haven\u2019t watched that already. (on it\u2019s own their adaptations weren\u2019t really all that bad but when compared to the source material it really lacks the depth and lacks proper explanation so if you already read the visual Novel before watching them it can enrage you even more).\\n\\n\r\nJust like Fate/zero the anime is divided into two seasons, with the first one doing all the introductions and building up and with the second one showing the results. Sadly while fate/stay night\u2019s first half is amusing it can also get a little slow and tiring at some points but we get to that later. One of the most important parts of Fate/stay Night is Shirou\u2019s ideals and you are treated with it\u2019s evolution in each route. The second route brings balance to his ideals, that in real life you can\u2019t be a shounen hero and you can\u2019t expect to help/save everyone. Also in this route Shirou gets closer to Tohsaka and form a deeper bond with her. I was very glad to see from the very beginning Ufotable focused on Shirou\u2019s ideals, showing fans that they know what they are doing and bring some depth to the story along with it. It is details like these that Ufotable cares about and they know we care about them as well which make their works ultimately a great experience to watch.\\n\\n\r\nThere are of course some problems with the story as well,(nitpicking) granted it is all subjective and this mostly has nothing to do with Ufotable as they were trying to follow the source material(they added their own things as well which i liked not saying they 100% succeeded in their adaptation but i liked it) but of course they could improve some parts if they wanted to(like pacing) so time for nitpicking. for example Archer\u2019s convenient different \u201clook\u201d that helped him mask his identity always bugged me,(there is a reason for it like side effects of his Magecraft but I am not satisfied with stuff like this sadly, I rather if he had a burned face or had a mask) or one dimensional characters like Kuzuki(Caster\u2019s master) or even Shinji (for example Shinji is also a tragic character, sadly he still lacks depth and is just In the story to ironically get manipulated by others and to piss you off). Now back to what I wrote earlier about the show being slow in the first season, it seems Ufotable\u2019s faithful approach turned into a double edge blade for them. In this season the real deal starts only at the last episode, leaving the rest of important stuff for the second season and beside Shirou\u2019s ideals getting discussed we only get to see a handful of events(that of course foreshadow stuff) and for those that only follow the anime it is hard to care for the stuff that happened. (granted Shirou already started growing in this season and there are some hints of what\u2019s going on around already) Plus Ufotable tried to implement some of the comical scenes inside the atmosphere they created and in my opinion in that aspect they didn\u2019t exactly succeed but the lighthearted scenes in the last episodes served it's purpose very well since it gave you the \u201ccalm before the storm\u201d feeling and you actually see the start of that storm in that episode. Also while I understand that the three routes of novel are suppose to be seen as one story all together it is a shame that characters like Rider are not explored till the 3rd route. Last nitpick is the amount of all \u201cI beat you but I won\u2019t kill you\u201d moments that got out of control in Fate/Stay Night. One could rename this as \u201cFate/Stay Night: Unlimited -Can kill you but won\u2019t- Works\u201d Of course there are explanations for each(like characters having their own plan for later or because of their personality) but it doesn\u2019t mean getting lots of these moments is a good thing since it can take away from the tension. But enough about the story and the characters, these are all things of the past and Ufotable is just trying to be faithful by following them and i liked some of the things Ufotable did that added to the whole experience. I just mentioned all these so the review feels complete.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is as fantastic as ever, while it feels there are no real improvements in the animation it feels this time around without the previous budget limitations the true potential was realized and overall we got treated with lots of impressive scenes and thankfully there was no sudden drop in quality unlike the temporarily one in Fate/zero. The character designs are faithful to the visual novel as well as expected although some of them like Rin felt a little strange at first. This time there is no fully 3D berserker like in Fate/zero so the 3D focus shifted toward Caster\u2019s familiars and other small things (even Rin\u2019s hair at one point at least). The old voice actors are also back again for another Fate ride and it is enjoyable to hear their voices again. Sadly I didn\u2019t enjoy the Opening song of this season while I enjoyed the Ending song as I expected cause\u2026Kalafina. About the music, While the music is good and the new composer Hideyuki Fukasawa tried so hard to be unique while staying true to previous material it didn\u2019t feel as epic as it could be but there are lots of chances in the second season to make that right with all the emotional moments.(he already got one chance in the last episode and pulled it off at least to some extent)\\n\\n\r\nNow time for building up more hype for the next season. Of course without a doubt the second season is gonna be one hell of a show and I am sure everyone is eager to see it. April 2012 is gonna be repeated all over again which is awesome.(again this time Caster class is responsible for the closing act) As for this season the production value and the attention to details really held it up and turned it into an epic ride for both old and new fans. A big thanks to Ufotable and Type-moon for entertaining us with this level of quality.\\n\\n",

            "content": "In 7th grade, I stumbled across the original Fate/stay night TV series produced by Studio DEEN and it was one of my favourite programmes at the time. It had magic, legendary heroes, action, and all that guff. Of course, I got older and I watched other shows that had way more to offer on that front so the original Fate/stay night didn't really hold up for me that well over time. In fact, I can't bring myself to sit through the original Fate/stay night series nowadays since there's so much wrong with it. Then enters ufotable, Type-Moon's best friend when it comes down to adaptationspromising us a fresh remake of Fate/stay night that actually adheres to the visual novel's story closer and with incredible visuals. Did they deliver? Well, I can't say that they lied because they gave us exactly what they promised. However, my expectations were shattered for the most part as I found out that the ufotable remake of Fate/stay night is basically identical to the Studio DEEN version (barring a few differences here and there).\\n\\n\r\nufotable's amazing production values can't mask the fact that Fate/stay night at large is mediocre and is still a lacklustre sequel to Fate/Zero (which I seriously need to get around to finishing). What's more is that the pacing across this season is absolutely appalling. Action-heavy episodes get followed up by mundane slice-of-life stuff, which never failed to kill my buzz as I was watching the show and what's more is that if you count the prologue (aka Episode 0), this show has TWO back-to-back episodes that are 45 minutes in length. I don't care what you have to say about this, it's NEVER a good idea to have two back-to-back episodes that are damn near an hour long. As someone who marathons the stuff he watches, this just made Fate/stay night much more tedious than it needed to be.\\n\\n\r\nI'm sure that fans of the Fate series are gonna get at my throat for saying that I'm an idiot for expecting Fate/stay night to be anything like Fate/Zero. Well guess what? Fate/Zero is the prequel to Fate/stay night, and logic dictates that the sequel should at least hold up to its predecessor. Fate/stay night as a sequel to Fate/Zero is incredibly disappointing. Why? Well guess what? Fate/Zero was actually entertaining! There were high stakes, likeable characters, enthralling battles, and all that shit. Any time Fate/stay night comes anywhere close to being as entertaining as Fate/Zero was, there just HAS to be some mundane slice-of-life stuff to follow up the intense action and that just pisses me off to no possible end. Speaking of stuff that pisses me off, let's talk about Shirou and Tohsaka because they're the ones that I take umbrage with the most.\\n\\n\r\nI understand that Shirou wants to be a hero and is on the idealistic side of the spectrum, but there's a way to do the whole \"idealistic hero\" concept properly WITHOUT turning your character into an insufferable idiot.  Seriously, I don't think ANYONE who had a problem with this in the first series should disagree with me on this one. He's still an idiot who hasn't learned thus far that his ideals are NOT pragmatic whatsoever. He STILL insists on fighting Heroic Spirits whilst completely mortal and vulnerable, still insists of saving the lives of the few rather than looking at the big picture, etc. Come on, Shirou! Don't disgrace Kiritsugu's memory by not listening to one of his teachings. I understand that Fate/stay night is about Shirou, but I CANNOT stand the fact that he's thrust into situations where he should've logically died but then gets saved by Sabre/Tohsaka/Archer ex Machina or the guy/girl they're fighting decides to spare him because fuck it, why the hell not? I don't always mind plot armour, but Shirou just takes that shit to a whole new level. Hey writers, if you're going to do that kind of shit, DON'T FUCKING PUT HIM INTO SITUATIONS THAT ARE ALL BUT IMPOSSIBLE TO ESCAPE FROM!!!!! My suspension of disbelief can't take much more of this...\\n\\n\r\nOn the subject of Tohsaka, let's talk about her for a little bit. She's a tsundere in all the worst possible ways. She tried to kill Shirou three times, and yet she still blushes around him and wants to eat lunch with him. That alone should be more than enough to explain WHY she's such an infuriating character. I'm not the biggest fan of tsundere characters, and Tohsaka embodies all of the WORST possible tsundere traits that I've come to viscerally despise. If Tohsaka was a real person, she'd be committed to a mental institution because she's completely incapable of suppressing her homicidal tendencies toward the person that she apparently has a crush on. Tohsaka worst girl, Sabre best girl. That's the best way I can put it anyway. Can ANYONE explain to me why they like Tohsaka in the first place? I mean, she's far more competent than Shirou is but that's not really saying much.\\n\\n\r\nI really wanted to like Fate/stay night, I really did. In fact, I started out really liking the show but as it kept going and the tedium just kept making itself more and more obvious, it just killed off any joy that I would've gotten from the show otherwise. Will I watch the second season? It's hard to say because on the one hand, the show could get better but on the other hand, it could just be more of the same, inconsistent bullshit. With that said, I don't hate Fate/stay night. There are plenty of other things out there that are worth my ire but Fate/stay night isn't one of them. I still do like the Fate series as a whole, and Fate/stay night is just fine as far as casual entertainment goes. However, the amount of praise this series gets never ceases to make me laugh raucously. Seriously, who the fuck in their right minds would think a porn game adaptation is a masterpiece? That's all for now, though. Feedback's always welcome and with that, I'm out. Peace :)",

            "content": "Why is the FSN remake the savior of anime? Gee whiz, I hope the fan base ready their magic circuits and frap on their doushjins!\r\nOver hyped as it pierced into the heavens, because Ufotable are going to re-animate so the action scenes look even more amazingly artificial and I thought it was just going to be cool action fiction thing with sprinkled anime archetypes but it ended up being stupid and pretentious. \r\nFirstly, nothing is deeply complex of this show, there is a lack in themes or anything to think about because the show uses common story telling techniques to explain the known adventure. Nothingseems \u201ctotal\u201d bullocks *cough* Zankyou no Terror *cough* with Shiro's obsession of kindness beyond natural human altruism was a bit odd but there was at least a decent explanation on why he became that way, though we found it a bit silly, it was way, way better than just either making it vague, or unreasonable.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, this in turn makes the drama undramatic because no one really seems to develop as if Thosaka's nature was the Tsundere clich\u00e9, it never helps that this wasn't meant to be a cool action show, but we need more emphasis on giving this show higher value like making annoying Drama! As if the countless moments of Shiro just trying to further nail the fact: that his insane altruism forces him to help too many people and the viewers are supposed to sob and fear about this thought provoking theme because they presented it in an intense manner! There were character interactions and their trauma and their development and writers were trying too hard to make us sob and where sobbing so uber much! Oh every moment was on par with the trauma drama of Clannad and I am crying in heavenly tears!\\n\\n\r\n Has anyone killed each other for the sake of progressing the plot? No not the making  random gore-fest moments that was redeemed laughable, but for the plot to move onwards, why the hell is no one trying to kill each other already?! Oh, Caster managed to lure our heroes to her trap and does she take this perfect chance to kill them? If Caster has uber hack powers from the gathering of so many corpses, wouldn\u2019t that mean she can negate the magic to any of the Grail War participants? Its not like there were any flaws in that power (like over I don't know - over draining her mana) which practically as she was the only standing servant with her master meant that she wins the holy grail war within one episode, and actually \u201cEnd!\u201d The series!\\n\\n\r\nTo be honest, Ufotable's signature animation does'nt really appeal to me. It felt like they were simply throwing money like garbage just to blend and put so much CGI on to the hand drawn sections, that it makes everything feel more man-made and that there is nothing natural about it. Too much lighting made the wood look like plastic, and the action scenes looked holy sick.\\n\\n\r\nDo you know what happens when you cross breed a maid and a knight and Shiro? You get Saber! Being the most overrated character in existence, her personality all comes down to being as loyal as a retard and respecting anyone. She is basically knight stereotype with boobs! Why are we still worshiping her?!\\n\\n\r\nSCORES:\\n\r\nCharacters: 3.5/10\\n\r\nStory: 3/10\\n\r\nMusic: 7/10\\n\r\nAnimation: 7.5/10\\n\\n\r\nFINALE: 3.5/10",

            "content": "I'm not a very good writer, sorry if I'm not able to properly articulate my exact feelings on the show.\r\nThe art/animation is outstanding. Nothing really to say here. The one failing moment was their attempt at CG water during some of the scenes with Caster.\r\nThe sound track was a near copy of Fate/Zero. It would have been more appropriate to invent new songs. Instead we see recycling of old ones. This isn't necessarily a bad thing, but it would have been nice to have something entirely new for a new show.\r\nThe characters are were this starts to fall apart. Excluding the fact that each conversationfeels like a quick-time event, the 2 main characters Rin & Emiya lack proper depth. And by \"proper\" I mean something that is believable. It's one thing for a character to have flaws, it's a whole other for them to do something entirely out of character. They also have a tendency to \"flicker\" characters. We see them once at some random point, then never again. Or maybe a quick cameo. What happened to lancer? Who cares! What's berserker up to? Lol, like that even matters. It's fine if you don't evenly distribute attention to each character, but that's not what's happening here. This is simply ignoring something potentially interesting so we can watch Emiya spout his hero of justice thing again. His inner conflict is largely uninteresting as it has no real moral conundrum to it. \\n\\n\r\nThere were around 10 battles/fights in this season. More then half of them end with a nonsensical retreat from the winning side. The first time this happens (with Rin) I disregard it. The second time, okay a little odd. But by the time we get near the end of the season and it's still happening I can't help but laugh at it's ludicrousness. There's such powerful plot armor around Emiya nothing feels even remotely threatening.\\n\\n\r\nThe story was what really kill this for me. I fear that if I were to properly explain it I'd get angry and it wouldn't be worth it. What pisses me off the most is the inconsistencies. Sure, if you're a 12 year old you won't notice them, but anyone who has experience with plot interpretation would be banging their head near the end of the season.\\n\\n\r\nObjectively this is probably a 6/10. It's an above amazing animation with below average characters and plot resulting in a slightly above average anime as a whole.\\n\\n\r\nIf you like super flashy fight scenes and awkward facial expressions this anime is for you. \\n\\n\r\nIf you're looking for complex character interactions and ideals that make you think you might want to skip this one.",

            "content": "\"I am the bone of my sword -- steel is my body and fire is my blood\"\r\nIf you have so much as set a single foot into the anime community since 2006, you have most likely heard of the Fate series by now. And even though its first anime adaptation (Modeled after the TypeMoon visual novel) propelled it down a critically ignored hill of decency, the series has come a very long way.\r\nFollowing the success of Fate/Zero, the prequel and first story in the Fate universe, studio ufotable announced that it was going to reinvent the original TV series. However, this time it would followthe route of Rin Tohsaka as opposed to the Saber version of the story. Needless to say, ufotable once again paints a beautiful image of exactly how the story of Fate should be depicted, while at the same time, adding new bits and pieces to renew the interest that readers of the visual novel once held in regards to the series.\\n\\n\r\nFate/Stay Night: Unlimited Blade Works follows both the aforementioned Rin Tohsaka (Smoking hot super-mage) as well as Shirou Emiya (Redheaded not-so-super mage guy). The two are tossed into a battle that occurs once every few centuries, in which seven mages each summon a \"Servant\" of a particular class in order to help them attain the legendary Holy Grail. However, the grail can not be obtained until only one mage is left alive.\\n\\n\r\nUnlimited Blade Works does an outstanding job blending action with the dark undertones of mortality, as well as friendship, betrayal, and the struggle of growing up and making the right decisions. Bloodshed paves the way to a new beginning (Or end) for each person fighting for the grail. Your attention will be fixed to the screen for literally every second of your time spent with this installment of Fate. Each episode's ending is overflowing with suspense, essentially beckoning you to spend more time with the show. In order to better describe what's in store for you, allow me to break this show up into a few key components.\\n\\n\r\nMusic: 10/10\\n\r\nAs always, ufotable brings you an onslaught of up and coming J-Pop/Rock artists, while bringing back the ones viewers loved from Fate/Zero (LiSA/Kalafina). And shall you make it to the final episode, a special surprise is in store for those who watched the first anime or played the VN. Never in my life have I had as many chills as I did hearing Disillusion come on as this first part of this story came to a close. It was like being hit by a literally tangible wave of nostalgia. And on top of the music, the original voice cast from the 2006 production returns once again. But this time, they are stronger and more emotional than ever. No complaints from me this time.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 10/10\\n\r\nI've always had a soft spot for the characters in the Fate universe. In fact, Rin is constantly fighting for the number one spot as my favorite character in all of anime every time she speaks. Each mage has a motive and ideals that keep them going as they put their life on the line for the entire duration of the show. Each servant is based on a historical icon (Fiction and non-fiction) that even history lovers would enjoy. They each bring to the table a so-called \"Noble Phantasm,\" accentuating a certain aspect of their past -- something that made them into icons. Even the characters you will wind up disliking are complex in their own ways. I'm going to go out on a limb here and say that the cast of the Fate series is the best cast in all of anime. And for that reason, they attain the highest possible score from me in this category.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 10/10\\n\r\nufotable is quickly becoming known for their beautiful artwork. People all over message-boards and forums in the anime community have even been talking and gossiping about their budgeting for a while now, considering they consistently deliver some of the best art to date. Fight scenes are easy to follow, but at the same time a spectacle composed of vivid color and speed rivaling that of a Boeing 747. Character design in spot-on and landscapes are a huge improvement from the prior production of Fate/Stay Night, as well as looking nearly identical to its prequel, Fate/Zero. Each image is not only captivating, but refreshing in knowing that there is a studio out there who is able to deliver beauty on such a consistent level. Once again, no complaints from me.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 10/10\\n\r\nTypeMoon has no qualms with telling dark stories. In fact, they love it. They build up each character almost perfectly and give them all their own time to stand in the spotlight. Character development is omnipresent and viewers go into each episode with open jaws and clenched fists, hoping their favorite master will come out on top. The Unlimited Blade Works route, which in my opinion is the weakest of the three different arcs, even comes out as mesmerizing. The story simply can't go wrong -- it just needed a studio who would be able to make everything else just as remarkable. It doesn't suffer from the same sporadic pacing issues that the 2006 Fate suffered from. ufotable picked a route and they stuck to it, adding many new flavors and new reasons to watch the series along the way.\\n\\n\r\nThere's always a shining star every anime season to emerge on top of its rivals. For Fall 2014, that show is Fate/Stay Night: Unlimited Blade Works. It closes the season with a bang and is already climbing the charts on various sites for \"Highest rated show\". It most likely won't wind up at the very top, but that doesn't take away from the fact that it was executed perfectly and deserves the score I am about to give it.\\n\\n\r\nUnlimited Blade Works picks back up for its second cours in April 2015. I'm looking forward to it more than you can imagine. You should be too.",

If you've only seen Fate/zero so far then you're most likely to be mislead and be disappointed, if you've read the visual novel then you're probably one of the many people who praise it like it's the second coming of Christ.\r\nCutting to the chase, this adaption of Fate/stay night is finally a faithful one, which is to 've expected from studio Ufotable. The dialogue has many hints about the protagonist'strue worldviews as well as other characters such as Archer. The story has a good pace that allows the viewer to question many things about, such as: why didn't Archer immediately attack Lancer when Rin was \"in danger\", how Archer know Saber from his past?, why does Saber not act as mature as she did in Fate/zero? why are there two of Rin's jewel that she used to save Shirou? why does Archer's ideals resemble those of Kiritsugu? why does Shirou blindly follow ideals that he might not believe in? what is the lesser grail and the greater grail? how exactly was Rider killed? how does Caster's master fight so well when he isn't a mage?\\n\r\nThe character development is mostly lacking, there are mainly subtle hints about certain characters and their true worldviews, but other than that, most of the development lies on the second half. Just like many people, I also hated Shirou at first, but by the end of Unlimited Blade Works he will be very tolerable and slightly likable, however, you must see the sequel Fate/stay night: Heaven's Feel in order to complete the story, discover the truth about Angra Mainyu, and even see Shirou become a mature and formidable badass.\\n\r\nThe art and sound is easily the best I've heard on any nime tv series, there's a good reason people call this show \"Unlimited Budget Works\", but even without the animation quality, this series is gold and should not be missed by those who want a deep and compelling story that requires major attention and a bit of thinking to truly enjoy.\\n",

            "content": "Take note that I don't play the visual novels and don't completly know the universe of this anime.\r\nTo be honest, I had high hopes for this anime after watching Fate/Zero but in the end I was underwhelmed because this anime is a big stepdown from the entertainment that Fate/Zero gave me.\r\nStory-6\r\nThe same as the story of Fate/Zero where mages would fight to the death with summoned familiars or \"Heroic Spirits\". The problem here is that the story is inconsistent in its pacing where 1 episode would be action packed and progressive and the next one would be boring talk about terms and history of thisanime's universe.\\n\\n\r\nArt-9\\n\r\nThis is where this anime really excells at. Art is simply amazing with every movement fluid and natural that it looks like you are watching an anime movie. My only complain is they use cgi models on some of the monsters summoned in fights which looks really weird and off for me.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter-5\\n\r\nPretty much a step down for me since I really don't find anyone interesting except for archer. The whole anime pretty much focuses on the development of Rin and Shirou and it almost completly forgets the other characters after introducing them in 1 episode. Nothing really bad about that except those two are fairly generic where one is a tsundere and the other the goody two shoes guy with naive morals and bad decision making.\\n\\n\r\nAnother thing that is  bad is the portrayal of saber. In Fate/Zero she was presented a tragic king with troubled morals/beliefs but in this anime she is nothing more than Shirou's bodyguard with a really shallow personality.\\n\\n\r\nSound-9\\n\r\nSound is great with everything in sync with the the movements/actions in the anime and it also has some catchy music.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment-7\\n\r\nThe anime is  slow and boring at times during its run because of the overly long talks which makes me question sometimes if I am watching shonen or slice of life, but it is really good when the plot finally progresses to the fight scenes\\n\\n\r\nOverall-7\\n\r\nAll in all this anime is still entertaining to watch if you are a fan of shonen anime.",

            "content": "Tldr: if you care at all about story, I suggest playing the original game from 2004. If you're not interested in VNs, I recommend skipping the anime anyway. Let me explain.\r\nIn the VN, you are often presented with life-or-death choices, where choosing the wrong one results in a unique type of bad end. Sometimes this just means a brutal death, other times a funny death, and still other times the result isn\u2019t death, but something much more disturbing, or something completely bizarre. Most importantly, they all reassure the player that none of the characters has any plot armor whatsoever and will easily die if youmisread the situation. In the anime, this element is (understandably) omitted. As a result, what would\u2019ve been a gripping tale of survival under extreme circumstances is turned into a simplified sh\u014dnen anime where you know the protagonists will always win in the end. It trivializes the story. \\n\\n\r\nAnd, of course, as with all adaptations, much of the character development and world-building is simply left out due to time-constraints. Thanks to this, the depth and maturity of the original is lost. Again, the result is a basic sh\u014dnen. And I do like well-written sh\u014dnen, but this isn\u2019t it, either. \\n\\n\r\nThe story in the original is good, as in life-changingly good. It certainly isn\u2019t perfect, but on the whole, it's the best I've ever seen in any form of entertainment. I would highly suggest giving it a try, at least until the first few life-or-death choices. There are better anime out there, but the VN is, in my opinion, the absolute best of its kind.",

Good concept but unlike Fate/zero, while watching this I felt like sleeping most of the time. I didn't expect it to turn into a f***ing cutesy high school drama either. Was too close to a shounen this time.\r\nArt- Same art style, it's good and all characters look fine as usual, but I hated how Shirou looked.\r\nAnimation-An especially strong point of the fate series, the animation quality remained great and action scenes were lively as ever.\r\nSound-Background ost's werenice, but the opening and ending were disappointments and did not live up to my expectations(although this is a minor point).\\n\r\nCharacters- Why the heck did they transform Rin into a stereotypical anime chick?\\n\r\nWhy did I hate Shirou so much? Probably because he was a generic shounen hot-headed \"I'll definitely win\" character. Nothing could make me feel for Shirou at all.\\n\r\nI wasn't eagerly clicking on \"next episode\" like I did with Fate/Zero, but I guess I'm used to disappointment in sequels. Whenever I saw Kiritsugu, Saber, or Archer during the series, it was like seeing an old friend. It's a bit \"meh\" now, but I hope 2nd season saves it.\\n",

            "content": "(Disclaimer: If you havent seen this show yet I would recommend reading the synopses of it before reading this review. Also, this review covers both season 1 and 2, since they are not really separated) \r\nFate/Stay night UBW is an anime of many genres. It tries to sell itself as an action anime, but this anime consists of very limited actions scenes. It tries to present a deeper story with lots of ancient heroes, which is meaningless since they never tell anything about them in greater detail. Last but not least this anime also got a harem and a highschool aspect which were completely unecessary.\r\nSoall in all would I call FSN UBW a fail? Yeah, pretty much. Soundtrack was nice and on very rare occasions the fights very animated decently, nothing too special, especially considering what money they earned with Fate/Zero and what could have been accomplished. The rest of this anime was bad. At first it may be a good comedy because of how bad It is, but after more than 20 episodes of it, you just had enough. But let\u2019s not stay with all the belittling slogans and start going through the anime piece by piece, shall we?\\n\\n\r\nLets start with the story and the characters: \\n\r\nYou start off the story with the main character Shirou, who is a highschool boy without parents living in a dojo. With him in this dojo is one of his female teachers who eats with him from time to time, out of reasons the show doesn\u2019t provide us with (maybe she was the gf of his adoptive father who passed away before the story begins.. who knows) and also with him is a female student the same age who cooks and cleans for him. Now I would have thought this is his gf, but apparently that\u2019s not the case. It more looks like he is just using her because she means so little to him that he completely forgets about her later on in the series. But that\u2019s not the only part of the story where our protagonist and self-proclaimed \"hero\" comes around more like a douchebag than a decent human being. He has obvious aggression problems, denial problems, the inability to learn from his mistakes and with most of the things he is doing he rather brings other people into danger than saving them. Things he has done that put others in danger are for example: not cooperating with a kidnapper who threatens to kill the hostage, when he and another character hide from an enemy that easily outmatches them and would kill them he shouts insults at this enemy, giving away his and his friends locaton putting them both in danger... why, because he thinks the enemy is a meany head. While such actions can easily lead to casualties, fear not, since this anime does not want to be taken seriously. That\u2019s why it comes up with ridiculous deus ex machina to save the hero, over and over again. If you watched Fate/Zero before and expected the same: character with a slight idea of how a plan would look like, you will be mistaken since this anime has only one thing:  plot convenience (or asspulls). \\n\r\nAnd if Shirous example doesn\u2019t convince you that the character of this anime are not really what this anime tries to present them as, meet Rin our self-proclaimed \u201cintelligent\u201d magician who fights along side the protagonist, for some reason. I don\u2019t know but teaming up with the most incompetent of all the participants isn\u2019t really a smart idea. Even her heroic spirit Archer knows that, and everyone who has seen the anime already knows what that means. But that\u2019s not the only thing really stupid done by this so called \u201cintelligent\u201d magician, in fact there was not a single thing smart about anything she did.  Even though she should plan for this heroic battle she rather spends her time in school and since the heroic spirits used in their battles are summoned by specific objects she should really analyze all the options of heroic spirits she has, but instead uses a random stone. And while the definition of insanity is \u201cdoing the same thing, over and over again and expecting a different outcome\u201d that won\u2019t lead her to change her attack plans. Rin also shows first signs of Alzheimers decease since she constantly forgets her servant at home and is pissed of about him later. The Alzheimer would also explain her inability of coming up with a decent plan (since she doesn\u2019t learn) and her going to school for no reason.\\n\r\nSo as your 2 main characters you got a guy with some deep psychological issues (aggression problems, denial problems and inability to learn) and a female one who I already diagnosed as a Alzheimers patient.\\n\r\nYou think those 2 incompetent character wouldn\u2019t be a match for any enemy. Don\u2019t worry, with the power of asspull shounen progression and plot convenience they are able to defeat anything in their way, except for brain cancer. \\n\r\nThe second season of the anime consists of many moral speech of various characters, but instead of being either inspiring or thought-provoking they only scream the little attempt of the writer giving his opinion about Japanese culture. But sadly he goes around it more like a little child trying to mock moral collectivism but clearly doesn\u2019t really understand the whole subject. But I guess he just has a repulsion against it because of a childhood drama. (most of the time it\u2019s something like that)\\n\\n\r\nArtstyle:\\n\r\nWhile I do like the detailed backgroundshots, the character designs are pretty lazy. They wanted to stick to the original Visual Noval designs which have nothing much to it. The animation in this show mostly consists out of limited animated standing (or sitting) and talking scenes with flapping mouths. Every one or two episodes you got a few seconds of decently animated fighting scene which mostly hold up 5 seconds at a time before they go back to their \u201cstanding and talking\u201d form. Which make the \u201cfights\u201d feel like they are half the episode long even though they are beating each other only for a few seconds.\\n\\n\r\nSoundtrack:\\n\r\nThe show has a nice epic battle score and in some cases mixed with electronic and it even has a nice j-pop opening, which even I (as a person who dislikes j-pop) can enjoy. The voice acting was decent I would say, nothing really worth praising but not something I would say is a fail. \\n\\n\r\nOverall\\n\r\nSo overall I would say that this show is by far inferior to the prequel Fate/Zero the studio made before. Especially the fact that they used the \u201cUnlimited Bladeworks route\u201d which is by far worse than the route used in the other anime version of Fate/Stay night, with a lot more contradictions and a lot more idiotic moral speeches.\\n",

            "content": "Warning, this review contains minor spoilers. No specifics are revealed.\r\nThe Fate series has a lot of hype surrounding it, with Fate Zero regarded by many as one of the greatest anime ever made, and it was my introduction to the series this past summer. After some encouragement from some friends, I decided to watch Fate Zero, and while it\u2019s not as amazing as some would say, I found it to be a great show. So, I was excited to see Ufotable\u2019s adaptation of Fate Stay Night, so much so that I put it on hold so I could marathon it when the season finished, somethingI blew through in the past two days. So, that leads to the question, was Fate Stay Night able to live up to live up to the hype, or is it just another mediocre show?\\n\\n\r\nMindset\\n\\n\r\nIn order to understand my thoughts on this show, you must understand the perspective I\u2019m coming from. As I saw Fate Zero recently, I view FSN as a sequel to Fate Zero. I know that this show is meant to stand on its own, and as such must explain things that I already know. I will attempt not to hold this against the show, but as I know I am at least somewhat biased by this fact, I felt it was best to make this bias clear. \\n\r\nAlso, this is only my review for the first season. I may redo this when the second season comes out, but well, I haven\u2019t so far. So don\u2019t yell at me for failing to take into account some epic scene that occurs there. \\n\r\nSo with that out of the way, let\u2019s move onto the story.\\n\\n\r\nStory\\n\\n\r\nI\u2019m pretty sure if you\u2019re reading reviews of the series, you already know the basic premise. Fate tells the story of a Holy Grail War, a death match between 7 mages for the prize of the wish granting Holy Grail. Each of these 7 mages is given a servant, a heroic figure from the past to fight alongside. There\u2019s magic and action, and death, and really everything I ask for in a show.\\n\r\nI will say this much, the story was very gripping. Every time an episode was over, I found myself excited to watch the next one. I did enjoy the mystery of wondering who was who, and what they were all capable of. Another thing that I really like was how they explored what it meant to be a hero of justice. The main character, Shiro is very idealistic, to borrow a term from ThatAnimeSnob\u2019s character video, he\u2019s a Boy Scout character. This really allows him to highlight the themes of the show, contrasting with the death game he\u2019s found himself a part of.\\n\r\nUnfortunately, that\u2019s about all the good I can say about the story. Now, I really wanted to like Fate, the premise is really interesting, I really liked Fate Zero, but there were so many problems with Fate Stay Night. The first main problem I have with the show is its boring introduction. Much of the first couple episodes are showing the main characters just go through their everyday lives. Yes, I know this was to introduce them, but I found it very dull. The information dumps were really boring as well, though I will admit, part of this is because of what I knew from Fate Zero.\\n\r\nThe second main problem were number things that didn\u2019t make sense. A good example of this is the magic system, which seems to work in whatever ways are convenient to the plot. Such as Shirou randomly having self-healing magic, quite helpful as it seems he seems to be injured about every other episode. He also ends up just happening to use a type of magic he\u2019d never showed any ability with in the show, right as he needed it to save his life. \\n\r\nThere\u2019s also the fact that for a death game, there is surprisingly little death with only one death in the first half of the show. This isn\u2019t for lack of battles either, as it seems like each episode has at least one fight in it. They just normally end with both sides deciding to retreat, wanting to have an honorable fight at a later time or something. If this just happened rarely, then I\u2019d be okay with it, but with it happening all the time, that\u2019s a problem. We have all this build up, but no real payoff. There\u2019s also the fact that in many battles, the fighters are idiots. Typically the mages are weaker than the servants, so it would makes sense to go after them first. So things would go a lot smoother if Archer decided to fire his attacks at Berserker\u2019s master instead of Berserker early on.\\n\r\nAnd of course, there is also the inconsistent tone of the show. I enjoy comedy, if I can laugh during a show that normally makes it more enjoyable. Unless the comedy doesn\u2019t fit. Fate Stay Night is a serious story about the death game, so this lighter content really doesn\u2019t fit the mood, and this goes even more so for the romantic subplot with Shirou and Ren. Trying to cram a romance into an action shonen type show does not work, as should be obvious after seeing Sword Art Online\\n\r\nSo in the end, the story really did have potential, but its slew of problems made it fall so short of what it could have been. I did enjoy it, and really want to see more, but I can\u2019t call the story good. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters\\n\\n\r\nI\u2019ve already talked about Shirou some with the themes the show presented, and that really is the highlight of his character. He is very idealistic, na\u00efve even, but this is why I\u2019m drawn to his character. Many of the others have grown up and seen the dark sides of the world, and know that being a simple hero of justice is impossible. But Shirou contrasts this, not being willing to abandon a few to save many, something that stands in stark contrast to his father. He\u2019s very self-sacrificing, not caring about himself if it means helping another. This is very admirable, and makes me want to see him win, even if it seems like he\u2019s the underdog, and really doesn\u2019t understand the gravity of the situation.\\n\r\nShirou\u2019s servant, Saber was one of the main characters in Fate Zero, and one of my favorite characters from that show. Here we see her and her noble characteristics in wanting to be an honorable warrior, and do her job as a knight to protect Shirou, even if Shirou doesn\u2019t really understand the whole stay out of danger thing. Unfortunately, she doesn\u2019t have the same flair, the same convictions as seen before.  I still like her character, but more because of who I knew her as before instead of anything she has done here. So far in FSN, she hasn\u2019t gotten much depth or development, or any awesome moments, though that may change in season 2.\\n\r\nThere\u2019s also Rin, another one of the masters and a longtime friend of Shirou. She serves in many ways as Shirou\u2019s guide to the Holy Grail War. At times I really like her, she can be very strong, knows what she wants. She can also be easily flustered, which isn\u2019t a bad thing, however there are times she feels like a standard Tsunade, which really is a shame, as I liked her character at the start. Her feelings and actions toward Shirou seem to be all over the place, from caring about him, to trying to kill him, to possibly being in love with him, to anywhere in the middle, and this inconsistency is her biggest flaw.\\n\r\nThe last of the notable characters is Archer, Rin\u2019s servant. Archer is a very analytical character, which contrasts well with the hot-headedness of Rin, and Shiriou\u2019s idealistic nature. He does what needs to be done to win, and if it requires sacrificing some innocents to do so, then he\u2019s okay with this. His actions at time also seemed to be inconsistent, though I think there may be some reasons behind this which we will see in season 2.\\n\r\nThere are a few other side characters, like Shinji who I really want to punch in the face, Caster, who is in many ways the villain of the show, but there isn\u2019t anything that notable about any of them, or the other characters I haven\u2019t mentioned yet. I do hope we get more development for the rest of the cast when season 2 comes out. One of the things I liked about Fate Zero, is that I could root for most of the teams, to a degree, while here anyone other than Rin and Shirou I don\u2019t care about.\\n\r\nShirou really is the only highlight character of the show, and I know that a lot of people don\u2019t like him. I really do wish they\u2019d do more with Saber and Rin, as they have a lot of potential. The other masters and servants are quite disappointing as well, though this could be comparing it to what Fate Zero was able to do.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation/Sound\\n\\n\r\nThe fact that Ufotable is animating Fate Stay Night means that there isn\u2019t much to complain about here. The backgrounds are detailed, using bright lights or the right tone of darkness to highlight the scenes. The actual animation can be lacking at times, especially when it\u2019s just two characters talking, but this is a minor complaint. The battles are done very well from an animation standpoint. Still, there isn\u2019t anything that blew me away animation wise, and while this is a step up from most shows I watch, it isn\u2019t anything amazing.\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is good, accenting the battles with epic music, and who doesn\u2019t like epic music? But still, the music is pretty generic, doing its job, but nothing more.\\n\r\nThe opening did a great job of pulling me in, I think I watched it about 10 times in a row when I first saw it. However, as I was watching the show itself, I became less impressed with the opening. Still, it was well animated, had a catchy song, and got me hyped for the show, so I can\u2019t ask for much more than that.\\n\r\nWhile I\u2019m normally not one to criticize Japanese dubs, as I have a hard enough time doing that with English, I did have a small complaint that there were times where Shirou\u2019s voice seemed off, which I think might have been that it sounded like another character the voice actor had done, and after doing some research, I found it was Sasuke from Naruto. A pretty small nitpick, but still one I thought mentioning.\\n\\n\r\nConclusion\\n\\n\r\nThis show really failed to live up to the hype that I and the rest of the community had. There was so much here that they could have done with the premise, but it just fell flat next to its potential. I wanted to like this, I really did, and there were a number of moments that really made me think this was a great show. Of all the season 2\u2019s coming out in 2015, this is definitely the one I\u2019m looking forward to the most. But there are too many problems for me to give this much praise beyond anything more than an entertaining watch.\\n\\n\r\nPros:\\n\r\nExciting story\\n\r\nInteresting themes about being a hero\\n\r\nHigh production values as can be expected from Ufotable\\n\\n\r\nCons:\\n\r\nInconsistent tone\\n\r\nThings not making sense\\n\r\nCharacters Lack Depth\\n\\n\r\nScoring\\n\\n\r\nStory: 5/10\\n\r\nCharacters: 5.2/10\\n\r\nAnimation: 8.5/10\\n\r\nSound: 7.5/10\\n\r\nTotal Score: 5.81/10 (Note that categories are not weighed equally)\\n",

            "content": "Treading on the dark abyss can be an enormous task to take. It is a never-ending ride that can only be described in the most torturous terminology imaginable. This abyss that I am describing formed around 2006 by the name of Fate Stay Night. Not the visual novel mind you, the adaptation of one of the routes contained in the visual novel. The reason it is called an abyss is that it was hated by almost everybody and their mother with its tedious and mind-numbingly boring presentation. All it would take to rationalize the problem is to realize that Type-Moon was lazy with giving itsadaptation in the hands of a studio that probably didn\u2019t have the authenticity it needed to showcase the grand scale of the Fate series. It only took Type-Moon nearly ten years to revitalize this by going on a different route, literally, with Unlimited Blade Works.\\n\\n\r\nThis might be controversial to say, with the usual reaction by many who follow this franchise, this next iteration in the Fate series anime franchise is by far my favorite. Mind you, I am someone who has not touched any of the visual novels when I watched the anime. I\u2019m making this statement based on how my experience is going through all of the anime, so no nitpicking adaptation problems from me. With that out of the way, how Unlimited Blade Works manages to succeed in being the best one simply from how the scale of its setting and story is structured in a way where it can quickly focus on the pacing the story and characters better. It doesn\u2019t have the most significant issue of Fate Zero where the scale of the setting was too big for the small amount of time it had to develop the characters. Not to say there is a lot of development in Unlimited Blade Works, as ufotable has realized that these characters have already been poised into our consciousness for so many media iterations that it\u2019s almost pointless to do so. Some decent character moments involve the development, particularly with Archer which I will get to later.\\n\\n\r\nInstead of Saber being the main girl with Shirou back in the original Fate Stay Night,  we have Rin Tohsaka filling in for that role in this one. As someone who\u2019s always thought of Saber as being a bland heroine in how they portray her in the anime, having Rin as the main focus was a breath of fresh air. Yes, she is your prototypical tsundere character falling for the main protagonist, Shirou, but she does manage to hold on her own as a capable character who offers more than the trope that she possesses. Shirou has always been a hit or miss character, but mostly a miss, for many people. Fortunately, he is not as dim-witted and unlikable as he was in the original Fate Stay Night, even though he still is in short bursts in Unlimited Blade Works. The rest of the human characters such as Kirei, Shinji, Kiritsugu, and Illyasvi are all of the same quality, all having their range of pros and cons but with nothing of exceptional value to this season in particular.\\n\\n\r\nI have never been interested in the actual lore of the Fate series. It is the hero characters being spiritual manifestations of past famous and infamous historical figures never clicked with me as being anything groundbreaking in the slightest. That said, Unlimited Blade Works was the first season that peaked my interest in it from the moment it started to tell the backstory of Archer\u2019s past life. It is explained in a somber manner and with a grandiose impact onto our main characters that will easily make you want to digest more of what will happen next as it paces itself forward.  What is disappointing is that the other heroes don\u2019t get the same treatment as Archer and make them feel static in comparison. From a visual novel perspective, it makes sense since a route only focuses on individual characters. But in anime, it feels jarring at times. However, it\u2019s not jarring to take in from Unlimited Blade Works perspective.\\n\\n\r\nOnce again, ufotable never fails to impress the fans and community by giving them a visual treat to splendor upon, if there is one thing they succeed in pleasing everyone. If you have seen Fate Zero before going into Unlimited Blade Works, nothing has changed dramatically from their original art design and CGI. Nevertheless, that isn\u2019t to say it is a disappointing factor since it is always more than welcome to grace us with its visual grandeur, even with no change whatsoever. The fighting scenes are just as amazing to watch as it was with Fate Zero with the niffty camera angles following the movement of the characters and the lovely sound design of the spells being cast and swords clashing onto each other. It's almost a necessity to watch this on the highest quality stream or buy the Blu Ray set to watch them at their maximum quality.\\n\\n\r\nEveryone has their strong attachment to the series and can be a polarizing experience for some who\u2019ve come to know the visual novels by heart. Me being one who does not fall into this category, as I\u2019ve mentioned before, I realize that my voice might be viewed as limiting to some. I can only express how I felt going through Unlimited Blade Works as my favorite of the series in terms of it being a nice fun ride that I hope will continue to go on with whatever next iteration of the Fate franchise that Type-Moon is willing to whore out for pennies. Maybe it\u2019ll be the final route of Fate Stay Night that they\u2019ll finally do and that will be the end of it, who knows. But that will more than likely not be the case, as sad as that can be.\\n\\n\r\nGrade: A-",

            "content": "Second Note: My score is for the entire series not just season 2 or 1.\r\nThe fate franchise is a vast amount of information expanding multiple shows, movies, books, manga, and short stories. There is definitely a lot to take in for a new comer to the franchise. So first I would like to say that if you are going to start anywhere you should read the visual novel of fate/stay night first. Granted if you don\u2019t want to do that then this anime is your next best thing. After finishing Fate Stay Night UBW it would be a good idea to watch Fate/Zero. I wouldn\u2019trecommend watching Fate/Zero first because it does spoil some things for this anime and the upcoming Heaven\u2019s Feel movie.  So here is an order for you Visual Novel or UBW -> Heaven\u2019s Feel Movie -> Fate Zero and if you want to be completions then you can watch Deens adaption of the Fate/Stay Night anywhere in the above order.  Now here is the review.\\n\\n\r\nStory: Fate/Stay Night\u2019s story follows the life of an amateur magus and our protagonist Shirou Emiya.  His participation in the Holy Grail War is the main focus for our story. The Holy Grail War is currently taking place in Shirou\u2019s home town Fuyuki City. During the Holy Grail War seven magus known as masters are aided by seven beings known as servants which are the reincarnation of legendary heroes from the past, present and future. During the war it is the goal of each Master Servant pair to kill the other Masters and take possession of the Holy Grail and have their wish granted.  During the Fifth Holy Grail war our protagonist is the master of the servant named Saber. One of the main themes of the story is Shirou\u2019s wish to save everyone and become known as a hero of justice. Throughout the story Shirou\u2019s ideals are tested and brought to question. So I don\u2019t spoil anything I will stop here with the synopsis of the story. Now the first two episodes (0 and 1) are mostly info dumps on who is participating in the War and what the rules of the war are. Both episodes may seem to drag on for new comers and overall it might have been a better idea for them to spread out the information instead of just shoving it all into a few episodes. \\n\\n\r\nIn the first half of the show  the story is paced rather well and I don\u2019t have very many complaints with how it was written.  I do feel some characters that have larger roles in the second half should have been given more screen time and more development. One such character is Rin the primary love interest of Shriou in this anime. For a primary love interest I feel she plays a rather small role in the first half and isn\u2019t fully given enough time to develop. Her Tsundere personality is fine in the first half but as the relationship grows the personality is never really turned down and this makes the relationship feel a bit awkward overall. The relationship at one point will be very romantic and then at the next point Rin will be hitting Shirou over the head with a pillow. \\n\\n\r\nThere are also a few servants that could have been given some more development as well along with our main antagonist who up until the second half really isn\u2019t given much screen time at all. I would go into more details but I feel I will be spoiling some things.  Now, if you are wondering if it\u2019s a good adaption of the visual novel I would have to say its ok. There are quite a few things that get cut out but overall it is better than any other adaption out there at this time. Ufotable also throws in some extra stuff that really isn\u2019t needed in place of cannon material. One character in particular has her entire backstory replaced. I think the new backstory is ok and gives the audience a gist of what kind of character she is but in my opinion it isn\u2019t as good as the original backstory.  During the second\\n\r\nhalf I fell the pace picks up a bit too quickly. Things that should have taken a few episodes to develop are instead crammed into only one episode. Personally I feel this makes it a bit jarring overall. The pacing of the second half starts off fast but it does even out at times as well. This does make it feel like some content is sacrificed as well. It is also one of the main reasons the romantic relationship feels awkward at times and why some characters are given very little time to develop. \\n\\n\r\nThe final issue I have with the story occurs in season 2. There is a scene that occurs later in this season that completely breaks cannon and overall doesn\u2019t make a lot of sense. Basically, the whole idea of how magic is inherited from person to person is disregarded during this scene.  Really it was one of few problems I had with how Ufotable adapted the story of UBW.\\n\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: There are only a few series that are animated as well or better then Fate/Stay Night UBW. There really isn\u2019t much else to say other than. There are a few animated faces that do look a bit weird at times but overall the animation is rather fluid especially during the battle scenes. Really if you decided not to watch this show for the story watching it for the animation and sound is probably enough to entertain most viewers. There are some CG scenes which I feel are rather well done but some people may feel they detract from the story. I personally think the CG makes the scenes in question feel more surreal.  \\n\\n\r\nSound: The sound is also great. I feel every track works well with both the show and even as standalone pieces. During the battle scenes the sound really helps bring out the intensity of the fighting. During the emotional scenes it sets the mood perfectly. There is one exception. During episode 13 there is a rather emotional scene that wasn\u2019t given any sound at all during the broadcast (this may be fixed on the BD release) It really makes the scene seem less impactful the what it really is. Outside of the OST the voice acting is also superb. Every character\u2019s voice fits their personality to a T.  \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: As mentioned above some characters really aren\u2019t given as much screen time as they needed or deserve. I have already talked about our main heroine RIn above but now I will discuss some of the other characters. \\n\\n\r\nShirou: I feel it\u2019s hard to talk about him without mentioning the fact that in the VN most of his dialogue is internal monologues. This I do feel detracts from his character and makes him seem less interesting and some may not feel emotionally invested in his character. But, if Ufotable had gave him more inner monologues the show would have been much longer. Shirou for the most part is displayed as a man who wants to save everyone no matter the cost even if it\u2019s his own life. He will go out of his way to save his friends and thinks about other before himself. To some this seems childish. This anime is mainly about Shriou facing his ideals and developing them over the course of the anime. \\n\\n\r\nSaber: Saber is a fan favorite and a flagship character for the Type Moon franchise. Granted in this route she takes a back seat at times for other characters. I think her character does suffer a bit because of this. She is a strong willed individual and I don\u2019t feel that is displayed as good as it could have been. In fact compared to the Saber in Fate/Zero this one seems a bit more on the cute side and her personality takes a similar turn. Ufotable took the strong willed Saber that many fans of Fate/Zero and the Fate VN and made her into a passive observer in some cases. I do think at times this can be overlooked because UBW is Shirou\u2019s story and not Sabers. Saber still does play a part though as parts of some episodes do focus on her past and her wish as well. Saber unlike Shirou regrets her past and wants to change it and by the end of UBW this plot thread is given a satisfying conclusion.\\n\\n\r\nArcher: Archer\u2019s personality is the polar opposite of Shirou. He\u2019s cynical and believes that everything Shirou think is wrong and childish. Archer does get a good amount of development and backstory. Throughout the series Archer is usually the person who Shirou is combating his ideals with.  I think Archer is a very well written character and does a good job at playing the opposite side to Shirou\u2019s ideals of saving everyone. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Even though I have played the Vn for all of its faults I still think Fate/Stay Night UBW is one of the best anime to come out this year. Its story is engaging and its animation and music is breathtaking as well. While is characters do suffer from a lack of characterization at times I feel it is a very good adaption to an excellent visual novel and would recommend it to any fan of the medium. \\n\\n\\n\r\nScore (calculated based on Story, Animation, Sound, and Characters) 8.25/10\\n",

            "content": "Oh well, long time no review! It's been a while since I last wrote a review but I guess I'm back in business.\r\nIf you plan to watch F/SN UBW, I assume you've already watched F/SN and know what this is all about. However, if you haven't, I recommend that you watch it first. After that, you have to watch Fate/Zero because it explains some things left in the shadow in F/SN and of course because it's 10 times better that its sequel. Oh, and if you didn't already know, UBW it's not a sequel to any of the series. It's just an alternative route ofthe F/SN. Now, given all these explanations I can properly begin my review.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 10/10\\n\r\nEven though 95% percent of those who read this know what the Fate francise is about. I'll make a short summary anyway for the 5% who don't. Seven masters summon seven servants to help them fight in the 5th Holy Grail War to win the Holy Grail which grants the winner any wish. The main character, Emiya Shirou is a teenager who doesn't know anything about the war and during the series still tries to figure out what his magical power are. Luckily, he meets Rin Tohsaka who helps him during the war and saves his life several times.\\n\\n\r\nThe reason why I rated the story 10 is because no matter what route of F/SN I'm watching, the story is always interesting and catches my attention from the very first episode. Even though I've watched SN I'm still excited to see how UBW is going to end and how the relationships between the characters are going to evolve. Fate has this ability to make my keep my interest even if I know what is going to happen. \\n\\n\r\nI\"ll also make a comparison between SN and UBW regarding the story. This time, the plot is focused more on Rin Tohsaka and her servant, Archer. Of course, Shirou and Saber play a huge role, but so do Rin and Archer. Despite small differences here and there, things go quite the same way as they do in SN. And I'll stop here because I don't want to give any spoilers.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 8/10\\n\r\nNow this is my favourite part because I finally get to some criticism. One of the weak points of Fate is Emiya Shirou. He is the typical character who doesn't know what is going on around him. He is weak, but still manages to beat the others. He is too naive and believes in some childish ideals snd most important, he acts bravely, gets himself injured and also puts Saber at risk. Maybe I'm a little too subjective but I've never likes these kind of characters especially when they are the main ones. During the whole series he messes things up but in the end he awakens that power in him and poof... wins the war. \\n\\n\r\nAs I said before, Rin Tohsaka is more important in this route, so her relationship with Shirou is also given more attention. That is one big difference from SN where in the center of attention was Saber.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter development? Well, yeah...I won't deny that. But there is still season 2 to come out so I'll wait and see how things go.\\n\\n\r\nArt & Sound: 10/10\\n\r\nWhen it comes to art, Fate never disappoints. When SN first came out in 2006 the art was not impressive but as the Frncise continued in 2011 and 2012 with Fate/Zero, everything improved and now the visual effects are simply awesome. Although the characters are not rich in details; their faces are simple but beautiful, the background views or the fight scenes are completely flawless. An amazing art + very good audio so I don't have anything to say about this.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9/10\\n\r\nYep, Fate keeps you captivated for the entire series. Let's see: action, funny moments, romantic scenes, dramatical life stories, heartbreaking feelings, suspense... all checked! Both SN and UBW create a magical world with different types of characters and an unforgettable story. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9/10\\n\r\nI gave it a 9 because I gave SN 8 and Zero 10. UBW is deffinately better than SN but still can't be compared to Fate/Zero which takes the Holy Grail War to a whole new level of awesomeness. This season was more than ok and what can I say, I'm patiently waiting for the second season to come out in April.\\n",

            "content": "With the second cour of Fate/Stay Night Unlimited Blade Works upon us, I thought now to be a good time to reflect on the first half. Note that this review is strictly about the first cour, hence the second season will have no bearing on this review.\r\nFate/Stay Night\u2019s story is centred around Shiro Emiya and Rin Tohsaka, two high school students and participants in the Holy Grail War, a battle-royale for an ancient artefact that can grant any wish. In this war, there are seven teams of mages and servants with their own agendas, abilities and desires. However, the core of the story lies notin the wishes of the masters, but the journey. The story has a variety of twists and turns, and moves along at a relatively slow pace for an action series, but this works in the favour of the battles because when they do occur, they always have purpose. This half is concerned primarily with building up the world and characters, so much of this half is shrouded in mystery, but there is still sufficient intrigue, depth and nuance to make this story riveting, provided the audience is patient. The tone of the series is handled expertly, with the slice-of-life scenes flowing naturally into the more intense, dangerous sequences thanks to sufficient build-up.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters in Fate/Stay Night are some of the most interesting to have come out of the fantasy genre in recent years. Shiro, the protagonist, is displayed as a good-natured, kind and selfless boy on the surface, like many shounen protagonists, though his behaviour effectively to underpin his ideal: only through sacrificing one\u2019s self for others can one attain happiness and meaning. This ideology, heavily inherited from Kiritsugu, his guardian and role-model whom Shiro strides to one day become. These beliefs are juxtaposed by Archer\u2019s highly utilitarian attitude, as he is more interested in long-term victory than short-term casualties. The struggle between Archer and Shiro is perhaps the defining aspect of this series, and is certainly a large part of Rin\u2019s character.\\n\\n\r\nRin is ultimately the most conflicted individual in the series, as she must decide whether she is willing to kill and betray to win the war, like her servant, or whether she should try to win within the parameters of her ethics, like Shiro. Multiple factors play into her decision, as her ancestors would want her to be victorious regardless of the cost, yet she herself has strong morals, having lost her entire family when she was young. Due to the multitude of conflicting values she must choose between, she may come across as inconsistent if her actions are viewed out of context, though her actions are always given sufficient justification to prevent her from seeming schizophrenic. The supporting characters are fantastic, with the elegant Saber, the mysterious Illya and the scheming Caster being the most notable. Though not all the supporting characters are given too much depth in this first half, their mannerisms, voice-performances and character designs give them a strong sense of identity and individuality. Whether it be in a battle or conversation, no characters are interchangeable, and all of them mange to successfully stand out.\\n\\n\\n\r\nAesthetically, Fate/ Stay Night is nearly flawless. The backgrounds are consistently detailed, enriched with gorgeous CGI and lighting. There is considerable diversity in the backgrounds, ranging from cold, dark graveyards to lush forests in the afternoon sun, gives the viewer a sense of scope and time. The character designs by Takashi Takeuchi, as was mentioned earlier, are memorable, unique and varied. The characters\u2019 eyes are particularly noticeable, as they are both beautiful and reflect the character\u2019s nature, be it Kuzuki or Archer\u2019s cold professionalism or Shiro and Rin\u2019s youthful naivety. In a few cases, characters smartly have their eyes concealed, giving them a sense of mystique and grandeur. The strong production values in the characters and backgrounds work well together, complementing one another instead of standing apart, and the choreography gives the viewer a sense of the distance between the characters and their direction. All of these aspects come together effectively in the stunning action sequences, which vary both in terms of colour palette and thematic tone. Episodes 3, 7 and 10 particularly stand out. Some minor artistic chinks exist in the form of the CGI monsters, though one could argue that this gives them an otherworldly presence, much like the demons in the third Berserk Movie.\\n\\n\r\nThe action and world are also well realised in the sound design. Every sword swing, blast of energy or punch carries appropriate weight, without seeming repetitive, melodramatic or inconsequential. From the harsh BOOM of Berserker\u2019s club to the hollow whistle or Lancer\u2019s spear, Ufotable seems to have a vast library of sound effects and the knowledge to masterfully apply them. The soundtrack, unfortunately, isn\u2019t mixed into the world quite as well. The OST itself, composed by Hideyuki Furasawa, sounds fresh and exciting when listened to by itself, reminiscent of some of John William\u2019s work, but is often too quiet, or absent, to be noticeable in the series itself. However, in the fight scenes the soundtrack does manage to reach its potential, and episodes 0, 3, 7 and 10 exemplify this. The voice acting is stellar, with Caster, Illya and Archer in particular delivering scene stealing performances and nearly every other character making the character their own, acting out their roles with familiarity and understanding.\\n\\n\r\nOn the whole, Fate/Stay Night Unlimited Blade Works Season 1 is an outstanding fantasy action series. It has a deliberately paced story that always knows where it wants to go and how to get there and has a striking cast of characters with huge variation and diversity in ideals and behaviour. The visuals are outstanding, assisted by professional choreography and unique designs, in spite of the occasional misstep, and the sound design is just as good, despite a slightly underused soundtrack. This first season is a strong set-up that doesn\u2019t side-line its characters for action or devolve into an aimless high school drama; it establishes a unique tone and pace, and I could not be more excited for the second season.\\n",

I'm sort of a newcomer to the Fate Series and it was just excellent. \r\nUfotable has exceeded all expectation and clearly put a lot of time and effort making the beautiful atmosphere the show creates. No other anime can compare when it comes to animation and artwork. The soundtrack is also amazing, especially the final ending song, \"This Illusion\" Remix by LiSa. The Characters have a great amount of development andyou truly fall in love with them. The story is truly something amazing, I can't really describe it. Overall I think the show is very enjoyable and I would recommend it to anyone! It is probably the best anime of 2014 and anyone can get into it!\\n\\n\r\nIf you enjoyed Fate Zero, definitely watch this. It is the fifth holy grail war and it involves the children of Fate Zero\\n\\n\r\nAnyways as a casual anime viewer, this may not be the most in-depth review but I can tell you that anybody can enjoy this show and it is one of the most mindblowing anime I have ever seen.\\n\\n\r\nJust watch it :) You won't regret it",

Both are good so i advise you to watch both Fate/stay night and Fate/stay night unlimited blade works.  \r\nSo basically, there is a competition between seven mages to get the \"Sant Graal\", a wish maker. It can make every single wish possible. For that, those mages summons seven servants tofight for them. Only one servant and one mage can survive.  The servants are heroes from the past and that's why they are so strong.  \\n\\n\\n\r\nI found this plot very interesting and is development also nice. Although personally fate zero has a better development then this one, but let's just focus on Fate ubw.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is the best thing i've ever saw in anime. The detail in the fights is so deep that make them epic, plus the nice soundtrack makes a really good action and will make you fill hooked for more. \\n\\n\r\nThe character design, to match up with the detail in the action, is also perfect. The glow that the characters have is unique and really nice for our eyes .. just by looking at their eyes we see how well made this anime is. We couldn\u00b4t expect less from Ufotable .. the company responsible for this anime.  \\n\\n\r\nWe have many themes to look at, some are really well explored, others aren\u00b4t so well made but in general, all look great. \\n\\n\r\nWe have everything on this show ... the nice romance that we all love in some way, the action that for it self makes this anime a \"god\" in design and it has nice character develoment. \\n\\n\\n\r\nI recommend this show for everyone .. since it's a piece of art that has to be seen by everyone that calls himself an anime viewer",

            "content": "I've only watched Fate/Zero. It's like super epic and stuff and I've never read Fate/stay Night but this is so boring and the characters aren't nearly as good. I'm going to have to give it a 7 because it sucks oh well back to Fairy Tale.\r\nAre they gone? Ok good.\r\nAs a journeyman of ALL of Type's Moons works, both in their original forms and their respective adaptions, and with clear understanding of all of Fate/Stay Night including Heavens Feel and Angry Manjew, I can tell you with sincerity that this is an excellent adaption. Most of the complaints I've seen just stem from misunderstandings involvingFate's 3 route process; an easily avoidable mistake if you have read the Vn. I understand some people haven't read it and simply don't want to, so I'll break it down. Nice. And. Slow.\\n\\n\\n\r\nFate/stay night is split into 3 routes; Fate, Unlimited Blade Works and Heavens Feel. Each route has it's own entirely different story arc, character focus and development, and lore information. Some characters die almost instantly upon reveal in some routes, and live to the end to be your favorite in another. Each of the routes rely on each other like puzzle pieces to create a coherent world; Reading Heaven's Feel before the previous two is like closing your eyes in a dark room and wondering where your pants are. So here in lies the problem. The biggest challenge to any adaption of Fate/Stay Night is attempting to present all of this information in one or two cours of anime. It's really only conceivably possible to adapt one at a time, bite off more than you can chew and you end up like Studio thereisnotsukihimeanime Deen; Dead, in the gutter, wondering where your pants are.\\n\\n\\n\r\nAs the second route, there is quite a bit of knowledge UBW expects you to already have gained. As a reader, you're already supposed to connect with and understand Saber, because most of her development is primarily in Fate. To someone who's never had that experience, it can seem like UBW is putting a whole lot of stress on a side character for no good reason. Sure you could blame UFOtable for not including all of that info, but as stated above though, it's truly impossible to create one anime for the two routes. If anything, UFOtable did a great job at making this anime accesible by connecting it with Fate/Zero, what with the extra Kiritsugu scenes. If you truly want to point fingers, you're just being a careless audience with no awareness of what you're getting into. If you're a casual watcher, I get that you aren't going to take the time to clue yourself in and that's fine. Enjoy yourself, grab a chair and maybe some lemonade. But if you're attempting to criticize this show for your lack of information you better find your pants sister.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSo how do we adapt this correctly? Well, faithfully, which is almost exaclty what UFOtable has done. Sticking to the books in 99% of scenarios, they chose to preserve every character interaction and even the pacing of the novel itself. Slow dinner conversations were saved and the action of the story doesn't overburden and strain the characters. We don't want to end up like a particular thereisnotsukihimeanime movie, now do we? But it really helps that Unlimited Blade Works is a pretty suitable route to adapt. It isn't as simple and introductory as the first route nor as burden of knowledge as the third. It finds a middle ground between the two, revving up the engines compared to Fate with a more intricate narrative, but still a few knotches down from Heaven's Feel. Unlimited Blade Works logically make the best conclusion to Fate/Zero as a show.\\n\\n\\n\r\nAnd for the content of UBW itself? Well it's really hard to point out its virtues without spoiling and getting to the meat of things, but basically it's one scenario of Shirou's ideals and the path he goes with them. Archer virtually shines throughout the whole route as he becomes a fully fleshed character and single-handedly painstakingly creates many memes even though his hands will never hold anything. This is my personal favorite route for Shirou as well because he sees his ideals out to the very end without abandoning them and it pays off. And well, Rin is great!\\n\\n\\n\r\n If you like Rhinos. \\n\\n\\n\r\nOutstanding production values. In the actions sets, every move is articulated with precision and outstanding visual flare which makes the show very easy to watch. There is no obtrusive flailing but rather high speed true combat. But where the visuals exceed the soundtrack droops. It isn't bad, it's just very meh. Where is Trapped Thoughts? And saving This Illusion until the very end? How distasteful.\\n\\n\\n\r\nWhile it was nice that Fate/Zero was all wrapped in pretty ribbons and crafted to be accessible, it was far from perfect. You kids sure as shit didn't understand what went on inside the grail at the end without reading Heaven's Feel or being informed beforehand. \\n\\n\\n\r\n\"Oh but Ginga, I don't waste my time with dumb visual novels for big dumb nerds unlike myself on this website for ANIME. I want my anime dubbed when I stream it!\"\\n\\n\\n\r\nLearn to read.\\n",

UNLIMITED CIRCLE JERKS.\r\nI know I made this joke already, but I'll be recycling this joke for almost every Type Moon show. Deal with it.\r\nFate/Stay Night Unlimited Blade Works is the less mature, more predictable, less logical, and more easily digestable sequel to the dark and edgy Urobutcherized Fate/Zero. It has changed from the serious \"seinen\" that weall know and love to the battle shounen with fancy visuals that we all know and... kind of like? Not as much as Fate/Zero though!\\n\\n\r\nFate/Stay Night UBW assumes that you have watched Fate/Zero by skipping some of the explanations for major story lines in Fate/Zero, yet also assumes that you haven't touched a type moon work in your life by explaining how fucking classes work. WE ALL KNOW THIS ALREADY! As you can tell, this leads to a thing about the Fate franchise, something that Fate/Stay Night UBW isn't an exception for... WHY IS THE PLOT MOVING SO SLOW?\\n\\n\r\nI'll give credit where it's due though. Fate/Stay Night UBW isn't as slow as the first season of Fate/Zero, but doesn't reach anywhere near the thrilling yet still slow pacing of Fate/Zero 2nd season. Fate/Stay Night UBW gets to the juicy action, the reason why we watch this series in the first place, much quicker than some people think. The action scenes are decently long, but not too long, and the choreography is spot on like always. \\n\\n\r\nDialogue. The main reason for the slow pacing of the Fate franchise. Fate/Zero's 1st season had a lot of dialogue, especially since the masters are all adults and usually work out their plans through shit tons of talking and planning. The masters in Fate/Stay Night UBW are mainly teenagers though, meaning less careful and detailed planning, and more yelling, tsundeRin interactions, even more yelling, monologues, people threatening each other like little children, and quotes. Quotes, my good sir. The archer class is really made up of archers! Stuff like that. Also, half the show takes place in a fucking HIGHSCHOOL! My elitist bloods be boilin!!!\\n\\n\r\nThe story of Fate/Stay Night UBW is cool but... hard to take seriously, unlike Fate/Zero. In Fate/Zero, it's a high octane survival game with a simple mistake leading to an early death. In Fate/Stay Night UBW, people survive due to rule breaking, people get upper hands due to rule breaking, blah blah blah all of the logic in this world is barely followed at all! People get random power boosts, people refuse to kill easily killable opponents due to the power of HUMAN MORALS and PLOT CONVENIENCE! \\n\\n\r\nIn other words, Fate/Stay Night UBW has way too much mercy. Everyone is so merciful, refusing to finish off someone because \"they felt like it!!!!!!\"\\n\\n\r\nSo... why does this show still get a 6/10? Because the action scenes are fucking awesome, and Saber is an adorable little thing. I just wanna take her home! SHE SO CUTE!\\n\\n\r\nTL;DR: \"The Shounen genre is really made up of Shounens!\" - TsundeRin.\\n",

            "content": "To be honest, when I first looked through the list of anime from 2014, I was expecting Fate/stay night to be near the top, if not the run-away favorite for Best Anime from 2014. I mean come on; it\u2019s the not-really-a-sequel to Fate/Zero, one of the greatest anime of all time! It\u2019s going to be just as amazing right!?\r\nWrong. Fate/stay night pretty much took everything that was amazing and a breath of fresh air from Fate/Zero and turned it back into the generic anime tropes you see in basically every show. You remember how in Fate/Zero, all the characters except for one were actually adultsand because of this the tone and setting of the story was very mature, leading to one of the most suspenseful and serious anime you\u2019ll ever see? Well now everyone\u2019s in f*cking high school and 90% of the plot happens in f*cking high school! Remember how in Fate/Zero, each and every character was given equal and significant amounts of screen-time, leading to them all receiving great character development resulting in one of the richest cast you\u2019ll ever find in any fictional work? Well kiss that good bye, since now you\u2019ll spend all your screen-time with Generic Nice Guy Harem Protagonist #347 or with Frustrating Tsundere #288. Because that\u2019s what we all want\u2026right?????\\n\\n\r\nNone of this helped either by the fact that Type-Moon isn\u2019t very original with their character designs. Making Fate/Zero fans say, \u201cHey, this is the same as the last one,\u201d every-time a \u201cnew\u201d character is introduced in the series. (Yes, I know that technically Fate/stay night came out first, but let me have this one joke damn it!)\\n\\n\r\nDespite all these flaws, there is one saving grace to this show that makes its inclusion as one of the Top 10 or so anime of 2014 absolutely necessary. It has quite possibly the best animation you will EVER see in an anime TV series. Everything looks phenomenal in the show, from the set pieces to, backgrounds, character designs, and the action scenes, oh god the action scenes. They\u2019re so incredible and intense that you\u2019ll need a surgeon on hand in order to screw your jaw back into place after watching the fantastic fights in this show. \\n\\n\r\nI also realize that my own personal enjoyment with this series was heavily influenced by comparing it to Fate/Zero the entire time, and for anyone whose crazy enough to have not watched that masterpiece yet, that won\u2019t be a problem at all. The premise to the show is still great, and is good enough to keep you hooked onto the show even through all the High School BS. There are also some really awesome characters to be found in this show as well, mostly on the Servants side of things with Archer being the stand-out so far. Hell, even our female lead, Rin, can be a cool gal whenever she decides to be competent.\\n\\n\r\nMix all this in with an all-star voice-acting cast, an amazing opening, and great OST\u2019s you end up with a really good anime. Does it live up to the reputation of Fate/Zero? No, but practically nothing can. Besides being a pretty good anime with some of the greatest action to ever grace the Silver Screen is a great thing to be on it\u2019s on. Plus, we can always hope that the next season will rectify some of these flaws.\\n",

            "content": "Having watched Fate/Zero (In my top 5 anime) I then watched FSN Unlimited Bladeworks the sequel to it and felt I should do a review having seen both.I am going to be comparing FSN UBW with Fate/Zero to some extent.\r\nStory 9/10 - The story is pretty much the same as Fate/Zero as it revolves around a war over the Holy Grail in Fuyuki city with 7 Masters/Mages summoning a Heroic Spirit to do their bidding, however this time with different Masters and different Heroic Spirits (apart from 2 *wink*). I think this whole concept is brilliant as it allows for there to be many twistsand turns due to the many rules of the Grail War, the fact that some people can break them and how it revolves around seven individuals and only one can win.This brings out the true darkness in some characters and shows how far they are willing to go to win. This is portrayed very well in the series but I feel they should have got more to the point in the first two eps and sometimes there are pointless scenes which do not add to the plot. Also the main characters spend a lot of time in high school but thankfully the show does not revolve too much around school life like every other anime.\\n\\n\r\nArt 11/10  - 2 words. FUCKING AMAZING! Fate/Zero's animation was flawless and FSN UBW takes it up a notch to pretty much perfection. The art of this show really is the main selling point and I would give \u00a3100 to anyone who found a point where the animation was really derpy. The action scenes were so crisp with vibrant colours and silky smooth animation that really was a feast for the eye and I truly found myself immersed in these irresistible fight scenes. The choreography of the fight scenes was also stunning and I often  found myself mesmerised while watching. The art outside the fight scenes keeps the same quality as the environment and characters look flawless. One really nit picky thing is that I find the design of the character's noses kinda weird.\\n\\n\r\nSound 7/10 - In Fate/Zero the sound was so well done with majestic badass choirs singing in the background with the occasional funky rock, whether it be a monologue, inner thought or an intense fight and it emphasised these moments with great effect as it made every action or event done feel like it had some great righteousness to it. The music in FSN UBW is a lot less potent and to be honest it really isn't that noticeable which is a shame. Even the opening and Ending songs aren't memorable and this is a real shame as the music is meant to make the whole occasion feel 'holy' as it is a war for the Holy Grail but this time is doesn't do that but merely just fits in with the scene. There were a few noticeable moments where the music sort of shined (When Archer charges up and fires a powerful arrow) but apart from that it didn't have much affect.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 8/10 - The story focuses around Emiya Shirou and Tohsaka Rin and their servants Saber and Archer. Rin is an experienced mage who has had her abilities passed down her family line. She is strong, capable, calculating and doesn't take any nonsense from anyone which was made clear in the first ep and I liked that. She does become quite shy around around the two males Archer and Shirou which is understandable as Rin is a tsundere towards Shirou as they sorta have a thing going on and Archer is a handsome man (no homo, actually full homo he is hot stuff). Shirou is quite a laid back guy on the other hand and is very selfless and altruistic. He is quite a simple guy and this has some comedic effect as he becomes caught up in the Grail War. He is very altruistic and this makes him weak at times as people take advantage of him. He too is shy around the females he knows for the same reasons as Rin (Saber is hawt). The other Heroic Spirits all have distinct personalities and this creates interesting dialogue between them as they force their ideals on each other as well as opposing Masters. The dialogue is less complex than Fate/Zero's but is always intriguing and captivating adding maturity to the show.\\n\\n\r\nHowever the constant dialogue between Rin and Shirou can become quite stale at times as they talk and then Rin turns into TsunderRIN and Shirou likewise, or Rin has to explain something to him or ask him to express his emotions. This brings me to another point, there has not been enough screen time for the other Masters. What made Fate/Zero so interesting was seeing the story from all sides of the battle and not presenting us with a main character. I don't mind the fact that main characters have been set, but the other masters need more screentime. Also the side characters seemingly have no importance to the plot and are just 'there' for the sake of it.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 10/10 - Despite the negatives I've, I have enjoyed the hell out of this show. The fight scenes, the thought provoking dialogue and whole setup has been very enjoyable to watch and with the stunning animation to top it off it has been a joy to watch and has kept me on the edge of my seat (mostly). I definitely recommend watching this show and I hope season 2 picks up on some of flaws I have mentioned and hopefully this show can top Fate/Zero\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 9/10\\n",

            "content": "I've started watching the fate series since Fate/Zero and so far this has been having pacing issues. So far it seems that nothing has happened except just some character intros and the Main characters investigating other characters. Let's compare this with Fate/Zero where characters already introduced theme selves in 2 episodes and then We get two see how each of them are trying to outdo each other whereas in F/SN we usually see characters doing High School Anime tropes (or just hanging out at shirou's place eating something) for half an episode and the other half sometimes involves fighting.\r\nYes, there are episodes (like 3 outof 8) where the ball gets rolling but then we're always brought to the same stage. Except for episode 1 in fate/zero, every episode was entertaining to some degree; something was always happening whereas in this show the ball rolls but then it reverts back to this. I think these episodes needed to be 45m long because on some episodes hardly anything happens except a clue or something gets found out.\\n\\n\r\nUpdate: Alright guys things are finally picking up at episode 10 this time around. After the creators of the show sprinkled some story and lore here and there throughout the slow pacing of things, things finally are coming around and we are now getting \"dipped\" in story instead of just sprinkles since various character are starting to come into light and giving us a glimpse on how they are (character development outside of \"slice of life\"). I hope this is how it continues now going forward with this series.\\n\\n\r\nUpdate: The Season finally ended so it's time for my thoughts on it. Overall the season was really slow and slowly paced but it had enough to peak my interest and keep me watching it. I didn't like how the season ended in a cliffhanger though, I like to leave with a satisfying feeling instead of the show popping more questions (their other series F/Z didn't do that). Half of the show was slice of life while the other half was the interesting bit. Coming from F/Z and not liking SoL genre (unless its comedy) at all, the show made me cringe a lot in those SoL moments. Sure F/Z had some moments where they had some SoL but when they did it, they did it well and didn't concentrate too much on it.\\n\\n\r\nOverall the show this season wasn't \"IGN 10/10 EPC OMGZ AMAZING\" but it was still really good (maybe to Visual Novel fans it might have been). I look forward to watching the rest of the series. I know they aren't going to change their stance on SoL (its like a cash cow and a lot of anime fans that like it) but the interesting bits are still interesting and make me want to watch the series.",

            "content": "This is a review of Fate/stay night: Unlimited Blade Works. There will be no comparisons made to the visual novel, nor Fate/Zero, and no mentions of any spoilers. \r\n\"An essential aspect to creativity, is not being afraid to fail.\"\r\nStory: 3/10\r\nUnlimited Blade Work has an issue with presenting it's story in a coherent manner. It relies on huge info dumps placed awkwardly throughout the show.  Instead of explaining things naturally, and figuring out certain events as they occur, or through the story. It makes the show seem lazy with it's story telling in that regard. You are constantly being explained things rather than actuallywitnessing them. For example the first double length episode has only one purpose, and that's to explain the show to you. While you can state that getting info dumps are better than not being explained at all and being confused. All you would be doing is comparing two bad examples of storytelling. \\n\\n\r\nSecondly there are largely noticeable pacing issues, and a lot of the time the reason for this is because the story needs to slow down to explain more things to you. One episode you will get a high action fight scene, with fast plot progression. Then the next episode you will be in the main character's house the entire episode forced to watch twenty minutes of talking at a dinner table about why things happened, or what is happening. Due to the poor pacing, many events seem rushed, while character motives seem unrealistic in certain situations. \\n\\n\r\nWhat the show does well if anything. Is that it presents you a story, and finishes it with a conclusive ending. It doesn't go out of it's way to leave room for a possible third or fourth season. However there have been a number of side stories made, for the purpose of a simple cash grab. They don't directly concern the main series.\\n\\n\r\nThe plot also takes place in at least the first season, in what seems to be the required place in anime. A school. Why do things have to happen at school? It doesn't take away from anything, as no time is wasted actually doing normally school things, as it is simply used as a setting. However it gives of a lazy sense of story telling. It's as if the writer didn't know how else the events in the story could have happened while making sense (which a lot of them don't) without having it take place in a school. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 2/10\\n\\n\r\nIf the story already didn't have it's fair share of issues. By fare this show suffers the most with its cast of characters. \\n\\n\r\nThe main character gives off morals you won't be able to relate to. He will be constantly proven wrong with his way of thinking, but simply brush it aside not listening to anyone. For a main character who is supposed to care about others he sure doesn't listen to others in that regard.\\n\\n\r\nThe rest of the cast are used as simple plot devices to help, or stop the main character from victory. You don't ever feel emotion from anyone, as character development is often skipped out on to add more info dumps. You never know what a character will do, because you never really learn how a character feels and acts. That's because characters simply act how the writer wants them to. Often, nothing makes sense and you're left wondering why that character did that. Or how that character knew that. \\n\\n\r\nEven the characters interactions with each other is poorly done. While dialogue happens, nothing is going on around them. They are always just sitting down talking, never doing something while they talk. Dialogue is done in the longest, and most boring way possible and feels like a chore to get through a five minute conversation. Many character sever no purpose as well, and are only there because they were in the original source material.\\n\\n\r\nWhen you have this kind of a cast of characters. Put into a vast story as it presents, it's inevitable that issues will arise.\\n\\n\r\nArt. 7/10\\n\\n\r\nEverything related to art in this show is a bid of a mixed bag, but leaning towards the better end of things.\\n\\n\r\nPositives:\\n\r\n-Fluid and smooth animation allows for kickass looking fights and an overall nice feel.\\n\r\n-Backgrounds are detailed and look damn good.\\n\\n\r\nNegatives:\\n\r\n-Character designs look a little weird. While the art style looks good in all other departments. Something about the look of people mainly the face is a little weird. I know ufotable ca. look better, because they did a better job in early Kara no Kyoukai movies.\\n\r\n-Fight choreography isn't the best, and relies a lot on aesthetics rather than creative fighting.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 3/10\\n\\n\r\nWhile this show doesn't have the worst soundtrack it is rather forgettable. It also often feels misused. There were moments when I was thinking why a certain song was going on, which instantly broke immersion. One of the best songs was a song borrowed from the musically superior Fate/stay night, but with the different singer it still didn't sound as good. Openings and endings were skipped due to them sounding very unoriginal. They basically sounded like any other anime opening made today, which lead to it being forgotten.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 2/10\\n\\n\r\nI did not enjoy watching this show. It's very bad, and gives a forgettable overall experience. By the time this was finishing I was looking forward to the end. I do praise any anime that doesn't resort to fan service. I definitely praise this show for using a very little amount. When a show starts relying on that to get the viewers attention rather than the actual show itself, you know there is a problem. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 3/10\\n\\n\r\nThis show plays it very safe. It could have done many things differently, but it stuck to many anime cliches because \"if it ain't broke, don't fix it\". While that may be true to a certain demographic. There are many people looking for creativity in anime. A story that isn't afraid to do new things and showcase an original, memorable story. Fate/stay night: Unlimited Blade Work is far from that.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "If you\u2019ve been on the internet in the past six months, then you\u2019ve probably heard of the all-consuming hype machine that is Unlimited Blade Works. While Studio Deen produced a movie adaptation of this route in 2010, it was little more than a glorified clip show, leaving fans of the Fate series hungry for something better. Now, the far more competent Ufotable, fresh from the runaway hit Fate/Zero, have seen it fit to create a brand-new adaptation of Fate/Stay Night\u2019s second route, much to the delight of the anime-watching community. Being a natural-born skeptic, I needed to see for myself whether or not their excitementwas warranted. But was it?\\n\\n\r\n\tFor all the hype it got, no. But that doesn\u2019t mean it wasn\u2019t a fun ride anyway.\\n\\n\r\n\tAs our story opens, we are introduced to Shiro Emiya, a talentless mage who attends high school in Fuyuki City, Japan. Inspired by his late mentor and father figure, Kiritsugu Emiya, Shiro has devoted his life to becoming a \u201cHero of Justice\u201d who always puts the needs of others above his own. As such, Shiro is frequently preoccupied helping his classmates with their various problems. However, after witnessing an intense battle outside his school  Shiro is attacked and nearly killed by a spear-wielding man called Lancer. However, on the verge of death, Shirou inadvertently summons a beautiful armor-clad woman called Saber, who pledges to protect and serve him. Without knowing it, Shiro has stumbled into the Fifth Holy Grail War, a brutal fight to the death between seven masters and their seven servants for the Holy Grail, an ancient artifact that will grant a wish to the last master standing. Determined both to become a \u201cHero of Justice\u201d and to stop the Grail from falling into the wrong hands, Shiro agrees to fight with Saber and achieve victory. Over the course of its 25 episodes, Unlimited Blade Works tackles some important questions about morality and the nature of justice: What is justice, anyway? Can one fight solely for justice? Who decides what is just? These questions are explored when Shiro allies with the powerful mage Rin Tosaka and her ill-tempered servant, Archer. Archer, whose past is shrouded in mystery, nevertheless harbors a hatred for Emiya and denounces his ideals as \u201chypocritical nonsense\u201d. The clash between Shiro\u2019s idealism and Archer\u2019s cynicism forms the crux of the show\u2019s plot, especially after Archer\u2019s motivations are revealed.\\n\\n\r\n\tAesthetically, the show is like Christmas for your eyes. Ufotable makes full use of its massive budget, crafting each and every episode into a delicious feast for the eyes. The skill of the animators is most apparent in the gloriously animated fight scenes, where the fluid motions and flashy attacks will leave viewers mesmerized. The fights between the servants are particularly strong, with each servant\u2019s special ability having its own unique look and feel. The vibrant, colorful backgrounds and detailed character designs are only icing on the cake. The soundtrack is equally breathtaking, with the tracks \u201cThe Illusion\u201d and \u201cEMIYA\u201d being particular standouts.\\n\\n\r\n\tThe strength of the Fate series has always been in its characters, which is why Unlimited Blade Works is such a disappointment in that regard. While there are well over a dozen major characters, Shiro, Rin, and Archer monopolize the screen time. Did you want to learn about Saber\u2019s motivations? Screw you! Go watch Fate/Zero, loser. Many of the characters have vast amounts of wasted potential, to the point where some of them may as well have \u201cCannon Fodder\u201d printed across their foreheads. The show is especially bad about this with its antagonists, who, with the exception of the pretty but psychotic Caster, are one-note and exist only to show how much better Shiro, Rin, Archer, and/or Saber are. The most prominent example is grade-A douchebag Shinji \u201cMcRapey\u201d Matou, who is a jerk for no apparent reason. The final enemy, especially, feels like he is only there so that Shiro has someone to fight. However, the characters that do get actual development are almost frighteningly real. Shiro, due to his dreams of becoming a hero, at first demonstrates a constant disregard for his own safety. Examples of this include nearly sacrificing himself for someone who had tried to kill him days before and challenging opponents who are infinitely stronger than him. However, as the series continues and Shiro\u2019s ideals are challenged, he slowly matures, learning to reconcile his ideals with the harsh nature of reality. Rin\u2019s servant, the bitter, cynical Archer, holds a deep-seated irrational hatred for Shiro that is not explained until late in the series. When you do learn Archer\u2019s backstory, however, it is genuinely heartbreaking as well as one of the show\u2019s most powerful episodes. The final main character, Rin Tosaka, acts as both Shiro\u2019s love interest and guide to this new world he\u2019s been tossed into. The scion of one of the world\u2019s greatest mage families, Rin fights to bring glory to her family. Rin\u2019s often ruthless pragmatism is often at odds with Shiro\u2019s desire for justice, but the two balance each other well and are a surprisingly effective team in battle.\\n\\n\r\n\tWhile I have praised this show quite a bit, the cracks begin to show where plot is concerned. The pacing, for lack of a better word, is atrocious. In the first eleven episodes of the series, nearly nothing happens, with the various masters alternately sparring and trash-talking each other. During this time, the plot often has a penchant for putting its leads in unescapable situations, only for their enemies to let them live for no discernible reason. Fortunately, the show picks up in its second half, with every episode bringing a new plot development which the characters are forced to adapt to. These episodes are filled with betrayal, bloodshed, and heart-pounding action, peaking with the culmination of Shiro\u2019s emotional journey in episode 21, when he finally confronts and comes to terms with his inner demons. While the final battle is interesting to watch, it never comes close the matching the raw power of Shiro\u2019s personal climax. The second half capitalizes on the show\u2019s inherently high-stakes premise, and giving the feeling that any of these characters could be the next to die.\\n\\n\r\nConclusion: Despite the lackluster beginning and poorly developed secondary characters, Ufotable has created a slick, emotionally charged product with mesmerizing artwork and truly inspired fight scenes. If you were expecting the next Fate/Zero, you\u2019ll be disappointed, but Unlimited Blade Works is a strong anime in its own right.\\n",

The first couple of episodes paint a very attractive picture of this fantasy world where heroes and mages exist and battle each other, but you never get toreally see much of it. I think this anime would benefit a lot from exploring the origins of the Holy Grail War and its heroes (and yes, I know there's a prequel, but I think it was necessary here in Fate/Stay Night: UBW).\\n\\n\r\nAlthough I did get hooked and ended up watching the whole first season in a week, I can't say this anime made me feel anything. So, I can't really recommend it. Watch it if you have the time and don't want to seem uninformed in front of your otaku friends. And hey, if you happen to love this genre, then by all means go ahead and watch it! But beware that Fate/Stay Night: UBW (at least its first season) is not worth the hype.",

Although I have not read the Fate Novel series, this series falls flat. \r\nAlthough the art is beautiful, it is just skin deep. \r\nThe story is also quite slow and has no real motivation or build. This stems from the fact that the characters are teenage and are being slightly manipulated. \r\nThe main struggle shown throughout this season and the second is shirou emiya and his ideals, specifically a hero of justice. \r\nSpoiler/ He has no zerocharacter development and does not change his ways after seeing the flaws in his thinking, and this arc becomes pointless/Spoiler \\n\\n\r\nThe sound is good and allows for an intense sequence, but the fighting sequences do not have as much weight and there is not a real sense of danger. The masters and servants seem to change places every episode so the possible attachment to each is very lacking. \\n\\n\r\nThe character are also rather two dimensional and easy to figure out. I wish that more time was dedicated to Rin, and that archer's arc actually produced some change. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, this show was severely lacking compared to its predecessor fate zero. The lighter tone, younger age, and less changed subject matter may be factors in this lower quality. As beautiful as the show appears, it is not much more than eye-candy. \\n\\n",

            "content": "A short review; this is more of an overall impression instead of detailed response. And some ranting. Most of you are gonna hate this review, because I'm not going to say anything about the standard positive point of this anime (such as the animation, drawing, bla bla bla you guys know it already). Instead I will nitpick about the small things.\r\ntl:dr: Excellent animation, excellent source material, not-so-great director.\r\nLong version:\r\nThis is the adaptation of my number 1 favorite VN Fate Stay Night. Considering the job ufotable did in FZ, I had some real big expectation. \r\nAnd indeed, I was disappointed.\r\nDisregarding the wonderful job the Art Directorand Animator has done, I cannot, in good faith, say that the Main Director has done a good job adapting it. One of the subtle but most persistent problem is the pacing of this anime. The scene transitions isnt exactly smooth, and when that adds up, you felt it and mood whiplash ensues. It's a small enough problem that you can ignore it, but it still be itchy.\\n\\n\r\nAmong the things that I am royally pissed off at the director besides the pacing being all over the place is that many, many, MANY in universe detail about Servants battle system and ability being wrong.\\n\\n\r\nI'm still fucking pissed of how they change the battle details with Berserker's invulnerability and Mad Enhancement. Fuck that part. Fuck the director. There are lots of other stuff I can nitpick about: having a dragonworm instead of a dickworm like in Zero, Assassin unleashing complete and perfect Tsubamegaeshi and yet Saber is still alive, Gae Bolg being laser lance instead of bending lance, or Caster capable of bending spcae in a Reality Marble-like. Most people would let it slide due to Rule of Cool. Not me. I know how the system works. And I fucking hate it when the system is all wrong.\\n\\n\r\nOther than those in universe detail though, the animation staff adapted this Up to Eleven, and even more. The big things like frame-to-frame animation and drawing quality is excellent, but that's the given ones for ufotable. So story source and animation is not debatable anymore. The ones that really shines for me for this adaptation is the little things they added.\\n\\n\r\nAmong those are: People actually doing something in the background, passing scene of residual damage after battle, character actually shown wearing a different clothes. \\n\\n\r\nWith different location used, the changes were also obviously done with meticulous detail: Stuffs like road's crack or existing power pole or letter box in background location, the varieties of furnitures in different location, using different places with completely different background and location drawings for different scenes instead of reusing them. \\n\\n\r\nAlso, many subtle things like character spot of light moments, subtle shift in atmosphere followed with expression changes, and camera preposition and position changes; Christ, all that takes a lot of work and patience.\\n\\n\r\nThe nitpicky stuffs really, really turns me off at the beginning I even stopped watching the TV release and wait for BD instead. But those good little things adds up. It keeps the watching experience fresh and keep the atmosphere's beat.\\n\\n\r\nAnd of course, their biggest accomplishment: unlike stupid DEEN, they managed to show that Shirou is NOT a white knight faggot, but a kid with a totally fucked up issue in his head.\\n\\n\r\nDo keep in mind that I (subjectively and effectively) still dont like the director's overall works for the pacing and the little changes he made. Those are unnecessary, making it worse overall, and create inconsistencies. Those are small things, but like the above GOOD small thins, the ugliness adds up and turns me off. Those maybe small matters for some people, but for me they're serious businesses.\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion: I cannot, once again, in good faith call FSN UBW 2014 an above average adaptation. The animation and art+drawing is top notch, but the same cannot be applied to the storytelling and pacing. The animation staff is this anime saving grace, practically the only ones who contributes good and positive points to this anime.\\n\\n\r\nI dont know if it is all the fault of the Main Director, but until I know for sure otherwise, I am holding Miura Takahiro responsible. Fuck you, sir.\\n\\n\r\nFinal Score: 7/10.",

            "content": "Note: This review will cover both seasons. tl;dr at the bottom.\r\nThe word \"hype\" is very interesting. When a new movie, book, videogame or (in our case) anime is announced, \"hype\" will show his ugly face sooner or later. Maybe \"hype\" shows up because of who is making the piece, or maybe because is an adaptation and the fanboys don't seem able to keep their mouths shut. \"Hype\" is usually very dangerous, specially within the anime community, because there's a high chance that a series or movie won't live up to it. It is also true, however, that unless you live under a rock or inyour mom's basement (mostly the case) you cannot escape from \"hype\" and it will eventually catch you. Finally, when you sit to watch the hyped anime you have a mix of both entusiasm (due to the hype) but also ... scepticism (because you don't want to be let down).  F/SN: UBW is a perfect example of how \"hype\" can pump up an anime to a ridiculous extreme (just so I can appear and make it look like shit)\\n\\n\r\nPRODUCTION VALUE\\n\r\nThe animation is, lacking a better word, amazing. Ufotable are famous for having fluid movement (you know what I mean), great visual effects, and an astonishing use of lights. They have both the money and the talent to make these kind of projects.\\n\r\nThe background art is wonderful. The church, the park, the school, even Fuyuki's City itself is done amazingly with a dark color palette that creates a fabulous contrast with not only the beautiful lights, but also with the characters, who are made with a shiny and clean color palette.\\n\r\nLet me tell you that I am no fan of CG (as I am a pure elitist, thus I don't like computer graphics mixed with chinese cartoons), in this case however, you can tell is high quality, and the anime doesn't abuse the use of it, so I have nothing to complain about.\\n\r\nIn the artistic department the anime feels lackluster. I already said it is perfectly done, but it surely lacks its own style. And this is obvious, specially with the characters desings which (although amazingly done) have nothing special going for them. This has to do with the kind of series that F/SN: UBW is (and for who it is aimed to). It is nothing experimental or that tries to be deeply artistic (obviously).\\n\\n\r\nThe OST isokay, but is surely nothing out of the ordinary. Compared with other Ufotable's OST this one feels kinda poor. The sincronization between animation and music is not spectacular (this is a directing regarding issue), it is okay but surely nothing above average. The sound is naturally clean and very kind to the ears. As for the voice acting it is good, I do not have much to say about it.\\n\\n\r\nSTORY\\n\r\nThe serie's story is decent. Truth be told, it pretends to be an epic masterpiece about a psychological thriller, full of suffering and big fights ... when it is just a pretty generic harem that happens to have fights because Ufotable can pay for them, and to have more teenage boys interested in the product. It is not as serious, nor as mature, nor as deep, as the fans claim it to be. The drama feels forced and in the endwhat really matters is the relationship between Rin and Shirou, which a big let down when compared to everything that was going around them and that was much more interesting than the series' main couple.\\n\r\nThe anime uses too much otaku pandering (high schools, archetype female characters, videogames therminology, harem with forced romance, and a really beta main character). This affects the pacing terribly and fills the screen with unnecesary, boring and cringeworthy situations (a picnic day, an eroge moment, bland comedy, etc). Add to that a nice amount of plotholes and an obscene use of plot armor, and the whole thing starts crumbling apart.\\n\r\nOn the bright side though, the idea of a death tournament between wizards with transdimensional heroes, videogame references and superpowers, is very attractive, and it is potentially great if you have epic battle scenes and charismatic characters. When it wants, the series moves with an spectacular pacing, and it hooks you with well-thought mysteries and high budget, well coreographed (is that a word?) fights.Some of the twists were really nailed and others felt more like asspulls.\\n\r\nI think that the series main problem was its superficil nature. It was built on action scenes and certain plot twists, which in the end turned out to be a dull base to create a deep and complex plot.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS\\n\r\nHereis where the series falls flat on its face. Let's start with the positive. Archer is actually a good character. He has a well-rounded personality, charisma, clear motivations justified by a well thought backdrop (although full of plotholes), and throughout the anime he has a well done and satifactory development (even if he has some seriously retarded moments).\\n\r\nSaber is not a bad character, but he is horribly basic, and in any other series she would be overshadowed by the rest of the cast. This is not the case because the other characters are dull and boring (which lifts her charisma). Unless you have already played the VNs or have seen related anime, her backdrop is non existant, therefore her motivations are empty and are (in fact) impossible to understand. This is a flaw because F/SN: UBW is a story on itself, and shouldn't depend on other works to be completely enjoyable. Her development also feels lackluster, un less again that you know about the franchise as a whole. However Saber is still an okay character. She has her own little charisma, and for some reason everyone wants her as waifu.\\n\r\nThe main couple is the series' major flaw, and the main reason why I didn't enjoy the anime much. If you are having a romantic relationship taking all the space in the show, you should have a couple with an interesting dynamic (and this is not the case).\\n\r\nShirou is a well-thought character, but he is handled poorly. He is a teenage boy with magic powers that wants everyone to be happy, and to destroy the evil that is the Holy Grail. However, as the plot advances, he doesn't become stronger and he survives because plot conveniences or shonen-power-up. He also lacks any development, and is always the same weakling moralfag that I totally hate.\\n\r\nRin is an awful character, and everything about her is done wrong. Her personality is non-existant, as she constantly changes her attitude because plot conveniences; one episode she acts a way, and the next one she acts another way. Her motivations are plain stupid (seriously, wtf?), the backdrop is basic and there's no development. She is the perfect example of a cardboard character that the script-writer uses as he wishes.\\n\\n\r\nCONCLUSION\\n\r\nSo, what's my own shitty opinion on F/SN UBW? As far as entertainment goes, the series delivers, and it delivers well ... for the most part. Without a doubt tghe combination of spectacular fight scenes and a plot full of twists hooks the viewer and drive him through very fun 25 episodes. However, it is still a harem, and it lacks any actual content (or even charismatic characters). Overall it feels lackluster and it surely doesn't come out as great as you would believe in the beginning. Besides the animation, I wouldn't say that everything else is above average.\\n\\n\r\nTL;DR\\n\r\n+Spectacular animation and visual effects\\n\r\n+Great background art\\n\r\n+Okay OST\\n\r\n+Great premise\\n\r\n+Some really neat plot twists\\n\r\n+Amazing fight scenes\\n\r\n+Archer's character\\n\r\n+Nice execution, most of the time\\n\\n\r\n-Some twists felt more like asspulls\\n\r\n-Plot armor over 9000\\n\r\n-An obscene amount of plotholes\\n\r\n-Otaku pandering\\n\r\n-Sometimes the pacing is horrible\\n\r\n-The romance/harem aspect is terribly handled\\n\r\n-Most characters are dull and forgettable\\n\\n\r\nReccomended for people who enjoy shonen action and harem, and don't mind trainwreck plots and bland casts.",

But short of butchering the story and character, I am not sure what to say about it. I have heard from Fate fans that Stay Night is better than Zero, mostly shallow and downright stupid comments like how Shirou was able to realize what is right and wrong from the beginning, the portrayal of conflict was the center interest, and not what the viewer think of it as right and wrong, with wrong being that it somehow bad. \r\nEnough of F/Z,moving on to this show. It tried to be deep and clever and drown everything in monotonous monologs of Shirou and just barely keeps your attention with flashy fight scene and soundtracks. Some of the characters are heavily underdeveloped as compared to the anime predecessor despite having lesser characters to work with. Nothing much was done with Saber, she walks around for a little while and then goes away. Rin just, she's like a three-dimensional tsundere, she wants to kill Shirou but not want to kill him because of extremely undeveloped reason, then becomes attracted to him.\\n\\n\r\nShirou is a goody two shoes but is secretly edgy because he has altruism, which comes to a point of contention later but is so absurd in its development as he thinks what he do isn't right because while he is stopping evil, he is doing evil even though by stopping evil he technically just stopped evil so..??? He was five years old when the event happened so how could he have possibly even comprehend what he could have done for others or even feel bad that he had survived when others didn't? He is also lacking personality, it seems to be that his whole character just encompasses of him being altruistic and bland. \\n\\n\r\nPlot isn't as deceptive as Fate Zero is, nor is it straightforward. So, somehow it just revolves around Shirou than a Battle Royale and somehow fails to develop him to a satisfying level. \\n\\n\r\nOverall. It wasn't something that was extremely bad but it sure as hell did not live up to the shit that everyone was hyping up. Also, the VN? Don't even try it. It's boring as hell.",

With the stunning yet beautiful animation, smooth battle transition, wonderful background in every scene make me willing to watch the remake version of Fate/Stay Night.\r\nThe character's design is really smooth, I really love the character hair when the wind plays their hair, it is really soothing my mind. lol\r\nI enjoy the series, even though it just aired in 12 episodes, but there is the cour two, in recent season. I hope itis spring.\\n\\n\r\nIn the end, if you like Fate/Stay series, and have a lot of free time, or need to spoil your eyes with beautiful Saber, Rin Tohsaka, then you should watch this series.",

            "content": "I would like to preface this review by saying that this show (and prologue) was the entry point for me into the Fate series. I had not seen anything else (including Fate/Zero) before this show. As such, my point of view is that of a newcomer into the series.\r\nSTORY: 5\r\nThe story of this show seems to be focused around building up fight scenes to show off the animation. My main gripe with this is that this show spends so much time repeating the same main ideas over and over again. How many flashbacks does Shiro really need of the fire? How many times must Rinwaver between wanting to kill or help Shiro? The fights are also extremely repetitive, as Rin and Shiro don't have that many abilities to show off. Although the servants themselves have some pretty interesting abilities, it is hard to care about the fights when the backstories of the characters are never fully fleshed out. It oftentimes just feels like fighting for the sake of fighting.\\n\\n\r\nI also had the issue of never seeing another Fate entry beforehand. I was watching with someone who had, and I needed to keep asking questions to clarify certain plot points, most of which came with the answer \"oh they tell you in another route.\" It's pretty hard to understand the mechanics of the world with this entry alone, making it seem very contrived without any supplementary information.\\n\\n\r\nART: 9\\n\r\nThe main appeal of this series is definitely the art. While other scenes are mostly plain, you can tell they really put work into making the fight scenes look good. The animation is overall a high point of this series. I also enjoyed most of the character designs. They were all pretty unique and easily distinguishable.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND: 8\\n\r\nThe sound didn't really have anything stand-out about it, but it didn't detract from my experience, either. The seiyuus seemed to fit their characters well enough, and the music was well placed.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER: 4\\n\r\nSimilarly to the story, the characters were another dire issue with this anime. Shiro, our protagonist, is very one-dimensional. The only thing he seems to have going for him is the repetitive \"these are my ideals\" shtick, which gets old really quickly. They seem to think having this one facet makes him \"deep,\" but really it just makes him unbearable to listen to.\\n\\n\r\nSaber suffers from a problem I like to call \"no-personality syndrome.\" She is easily the blandest character in this show and I felt absolutely no attachment to her. She only seemed to be there as a plot device for Shiro to use to save his ass. We never really get any backstory for Saber and her dialogue is as bland as it comes.\\n\\n\r\nRin is a character I actually quite enjoyed, and it's a shame she wasn't the main character, as I find her infinitely more interesting than Shiro. She actually has a personality, and her dynamic with Archer is really enjoyable.\\n\\n\r\nArcher is also more fleshed out and intriguing, unlike Saber and Shiro. The questions his character raises are interesting and I actually wondered a lot about his character. The scenes focusing on him and Rin are some of the highlights of the show.\\n\\n\r\nAside from the bland protagonists, this show also suffers from pretty much forgetting to develop most of the other side characters. Sakura and Taiga become less and less relevant each episode. Shinji feels like the most \"evil and annoying for the sake of it\" character to exist. The other servants and masters are almost barely touched on at all. It all feels really rushed and I would have been much more engaged if the side characters were more fleshed out. \\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT: 3\\n\r\nPersonally, I found this series very hard to stomach. Between the bland main characters and lack of any real plot, I was frequently bored to tears. This might have been higher if I was the type to enjoy fight scenes just for being fight scenes, but they didn't feel like they had any strategy or reason. I just couldn't get into this show.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL / TL;DR: 5\\n\r\nFrom everything I heard about this series, I had pretty high hopes for this anime. But ultimately, the characters and story really made it hard to invest in it. I would recommend this show to anyone that enjoys well-animated fight scenes, but for the actual plot, I find it hard to praise. It isn't the worst show I've ever seen, but it was pretty mediocre-- the epitome of a 5.",

            "content": "\"Fighting for others, but not yourself, is nothing but hypocrisy.\"\r\nI could only start by saying this anime is an masterpiece, you'll know all about it throughout this humble review I'm doing as your regular every day anime fan.\r\nStory: 8 (Very Good).\r\nSimple as that, the story in general was amazing. However, I seemed to feel confused to be honest in the beginning to pull off the 3 or 4 episode seemed to be something hard as it was brain teasing and confusing and I haven't watched any of the previous series or adaptations or even read the manga so I was absolutely confused and Ihad felt I was an Arab invited to a Chinese wedding (No racism intended.) furthermore I had to think and think of what the story could possibly be and waiting from week to week I was still interested in knowing what would happen and I suddenly knew everything at once !! Then I realized I fell in love and point of the anime was to think and expect unexpected stuff.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 10 (Outstanding)\\n\\n\r\nThe art added to battles is beyond description, the battles are very well detailed everything in the anime was drawn to a crisp and had amazing touch into it. I mean like even the eyes of the characters had a stories in them !! That's about it, describing it is way out of description you should watch it yourself.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8(Very good)\\n\\n\r\nThe opening wasn't the best but wasn't bad either ... The music added really created moods and was sometimes playing a role in delivering feelings straight to the heart but the soundtracks seemed to be to repeatable and didn't have 1 precise meaning and that's what i didn't like.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 7(Good)\\n\\n\r\nNothing too special about the characters, the hero seems to be like any other anime hero very expected (SO FAR) like a kid wants to be an hero and works hard and he has to tackle his fears and basically \"starting from the bottom and now we here\" ... But besides that characters were well expressed and many characters that were focused on seemed to vanish tho but the intensity of the story just removed your desire to know more about them.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9(Great!)\\n\\n\r\nI personally enjoyed the anime, despite me being lost in the first few episodes but it's rather an exciting anime with amazing stuff to happen and sometimes I would just pause for a second to get deep in thought on what could possibly be next ! \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9(Great)\\n\\n\r\nIt's an very well produced anime with great content and it represents many nice people who priotorize others lives than their own ... It had touched me so hard to be honest I was very very touched ... IT'S AN MASTERPIECE.",

            "content": "This is a 2-in-1 review for both season 1 and 2.\r\nAfter the big fire that caused major destruction in Fuyuki City 10 years ago, it's time for the Fifth Holy Grail War.\r\nThe Holy Grail War is a battle royale among seven magi who serve as Masters. Masters, through the use of the command seals they are given when they enter the war, command Heroic Spirits known as Servants to fight for them in battle. In the Fifth Holy Grail War, Rin Tohsaka is among the magi entering the competition. With her Servant, Archer, she hopes to obtain the ultimate prize\u2014the Holy Grail, a magical artifactcapable of granting its wielder any wish.\\n\\n\r\nOne of Rin's classmates, Emiya Shirou, accidentally enters the competition and ends up commanding a Servant of his own known as Saber. As they find themselves facing mutual enemies, Rin and Shirou decide to form a temporary alliance as they challenge their opponents in the Holy Grail War. \\n\\n\r\n-\\n\\n\r\nThe Fate/Stay Night series split into three routes. \\n\\n\r\nEach route features a different heroine/main female character and with Fate/Stay Night previously being an eroge visual novel game, Shirou the male lead ends up with the female lead at the end. Obviously, they can't add in the famous sex scenes in the Visual Novel into the anime as that would make it a hentai but fret not, Unlimited Blade Works features the best female lead and my number 1 waifu, Rin Tohsaka.\\n\\n\r\nUnlimited Blade Works contains alot of fan service for us viewers and even if it didn't, Rin's thighs would surely suffice.\\n\\n\r\nAnyways, this particular route focuses mainly on Shirou and the Archer servant whom coincidentally is Rin's servant.\\n\\n\r\nRin was just there for fan service is what many may think but she plays a big part in Shirou's development.\\n\\n\r\nUnlimited Blade Works actually in its essence is actually just the main character following his self-proclaimed ideals\\n\\n\r\n-\\n\\n\r\nIt's what I'd call the generic anime relationship with a very miniscule twist. \\n\\n\\n\r\nThe relationship between the aforementioned smoking hot mage Rin Tohsaka and the half-baked mage Emiya Shirou.\\n\\n\r\nShirou is your typical dense anime main while Rin is the hot female senpai that everyone wants. \\n\\n\r\nBecause of that, it's pretty safe to assume Unlimited Blade Works is the more casual side of Fate/Stay Night with Unlimited Blade Works leaning towards character introduction more.\\n\\n\r\nUnlimited Blade Works includes a perfect blend of action, slice of life, comedy, relationship struggles, tsundere (yea i love Rin) and introduction.\\n\\n\r\nIt is the more casual route that more or less just introduces the personality of all the other characters in the series to prepare viewers to the real deal which is Fate/Stay Night Heaven's Feel.\\n\\n\r\nSince this was the TV remake of the UBW movie in 2006 it is better in almost every aspect. Don't get me wrong, the DEEN studios adaptation made in 2006 was great but during its time.\\n\\n\r\nYou can't expect the 2006 movie to beat a 2014 remake right?\\n\\n\r\nSo ufotable, the studio that made this remake and will be making subsequent Fate/Stay Night adaptations did a fantastic job.\\n\\n\r\nufotable is becoming known for its beautiful artwork and overwhelmingly well animated fight scenes with great creativity and craft. The fight scenes are set in really fast paced situations but displayed in a manner easy to follow with timely after effects of attacks that lead to a mass explosion of colours bursting with vivid expression.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter designs are very well drawn with a huge improvement compared to the DEEN adaptation and with the same design as the prequel, Fate/Zero.\\n\\n\r\nufotable actually beat many 2018 anime after rewatching Unlimted Blade Works in 2018, I still cannot believe Fate/Stay Night UBW is a 2014 anime to be honest, ufotable sugei na\\n\\n\r\n-\\n\\n\r\nThe OP and ED were also very good featuring popular J-Pop artiste like LiSA and Aimer. You just can't go wrong.\\n\\n\r\n-\\n\\n\r\nEvery character, servant and master have their own backstory and ideals and are all fighting for the Holy Grail.\\n\\n\r\nLike I said, this is just the 'introduction'. Neither Saber nor Rin actually make the real shit happen in Fate/Stay Night. \\n\\n\r\nThe third route is where everything fucked up happens, where the most subtle female lead comes.\\n\\n\r\nWatching this is important as you are expected to know deeply what the Holy Grail War is about before watching Heaven's Feel\\n\\n\r\nbut I'm also pretty sure most will get hooked by this nonetheless be it by the captivating characters, the many ploys and strategies, the animation or Rin's smoking hot body\\n\\n\r\nso, I highly recommend everyone to watch it, otherwise don't bother watching Heaven's Feel.\\n\\n\r\nEvery route is set in a different genre and I love Unlimited Blade Work's slice of life action filled genre\\n\\n\r\n-\\n\\n\r\nThis is only the beginning",

            "content": "Unlimited Blade Works faces the awkward fact of being made in the wake of Fate/Zero, a tightly told, mature story with great action. It mainly differs in that, instead of constant planning, there is a slice-of-life-school storyline, but more than that\u2026\r\nThe biggest difference is without a doubt the biggest blow.\r\nShirou.\r\nWe follow around a single protagonist, a weak novice mage who accidentally gets puled into the Grail Wars. It\u2019s a fairly typical start for a show with a complex world, allowing lots of explanations for both the viewer and the characters without reducing them to idiots. Unfortunately, this bozo is an idiot anyway.\r\nIt\u2019s through him thatthis show bares its ugly teeth. It\u2019s a power fantasy harem with a powerless, weakly characterised fool that can be self-inserted easily, because without that self-insertion, there is very little to go on.\\n\\n\r\nGirls throw themselves at him without reason as he twirls around his harem on his fingers. I genuinely can\u2019t see why they do this - his edginess is painful, he\u2019s standoffish and blunt with his words, he has the inability to listen to anything Rin says and he has the most childish ideals. To top it all off he is constantly, and amusingly, enforcing his sexist beliefs on the female characters who are unimaginably stronger than he is, despite showing him multiple times as such - though, I really must commend the strength of his plot armour, allowing him to dodge unavoidable deaths at least three times. His design even reeks of such, with obnoxiously sharp eyebrows and buzzy red hair that wouldn\u2019t be out of place in Yu-Gi-Oh!\\n\\n\r\nThere\u2019s supposedly a romance going on throughout this series, but it\u2019s hard to believe anything. Shirou has no chemistry with standing idly let alone any other characters let alone his love interest and ally in the Holy Grail War, Rin.\\n\\n\r\nRin is an okay character. Undeniably a tsundere and despite following a few tropes too many, she\u2019s okay. She\u2019s a powerful mage with a lot of independence. Supposedly, she is the strategist, but Shirou has the inability to take in any of these ideas and ruins them. She has great chemistry with her servant, Archer, and her forcefulness and pushiness actually makes for some hilarious moments. Her face is truly expressive, with a door being closed on her at one point genuinely making me laugh in this show that begs to be dark.\\n\\n\r\nExpect to see ribs protruding from chests, limbs cut to pieces and impaling\u2019s beyond niceties. Much like Zero, Unlimited Blade Works doesn\u2019t pull its punches. Alongside its bleak colour scheme and shots of nightfall, Blade Works desperately wants to be taken seriously. But then it shows its schoolboy harem with comic side-characters that fall-flat, there\u2019s a loli commanding a giant from time-to-time and one servant is killed in a bath of BDSM-ish chains. There\u2019s a very specific audience for this show, to say the least of its inconsistencies in tone and pacing.\\n\\n\r\nAside from all this, I can say for certain that Unlimited Blade Works is a thing of production beauty; an epic soundtrack, industry-leading animation and great sound-editing go into making the expertly choreographed fight-scenes a joy to behold. That and a story that promises some interest, is enough to just about get through this weak season. It\u2019s going to be hard to save Shirou unless he does actually finally (hopefully) die and we continue to follow Rin like in the prologue, but I pray that the second half has some more intrigue, and hopefully explores the depth of Archer\u2019s character and we find out about the other masters.\\n\\n\\n\\n",

I might as well spoil you guys the series in my review.\r\n(I'm joking... I'm not going to include spoilers)\r\nStory: (8/10)\r\nThe show is set in Fyuuki City where the 5th Holy Grail War is taking place. 7 masters are randomly picked and they summon a being called a \"Servant\". Servants are real life heroes from the past turned into a heroic spirit. They are summoned to serve their master. 7 masters and 7 servantsfight against each other to claim the ownership of the Holy Grail which can grant any wish that the master and a servant want. \\n\r\nFate/stay night is based on a visual novel video game where the player must decide how the story will go. Fate/stay night has 3 paths. The 1st path is Fate, the 2nd path is Unlimited Blade Works and the 3rd path is Heaven's feel. The show is now focused on the 2nd path, hence the title of the show.\\n\r\nBy the time I am writing this review, I have only watched the first season. So far, most of the story told are already familiar to me because I watched FSN (2006) and UBW (Movie) but the story so far is definitely a lot better than FSN(2006). There is still some surprises in the show but most of them got spoiled because I watched the movie. I shouldn't have watched that movie. If you only watched FSN(2006) then you should already be familiar with the early parts of the season. If you have not watched any of the Fate/series then I recommend to not watch this series first because some of the important scenes that was shown in FSN(2006) will be skipped.\\n\r\nThe story pacing is slow so it takes time to explain what's going on. However, some of the scenes were either rushed or skipped because the creators are assuming that you have already watched FSN(2006).\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt/Animation: (10/10)\\n\r\nThe Animation is outstanding. I mean, just look at the roads, dirt, buildings and the environment. They looked almost real. I proceeded to watched the first episode again on my 55 inch 1080p TV just to see if it would look more better and it did, no surprise there. The character designs are also outstanding. Way better than the UBW's(Movie) character design. I'm just glad that ufotable did the animation. If deen were to animate the show like they did with Fate/stay night(2006) and Unlimited Blade Works (Movie) then it would look like an abomination that needs to be burnt down to the ground. \\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound: (9/10)\\n\r\nThe soundtrack used are wonderful. Most of the battle themes I heard gave me a few goosebumps and it fitted well with the fighting scenes. The voice actors are ok but I would have preferred an English Dub. There is only 1 OP and ED soundtrack. Both of them are amazing and it's the second time I didn't skip the Opening ever since watching FSN(2006). \\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: (9/10)\\n\r\nI see some people complaining that Unlimited Blade Works had a poor character development. While I do agree with that statement, let me tell you the reason why. This is the second path in the fate series.  The creators assumed that you have already watched Fate/stay night (2006) so they don't need to focus and develop the characters all over again. The show is basically the same as the first series except this is the 2nd path in the fate series. Don't blame the creators that the show did not get a proper character development. It's basically your fault for watching the UBW series first before Fate/stay night (2006). \\n\r\nNow to review the characters. Shiroe, the main protagonist of the show, pissed the living hell out of me in Fate/stay night(2006) because of how stupid he is and how he takes on the servants just because \"it's for the best\". I literally wanted to punch him in the face every time he makes a stupid decision. In this show however, Shiroe is a lot smarter, not mentally challenged, still makes some few stupid decisions and a lot better compared to FSN(2006). Rin, the main character of the show and the show's main focus, is also a lot better than the 2006 version. They made her into a tsundere which is one of the personalities that I love. Basically, she's the same except they added in a tsundere. Saber, one of the main characters of the show and Shiroe's servant, is also a lot better here. I didn't like Saber in the 1st path because she became a \"lovey dovey\" for Shiroe which did not fit her character. I prefer her cold character with some nice personality. Saber is also a lot cuter here compared to the 2006 version.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: (10/10)\\n\r\nI thought this show would also suck ass because of how bad the 2006 version is but it actually isn't. The story is a lot better, the protagonist doesn't piss me off anymore, the fighting scenes are way better than Fate/Zero and the soundtrack is mostly the same as in F/Z which I loved. I definitely enjoyed this season.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall: (9.2/10)\\n\r\nOverall, one of the best action anime I have watched this year. I'll definitely watch the second season soon.  \\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nPros:\\n\r\n-Great Story\\n\r\n-Ufotables' perfect animation\\n\r\n-Great Soundtrack\\n\r\n-Characters are a lot better compared to their 2006 version\\n\r\n-Enjoyable season\\n\r\n-Rin being a tsundere (Not a hardcore tsundere)\\n\\n\r\nCons:\\n\r\n-\\n",

            "content": "If there is one thing that Ufotable is really good at, then it is animation. A rather 'young' studio that was founded in 2000 brought us a couple of really good anime series including the \"Fate\" series. After finishing Fate/ Zero, I watched Unlimited Blade Works and even tough a lot of people consider Zero as the better one, I cannot agree with them because UBW was a masterpiece.\r\n PLOT AND STORY LINE\\n\\n\r\nLet's firstly talk about the setting of this anime. The setting, being the Holy Grail War, is in my opinion one of the best settings I have ever seen. In a battle royale, seven Masters fight for the ultimate prize-The Holy Grail. Each master summons a servant, a Heroic Spirit from the past that fights for them in the war. There are in total seven different servant classes: Archer, Saber, Caster, Rider, Lancer, Assassin and Berserker. It is so amazing how they actually found a way to awaken legendary warriors and heroes from the past. Alexander the Great, King Arthur, Gilgamesh... These are all characters from my History books and legends we have all heard so many times. And now there is an anime that actually awakens them, their story, their ideal and personality. Truly amazing. And of course with a setting like this one the story itself just has to be good. \\n\\n\r\nUnlimited Blade Works' story line follows a young mage, Toosaka Rin, that entered the 5th Holy Garil War together with her servant, Archer. After an incident at her school, one of her classmates, Emiya Shirou, enters the Grail War by unconsciously summoning Saber. Facing mutual enemies, Rin and Shirou form a temporary alliance to challenge their opponents in the Holy Grail War.  In time the battle for the Grail turns into an interesting story that involves much more than just mare fighting, but events from the past and the future. Unlike Fate/ Zero, UBW has its focus more on the life story of Shirou Emiya rather than the war it self. It is a story about his ideal and promise he once made to his father to make this word a better place. And even tough it was the main story line of the anime, the War it self wasn't pushed into the background. In that way, the anime brought a lot of action and amazing fights along with an emotional main story and a couple of background stories that filled the plot in between. \\n\r\nThe story line of Unlimited Blade Works develops gradually and slowly but there still is, in my opinion, one thing that disturbed the otherwise perfect story line. Shirou starts of as a weak mage with no actual talent but suddenly gets all strong and becomes the hero of the story. I found it rather forced and poor. Besides, Rin in the end becomes nothing more than a side kick despite being strong and independent from the beginning. His actions, on the other hand, were mainly transparent and kinda immature for most of the time. Still, it didn't change the fact that it was one of the best anime stories ever and it definitely deserves the best note. \\n\\n\r\n CHARACTERS                                                                                                                    \\n\\n\r\nAnd here is one more thing that the makers of UBW did extremely good. Even tough it didn't brought us the characters close as Fate/ Zero did, I did get the feeling to know all the characters  very well and their personalities. The diversity of personalities in this anime is awesome and most of the characters are incredibly developed. The character that kinda stands out with his/her development is in my opinion Caster. Actually, it is not her development, but more the way she actually showed her true intention in the end. The only character that I actually hated was that Shinji idiot, whereas my favorite characters were definitely Rin and Gilgamesh. They are both so strong, independent and incredibly amusing. What a pity that the worst character in the anime happens to be the main. A rather clumsy, stupid and in character weak person ends up being an overpowered hero in the final battle. I just couldn't accept the fact that actually  HE defeats...Sorry, NO SPOILERS.  \\n\\n\r\n ANIMATION AND STYLE                                                                                                   \\n\\n\r\nRight from the first episode I knew that this anime would be amazing. I literary fell in love with it and especially with the animation and its style. Guys, if there is one thing that I respect the most than it is the animation of an anime. If the animation is bad, there is almost no chance that I'll ever watch the anime. The animation of UBW is just incredible and so is the style. It is with great extend the best animation I have seen in a long time. Fluid movements, colorful, rich in movement, and the action scenes...astonishing, marvelous, extraordinary, wonderful... Should I go on? It is one of the rare anime, I'd actually like to watch over and over again and mainly because of the animation. \\n\\n\r\n CONCLUSION                                                                                                                     \\n\\n\r\nIt was pretty easy to rate this anime on My Anime List. It's clearly a 10/10 masterpiece. From the start I knew that I'd actually love it. I don't know why, but I was right. I loved it and I am sure that you will too. \"I am the bone of my sword. Steel is my body and fire is my blood. I have created over a thousands of blades. Unknown to death. Nor known to Life. Have withstood pain to create many weapons yet those hands shall never hold anything. So, as I pray, (I need more of) Unlimited Blade Works.\"",

            "content": "Unlimited Blade Works is the second route from the Fate/Stay Night VN (which you should definitely play before you watch this for the full impact) and probably the most popular one, due to the excellent adaptation by Ufotable. There are some issues that I frequently see people critique, and I will go into them briefly.\r\n99% of people that enter the Fate series (well, not 99% but MOST people I've seen) always watch Fate/Zero first, which is the wrong way to go about it. Fate/Zero is a prequel to Fate/Stay Night (and thus, UBW), and thus has a lot of themes that are very similar toUBW. Of course, people that watch the prequel first and then find that the sequel has a lot of very similar themes or a \"weaker\" protagonist will always complain, which is what most Fate/Zero-first people will do. \\n\\n\r\nIf there is one thing to take away, PLEASE play the VN first. It helps make the anime so much more impactful and explains a ton of things that are not shown or not explained in the anime. The VN has three routes that build upon each other; since UBW is the 2nd one it loses a lot of impact when it's shown by itself. \\n\\n\r\nSo here is the breakdown:\\n\\n\r\nStory: 9. I think UBW has one of the most interesting stories in context of the Fate/Stay Night VN. If you watch it as a standalone, it will be a fine show. Please, please, please read the VN first. The anime is so much better afterwards since the VN is from a first person perspective and the protagonist has internal monologues all the damn time. The main conflict gets a TON of extra backstory and info since there are so many monologues.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8. Ufotable is the ideal studio for Fate if it wants to become a grimdark anime (like Fate/Zero for instance), but Fate/Stay Night has a lot of goofy moments as well which may not be expressed as well. Still, it is very artistic and \"humanlike\"\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9. Remixed songs from the VN are a h u g e reason why I like it, also the second opening is fantastic. Background sound is also very fitting in the proper moments.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 6. Shirou, the protagonist, is very unreasonable and downright \"generic shonen MC\" nearly the entire time. HOWEVER, if you've read the VN (which you seriously should), there are a ton of internal monologues that explain why he does things, what his backstory is, and his motivations. Seriously, people that complain that Shirou is a worse protagonist than Kiritsugu (the protagonist from F/Z) just never played the VN. Shirou does not monologue that much in the UBW anime, and a lot of his backstory is not explained that well. In addition, the main conflict is presented\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10. Watching the UBW route animated is HUGE, since I've only read the fights and the motifs. It is animated extremely well, the sound is boppin (since it's remixed from the VN which is a very nice touch after playing it) and it's a very hype show. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9. While it is a shame that not a lot of Shirou's monologues made it in, it also wouldn't make sense for him to just talk to himself all the time. The VN does a better job of presenting the story in context (since it's written from his perspective), but the anime is the best follow-up to the VN that you could think of. Highly recommend to watch it (of course, after reading it)",

            "content": "I came into this show with high expectations from Fate/zero and other Fate works, and while I definitely can't call it bad, I was a bit disappointed. \r\nThe good: \r\nThe art and animation are gorgeous; the style from Fate/zero is maintained and might look even better. Fights are very fluid. This is probably one of the best-looking anime I've ever seen. \r\nThe voice performances (I watched the English dub) were quite good for the most part. I really wish they had brought Liam O'Brien back to play Archer though; his performance in the earlier Fate/stay night anime was amazing. \r\nThe not so good: \r\nThe pacingfelt a bit strange. I felt like the writers were doing their best to convince me that the events transpiring were very tense and happening very quickly, but what we actually see kind of meanders along or stalls. I'd be fine with either of things if they committed to them, but the result is kind of this awkward mismatch between the impression we're supposed to get and how the characters are reacting to it, and the pacing that we actually see. In my opinion, the story arc of UBW is not quite deep enough to hold a 24/25 episode anime, at least the way they chose to adapt it, so we have a lot of detail added that sort of strangles the action, as well as some scenes where not much is happening. \\n\\n\r\nI also thought that the character focus was a bit off. The story of UBW, as I understand it, is primarily about Shirou and Archer's characters and ideals and how they clash. Neither of these characters, especially Archer, received an amount of focus proportional to this - we do learn things about them, but they don't feel very prominent in the story. There are a number of other interesting side characters and backstory details and such, but the placement of when we actually learn about them is sometimes confusing and can distort the narrative flow. \\n\\n\r\nAll in all, I would not say that FSN: UBW is bad; it's very exemplary in animation at least and certainly has positive aspects to be enjoyed. However, I do think there are a number of areas that could have used some revision and may prevent full enjoyment. 7/10",

Or as the show states, Arturia. \\n\\n\r\nNo the problems become clear really once we start moving a bit outside of Saber, and what do we have? I don't even know what we have, to be honest, it's hard to remember who was what or why, particularly in UBW. \\n\\n\r\nBasically Hercules is a monster from a video game, Lancer is some kind of baity edgelord, and then you have a smart but shy girl... which.... pretty sure.... encountered that one.... somewhere.\\n\\n\r\nThe rest, are there more?

            "content": "I never knew ufotable did the animation of the newish Tales of series  after doing research I found out, so yep they have revamped the series so wonderfully of Fate/Zero and Unlimited Blade Works. It looks amazing in everyway. This is the order of the anime you should watch, well I was introduced to it back in high school it's how it gave me a different type of visual and nostalgia feels.\r\nFate/Stay Night from 2006 is the animation done by DEEN. This is the route of Saber and was the first Fate anime series that released. It talks more about Saber and Shirou's relationship.Tohsaka and Archer is with them too still of course, but it's not how you see them now. It's completely different. You can choose not to watch it and skip to Fate/ZERO. I recommend watching it though to see what it was like back then. You might find Shirou's character here surprising than it was in the other ones. I think this is more action than talking, because it doesn't slow down at all about the story. You'll probably be like wdf. \\n\\n\r\nFate/Zero is the past of Unlimited Blade Works. It uncovers the secrets of the main characters parents and to show that they entered the war and how it began as well. Shows more background of Rin, Sakura, and Illya when they where children super small kids. Shirou when he was small at the end too, how he became an Emiya, and Gilgamesh. \\n\\n\r\nFate/stay Night Unlimited Blade Works is Rin's route. This shows more of Rin and Shirou's relationship. They grew up by the end of the series, which is very much to enjoyment seeing them grow and taking up new challenges. \\n\\n\r\nThe series is basically based from the games, so I think that's why it's made this way.\\n\r\nThat is the best way to explain on how the series works. Soon there will be more to come from what I heard with Sakura's route, which I hear will talk about more of Shirou and Sakura's relationship. That's pretty much the gist of it.\\n\\n\r\nAnyway on with the review for UBW.  The animation is outstanding and top notch. The buildings are so realistic and water looks like it will come out from the screen okay nah not really, but it's awesome. You can hear the clashing from the swords not like how it was back then in \"FSN\" You can really hear they took the time to animate this. \\n\\n\r\nThe music is also to die for from the series. Have you heard of Kalafina or LiSa? LiSa might be more of recognizable artist, because she done a few themes for Sword Art Online and Angel Beats. She's back with \"This Illusion\" baby, the theme was done by someone else from the 2006 version. My how it changed.  It gave a kick in the feels when it played as Tohsaka was falling from the roof and dayum that animation. Kalafina does themes mostly for this series and a few other series that I forgot, I apologize, but you can look it up. If you haven't heard of any music by them, then start doing it now! I especially liked Aimer's Brave Shine too. She's new that I never heard of before. Outstanding music that are done with these artists that you can't miss a beat. \\n\\n\r\nWelp that's all with my review. \\n\r\nIt does have a certainty on which order you should watch.\\n\r\nI recommend watching Fate/Zero before this. The 2006 version is optional. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

I found the storyline to be a little lacking since they were repeating a few things from Fate zero and it had this \"hero will save the world\" which bores me.\r\n2. The art and sound were splendid and I truly enjoyed it.\r\n3. The characters were what the show was lacking the most in myopinion. I liked Gilgamesh (as always) and lancer was great as well but the rest were not as interesting as they could be... Tohsaka was discent but she got a little boring near the end and Shirou was just repeating himself all the time which bore me unbelievably. \\n\\n\r\n4. Overall it was an enjoyable show and I would definetly recomend it, just don't expect as much from it as you got from Fate/Zero",

            "content": "Fate Stay/Night (2014), also know to the fanbase as Fate Stay up all Night: Unlimited Budget Works, is the second anime adaption of the popular Visual Novel, animated by Ufotable, the same company that did Fate/Zero. The battle for the Holy Grail, an omnipotent wish-granting device, fought between Masters and their Servants, heroes from past or future that gather to fight for it. One of the better shows of the 2014 season.\r\nSTORY 6/10-\r\nProbably the weakest point here, since a lot of weird stuff does happen that doesn't make sense, most of which involving Emiya Shirou, the main character (whom I consider to be a completemoron during this season). While some of it makes sense, there are events occurring that make no sense, such as the battle between the main characters and Caster and her master. Spoilers, but it doesn't make sense how that particular battle occurred, since the master of Caster is clearly weaker than any of the Servants. Also, who would leave their loved ones unprotected during a battle royal that could destroy the entire city?\\n\\n\r\nART 10/10-\\n\r\nWhen I first saw the battles in this show, I immediately knew why it was called Unlimited Budget Works. The animation is beautiful, with each panel of every fight full of color and 60fps of intense magic action. No fight scenes left me dissatisfied (at least the actual fights). The fights were enough to make even Wit Studio seem mediocre. The only word I could use to describe them are perfection.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND 8/10-\\n\r\nWhile not nearly up to par as the fights or the Fate/Zero soundtrack by the extremely talented Yuuki Kaijura, the music definitely did more than just compliment the fight scenes, making the watcher feel hyped and at the edge of their seat, but not that memorable on their own. Still, the soundtrack did its job, and for that, 8/10.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER 6/10- \\n\r\nEmiya Shirou is by far the most disappointing aspect of the story, as he is a boy that strives to become a \"hero of justice.\" If one has watched Fate/Zero and seen how his foster father Emiya Kiritsugu acts, you would know that his quest isn't going to do well. This story route in the VN even goes into what his quest might lead him to. Makes me mad just thinking about him and how he tries to take hits for people and save random people that he doesn't know. Saber is less disappointing, but would probably be a lot more had I not started Fate/Zero before writing this review. Essentially, she's there to just fight for Shirou, as the most popular character in the series. Lol. Tohsaka Rin, while a Tsundere, is fairly interesting in how she acts (I guess), but the main point of interest is definitely her Servant, Archer. Completely contradicting everything Shirou has to say about his ideals, Archer's past is unknown and he and Shirou absolutely loathe each other, and later on he makes decisions that make him a rather interesting character. Very complex and mysterious character who partially makes up for the other three.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT 8/10-\\n\r\nFate/Stay Night: Unlimited Blade Works was a decent watch for me. While lacking the complexity of Fate/Zero, it easily overtakes its older sibling in terms of animation, making it a good action fodder series with fairly interesting story.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL 7/10-\\n\r\nWhile the animation and sound are beautiful, and Archer is one of my favorite characters of all time, Unlimited Blade Works's faults in story and other characters don't live up to the former aspects, and earns the show a 7/10. Recommend for fans of the Fate series who don't mind a dip in story quality for a boost in animation from Zero.",

            "content": "This review contains minor spoilers in the \u201ccharacters\u201d paragraph and will be about the 2 seasons.\r\nI precise that I had played the Visual Novel before and seen Fate/Zero and the Fate Stay Night 2006 adaptation before seeing the 2014 show.\r\nArt:8.5/10\r\nOverall very solid, we got here the very display of Ufotable\u2019s experience. The background and landscape of various part of Fuyuki city are detailed and beautiful. The palette of color was good and breathe some life into the anime. \r\nAs expected from Ufo, the best part was the animation during the fights (through non battle scenes were also good): dazzling effects combined with an excellent fluidity,I was really captivated by the clash of high speed blades and the impressive choreography of the servants in battles. The art was a real pleasure for our eyes and the strongest point of Fate UBW.\\n\r\nHowever 2 flaws, the face of the characters were a bit weird (their chin were often really sharp) and there was a perceptible drop in the quality of the art and animation in some fights of the end. (Budget problem, lack of time?).\\n\\n\r\nSoundtrack:6/10\\n\r\nLackluster and often too discreet. It somewhat failed to reinforce the epic or dramatic side of the story like Kajiura\u2019s soundtrack in Fate Zero. Personally I found the general tone of the ost a bit weird and quite forgettable. Which is a shame when the original soundtrack of the VN (but also Deen\u2019s adaptation) were already very good, unsurprisingly, the best theme IMO was EMIYA theme\u2019s remix from the visual novel. Sound effects and the seiyuu\u2019s job were good.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 5/10\\n\r\nThrough not the most interesting Shirou of the 3 routes of the visual novel, the anime pretty much failed to describe us Shirou. It failed to stress that he is an empty boy, traumatized by the great fire who had no other dreams than the one borrowed to Kiritsugu and who can only exist by the help he provides to other people. Instead I was under the impression that the anime portrayed a fairly unidimensional idealistic shonen hero who always shout his ideals, louder each time...\\n\r\nSaber was rather uninteresting which was predictable since the story do not really focus on her, but still. \\n\r\nRin and Archer were rather good I guess, though I was not fund of her tsundere side in the first place.\\n\\n\r\nStory:5/10\\n\r\nStandard battle royal\u2019s scenario and several good plot twist, especially one. The problem was not the story itself but instead the execution of it. \\n\r\nMaybe the greatest problem of this adaptation aside from the weakness of Shirou\u2019s portrayal, was the pacing: too much dull scene that do not really bring anything to the story. Even for someone who had never seen the show, some explanations and events were just too redundant and long. Typically after 5 min watching an episode, I could predict that no major event would happen until the next episode. The thing is that the slow pacing did not really allow to develop Shirou\u2019s intern character.\\n\r\nThe pacing of the battle was also too disjointed to be appreciable, for example the greatest battle was extended through 3 episodes which was just too much, generally speaking the dialogues and the flashbacks were unnecessary long and cut the rhythm at the middle of the fight so that I often lost the excitement at the middle of the battle.  \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 6/10 The problem is that the serie fails to achieve its goal either as a \u201cpopcorn show\u201d (not a pejorative word, I enjoyed Code Geass) with little pretention, just like Deen and either as a more mature anime because of the lack of depth of the characters and the story. In the end I lost all my hype and watched the anime as a rather passive spectator. I must say that is anime is with no doubt my greatest deception of  2014/2015.\\n",

            "content": "After Fate/Zero, I thought I had seen the best that the Fate franchise had to offer. I was wrong..\r\n(minor spoilers)\r\nFate/Stay Night Unlimited Blade Works (both seasons) is undoubtedly a masterpiece anime ranking amongst the top 5 best-anime (under 100 episodes) in my opinion. In one of my earlier reviews regarding Fate/Zero, I talked about that show\u2019s ability to convey ubiquitous debates about what means to be a hero in a surreal manner. Fate/SN UBW packs the same punch in a entirely new, and seemingly more emotional, light. In addition, UBW has a more interesting plot, greater sound and visual components, and the same diversity ofrelationships and characters that Fate/Zero perfectly executed. \\n\\n\r\n1.     \u201cHero of Justice\u201d - Anyone who knows anything about the Fate franchise is certainly acquainted with this phrase \u2026 and, to no surprise, the core philosophical debate in UBW revolves around this. In Zero, the remarkable final scenes with Kiritsugu Emiya held enormous weight on what it means to be a \u201cHero of Justice\u201d: a false unreachable ideal or a worthy goal. Kiritsugu ultimately reached the notion that it is impossible to save everyone (meaning saving one with come at the expense of losing another). However, with Shirou, his adopted son, we see a slightly different take on the debate. After Kiritsugu adopts Shirou, Shirou adopts his father\u2019s dream of becoming a \u201cHero of Justice,\u201d and lives by that ideal. Although Shirou faces opposition from even those closest to him (specifically Rin and Saber), he never loses hope and perpetually engages in self-sacrifice for the betterment of everyone else around him. And in one of the final scenes of UBW, when Shirou faces Archer, he marvalous strife to overcome his doubts and regrets for engaging in self-sacrifice is the peak of this anime series. \\n\\n\r\n2.      Story - By now the story is not that unique\u2026if you watched Zero, you could probably even predict what the story was going to be about without even reading the summary. Holy Grail war, summoning powerful servants, Church vs Mages, etc. However, the slight repetitiveness of the story does not at all take away from the overall enjoyment that this anime delivers. In fact, by placing Shirou in his father\u2019s shoes, the viewers get to make the comparisons themselves as the anime never explicitly contrasts father and son. In fact, because of the growing teenage relationship between Shirou and Rin, I actually found the UBW route to be emotionally lighter and a little more enjoyable than Zero, which definitely took a slight darker path. Note: I felt at times there were a lot of unexplained moments in the storyline that justified a few more episodes, but given the intense budget for this 26 episode show, I doubt they could afford a few more. Like we never got to really see Shirou use a bow\u2026\\n\\n\r\n3.      Art and Sound - Holy shit were the fight scenes awesome\u2026just watch the trailer (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61RuoLIlCUM). The animation in this series has set the bar for around 5-10 years. I do not typically really care about how the sound plays into anime simply because when I watch these types of shows I pay more attention to the story, so all I will say was the sound (for an inexperienced listener like myself) was above average. It amplified the emotional content of the anime. \\n\\n\r\n4.      Characters - I would not so much as think of giving any anime a 10 rating unless I think the characters are exceptional. For Fate/Zero, Rider (Iskandar) and Saber did it for me. For UBW, I would have to say Saber (obviously), Shirou, Archer, and a few others were really amazing. First and foremost\u2014Saber. I will say this off the bat: The Sunny Days (alternate ending) really does not do justice to her character; during the final battle, she consciously using Excaliber knowing that she will perish, along with her opportunity to see Shirou grow up with Rin. For me, Saber (throughout both Zero and UBW) is the ultimate king of self-sacrifice to the point of trying to use the Holy Grail to reverse her failures from days past. On a side note, I also truly adore Iskander, however his ideals and morals significantly differ from Saber\u2019s. I\u2019ve already talked about Shirou, so I lastly want to mention Archer. The final battle between him and Shirou brings his regrets to light, seemingly regrets that Shirou overcomes by championing his ideals before them. What I found best about Archer is that although he was wise beyond his years and experienced pain and hardship like none other, he ultimately accepted Shirou\u2019s ideals (once again) continued his journey as a servant for humanity with the belief that suffering should be abolished. \\n\\n\r\nLook - I get it. The whole Fate franchise isn\u2019t meant for everyone. But for me it left an indelible impression not just as an entertaining anime\u2026\\n\\n\r\nUltimately, UBW reminded me of why I watch anime. Can\u2019t wait for the Fate/Heaven\u2019s Feel saga.",

Rin acts like a generic tsundere instead of a mature person who can actually hold a conversation. Lots of time is wasted showing characters like Caster when they should have spent the run time conveying Shirou's psychological characterization from the VN. Archer's lines make no sense because Shirou's inner thoughts are never conveyed. The translation quality is terrible. Three episodes are spent having Shirou, Archer, and Saber repeat the same lines at each other. The action scenes are flashy and meaningless, they do not convey any of thefascinating thoughts Shirou had during them.\\n\\n\r\nI recommend the Japanese VN (not the terrible fan translation) for those interested in proper characterization and dialogue over flashy visuals.\\n\\n",

To start after watching Fate/Zero I watched this the best choice I ever did. The rich story as always amazing character development from the start the animations with the mix of CJI's is done right! Overall I enjoyed it and this route by Ufotable is one of my favorites. This route plays a much longer role to Deen's adaptation since Deen only released a movie and this is a series!",

            "content": "Production, Acclaim, Genre, etc.\r\nFate/Stay Night: Unlimited Blade Works (first season) is a twelve-episode anime that aired from October to December 2014. It was created by studio Ufotable, famous for fantasy anime such as Tales of Symphonia, Kara no Kyoukai, and various installments of the Fate series. FSN:UBW is a newer adaptation of the 2010 movie Fate/Stay Night: Unlimited Blade Works and the 2006 series Fate/Stay Night. These, in turn, were adaptations of the original visual novel/ Windows game by Type Moon.\r\n The Fate franchise is widely popular. A hundred and seventy-five thousand users on myanimelist.net have rated this series for an average of 8.41, makingit nearly as popular as such classic series as Madoka Magica, Code Geass, and Death Note. Its rating is higher than that of newly hyped anime such as Akame ga Kill. Genres and themes for FSN:UBW include fantasy, suspense, battle royale, friendship, action, and part psychological thriller. To fully appreciate FSN:UBW, you will have to watch the second season, but this review will focus solely on the first season of twelve episodes. \\n\\n\r\nStory: Execution and Structure\\n\\n\r\nThe story in FSN:UBW was well-planned and well-executed. It succeeds in being a captivating fantasy and a suspenseful, exciting battle royale.  Even if you're not into fantasy or competitive battles, it's possible to just enjoy the story of Shirou's personal journey along with that of Archer. It can be quite thought-provoking and has a psychological element. The story will force you to think about what your values are, whether or not you live them out, and whether they are feasible or unrealistic. FSN:UBW can also be enjoyed as the second half of the story of Fate/Zero. \\n\\n\r\nAs a writer, I'm interested in story composition, and would like to discuss that here. Interpretations of the story structure of FSN's first season may differ, but I look at it from the perspective that Shirou's personal journey is the main \"plot.\" From that perspective, there are three major plot points: summoning Saber in episode 1, beginning his conflict with Archer in episode 7, and, in episode 12, losing something dear to him partly as a result of his insistence on his ideals. The three plot point structure of Shirou's journey is a great way to develop his character, and can be thought of as 1) becoming someone with the potential to be a hero, 2) conflict with someone challenging his heroic ideals, and 3) seeing the consequences of being too much of a selfless person.  \\n\\n\r\n(Now, if action is the main driving plot, then the story's biggest points are probably fighting Berserker in episode 3, fighting Rin and Rider in episode 6, fighting Rider in episode 8, fighting Caster's Master in episode 10, and finally, being attacked by Caster in episode 12. The 3-6-8-10-12 pattern is excellent design for an action show with a lot of fighting. It makes it so there is room for both character development and action, and it tries to get viewers hooked with the important third episode.)\\n\\n\r\nArt: Overall and Character Designs\\n\\n\r\nFSN:UBW is a beautiful, colorful treat for the eyes. The vivid coloring makes almost any screenshot worthy of being a wallpaper. The studio kept the same basic animation style as the 2010 movie, the relatively modern style of somewhat realistic body proportions but classic anime facial features of large, sparkling eyes and tiny noses. The detail and picture quality were improved compared to the 2010 movie. Unlike in the movie, some CG is used for effects, such as the wisps of air around Saber's invisible sword, the disappearing and reappearing of Heroic Spirits, and some of the colorful, special attacks of the characters. Importantly, however, CG is not overused, and for the most part it blends in well. The fight scenes look amazing, and although they are fantasy battles rather than techniques used in a real fighting form, they still look well-referenced. I would have liked more realism personally. \\n\\n\r\nThe character designs keep to the originals by Takashi Takeuchi from what I can tell. They are certainly memorable, though to me they seem somewhat plain and simple once you take away the almost blindingly bright colors. For example, Rin's red outfit really fit her personality, and helps viewers develop an image of what she's like, but without that, would she still be properly expressive? I would have liked to see more details and differences in the faces and expressions of the characters. I have no complaints about the overall design though. Lancer, a popular character among fans, has a particularly appealing character design for me, and he is one of the characters whose expressions are more pronounced. I have always been a fan of Saber, and she wouldn't be the same without that design. \\n\\n\r\nSound: Acting, Music, and Scores \\n\\n\r\nThough there was nothing that struck me as amazing or unforgettable, the voice acting in FSN:UBW is still pretty good. The same voices used in the 2010 movie are used in the 2014 adaptation. Rin's seiyuu Kana Ueda played the lead character in Maria Sama ga Miteru, Shigofumi, and Kashimashi Girl Meets Girl. Noriaki Sugiyama, voice of Shirou Emiya, is famous for voices in the Naruto series, though he hasn't had many lead roles in other anime. Junichi Suwabe plays Archer, is widely known for playing Dandy in Space Dandy, and has side roles in many excellent anime including Bungou Stray Dogs, Danganrompa 3, Kiznaiver, High School of the Dead, and Black Butler. Among the main characters' seiyuu, I believe Suwabe's performance was probably the best. The widely popular seiyuu Hiroshi Kamiya makes a minor appearance as Shinji Matou. Even with such a small role, he makes himself memorable. \\n\\n\r\nFSN's opening theme, \"Ideal White,\" was performed by Ayano Mashiro with lyrics by Meg Rock and music composition by Carlos K. At first, the song didn't stick out at me, but after listening to it a few times, it started to become the very sound of FSN for me. It's quite suitable for an action-fantasy anime and has a positive feel to it. The lyrics are interesting, and I see them as Shirou's own thoughts. The band Kalafina performed the first ending theme, \"Believe,\" with composition and lyrics created by Yuki Kajiura. Kalafina is known for performing songs for anime such as Madoka Magica and Kara no Kyoukai. The song is memorable and pleasant to listen to, especially if you enjoyed hearing the band in Madoka Magica. \\n\\n\r\nThe OST for FNS:UBW was composed by Hideyuki Fukasawa. (There is an OST II for season 2.) The music didn't stick out at me as much as with some anime, but whenever I listen to the OST, I am always impressed with it. It could be that the music scores matched the scenes and emotions so perfectly that they escaped my notice while I watched. One of my favorite things about the music is that electric guitar is often used in addition to orchestra. The track \"Archer\" is one of my favorites, an exciting and mysterious rhythm building up steadily. \"Two Hearts\" and \"Far Away from You\" are other tracks that touch me; they are beautifully orchestrated, emotional melodies, with \"Far Away\" having more of an emotional climax.  \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: General, Rin, and Shirou \\n\\n\r\nAlmost all of the characters in FSN:UBW are memorable, though many of them are underdeveloped or one-dimensional. The chivalry, loyalty, and courage of Saber make her an appealing character for anyone who admires knights and classic, good-hearted heroes. In contrast, the rough and rugged Archer appeals to those who like their heroes with a dark and unpredictable side. I felt that several of the minor characters in FSN:UBW deserved more attention than they got. The best example is Taiga Fujimura, Shirou's legal guardian and older-sister-figure. She was funny, spirited, cheery, well-designed, and a great contrast to the angsty, gloomy, or angry teenagers in the house. Another underdeveloped character is the Assassin servant that guards Caster's temple. He had an interesting character concept, but only gets significant screen time in one or two episodes of the first season. \\n\\n\r\nSomething deserves to be said about the main heroes, Rin Tohsaka and Shirou Emiya. Although the situation does seem to be slowly improving in some genres, anime in general has few strong, leading female protagonists, and the ones that exist are often disliked as stubborn \"bitches\" by the male fanbase, showing the ever-present problem of sexism. For that reason, it's a breath of fresh air to have a spirited, free-thinking heroine like Rin. For most of the series, she is a superior mage compared to male protagonist Shirou, and she never backs away from a fight. Her values system makes her seem cold-hearted, but she adjusts them as the series goes on to make room for words and actions that show her human heart. It's also refreshing that Tohsaka is designed and regarded in the show as a beautiful person, without needing huge jelly-boobs or revealing clothes\u2014fan services that are sickeningly common in modern anime. \\n\\n\r\nThe male hero, Shirou Emiya, is a bit unusual in some ways compared to lead characters in many (but not all) anime series. He is reasonably humble, rarely needing to act \"manly\" to prove himself. Though he starts off skeptical and misjudging of Saber because of her gender, Shirou comes to accept and respect her soon enough, relying on her strength. Throughout the season, it is suggested that Shirou is driven first and foremost by his values, which are shown to be unrealistically idealistic in some cases. It's rare to see a protagonist so driven by pure intentions, with the flaw of not being able to accept that his values might be flawed. This stubbornness gives him an air of strength and determination, though it also shows he still very much a child at heart. I have encountered few anime with a hero like Shirou, who strives for an ideal, and shows courage and determination even in the light of weakness or lack of ability.  \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment\\n\\n\r\nWatching FSN:UBW was certainly a treat for the eyes, and in some ways a breath of fresh air, but in other ways, I found myself a bit disappointed, or even bored. While the battles are colorful and explosive, they don't have any quality of realism that makes me feel suspense. The Holy Grail War is supposed to be a Battle Royale, but all the characters seemed to me to be slow in making their moves and following through. Once I got a sense of Shirou's character, the direction of the story became quite predictable, at least in season one. There were only one or two twists that truly surprised me. In addition, I used to be a lot like Shirou, and watching his character's journey with its many mistakes (like my own) was a bit painful. That doesn't make the show any less awesome; it just interfered with my personal enjoyment somewhat.\\n\\n\r\n I liked season two, the second half of FSN:UBW much better, and I definitely recommend continuing the story whether you already know it from the movie or whether you're a brand new fan. \\n",

This anime is a needle in a haystack and when you do find the needle... it's made out pure gold and you cannot help but pinch yourself with it to make sure its real... and if you're dreaming.\r\nAnyway, enough of that, this is my 2nd time watching Fate/stay night: Unlimited Blade Works. I'd like to note that unfotable went above and beyond. This high caliber art of an anime is breathtakingly beautiful. The effects are of utmost perfection. I cannot thinkof anything bad about this besides the fact that it is an anime based off of a visual novel. I very much so would like to see a season 3 because at the end of the season 2 the show sorta ended on a cliffhanger. \\n\\n\r\nI personally think this show is a gold mine waiting to happen. I would 100% think this would be on par with the amount of sales that Sword Art Online is receiving. Get a team of writers together and start writing! \\n\\n\r\nAlso, both the dub and sub are phenomenal. For this one, I preferred the dub just because it was on Netflix.",

            "content": "Some people feel that Unlimited Blade Works (hereafter UBW) is not deserving of its high score.  I think your potential enjoyment of this anime is going to largely depend on how important coherent story is to you.\r\nMany of us watch anime because it is adventurous, and it represents a medium through which to express situations and possibilities not present in \"real life.\"  So I don't really understand the negative reviewers who are very much preoccupied with a lack of realism, plot holes, or literary quality.\r\nSo let's get the negatives out of the way then.  \r\n- The main story, the Grail War, isunconvincing, melodramatic, and gives low return on your investment of time.  There is no denying this.\\n\r\n- UBW is excessively talky and has some of the worst in-combat dialogue I've ever witnessed.  Anime as a genre is particularly guilty of monologues during fight scenes, but UBW is among the worst.\\n\r\n- There are no surprising outcomes in the main plot.  You can write it yourself, it's that bad.\\n\r\n- Archer's angsty backstory is just cringe-worthy.  Just, No.\\n\\n\r\nOK, so if the negatives are so atrocious, why did I rate this anime so highly?\\n\\n\r\nReally it comes down to two things: Atmosphere and Characters.  For me, I watch anime because I want to go on an adventures with the characters in the story.  I call it atmosphere but maybe some other applicable phrases might be \"setting feeling\", \"world building\", or \"adventure quotient.\"  Say you are having a dream.  How amazing was it?  Some of this is personal preference.  I love the fact that some of the combatants, Rin especially, are self-sufficient mages living in their own mansions.  I don't care how realistic this is--as a setting it's amazing to me.  \\n\\n\r\nRegarding the characters, the main appeal to me I suppose is the fact that I am not familiar with the VN / Type Moon games, having never played them.  I watched the original Fate/stay night and zero, and I wasn't very impressed with the characters, story, or anything else really.  However, I wasn't prepared for this path where Rin's relationship with Shirou is explored.  It caught me by surprise in the most pleasant way possible.  And it is NOT fan-servicey as other cheaper anime are.  I actually found myself eager for the next episode just to see how their relationship would develop.  And I was fearful of the way this is resolved in Season 2 of UBW but in my opinion it turns out with the best outcome I could have hoped for.\\n\\n\r\nAs for actual character development, well, it's a bit forced and contrived just as you would expect with the terrible writing of the source material.  But ufotable takes some liberties with the dialogue I think, making it much easier to watch the slice-of-life parts vs. the actual battles and main conflicts (which are cringe-inducing).\\n\\n\r\nThe annoying magenta-haired girl, (of Heaven's Feel path) is largely pushed into the background here, for which I'm very grateful.\\n\\n\r\nI actually like Saber better in UBW because her relationship with Shirou feels much more natural and relatable.\\n\\n\r\nOK, some technical positives:\\n\\n\r\n+ Battle animation / fight scenes are top notch.  Seriously, the fights are much more coherent, the animation looks fluid, and the visual effects have a lot of dynamic lighting.  Probably CG is everywhere but it is blended with hand-drawn art masterfully.  10/10 of all anime I have ever seen.\\n\\n\r\n+ Character designs are very appealing.  Probably personal preference, but I have a hard time watching anime with crappy character designs\\n\\n\r\n+ The sound track is to die for.  If the story absolutely sucks, the original sound track is on the complete opposite end of the spectrum.  Sometimes I'll throw the OST on in my car when I want to be inspired.  It's that good.\\n\\n\r\nOK, to summarize, if you love being transported to another place for exciting adventures, you much watch this.  If you are one of those stuffy pseudo-intellectual types who are no fun at parties and like to point out every logical inconsistency, well, this is not your anime.  \\n",

            "content": "Let me start off by saying that I'm a huge Fate series fan and that there'll be a few minor \"spoilers\" that I personally don't believe will negatively affect your enjoyment of the show. I did try to keep spoilers to a minimum, however, if you want to play it safe, please skip to the last two paragraphs.\r\nLike I said before, I'm huge Fate series fan. I've played both the original Visual Novels, their remasters, I've read the light novels, played their video games, and of course, watched their anime.\r\nThat said, I can't bring myself to like this show. I still love the Visual Novel,I thoroughly enjoyed the Unlimited Blade Works route, but this anime is its own thing. \\n\\n\r\nThe dialogue was rewritten, scenes were rewritten, they've added in scenes(which were frankly unnecessary) that were never in the original source material and they even decided to make changes to the main heroine, Rin. \\n\\n\r\nThe Rin in the visual novel showed tsundere tendencies at times, but she wasn't this over-the-top. Her body language was, generally speaking, never this energetic, she was more confident, was more successful in her attempts to appear graceful, and was all around less generic, more believable, and more impressive(to me) as a character. \\n\\n\r\nThat said the adaptation's Rin is not what I would call a terrible or even bad character. My point is that what, I hope, was their attempt to improve upon an already great one, only served to make her, overall, less likable. \\n\\n\r\nThe dialogue is terrible. In fact, I honestly do believe that the infamous Fate/Stay Night adaptation made by Studio Deen in 2006 is better in this aspect. I realize that, as a non-native speaker of Japanese, I may not be qualified to criticize the dialogue of a Japanese show. But I personally believe that the dialogue was so poorly done that even an individual with no knowledge of Japanese whatsoever, would be able to tell that there was something off. Forceful transitions into exposition and awkward dialogue pacing make for a deadly combination. This was, most probably, the greatest reason why I was not fully immersed. Most of the time, I was unable to believe that these characters were actually having a conversation. The original Visual Novel's dialogue was never perfect, and, like this adaption, had problems with subtlety, but it was still of an adequate level of quality, so I was able to immerse myself. \\n\\n\r\nIf you can look past the dialogue, I do believe there is quite a bit to enjoy. \\n\\n\r\nI don't usually focus on animation, but it is called \"Unlimited Budget Works\" for a reason. I do believe that the action scenes were well done, the backgrounds were detailed, there were plenty of wallpaper-worthy scenes, I liked their use of CG and all in all, I personally believe it does look beautiful, but I am still reluctant to call it \"good\" because I'm far from an expert.\\n\\n\r\nWhen the show tries to be funny, I did laugh quite a bit. I like how Shirou and Rin were developed. I like how they explored Shirou and Archer's characters. Though it was done rather clumsily, I do like how they tried to explore some of the problems of altruism. How they tried to tell its audience that, even if it's impossible to save everyone, you're not necessarily wrong for believing that it's still a goal worth working towards. Sure, it can sound rather stupid. Even characters portrayed as respectable and intelligent in the show think it's stupid. But personally, I like it.\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion, it can be funny, there were some great ideas, a unique message, it's supposedly very well animated, and I like how they tried to explore and develop the characters of Shirou, Rin, and Archer. However, I was unable to immerse myself into the show. The dialogue was so awkwardly paced and terribly written, I was unable to trick myself into believing that the characters in the show were actually having a dialogue no matter how hard I tried, despite not being a native speaker of Japanese. I just could not enjoy it as much as I wanted to. There is enjoyment to be had, but it does spoil the Visual Novel and I don't think it's anywhere near as good, so I still find it difficult to recommend it to anyone. Fate/Zero is a much better introduction to the Fate series for anyone who doesn't have the time to read a Visual Novel.\\n\\n\r\nFor those who do, you can simply purchase a cheap(comparatively at least) PS2 copy of the game to support the creators. It's, supposedly, extremely easy to pirate the game online, but I'm not necessarily recommending that anyone do that. It is still illegal after all.\\n",

            "content": "This is an anime that treats itself as a novel. Understand that, and you'll understand that this is not made for \"anime fans\", and it treats itself very differently from many others. (This is in part due to the fact that it's based on a video game that had three main branching paths, with over 40 different endings.) \r\nIt initially falls victim to several stereotypical anime tropes, but quickly outgrows them. Whatever you hear, this is NOT a harem anime. Several girls early in the anime express interest in the protagonist (again, possibly due to the many branching storylines of the original game), but itmoves on from that scenario extremely quickly. \\n\\n\r\nI don't know where to start with my love for this anime. The plot is intense, with some twists you'll see coming and plenty you won't. The stakes feel high enough--not always necessarily in body count, but definitely on a personal level. \\n\\n\r\nHowever, the greatest thing this anime has to offer is in its characters. Almost every single character is well-developed, which is a remarkably fresh breath of air in anime. I am not simply referring to \"backstory\", but rather each character has a strong and distinct personality without relying heavily on stereotypes or caricatures. It is said that the best novels have every character believe that the novel is about them. Everyone is at the center of their own life story, so fictional characters should be more concerned about their life stories than the anime's actual plot. That is 100% how Unlimited Blade Works plays out, and I love it. Every character's actions is based on their own goals and motivations, and nobody... NOBODY... acts as if they are a secondary character in the story. This anime has, without a doubt, the single most realistic characters I have seen yet.   \\n\\n\r\nMy greatest hesitation is likely with the explanation of certain plot points. It very easily could have been the translation on the version I watched (Crunchyroll) but some things didn't seem to make sense to me OR my viewing partner. Like I said, these could have been translation issues rather than an issue with the actual anime (I'm not skilled enough in Japanese to tell.) However, talking with my viewing parter, we were able to make sense of everything. Also, Fate does fall into the trap of occasionally repeating itself too much, but I found myself laughing those moments off rather than being bothered by them--they didn't ruin my overall enjoyment at all.   \\n\\n\r\nIf you are looking for your standard Pretty Boy vs. Rage Monster anime, look elsewhere. If you are looking for a harem anime, look elsewhere. If you are looking for an anime that prioritizes plot over character, look elsewhere. If you want a well-thought-out, intensely personal anime, filled with characters that are so realistic you'll feel like you could run into them on the street--punctuated by extremely epic fight setpieces and a few good twists--this is what you've been looking for.",

            "content": "I am the bone of my sword\r\n Steel is my body and fire is my blood \r\n I have created over a thousand blades\r\n Unknown to Death,\r\n Nor known to Life.\r\n Have withstood pain to create many weapons \r\n Yet, those hands will never hold anything \r\n So as I pray, Unlimited Blade Works.\r\n(Note, this review is for both seasons of UBW. You have been warned)\r\nOne of the unique things about Fate/Stay Night (The Visual Novel) (And really, anything made by Type-Moon) was that there was technically 3 versions of it, all written by the same author of course. Each of them shifted focusto different characters and the plot became more complex and darker with each. Here, we're talking about the adaptation of my favorite route... and how it became one of my favorite animes of all time.\\n\\n\r\nStory:\\n\\n\r\nIf there's anything I could compare the routes of Fate to, it would probably be that the Fate route is the original Gundam series, UBW is Gundam The Origin and HF is Gundam SEED. As the comparison would imply, it often feels like an expansion of the Fate route, but its probably so in the best possible ways. Many of the concepts introduced there are expanded upon, and the pacing is much faster.\\n\r\nAs the Gundam The Origin comparison would imply, UBW is also way darker than the Fate route, yet at the same time, it never feels mean spirited, and there's always enough hope that you want to keep watching so that you watch your favorite characters survive.\\n\r\nThe show also heavily deconstructs Shirou's ideals, but unlike Heaven's Feel, it ultimately also reconstructs them, and shows all of them great things that come with them alongside all of the bad in them.\\n\r\nThe rivalry between Shirou and Archer is, for the lack of a better word, perfect. The two are indeed two sides of the very same coin, with Archer showing what could happen when someone decides to persue an ideal, yet has nothing left to live for. It ultimately becomes pretty much the main subplot of UBW, and I wouldn't want it any other way.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are mostly the same as in the Fate route, but with some differences. Shirou thankfully doesn't suffer much of a downgrade from the VN here even though his internal monologue is still missing, likely because they made a much bigger effort than the DEEN anime to translate his thoughts into dialogue. UBW is technically meant to be the Rin route, but when you get right down to it, this is Shirou's route. This is about his struggles, his efforts to try and honor Kiritsugu's ideals, which all leads to a brilliant conclusion.\\n\r\nRin and Saber both made for good female leads. Saber doesn't get as much focus as in the Fate route, but she gets enough for my taste and she's still ultimately a likable character. Rin thankfully gets a lot more to do, and is generally far more competent. Her romance with Shirou isn't as integral to the show as Shirou and Saber's was in the Fate route, but it's surprisingly well done.\\n\r\nBut of course, you can't talk about UBW without mentioning its deutragonist, Archer. This is the most focus Archer has ever gotten, and thank God for that. The show really does delve into how much of an utterly broken and cynical individual he truly is. And his struggles throughout the show end up being just as endearing as Shirou's.\\n\r\nGilgamesh gets a lot more to do too, and he's basically the main villain here. He's an interesting character. His motivations are certainly twisted, but there's definitely a hint of truth in them, and you can't help but understand why he ultimately thinks so. Plus he's a deliciously large ham to booth.\\n\r\nBut screw them, let's talk about the true star of the show, the hound of Cuulan (I think that's how it's spelled) himself, Lancer. Oh my God I adore this guy. He's technically a villain, but he's so affable and easygoing that you wish he wasn't. Combine this with and absolutely badass weapons and one of the coolest deaths in the franchise's history, it's easy to see why he's one of my favorite characters ever.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation:\\n\\n\r\nRemember how the animation was the worst point of the DEEN anime? Well, here, it's the exact opposite. This is some of the most fluid, energetic and straight up gorgeous animation I've ever seen on a TV anime. It's honestly on par with some OVAs I've seen. The fights are extremely flashy, yet they're also believable enough to be engaging. Needless to say, this show has earned its nickname of Unlimited Budget Works.\\n\\n\r\nSoundtrack:\\n\\n\r\nMost of the soundtrack is composed of remixes from tracks from the VN, though I did notice some Fate/Zero tracks here and there. I of course don't mind that since those soundtracks were perfect. The new openings and endings are also great too. Also, \"Last Stardust\" is one of the greatest songs I've ever heard.\\n\\n\r\nVoice Acting:\\n\\n\r\nAll but one of the voice actors from the VN return and do an outstanding job. The one that didn't come back was Kuzuki, who's now played by Masaki Terasoma, as apparently Kazuhiro Nakata had some health troubles. He's not as good as Nakata, but he gets the job done. \\n\r\nOf particular mention are Noriaki Sugiyama as Shirou and Junichi Suwabe as Archer, as those two are pretty much the heart and soul of UBW. Oh, and this is the show in which I jumped into the Nobutoshi Canna fan train.\\n\\n\r\nOverall;\\n\\n\r\nHaven't I made my point yet? You MUST watch this show. It definitely shouldn't be your first experience though, start with the DEEN anime, then watched Fate/Zero and then finally watch this show. Trust me, its worth it.\\n\\n\r\nFinal Score: 10/10",

            "content": "Ok. So here's how I see it.\r\nI think UBW is a great anime, but maybe not for the reason you might think.\r\n*slight spoiler ahead*\r\nAllow me the audacity to say that the characters are complete trash. Nothing's interesting about our main character and his posse, and the characters that are actually interesting all go away within a couple episodes. Exactly 0 of them get to do any developing. This really makes it hard to watch and enjoy the story after sometime, which is a shame because the Fate series has some of the most awesome, tragic, happy, basically all of those emotions wrapped into one, kindof story. The fact that Emiya is still the stubborn and \"people die when they are killed\" character, and that there was 0 change in his attitude even after all of the stuff he goes through, says to me that none of that needed to happen. The story went forward, yet the characters stay still. UBW isn't better than the 2006 Fate in that aspect.\\n\r\nThis sort of gap between character and story ruined the experience for me.\\n\\n\r\nHOWEVER.\\n\r\nUBW has probably the most orgasmic animation I have ever seen. The art direction, the choreography, the sound effects, shows me the peak capabilities of artists in their craft. I promise, you will not easily find another anime comparable to UBW's high quality animation. \\n\\n\r\nSo, this is why I think UBW is great... for a starter anime. Watch and show your anime curious friends the first half of this series (or all, i don't care). Show them exactly how much can be achieved through this medium. Even the story is pretty amazing (though if you let them watch for long enough, maybe they'll figure out how static the characters are) and the characters you do get attached to. But as a \"child\" in anime, you need the sugary sweets before you can truly enjoy the more complicated palet.\\n\r\nThen maybe, you'll be able to move on to a more \"adult\" anime, like Mars of Destruction, the best anime ever made in our lifetime and many lifetimes before.",

            "content": "To put it simply this entire series could be summed up as \"Awesome animation Meh Plot and Meh Characters\".  The fighting sequences are what you should watch this anime for not for it's plot. If you've watched the other Fate Series then should already know this well, however this one in particular has even less plot/story substance than the other series. Although i believe it is on par/slightly surpasses the others in terms of fight sequences. The main Protagonist is okay but he's a bit timid and for the most part a walking contradiction who is very confused about who he is as anindividual which at times can be a bit annoying. However he shines when paired with the female lead in this anime as their relationship is essentially the focal point of this anime and where it does its best. The over ending/conclusion of the series was meh, and i feel as though the last episode wasn't necessary and it was fine to end it on the episode before as the final episode was a bit empty and unfulfilling. Overall i give this anime a 7 simply for enjoyment, but if you want something that is very thought provoking with an awesome storyline this isn't for you, this is for the action junkies.",

            "content": "This is the first version of the fate/stay night series that I have watched. I had heard a lot of negative things about the earlier Studio Deen adaptation, so I basically avoided the series until UBW came out. I initially was interested in the premise of the story -- Mages summoning great heroes from the past to fight the holy grail war to obtain an item that will grant its user any wish, so I wanted to see how it would play out, especially considering this story is based on an \"adult\" light novel. \r\nBasically, the best thing about this anime is that THE ARTIS SO BEAUTIFUL. From the smoothly executed and finely detailed fight scenes to the wonderful stills, this was probably the most visually stunning anime I had seen all year. Watching this anime was definitely a treat for the eyes and does not disappoint in this department. I literally wanted to watch the next episode every single time just to see what it looked like. \\n\\n\r\nBeing that this was the first adaptation of FSN I have seen, I was a little confused about some of the roles of the characters and their importance in the overall picture. So I have to confess that I had to do a little research in order to really understand the plot and character relations. Characters such as Sakura, Ilya, and Kotomine have such as underdeveloped and minor role in this series, despite their importance in other arcs to the point where I almost didn't really care about and see the point of these characters being there. \\n\\n\r\nDespite the flaws in the plot and the character development, I do like how the relationship between the leads, Shirou and Rin play out (since this was basically a big focus of the series) a lot better that the relationship between Shirou and Saber in the Studio Deen adaptation of the Fate Route. Rin doesn't depend on Shirou too much to save her and Shirou lets Rin do whatever the heck she wants for the most part because of the trust between them. \\n\\n\r\nAlthough the ending felt kind of abrupt, I thought it was still somewhat satisfying compared to other anime I have watched. \\n\\n\r\nSo as a whole, I thought this anime was very enjoyable despite its flaws and I think that the visuals that this anime has to offer definitely makes it one to check out.",

            "content": "Ufotable is showing the chink in its armor with this one.\r\nLet me tell you about a very important thing that many studios have problems with but has always been able to mask it with the source materials or the visual or the soundtrack.\r\nWriting.\r\nFor me writing should be at a point where it adds into the events happening. After all, most world building and even settling are done through dialogues. This holds especially through with anime. For some reason Japanese visual arts are still obsessed with exposition, namely novel. Unlike visual arts where parts of the exposition could be told through the background or sound, wordsneed to be write or said to be used to describe the actual things and subjects. The cleverness of words stern from the fact that a writer could tell so much with so little. Incorporate these elements into visual arts requires a great deal of skills and thoughts to make the best of it. \\n\r\nFate Stay Night Unlimited Blade Works\\n\r\nPerhaps it is the fact that many people has not try out Fate Stay Night Visual Novel that lead to the rise of this particular one popularity. In all my honestly I could only describe it in one word: excruciating. It was one of the most cringe worthy adaption I could recall to date, even trump the original because that one at least has the charm of a silly, clumsy visual novel adaption. After Fate Zero I would thought Ufotable would completely revitalize in my opinion the best route in the visual novel. But at last it flop quite spectacularly in ways I didn't expect.\\n\r\nThe story is the strength of this one unfortunately and this one I can't credit Ufotable for it. This route with all of the spoiler in the world is about the main character and his path to reaffirm his own belief, forging his own weapon, personality and most importantly resolve as a person. It is such a personal and intriguing story that makes you feel this character is a person, a relate-able man rather than that silly guy with a silly idea about life. Nativity, youth and inner desire are pit against maturity, cynicism and circumstances in a battle that are build up step by step, slowly reaching its peak with all the seasoning of a struggle, feeling of lost and hopelessness. No other route has been able to freshen the main character up as much as this one. Fate feels like a trip to the countryside, quickly forgotten the moment I fall asleep on the way home. Heavenly feels is like a guided tour through a city with many attractions. Everything is almost touched and go, leaving me half wanted for more and half desired to have nothing to do with it anymore. So this one is really worth watching for someone who do not have the time to read the novel. \\n\r\nI wouldn't be able to say the same to the writing however. There are many dialogue that sounds like it was taken directly from the novel. Jesus christ, the visual novel needed to spelled out almost everything like Hideo Kajima on weed but it needed to do that because Kinoko Nasu is not a good exposition man even though he tried really hard. If you are capable of appreciate his writing then congratulation you are fitted to read 90% of the light novel out there. If you are not then like me you can go and do something meaningful instead of reading that loads of crap that sometime mixed with some rare sparkling stones, mind you stones, not gems. The effect of this importation is that sometime character makes this kind of comment such as \"he's capable of doing xyz, looks like we can't zxy\" and bloody hell did they repeatedly doing this almost every time we are introduced to someone powerful. It is so hard to swallow it all when the dialogues tickle my inner ear every 10 minutes. I never knew I hated the visual novel style of dialogue so much before watching this. It makes me lose all respect for ufotable and ended up watching their previous stuffs to reminds myself of what was done well. Kara no Kyoukai for example is rather dialog heavy as well and one part people seems to have forgotten about it is that the dialogues were the central peace of that work. Look past the cool effects we find a soft, quiet, atmospheric, intriguing show that easily eaten up every other show trying to imitate it. Admittedly it is still hindered by Nasu ineptitude for exposition that sometimes kill the atmosphere. Still its dialogues were tight, interesting and worth listening to. Unlimited Blade Work TV version dialogue is atrociously awkward especially when it comes to Rin. She used to be cool and fun to see but now she's like a talkative awkward person that is neither interesting nor fun because of the dialogues she give. They could cut out tons of dialogues but they chose not to. Maybe it has to do with the \"purist\" who wants every single minor detail from their favorite book or whatever to be adapted. It makes them feel warm in their pants or something. Some people mistaken these long exposition for pacing because they see them as things that happen between battle scenes. The battle is merely a device to further the plot and characters you know? Most if not all of the important plot points are made from the aftermath or as preparation for the next battle but the focus is still on characters and plot and not the cool visual effects. That is why I still respect and read Nasu works even though they make sleepy all the time, kind of the same thing I would say about Mr Kojima too. The conversations though completely kills it for me and it is the writing fault. \\n\r\nVisual effect is not a point of discussion really. Everyone has been referencing too Unlimited Money Works anyway. Colorful, eye-catching visual effect and high octane fights with huge frame rate are not something you should be surprised about anymore. I admit when I see them used in Kara no Kyoukai I was blown away but by now I feel kind of over it by now. I would tell you what it lacks though: art direction. Art is not really about looking life like and stuffs, it is about leaving an impression on the observer. In this case since they used up too much money on fight scenes they forgot about the dull conversations one that are as boring as you might imagine. Of course in its defense talks are often happening inside Shirou house, a place that has nothing striking at all about it. I already had this problem with ufotable since Kara no Kyoukai but forgive it because it was fresh and the dark tone was well used combining with the lighting. I vividly remembers how unimpressed the river fight in fate zero was and now unlimited blade works reminded me of that. \\n\r\nThe sound is another disappointment. DEEN might not be the best when it comes to, well anything really but the old Fate soundtrack was, let's face it, really really good. Moody atmospheric and mysterious, it almost saves that atrocious adaption. This one doesn't spin me the way the old one did, something I have noticed after Kara no Kyoukai left me with only one track that I really like. I guess Ufotable strength isn't in the music. The sound of magic and weapons are so so I guess, I can't really make comments about things I have no idea about. \\n\r\nIf I have to admit I did enjoy watching my favorite route making an appearance full length and seeing the heart scene and the dual scene brings back all the memory of my youth. However my mind keep nagging my nostalgia gut about being level headed and stuffs and regretfully I have to tell those who really like Fate Stay Night series that this one isn't bringing anything new to the table and not worth your time. If you like to start this series this one isn't really good as well because unfortunately the layout of the visual novel is actually the best to expose this storyline: Fate set up the basic concept and knowledge about this world, unlimited blade works explore the main character moral in greater detail and heavenly feels flip all the stones over. Starting the series on this one is ok I guess but the full package really comes as I have said.  If you like some cool action stuffs like Attack on Titans UBW TV barely makes it because the gore and death was the fun part of Shingeki no Kyoujin as frankly with a risk the action wouldn't be half as fun. Fate series has always been about character and world building so action fans won't be fully satisfy here. \\n\r\nThat begs the question to me, what was the point of making this one?\\n\r\nTo please the fan? As a fan I think it pretty much flopped. \\n\r\nTo jump start newcomers? The story of this one is kind of convoluted compares to Fate route.\\n\r\nMy guess is to capitalize on the Fate Zero hype. The thing is though Fate Zero great character, good dialogue, great storyline, good plot, decent writing (from the fact that a writer wrote them of course) and enough emphasis on action and tension is what made Fate Zero great. UBW doesn't have any of that stuffs. Fate Zero is a whole meal while UBW is a part of a 3 course dinner. It cannot be done the same way. \\n\r\nI do recommend trying to one out if you have not watched a Fate entry. \\n\\n\r\nBeyond the show\\n\r\nIf I have to give Ufotable one advice that would be finding a writer right now. Their show writing has always been a pillar to their show. Kara no Kyoukai blows the short movie scene with rich art, good writing and the same was made to TV show by Fate Zero. In all honestly the Japanese sucks at writing dialogues but are masters at overreaching plot. Seriously, Kojima dialogues are long and excruciating but its synopsis made me did the stupid thing of playing through the whole series many years ago when its entries are still countable with one hand (exclude the ones without the solid). Conversation writing is hard but it has been done well before and there is no reason the Japanese studio can't do it again. Bones with director Tensai did a good job on Darker than Black and older ones like Ghost in the Shell or Cowboy Bebop have proven that the Japanese has more than enough capability to bridge this gap. \\n\r\nI also want to comment on why recent Japanese games are so shit in terms of story (specifically FF series). It used to not be voiced and the writing was all we could read. The voicing ended up making their dialogues slower (due to us having to listen) and at the same time taking away the joy of imagining these voices. Chrono Trigger and FF6 with voice would be disastrous after I try playing them and talk about every piece of dialogues. Their story might retain the grandeur of old but the charm has been squashed out. FF series is even worse because all of their focus is on the shitty graphic that one honestly cares about. This is why the Fate Visual Novel for me is better even though the show is basically moving the dialogue in the game to the show. Still, Japan needs to learn more about dialogue or at least shorten them, telling them \"Dark Souls style\" that is so quintessentially Japanese that makes them so great and adored.",

            "content": "Fate/ Stay Night: Unlimited Blade Works based on the visual novel by type moon. Directed by Kenichi Takeshita. I couldnt watch more than 2 eps of the first fate stay night it just didnt trap me. . . ye. F/SN:UBW i guess the reboot, kicked ass. Action, animation, characters were all done way better of course this is my opinion. \r\nThe plot essence isn't exactly new but its interesting. So the holy grail war is whats happening and its happened before. 7 mages get a servant each and these servant are hero's of old coming back to fight once more. The grail is whats beingsought after and when obtained a wish can be granted. \\n\\n\r\nWhat was done right, the fact that its not always from Emiyas point of view (this dude is way . . . stubborn) In the beggining i was scoffing, hissing and tutting at almost everything he had to say but thanks to Rin and her point of view it wasnt to much. (you get why hes like that later on and its satisfying).\\n\r\n          The action was epic i could rewatch most of the sequences and enjoy them just as much as the first time. The mains arent OP so you see some real development of skills. \\n\r\n         The mood of this anime is kinda dark, and i guess serious with few light parts. The things i took away from the anime is one of the biggest credits i can give i feel like i have to wait a bit after some episodes and just meditate on it alil, even though i feel like they can go into somethings more i was pretty happy thinkin on it on my own.\\n\\n\r\nNot many negatives except for a minor distaste for Emiya at points. I thought it could have been longer, talking about the other mages and heros a bit more but for what was given satisfied is an understatement. \\n\\n\r\nDo i recommend this? Hell to the yes. Its well done and visually, its unique in ways that really add to the enjoyment. I rate this Badass",

            "content": "(This is a review for both seasons.)\r\nStory: 7/10 \t\r\n \tFate Stay/Night Unlimited Blade Works is the sequel to Fate/Zero and is the alternative version of Fate Stay/Night. It revolves the fifth war for the holy grail with seven masters and seven servants duking it out for the ultimate reward, which grants anyone wish. This wasn\u2019t my introduction to the Fate universe since previously I watched the critically acclaimed prequel Fate/Zero which could be comparable to Anime\u2019s Game of Thrones. Gen Urobuchi had a perfectly paced, and extremely interesting cast of characters with Fate/Zero, and after the stellar second season I craved more Fate, especially Rinwho I was really glad to find out is the main female lead of UBW. If you\u2019ve seen any Fate adaptation the basic story structure seems to be the same, but what changes with each series of films is the revolving door of characters and all the different clashing ideologies that come to a head in beautifully animated action scenes or just discussions between masters and/or servants. The actual structure of the story is a bit cliche so the action scenes and relationship building between characters really added a bit of spice and substance to the overall plot, but it still isn\u2019t anything exemplary.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nShirou Emiya-\\n\\n\r\n\tIt should go without saying but major spoilers for Fate/Zero will come up during this review, to explain character motivations and backstories. Shirou was rescued from an expansive fire by Kiritsugu after he forced for Saber to destroy the Holy Grail. He has always admired heroes of justice and always admired his adopted dad Kiritsugu. He vows to become the hero that Kiritsugu couldn\u2019t due to his old age, and it really sucks that Kiritsugu kicks the bucket before this series started since he was definitely one of the best characters in Zero. Anyways Shirou always puts others lives above his own which seems good in theory but is actually very impractical and he ever acknowledges how childish is ideologies can be but he still finds his aspirations to be too pure and good for his hypocrisy to get to him. Still he really does have the best of intentions and is probably one of the best teammates or allies that you could have, due to his tenacity and projection skills. His way of looking at things seem to match up very well with Saber\u2019s so it made sense that they got along very well throughout the series. Due to this you can\u2019t ever hate him, but it\u2019s possible that is ideologies and his persistence with them can get on your nerves.\\n\\n\r\nRin Toosaka-\\n\\n\r\n \tShe showed a ton of promise when I first watched her as a child in Zero, and she somewhat lived up to my expectations for UBW. She\u2019s extremely competent, sarcastic, and well meaning. She is the expert and was raised to become a master in the war for the Holy Grail. She is a bit of a tsundere considering she is pretty stern, proper, and easily agitated on the outside, but on the inside she\u2019s a big softie. She thinks very practically, the opposite of Shiro who\u2019s is impulsive as hell. Also I just love her voice in this dub, and her voice also stuck out in particular for me with Zero. The only thing that I thought was done a bit poorly was her relationship with Shirou. The pacing of it didn't feel natural at all to me, and that they just had them get together in the end/epilogue to tie everything in a nice little bow. Like it makes sense for Shirou, but when didn\u2019t she have such a change of heart considering how lovey dovey she seemed with Shirou in the Epilogue. Again, besides that she is golden.\\n\\n\r\nSaber-\\n\\n\r\n \tShe\u2019s the heroic spirit summoned by Shirou, and she was King Arthur. She is really strong, and well meaning. She seems to share the same heroic aspirations as Shirou, though she regrets how her past went down, and if she had the holy grail that would have been the one thing that she would change. She character seemed quite a bit different in UBW compared to Zero, since she always seemed more doubting and untrusting compared to how she acts in UBW. She seemed to trust Shirou a lot more even though he is a pretty incompetent mage at the beginning, like she seemed too carefree when she was summoned, like her character was altered slightly. This might just be a nitpick, but it was eating at me a little bit while I was watching UBW. Still she is has a ton of chivalrous badass moments, that any little flaws in her character\u2019s consistency can be overlooked. \\n\\n\r\nAnimation/Art Style: 10/10\\n\\n\r\n\tUfotable have done an incredible job with all their entries in the fate series in the visual department. The animation and artstyle of UBW are motion picture quality, everything just looks so crisp and beautiful, that you could stare at still frames for hours just to bask in the magnificence of it all. The action scenes are very fluid and high in intensity. I have no qualms with anything visually, I even love how most of the characters look. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 8/10\\n\\n\r\n\tThe soundtrack is filled to the brim with orchestral pieces, which get you pumped for the eye candy to come. The scale of the soundtrack is grand, with many pieces fitting the mood to a tee, though most of it is supplementary and can\u2019t really stand on its own, unless you have a large hankering for some orchestral music. There are some more exotic pieces too, which gives off a mysterious and calming vibe. Both openings look gorgeous and sound good, but I for the life of me can\u2019t remember how either of them go, so overall they are enjoyable but not quality enough to stick with you after the fact.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8/10\\n\\n\r\n\tSome of this may have sounded harsh, but I still did enjoy UBW quite a lot. The action and animation are top notch, and I love a couple characters in  the main cast. But UBW has a couple things going against it. 1. The plot still isn\u2019t anything to write home about, and even some of the solid writing can\u2019t save it, and 2. the second half falters quite a bit when it nears its end. Nothing in this series struck a chord with me like Zero did, but if you want learn more about this interesting universe, and just want to have a fun and enjoyable time then definitely check this series out. I would say start with Zero then watch this (though I haven\u2019t seen the 2006 alternative version, and do really have any plans of doing so in the future).",

            "content": "I watched this entire series over the weekend.  \"Why wasn't I watching this earlier?\"  is my only question. \r\nStory(8/10) \r\nUBW has a few key differences to FSN in terms of who the story focuses on. It had an episode zero which focused entirely on Rin Tohsaka  the female main character of this series. The story tends to give more focus on Rin and Archer than its predecessor FSN did.  Since this is based on the visual novel UBW follows the true ending to the Unlimited Blade Works arc. I feel Unlimited Blade works universe set one of the darker precedents inthe Fate Stay universe and the plot often reflects this tone. \\n\r\nArt (9/10) \\n\r\nThis is partially what made me quit Fate Stay Night and kept me watching UBW. The art is gorgeous in this series. When it isn't a thrilling  action scene, it's a stunning background showing a colorful landscape. I really love the landscape shots in this series and how they bring life to the characters in this show. \\n\r\nSound(9/10) \\n\r\nMost of the OST is great. I did watch the OP and ED the first time but skipped it subsequent times. The VAs on this show are also very good.  I can't think of a Japanese VA that wasn't originally from Fate Stay Night.  Due to there being more Archer in this series, you can tell the work Junichi Suwabe put into his lines and delivery. He plays the perfect manipulative jerk. \\n\r\nCharacter (8/10) \\n\r\nI only give this an eight out of 10 because I hate Shinji and they focused less on Sakura. Although it detracted from the focus on Saber, I felt that the focus on Tohsaka, and Archer and their relationship to Shirou was a very good thing in terms of character development. I didn't like Shirou at first as the main protagonist. Good selfless characters feel dull to me. This show did a good job of averting this and even addressing the problems with such a character. Shirou's flaws felt well portrayed. As for the 8/10, this might be a minor gripe, but out of two siblings Sakura and Shinji, they decided to focus more on the one I can't stand.  There are characters who are jerks in this show(i.e Archer, Gilgamesh) , but I felt like Shinji had no fleshing out character wise. He was just a borderline-rapist coward slime and every scene he lived was an irritating one.  \\n\r\nEnjoyment(10/10) \\n\r\nJust the general environment of this show appeals to me. The action was amazing and I loved the OST . The characters were interesting and enjoyable(exception Shinji). I was hooked by the plot. In conclusion, I would recommend giving this show a watch.",

            "content": "In a world where Masters fight for the Holy Grail, a novice mage is thrown into the mix. Fate brings to my plate something that I can't really explain, but it threw me in for a ride.\r\nStory: Fate starts off with the premise of what is basically a magical girl anime (y'know, with the whole having an aptitude for something), but then retracts that claim in order to set up what I think is a solid story. The events all match up and are timed so that you aren't overwhelmed but also aren't bored. You get your relationship building, your backstories, and your action allin one large, but manageable package. I felt that the build ups were done well too, and tension before something was done skillfully.\\n\\n\r\nArt: Besides the obvious fact that this was done by ufotable, and thus should obviously come out as having amazing art, I'll give my opinions on it. Art was, as stated, really good. Transitions and animations were smooth, and scenes with magic really stand out. Fight scenes are also animated well, even having some \"3D\" sections that look great. Expressions on the characters are also really well drawn, and the mood of any scene is so noticeable that I bet someone without any prior knowledge could walk in the room and immediately understand what is going on. \\n\\n\r\nSound: Voice acting in Fate was like what I normally review for other animes, but it goes the extra mile with the battle scenes. Fate's voice acting in battle scenes are what I believe to be the highlight when it comes to their VAs. Sure, it's limited to one emotion, but that is conveyed the best when compared to the other scenes. Even so, really emotional scenes are still really well voice acted, and you can still get a kick out of those. But enough of that, now onto the main event: the music. Fate has some of the best background music of any anime that I've watched so far, and that's really something. The music prepares you for battle, puts you into the battle, and also intensifies the mood overall of the scenes. Even the opening is something to be noted, as that eases you into whatever the episode is going to be, whether a casual and less action packed episode, or one that's filled with just that. The ED is a bit more tame, but still does a great job of easing the viewer out of an episode. Overall, sound was done extremely well.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: Alright, here's where the anime suffers just a bit. It's not like I don't like the characters, but I think that they could have been done better. Emiya is portrayed as a defender of justice, whose ideals prevent him from seeing the bigger picture, and ultimately are the cause for most of his downfalls. He's not a bad protag, but I just wanted to see him change, and maybe become more like Archer, you know? Anyways, onto Rin. Rin is our series staple tsundere, but I feel that she was done a bit better. Rin's overall character feels a bit stuck up, but I will say that it fits her character. She's not exactly unlikeable, but it is a bit hard to like her at first. She, and like Emiya, take a bit of time to adjust to, but they end up being alright in the end. Now, Archer. Archer was, in my opinion, the best character in this season. He starts off as a mysterious and also cocky man, but in time is shown to act his way due to what he has to experience. He's relatable, and also uses his cockiness and sarcastic personality in moderation, making him not annoying. Archer also comes off as basically Emiya if he was a bit more experienced in life, and were to know that you can't save everyone. Besides the fact I do know who all the servants are, I can put myself in the place of someone who doesn't and still know that Archer is someone that should be noted.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: I enjoyed this anime very much, if you couldn't tell. Actually, so much, that I binged 10 episodes in one day. I'll get more into specifics in the Overall portion.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: My thoughts overall on this series is that it was solid. It had amazing sound and visuals, but also had a story that was pleasing to follow. The only thing that could be improved on in my opinion was character, but this show did it in a way that even character wasn't that bad. In the end, everything was how I wanted it to be, and was enjoyable to the end. If you've not watched this yet, but have watched any other Fate series, I highly recommend UBW.",

            "content": "The intention of this review is to cover the series as a whole, including the 2nd season. The Fate series are quite famous and not in need of much introduction. If you are reading this, you probably have already some experience with them. (Note that I mainly rate based on enjoyment and my opinions are subjective to my personal tastes and kindness).  \r\nStory\r\nThe storyline is an alternative course of events to the previous anime Fate/stay night from the 2006. During the first few episodes, the events are the same with the 2006 version, but then the characters start to make different decisions which leadto different events. The story flowed quite nicely and I was always left with anticipation for the next episode. Towards the last episodes though, I did get the feeling that some parts were dragged much longer in duration than necessary as if the creators did not have other material to fill the required episodes. However, it wasn't that bad and it didn't affect the overall flow. With that said, it doesn't mean that there aren't a couple of things here and there that do not reasonably match with the expected result. However, I am keeping my reservations on that matter as humans are always unpredictable :P  There was also a point to the story that everyone had realised a specific secret about one of the characters (including the audience), but it took several episodes to come out in the open, which somehow stole a bit of the element of surprise regarding the plot shift. I did feel some dissatisfaction that certain characters did not learn few truths about the others, but I suppose that this was how things were to end up in this timeline. In terms of action, it surely had very well directed and memorable battle scenes. These complimented well the story and the conflicts between the characters. \\n\\n\r\nArt\\n\r\nIn terms of the graphic art, I consider the anime of very high quality. The colours, the details of the scenes, and the animation are all very carefully and elegantly designed. But, surely that is something to be expected by the ufotable studio (of which I confess I am a fan, so maybe there is some bias there). The art and colours definitely fit the fantasy theme of the series and made it memorable and lively. The designs of the characters resemble the 2006 version but are more detailed and more appealing. Yet, you can still relate them to their previous versions. \\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\r\nThe voices of the characters were the same as the 2006 version, as well as the Fate/Zero anime. I personally believe that the voices fit the characters personality and it's nice to have this sort of consistency through the different series. The soundtrack was also really good. Especially the chores accompanying the battle scenes were giving off that epic feeling that is expected in such moments. There are a few tracks from the soundtrack that have made it into my music playlists. I did not find the opening and ending songs of both seasons memorable or stuck in my head, but there are nice tracks and fit the anime's aura. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter\\n\r\nA great deal of the series revolves around Shirou's desire/dream. This desire/dream can be considered either as a flaw or a strength, and through the story the audience is given arguments for both sides. In general, I believe that all the characters explained well their actions and the reasons for which they took a specific side over another. The arguments are well rounded and really important in order to understand the characters' personality. There were a couple of times that I felt that some characters were presented too clever or knowledgeable despite their age for the sake of progressing the plot. But I easily overlooked that part. On a side note, I find Gilgamesh, one of the main antagonists, as one of the most interesting personalities I have come across despite of his rotten side (or maybe because of that). Either way, he is a bonus to the show (and of course the actor who is voicing him - I absolutely love it). \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment\\n\r\nI confess that in terms of satisfaction, I was expecting something similar with the Fate/Zero. The creators tried to do so, but it didn't get as far. Of course, the series were very enjoyable and thought provoking.  In the future, I would definitely like to re-watch the parts of the series where the most interesting arguments and impressive battles happened. To conclude, I would recommend this anime whether you are a fan of the franchise or not. \\n\\n",

            "content": "Okay, heads up, I will be vaguely comparing this work to the original 2006 anime. So, there maybe a few slight spoilers here and there. Nothing that will ruin your own watchthrough, though.\r\nSo, I was under the impression that UBW would be essentially a remake of the 2006 series except from Rin's POV instead of Shirou's. That isn't the case, though. If I understand correctly, the three routes (Fate, UBW, Heaven's Feel) serve to simply hook Shirou up with Saber, Rin, and Sakura respectively. Naturally, who he falls for affects the story, so there are some differences in how things go down. Also, the originalanime heavily focused on Saber as the main Servant, giving us her backstory, etc. while UBW focuses on Archer and his origins. \\n\\n\r\nAnyway, with those logistics out of the way, I'll say that I really enjoyed this first season. I recommend watching the 2006 anime as well because it's quite fun to see where the two diverge vs. where they're the same. I do think I prefer the Fate route to the UBW route (so far, anyway, I haven't watching the second season, obviously). I found the story between Saber and Shirou so magical, but I also love learning more about Rin in this route so I still have a lot of love for UBW.\\n\\n\r\nAnyway, yeah, that's it. Solid first season. Solid story.",

            "content": "Another day, another review I write about an Anime that has been covered to death. But, seeing as \"Fate/Zero\" is my favorite Anime series this one is mandatory. \"Fate/stay night: Unlimited Blade Works\" is an unusual series due to the fact it's a re-make of a series that \"Fate/Zero\" was the prequel to, making this more of a sequel than an original work. But, seeing how \"Fate/Zero\" was superior to it's predecessor in every way one would grant the creators a chance to go back in order to go forward. Confused yet? Me, too. Anyway, on to the meat of the review.\r\nFantasy/Action Anime doesn't getmuch better than this series overall. The story is a strong one, with many good characters, twists, turns, and exciting action. It loses a point or two from me because it takes a lot of the time in a high school, with half the cast comprised of students and teachers. I swear if Anime had a Toon Town it would be one, giant high school. But, I digress. The artwork is very good, enriched with CG effects and great sound, and provides some gorgeous battle sequences and unique characters that take part in them. This is by far the strongest part of Season 1 and kudos to the writers for picking a great spot for a mid-series break. \\n\\n\r\nThe Sub vs. Dub battle is one of the closest I've had to judge in a long time, and I honestly prefer the English Dub a bit more than the Japanese. You can't go wrong with either, tho. The difficult part of this review is that it's only for the first half of the series. And it's very good, it has it's slow points while it throws exposition at you, but it gives you a great ride and sets itself up for a thrilling conclusion. Overall, I wouldn't put this series quite on the level of \"Fate/Zero\" but it holds up very well. 8/10. Look forward to Season 2. Check it out.",

            "content": "After watching the main Anime adaptations of the Fate series I must say that I'm very glad to have experienced this series. Episode after episode I get more interested and attached to Fate and because of good reason.\r\nWhat I love about Fate is actually that it contains everything of what one would want to see in a series. \r\nFrom a serious, outstanding story to average slice of life elements and even romance. And Fate manages to balance all of these elements without failure in my opinion. \r\nSo far I've only seen the Anime adaptations but after this almost overwhelming marathon I'm absolutely ready to readthe original visual novel and I'm definitely excited of what the original story will deliver.\\n\\n\r\nAs for this review:\\n\\n\r\nStory: Fate/Stay Night Unlimited Blade Works adapts the second route of the original visual novel (from what I've read) pretty faithfully. The story will surely make you think thoroughly about your own self and everyone who watched the Anime will exactly know what I mean....\\n\r\nOne of the most maturely narrated stories I've ever seen.\\n\\n\r\nArt: Oh, god the animation...Words can't describe how gorgeous it is. Seriously, I can't say anything more to this section because I'm absolutely in awe with it.\\n\\n\r\nSound: Beautiful openings and endings. Every single one was remarkable and I think you won't be disappointed with the mesmerizing artist that is called Aimer.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: Well, admittedly I do have some issues with the main character but his personality is unusal and unique so I can't argue about that. In fact, actually no one in Fate is predictable or straight up stereotypical, another strong point in the series and I think everyone will eventually find his own, personal favourite.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: I instantly got hooked, the excitement I felt was incredible and I enjoyed the hell out of it. This goes for the whole series respectfully.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: I honestly think that we need more stories like these, stories who will provoke thought, who will make us question about our own philosophy and lastly about humanity itself. If we don't question our own lives and ideals then we will always be stuck in a repeated circle of a monochrome mindset. That's how I'm interpreting this story and it's huge message for everyone. \\n\r\nBut of course not everyone can think of it like that so watch the Anime and then make up your own opinion. Whether you'll like it or not is completely up to you but I think you won't get disappointed.",

The GLORIOUS artwork, animation and soundtracks easily put it among my top 3 favorite anime series in this decade!\r\nMy favorite character is Archer: the unique design, the calmness, the no-nonsense attitude, the sarcasm, cynicism, assessments of others, and even \"old-man talk\" (haha). I love every fight that Archer engages in in this anime. Even though he's not a 5-star Servant in terms of power, he manages to pull win after win against tough opponents by utilizing tactics --He's a symbol of \"trying your best\".\\n\\n\r\nI must say, watching Ufotable's adaptation is much more satisfying than reading the VN, because I get to see the most fantastic, epic, eye-pleasing battles that one can ever see in the anime world. I also get to see the characters' movements and interactions - which I can only imagine in my head when reading the VN. I also am extremely pleased to see that Ufotable's adaptation stay faithful to the original VN work! Although all internal monologues are cut out, the anime - through its amazing animation - successfully conveys all the subtleties in the ways the characters interact and fight.\\n\\n\r\nThere is no other company that I would entrust this franchise to. I am looking forward to Ufotable's adaption of Fate/Stay Night: Heaven's Feel. I also hope that they will adapt Fate/Hollow Ataraxia soon!\\n\\n\r\nMy favorite OST is EMIYA theme ! Absolutely epic!",

Now today we are gonna be tackling, Fate/stay night: Unlimited blade works. Specifically the first season in this review, I will rate the second season and make  a review as well. Though for now lets just discuss the first half of...\r\nwhat I believe to be one of the best looking anime that I have ever seen, in most anime the production studio will emphasize the quality of some scenes over other scenes. This leaves you with a final product that looks well, distorted in a weirdway. It's not that the animation is bad, but the animation either doesn't feel fluid in scenes with just exposition and dialogue or some scenes feel alienated from others because of the difference in animation. Let me tell you that with this anime that sure as hell isn't the case with this, each scene is animated to look amazing whether it's exposition or another on off Fates amazing action sequences. Not only showcasing it's huge budget, but its amazing team. The writing characters are also just so well written and feel so real each given a motivation instead of forcing conflict. All in all after looking back over this anime I give this anime a nine out of ten, the only thing stopping me from giving this anime a ten out of ten are the some small nit picks. Though this anime is a must see, I would have to say you should watch the original Fate/stay night. I hope this review helped your decision on watching this anime, and tell me what anime  you want me to review in the future. Have a great day my otaku friends",

            "content": "***talks about season 2 as well\"\"\"\r\nFirst things first, if you walk into this show expecting a masterpiece similar to Fate/Zero, you'll need to reevaluate your expectations. This show is by no means a bad show; in fact, it's probably better than most of the anime out there. But as a Zero sequel, it falls flat. This is the inevitable problem of adapting a VN, since an anime on a single route leaves out so much and never feels quite complete. Ufotable did the best it could with what it was given, but the show couldn't meet the standard Zero set.\r\nWhat went wrong? Naturally, when adaptinga VN to anime, you'll need to cut out ALOT of details. The visual novel was essentially alot of cooking, eroge scenes and story, and I'm glad Ufotable got rid of the former two. They could have, however, focused on fleshing out the major points of the story well, as this is where the problem starts. Shirou, the protagonist of the series, is never given any depth or good backstory; we simply get a few PTSD flashbacks that show us he had a hard time in his past, but we are never given insight into his mind. So, whenever he does something stupid (which is 100% of the time), you can't help but hate him and ask why he's so irrational. And since he's the focus of the show, he just brings the story down. Besides him, the other characters are actually interesting, and it's a shame they weren't fleshed out at the expense of Shirou. \\n\\n\r\nThe redeeming qualities of this show are definitely Archer and Gilgamesh. Archer combats Shirou's stupidity with actual rational thought and complex backstory, and Gilgamesh is a good villain like always. Unfortunately, the series does not provide any closure for alot of the things left open-ended in Fate/Zero (Kirei reviving the Grail and settling his dispute with the Emiyas/Matous, Saber redeeming herself, etc).",

I kinda skimmed a lot of the series watched some action fights (The only good parts), but I just couldn\u2019t save it.

            "content": "First I want to split my review into two parts, one that I wrote months ago referred to the first season (without being influenced by the vision of the second season), and my analysis on the second half\r\n\u00a0First season (I had not yet seen the second part):\r\n\u00a0Assuming that the vote (10) takes into account the enormous hype caused by a season finale adapted to the great future as compared to the second part of this will be nothing in comparison.\r\n\u00a0Finally after the horrific souls of Deen, \"Fate / Stay Night\" is a truly transposition with all the trimmings: the work goes to narrate the firsthalf of the events of the Second Route, \"Unlimited Blade Works\"; compared to the visual novel are reading added managed by the original author (Kinoko Nasu), many pleasant and some avoidable (too many clues about a plot twist that there will be on the second part).\\n\\n\r\n\u00a0With regard to animations confirm only a matter of course, nothing short of extraordinary and perfect, unprecedented, the Ufotable proves the best in the industry, this accopagnato by a director who very often will prove both professional and engaging, not counting the really beautiful music and well-aimed.\\n\\n\r\n\u00a0I prefer not to say too much about the plot in the review, as the basic story in opera is not anything compared to its development (in a story good is meant, though there are exceptions), but even here the premises are intriguing, we He finds himself in an urban fantasy context. Seven selected must fight each other to the grail and each will have its own servant, a historical figure (like Alexander the Great) or mythological (Hercules type) so large as to be reincarnated as a heroic spirit, a powerful \"familiar\" that may belong to a seven classes, all balanced in Surprising so although there are powerful servant.\\n\r\n\u00a0What I just described leads to a result, spectacular crashes with a realizazione sublime and comparisons of different skills that will keep the viewer has pasted to the screen; \"Fate / Stay Night\" is focusing on the battles and believe me when I tell you about this in addition to not be second to none there is not the slightest comparison; even so there will be many quiet parts, no middle or entire episodes devoted to the battle or several bets without a shred of action that carratterizano still very characters and are very accessible thanks to the advancement of the well-kept plot.\\n\\n\r\n\u00a0If they asked me with a gun at the head of list of the imperfections and to be more critical can probably cite a lightweight script error that I noticed in the prologue (ask for that class is the enemy servant has just shouted it from the rooftops when Rin) and it takes to complain, also a detail of the character design you might not like is the nose of Rin (have it always with you ... and it is the female protagonist of this route), which could be corrected in Blue -Ray, not counting that will improve the already sublime animations (I do not exaggerate in saying that even so is already the anime with the best graphics of the story, for the moment)\\n\\n\r\n\u00a0The history as well as explaining in detail every aspect of the universe in which it is set in no way loses its base, resulting intressante much as on relationships and on affection of the characters because of developments and interesting topics, in short a complete series that in its right duration becomes a development \"slow\" in place that creates a lot of waiting for the second part, and it will be them who will elevate \"Fate / Stay Night\" in what I consider one of the greatest masterpieces.\\n\r\n\u00a0A first part realized on paper with all the trimmings, however, recommended to anyone, even to those who rightly hated the previous \"adaptations\" of \"Stay Night\", this is the only and true souls (possibly gamble the first route, the visual novel, or wait hopeful that Ufotable suited to the souls, the story was conceived in a certain order).\\n\\n\\n\r\n\u00a0Second season: now I can say, it exceeded all expectations! Withdrawing what I said, you can begin to Make these souls, maybe the 10-episode event seem even adjusted but patience (obviously aware of this), they did so to facilitate viewing for those who come for the first time to the series, thus without using Zero as a reference point (big mistake, you'll understand why considering that what was seen only after all three of the route), you can start from here.\\n\\n\r\n\u00a0Going back to the second part, each episode is now thick, directing, music and graphics have reached new levels of quality, compared to the first season there was a noticeable leap and themes have their say, with depth and why not also with a spectacular never seen before (or very rarely at this level at least).\\n\\n\r\n\u00a0Sure, it's not the perfect fit, is not even equal to the Visual Novel, there is some small quibble and it is also true that certain parts present in VN would be good (complete Chant dell'UBW, or the final sentences that were replaced with something equally epic that gives the same effect), but I can confirm that they made up!\\n\r\n\u00a0All new components improve the product in some respects and some of those already present in the original have been adapted even better, to make examples (I do Spoiler) the end of the episode 20 or the final battle, which is the battle the most beautiful in the history of animation (and I'm not exaggerating), Ufotable did wonders, a few needles in the haystack is definitely overwhelmed by everything else, which I would call excelled.\\n\\n\r\n\u00a0It is also true that this individual is an incomplete souls, however, only fit a scenario, some characters are put aside but only because the protagonists of the other route, so quiet is normal, I say this because this review will serve both for those who want to see these souls or for those who have already seen it and want infromarsi on certain details.\\n\r\n\u00a0Despite being a third of the total, that alone limits its potential (and with other scenarios bloom completely) individually it shows an indisputable quality, spectacular battles, the sudden plot developments, but above all by a beautiful message it that was made to perfection (the conquest of themselves), the series will dig on the characters and their ideologies, from what the comparison between their ideal with reality, and how humankind can not bear the weight of their own desires, this melancholy will be topped with a desire to move on ..... get ready to see the beautiful, but also the raw or emotional, but do not force (the consistency is omnipresent in this series, suppur certain parts are difficult to understand, or more precisely analyze is complex, nevertheless even those run as smooth as silk, with a sublime narration, studied but smooth).\\n\\n\r\n\u00a0Ultimately it is a complete work in many respects, highly recommended more than any other anime is proof that the Japanese animation is not dropped one iota but rather offers us (thank you!) Yet these milestones",

            "content": "\u00abThe one who obtains the Holy Grail will have any wish come true. \u00bb\r\nThe story of the Holy Grail is a well-known legend that already inspired numerous movies and books. Therefore, having an anime on this subject is not surprising, but it\u2019s still an intriguing mixture of cultures. In 2004, the Japanese game company Type-Moon released the visual novel \u201cFate/stay night\u201d, a very long game including 3 different versions (routes) of one story. The release was a huge success, and rapidly secured the title of the highest selling visual novel in 2004. Consequently, a lot of adaptions followed: manga, anime, light novels, video games\u2026\r\nFate: UnlimitedBlade Works (UBW) is the adaptation of the second route of the original game, I highly recommend watching Fate/Stay night and Fate/Zero before UBW. Since it\u2019s another version of the same story, the story alone is understandable for the Fate neophyte but there will be references that you will not get.\\n\\n\r\nThe story takes place in the city of Fuyuki, Emiya Shirou is a normal hardworking student, with the exception of his heavy past: his parents died in a fire when he was a kid and he was saved by a man called Kiritsugu Emiya, which is no longer of this world. These events cause Shirou to be a very altruistic person, helping others even when it\u2019s at his expense.\\n\\n\r\nAfter staying late at school to clean the archery dojo, Shirou stumbles upon a battle between two magical beings called Servants. Servants are the reincarnation of heroes of all time, superhuman warriors fighting in the Holy Grail War under the command of 7 Master, sorcerers seeking the Grail. Of course Shirou didn\u2019t know any of that when witnessing the scene and is quickly spotted despite trying to stay hidden. One of the two servants, for the sake of the secrecy of the war, goes after Shirou and pierce his heart with a spear. But Shirou didn\u2019t die that night, his life was saved by an unknown person and he finds himself unwillingly carried in a secret war between magi.\\n\\n\r\nThis story is sublimated by the best animation I\u2019ve seen for an anime TV series: everything is full of details, the scenery is a spectacle even in the most banal scenes, the movements are fluid and natural and the fight scenes incredibly rich.\\n\\n\r\nConcerning the sound, the voice acting doesn\u2019t fail the iconic characters and the music has some really good themes and even after finishing the show I like listening to the OST of UBW.\\n\\n\r\nI\u2019ve been told several times that 10 is maybe a little high for this anime, but Unlimited Blade Works really matched my expectations for the second route of the Visual novel.\\n",

            "content": "I write this for both seasons. After seeing Fate/stay night (FSN), I could immediately tell that in terms of quality, this was made better. I liked FSN better, but this would appeal to critics more. Why?\r\nThe plotline is more logical than that of FSN, for one thing. The events are more combat-based, which I of course enjoyed, and Shirou is not so focused on Saber. (Although that was precisely why I loved FSN.) The art, again, is awesome, and the fight scenes are magnificent. One of the facets to the enormous diamond of anime is that the fight scenes are so fast to the humaneye and that characters are wickedly good at fighting. In comparison to FSN, Unlimited Blade Works (UBW) was also more focused on Shirou's realization of his ideals. To fight for others, regardless of the consequences. To summon weapons from nothing but his mind, continuously too. One of the best anime titles, too. Take an anime like FMAB or Code Geass. The titles are apt, yes, but nothing extraordinary. Take the Fate/stay night series. Most creative titles I know so far, since you can't really tell what they mean. You can guess. Bleach is interesting, I'm on episode 19 and I'm still pondering...\\n\\n\r\nPardon the digression. The art is brilliant. The sound, like that of FSN, is great, but less emotional and more driven. The character is less focused on Saber and more focused on Saber and Rin. Rin, I have to say, is a strong character. Not very attractive in my opinion in the UBW version (FSN is better), but nevertheless a good tsundere. The characterization of Shirou Emiya and his quest to discover who he is -- now that is what drives this anime. After all, all stories are delineated by setting and driven by characters, who manifest the plot. If you want to see good fight scenes, strong characters, and AWESOME opening themes -- I mean, Ideal White and Brave Shine (also good titles) are two of my favorites. Not only are the vocals awesome but the action within the opening is good, too. If an opening is really good, that means the creators of the particular anime were motivated to do so, which means the anime itself is worthy of watching.",

            "content": "Fate/Zero was amazing, but does Ufotable bring justice to the original deal. Absolutely! Though, it isn't quite as polished.\r\nAs per usual with Ufotable Fate productions, the animation and soundtrack are amazing. I can even look over the fact that they use the stock metal clanging sound that Garry's Mod uses (to be frank, who doesn't use them?) because the anime looks and sounds so breathtaking.\r\nThat being said, the story, I'm afraid, doesn't have the polish that is present in Zero. It likes to add a lot of SOL elements that, while being faithful to the novel, drags the plot to a halt at many points.Also, the characters are great, but their motivations are not convincing sometimes. For instance, Shirou wants to be a hero of justice, but the how and why are kind of vague. Rin wants to protect Shirou, but it's never really defined why. A lifedebt? love? They for the most part are clearer near the end, but can be irritating to sit through early. That said, Shirou and Rin do go through a healthy deal of character development that helps the watcher feel more attached to them. Though, it can't be said for other otherwise great characters, like Rin and especially Illya (I haven't even seem Prisma Illya and I'm already in love with her character, but not in a Chris Hansen Way. Also for the record, she's 18-19). \\n\\n\r\nBack to topic, Ufotable makes up for the less substance with even more style. Big explosions that would make Michael Bay jealous, and lightshows galore. The battles are not quite as intelligent or calculated as Zero, but are intensely great in a Dragon Ball or Pretty Cure way as in lots of contact, great animation, and lots of crap thrown around.  \\n\\n\r\nThe dub is pretty good. I didn't watch the sub yet, will probably try that next time. Mela Lee as Rin sounds kinda scratchy but gets the flustered teen right. Shirou sounds like your typical shounen protagonist, but then again, he kinda is (at least in UBW). David Vincent as Gilgamesh and Crispin Freeman as Kirei, as usual is deviously great. Kari Wahlgren also nails Saber yet again.\\n\\n\r\nSo, to conclude it isn't as good as Zero, but it had pretty big shoes to fill, and I think it filled them pretty good. \\n\\n\r\nRECOMMENDATION: HIGH\\n\\n\r\nPS: I would like to point out, if you are a newcomer, you shouldn't start the with this one, since it retroactively spoils much of Fate/Zero since it was made in part with it in mind, and as such many plot points from it are mentioned. \\n\\n\r\nThere are three good options\\n\\n\r\n1. Watch Fate/Zero, if you can't get the visual novel and don't want to watch the Deen adaptation.\\n\\n\r\n2. Read the VN and then watch Zero.\\n\\n\r\n3. Watch the serviceable (so I'm told) 2006 Deen adaptation that focuses on the Fate route.\\n\\n\r\nZero was written with Stay Night in mind so it's preferable to watch either the 2006 anime or read the novel first if you managed to know this fact, which I didn't unfortunately,  but don't watch this before Zero.",

While there is lots of it in UBW as well, does it have some lighthearted moments to break up all the dark things going on.\r\nUfotable definitely doesn't hold back,cause the animations in UBW is simply outstanding. The battles are crazy amazing, by epic proportions. This composed with great music and sounds make it even greater. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters have a great mix of interesting ones, all from Servants to Masters. Shirou is a very odd and different one, as he live for his extreme ideals, as he try to survive the chaos he been thrown into.\\n\r\nRin is moody and have a switching temper! Though consider previous events am I not surprised if she have lot's of suppressed memories and she takes it out with her mood.\\n\r\nBut in general do I think the characters are very good and interesting, some more than others!\\n\\n\r\nThrough and through, did I really enjoy this anime for it's outstanding animation, interesting characters and simply well composited. Though as usual can it be hard where to start with the Fate series, but oh well. xD\\n\\n\r\nFor me was the show very emotional and gripping at times, not as powerful as Zero, but definitely up there and is a great anime either you like action, well animation or Fate in general. I think it's worth a watch!\\n\\n\r\nAnd my reaction to the entire show https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLFiDOren6dOULFaYDUYJqBgF4_AFocW7_ I'm still amazed by the beauty of this anime!",

            "content": "Nine years after the release of the original Fate/Stay Night, here I find myself writing a review for none other but Fate/Stay Night. However, this is not just another repeat/summary but rather a completely different route, and one that brings FSN into alignment with the events of Fate/Zero. For those who have watched the original FSN, the beginning may seem familiar but soon the divergence becomes strikingly apparent. For those who have watched the FSN UBW movie, this is a much more thorough version of that movie (unfortunately, you will know most of the large plot twists already). For those who have watched Fate/Zero, you'llfinally get your contiguous story line. If you have been in a vacuum and not seen any Type Moon works of the FSN series, I recommend starting with Fate/Zero.\\n\\n\r\nThis review encompasses both seasons of this latest iteration of FSN and will use Fate/Zero as a standard for comparison (and will assume that you have watched it). Oh, and most importantly, this is the Tousaka route (the original FSN featured Saber's route and the upcoming movie FSN Heaven's Feel will showcase Sakura's route); Tousaka addicts rejoice, this show overflows with Kana Ueda's spot on tsundere performance.\\n\\n\r\nSo how does the latest FSN stack up? The production values are right up there with Fate/Zero and the story is pretty much an extended version of the UBW movie. I do feel that some characters had a much diminished role as compared to the original FSN, and overall it isn't as dark (and male-voice dominated) as Fate/Zero. Nonetheless, this still ranks as a must see; it truly sets the bar for what you can get for what ApexE aptly terms \"Unlimited Budget Works\". Moreover, if you happen to be a Tousaka fan, this is an absolute no brainer.\\n\\n\r\nIf you're so inclined as to pick up this show, do note that there is a special episode 0 (Rin's version of episode 1 really) and episode 25 (epilogue that tidies things up nicely).\\n\\n\r\nAnimation:\\n\r\nThe overall animation is absolute eye candy. The list of outstanding qualities in this show was so long that I literally had to jot notes to keep track of what I liked. To start, the colorization is very well done, and is at the very least on par with Fate/Zero. One of the best animated sunsets I've ever seen was in Fate/Zero; they must have heard me or something as they once again do an amazing transition, this time at the very end of the epilogue. Backgrounds are in general sharp and well drawn; I particularly liked the nighttime cityscapes. As with Fate/Zero, expect the color palette to create a dark, somewhat menacing atmosphere- the show definitely feels a bit darker than the original FSN.\\n\\n\r\nThere were some rough edges in the production, however. The show has some of the best looking CGI-generated water that I've ever seen, yet also has some of the most mechanical-looking walking students that I've witnessed. Character-wise, all the characters from FSN return though with differing importance from the original- there's a lot less of Sakura, Ilya, and Saber than in the original (though Saber's behavior here fits more with her performance from F/Z). What particularly stood out for me was the attention to the character behaviors. From the way Tousaka prances her way across the screen to Ilya's effortless, innocent expression while telling Berserker to kill others, the subtle details really show that they went the extra effort to make this truly a work of art.\\n\\n\r\nYou won't be disappointed in the action department either. The battles here, though brief, are amazing to behold. From the smoke that billows around Saber's invisible sword to the bright sparks from clashing blades and shockwaves after body attacks- everything is top notch. Granted, if you don't like gore and blood, some parts of the show may be a bit dark, but assuming that you survived F/Z you should be fine here. Ecchi is really not a focus here, and despite the H-nature of the original VN, you won't be seeing a lot of skin ship between Shirou and Tousaka. That being said, an embarrassed Tousaka in brassiere hugging a pillow is perhaps adequate recompense.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nAs much as I hate to say it, I prefer the music in the original FSN and F/Z to the work here. There are definitely throwbacks to the original such as the reuse of Disillusion as an insert song, but the OP/EDs and BGM just aren't as memorable. The show has a total of two OPs and two EDs. The first OP has some good vibes but doesn't have the mystery or strong melody of Disillusion. The second OP comes across similarly; it's a decent OP but feels a bit slow considering the show's brisk pacing. Ufotable's association with Kalafina continues with both the EDs, the second of which is the stronger of the two.\\n\\n\r\nThe VA cast should be familiar to those who watched the original. As far as I could tell, the entirety of the original cast returns for this grand reunion. Despite the almost decade since the first FSN, everyone sounds as you'd expect- perhaps only even better given their seasoned experience. Regardless, Kana Ueda is hands down the queen of this show, and gives an absolutely superb performance.\\n\\n\r\nStory:\\n\r\nEmiya Shirou has never known happiness; he felt that he never deserved any as the sole survivor of the great fire at the end of Fate/Zero. As fate would have it, this novice user of magic (and adopted son of Emiya Kiritsugi) happens to witness a battle between servants and is literally forced into being a master. Luckily, due to his catalyst, he unknowingly summons the strongest of the servants - Saber. However, will her strength be enough to balance out her master's weaknesses? Doubly lucky, Shirou finds that one of his schoolmates (Tousaka) is also a master. Despite her initial assistance, how long will her help continue given that this is a battle royale?\\n\\n\r\nThe show starts with a brutal, hectic introduction with an engaging yet strikingly similar plot to the original FSN. Pacing is quite masterful as the show does a great job of balancing action-packed episodes with breathers to fill in more background. The central plotline mirrors that in the UTW movie but does a bit more to explore of side plots. For example, Ilya gets a nice episode that connects well to the events of Fate/Zero. However, there isn't as much of a balance in terms of exposition compared to the original FSN, and the master/servant relationships and mechanics of the battle for the grail are somewhat glossed over. There is really only one single story line, though there is a bit of a rise in intensity to mark the end of the first season.\\n\\n\r\nIf I had to pick what was the strongest facet of the story, it would have to be the execution. The background, interactions, and events all built throughout the show until the final glue of the epilogue ties it all together. The weakest aspect is Archer's decision-making; let's just say that there were plenty of chances to carry out his original mission. Overall, the show has a strong, but not flawless story.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nA lot hasn't changed from the original FSN. Emiya is still self-sacrificing, Shinji is still the turd, and Gilgamesh still refers to everyone else as \"mongrels\". What has changed is the drastic shift in focus towards Tousaka, Archer, and (to a lesser extent) Caster. I was actually rather disappointed in the amount of progress in the Shirou/Tousaka relationship, it all felt somewhat juvenile, especially compared to the relationships in Fate/Zero (granted they are much younger here I guess). That aside, the main cast is definitely a dynamic set that grows and adapts throughout the show. Again, the real gems of the show for me were in the small details that weren't in the original; these include scenes like Tousaka getting flustered and Saber's adorable inability to use a bat in a batting cage. Really, the rating for this section will highly depend on how you mesh with the above-mentioned characters. Luckily, for me, the show had my basis covered.\\n\\n\r\nValue:\\n\r\nFSN is an entertaining addition... er... partial addition to the Fate animated universe. Though it doesn't add much more in terms of story to the UBW movie, it does add some interesting character tidbits. And the production, by itself, should make it worth your time. As for re-watch, once you understand the main twist, it's funny re-watching and seeing the irony in a lot of the character lines. Despite the intense expectations coming after Fate/Zero, I think Type Moon delivered a strong hit, definitely check this one out.",

            "content": "So let me get this out of the way: Fate/Zero is one of my favorite anime of all time and one of the finest examples of the medium I can come up with in the past ten years. Despite many flaws, the story was gritty and intense, the characters well-rounded and enjoyable, and the sparse action scenes were fantastic. So it\u2019s only natural I\u2019d go into Fate/Stay Night with huge expectations.\r\nDespite being a fan of Fate/Zero I\u2019ve never been able to watch Fate/Stay Night because of how\u2026well, crappy it is. The writing is awful, the animation isn\u2019t that great, and I\u2019ve never found it tobe a compelling package, even with the Fate name strapped on. And then there\u2019s the abominable Fate/Kaleid series that is, by the way, getting a third season despite shitting all over everything that Fate/Zero built up and making this serious series into a joke.\\n\\n\r\nUnlimited Blade Works has a film version that I never got around to watching, so this is all new to me. The series itself is based on a different branch of the visual novel, so there will be a lot of similarities to the first Fate anime, but it does diverge at one point.\\n\\n\r\nFor those who don\u2019t know the gist of Fate, every once in a while there is a Holy Grail War officiated by the church. In this war, seven mages summon Heroic Spirits, heroes of myth and legend, who duke it out in life or death battles. When one Spirit (also called Servant) is standing, the Holy Grail appears and wishes are granted to the winner.\\n\\n\r\nEveryone participating in the war gets three command seals which magically compel their Servant to do whatever they wish. Once the seals run out, they have very little control over what their Servant does next.\\n\\n\r\nUnlimited Blade Works takes place ten years after the Fourth Holy Grail War and follows the children of that battle\u2019s contestants. As such, they\u2019re all (for the most part) in high school.\\n\\n\r\nBlade Works opens when Rin Tohsaka, daughter of a man killed in thelast war, summons an Archer-class Servant who dukes it out with a Lancer-class after school one night. A young kid named Shirou Emiya, adopted son of the now deceased master of Saber in the previous war, bears witness to the battle and is chased down and killed by Lancer. Somehow, he is brought back to life by Rin and he summons Saber to fight for him in the Fifth Holy Grail War. Joining this battle is the daughter of Emiya Kiritsugu as well as a few surprise characters.\\n\\n\r\nShirou and Rin wind up forming an alliance to take down the other Servants and that\u2019s pretty much the extent of the plot of this first half of the series. The two battle against the bad guys, go to school, and develop a cute romance.\\n\\n\r\nCompared to Fate/Zero I felt the series paced itself a lot better. Probably my biggest problem with Zero was how slow it was to get to the action. But that complaint will be a double-edged sword as I loved the cast in Fate/Zero and felt that the story\u2019s focus on adult characters (for the most part) made it much more compelling to me. Unlimited Blade Works is focused on teenagers, which I thought would alienate me. The high school setting made me nearly groan, figuring it\u2019d fall into the conventions of the place. God forbid Saber be dressed as a schoolgirl and made an \u201cexchange student\u201d.\\n\\n\r\nBut Fate handles the setting really well with teenage characters who aren\u2019t conventional enough in thought and action to make me quit. Shirou is an interesting guy who is learning magic as best he can, doesn\u2019t really want to be a part of the War as it was the catalyst for him becoming who he is, and also has developed a caring for Saber despite her being a weapon essentially. And the same can be said of Rin, who cares deeply for her Servant as well as Shirou, hides the fact she is an emotional and somewhat impulsive girl behind her supposed love for magic, and really is seeking an acceptance that her lonely life most likely hasn\u2019t given her. These are kids who were bred specifically to fight in a war and living in the shadows of the dead.\\n\\n\r\nThat\u2019s not to say that the character\u2019s are totally deep in any way, but I enjoyed their company and constant readers know that Rin ranks as one of my favorite, if not my favorite tsundere, of all time. Rin isn\u2019t tsundere enough to be a bitch, nor annoying enough in what she says to turn you away. She has her \u201ccharacter trope\u201d moments, but she also has a sweet side the show likes to shine a light on.\\n\\n\r\nDespite all that, compared to the characters of Fate/Zero, Unlimited Blade Works is lacking the interesting cast that kept me so glued to my seat. But Zero liked to jump around to characters and have huge swathes of development and talking rather than action, something that did detract from it for me and something Unlimited Blade Works rectifies. Action scenes are plentiful and gorgeous. No action scene in this show is poorly done; I\u2019d go so far as to say that this is the best action of any anime I\u2019ve ever watched.\\n\\n\r\nAnd this is mostly thanks to the ridiculously beautiful animation. Every episode is film quality with beautiful colors, meticulously detailed backgrounds, and usually pretty character design. Faces can be a little strange, especially from the side, but it\u2019s still of a quality few if any anime strive for nowadays.\\n\\n\r\nWhen the action heats up, the animation never misses a beat\u2013it\u2019s damn near impossible to explain how amazing the animation for these action scenes are. You can feel every hit, even when the fighters are crossing swords at a hundred miles an hour. It\u2019s freaking amazing the detail in these battles.\\n\\n\r\nAnd music? The opening and closing credits aren\u2019t anything memorable but the soundtrack of the show is pretty good and works will with the intense action.\\n\\n\r\nI occasionally spoil the shit out of anime to tear apart the plot or complain about characters but I\u2019m loathe to do so with a show as good as Unlimited Blade Works. If you haven\u2019t watched it, quit watching whatever you\u2019re watching and get ready for the best anime I\u2019ve seen out of 2014. The dialogue is great, the characters are memorable, the plot is an anime classic, and the entire package is presented in a format that appears directed like a film and has the production value of such.\\n\\n\r\nThe worst part about this show? Knowing nothing you watch after it will  likely satisfy you. And also having to wait till April to see how the series continues.\\n\\n\r\n\u2026I know I can cheat and read about the game and watch the movie and all that but I won\u2019t. I\u2019m stubborn like that.",

            "content": "Two very important things we can all learn from Shirou Emiya. First, did you know people die when they are killed. Also just because you got something correct doesn't actually mean you're right.\r\nEnough with the Shirou Emiya quote and lets get into the review. I will be reviewing the series as a whole instead of 1st then 2nd season.\r\nStory: 8/10\r\nThe story is exactly the same as the original Fate Stay Night. Shirou gets involved in the Holy Grail war somehow and now must fight and survive the war using his personal Saber waifu (just kidding). Even though the story is the same, it originally isstill a great story for survival anime.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:9/10\\n\r\nI really do love the characters of the Fate series. Shirou Emiya: he' a little on the cliche protagonist side, but he's my favorite of those. Rin Tohsaka is my favorite tsundere, even though I generally don't like tsunderes. And do I even have to say anything for Saber. Even though I hate Gilgamesh, because I hate him actually makes the anime a lot more enjoyable and satisfying.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\r\nThe enjoyment was FREAKING AAAAMAAAAZIIIIING!!!!!!!! I loved the action scenes cause they were just made so well. I do want to come back to the plot for a bit. The plot was the same as the original Fate Stay Night, but the outcoming was completely and totally different, especially in the second season. I'm not gonna tell you how it was different cause of spoilers, but I'll just say it was very different and a lot better. Also I think Shirou and Rin make a better couple than Shirou and Saber. Which means that leaves poor little Saber prone to all those waifu hungry otakus.\\n\\n\r\nArt and Sound: 10/10\\n\r\nThe art is my favorite art style of the modern anime era and the sound and soundtrack are just splendid. I love the OST of the Fate series, cause it's just so enhanced and it fits very well too. I also think the dub is one of the best dubs I've watched.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9/10\\n\r\nFate Stay Night UBW is one of my favorite animes ever and I say it's definitely a watch. It's not a perfect anime because the plot is still the same as the original, but Fate Stay Night UBW is still a great anime to watch. It also has a lot of major plot twists like Fate Zero. Definitely go watch the dub, cause it's one of the best dubs I've ever watched. I hope you'll love it as much as I did. Thx for reading.",

            "content": "Story 7/10: Being an alternate route to the original Fate/Stay Night, one shouldn't expect a whole lot more. In relation to Shirou and Sabre, the MC's of the original... it somehow got leagues stupider in every way and kinda answered questions that I personally couldn't care less about. It even managed to make him even more overpowered, which was severely aggravating.\r\nLiterally everyone else in the story is done fantastically though, so it begrudgingly drags it up quite a few notches. Literally everyone else done in a fantastic way... the Fate/Zero way.\r\nArt 10/10: Great quality with action scenes notably running at a higher framerate that resultsin much nicer animation.\\n\\n\r\nSound 8/10: Having better sound quality is one thing, but it was also done leagues better. Berserker is notably no longer or gargling mouthwash, instead he is a proper howling monster. Music could have been better, but I digress.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 7/10: I wanted to enjoy it as much as Fate/Zero, but I could only enjoy the return of characters that served as little more than plot devices and the animation quality. The story was... as contrived as ever when it came to winning any sort of fight which detracted from the enjoyment. Being dragged out of enjoying something into borderline regret is pretty bad.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 7/10: Much better than the Original Fate/Stay Night, but in terms of the main characters from the original... it got needlessly edgy, over-complicated, and somehow worse. Luckily the story tries to focus more on a secondary characters perspective and their involvement, but even they get swallowed up by it towards the end.",

            "content": "The concept of an adaptation is too adept (no shit) be that a book, visual novel, comic, etc. into a moving picture. One thing an adaptation should do is try and stay faithful to the source material while doing things differently from said source material so that it may stand on its own feet. But can a 2 cour adaptation of a single route from a 50+ hour visual novel achieve that?\r\nFor the sake of those that have experience with this franchise such as myself I\u2019ll be doing a two part review. One from the people who don\u2019t even know what Fate/Stay Night is (UNX),and one for those who\u2019ve either read the visual novel or seen the previous Fate anime entries (EXP), and please keep in mind that I\u2019m a little bit of a fanboy when it comes to this series. Nevertheless I\u2019ll try to approach both views free of bias (I did say try).\\n\\n\r\nThe Short Version:\\n\r\n(UNX):\\n\r\n(+)The animation, good god the animation.\\n\r\n(+)The music.\\n\r\n(-)You\u2019ll be wondering what all the fuss, more than once throughout the runtime.\\n\r\n(EPX):\\n\r\n(+)Pretty much the entire show.\\n\r\n(-)Some of the things they added, because HOW DARE THEY?!\\n\\n\r\nThe Story (UNX (7/10) EXP (8/10)): For those initiates among you this show will seem like a god damn shit storm half the time, The first two episode are double the length of your standard anime, and the only real reason for this is to give a massive exposition dump of the world and rule set you\u2019ve just stepped into. \\n\\n\r\nThis is the reason a lot of new comers are, to put it lightly, off put as fuck to continue watching the series, you\u2019ve got the entire concept of Heroic Spirits and the Holy Grail to contend with, the explanation of the rule set given to the mages, and almost the exactly same outline of events from two different people. Welcome to the Type-Moon way of doing things kids, enjoy the ride, but this extremely slow start shouldn\u2019t make you drop this series because you\u2019ll find as the show goes on, its gets just a little bit good. Just a little.\\n\\n\r\nFor the fans this slow start is probably expected, and the first episode itself is a little bit of fan service, because it\u2019s the entire prologue of the visual novel, then again they are parts of the story that aren\u2019t in the visual novel. Most of that is in S2 though so let\u2019s stay focused. You can argue for both sides when you say that the pacing of the show is flawed and the concept of the Holy Grail War itself doesn\u2019t even present itself unlike a certain prequel to this show, the fact that it\u2019s supposed to be a full on battle royale. Except that you only see this \u201cbattle royale\u201d is seen from one side and gives more of a \u201cMe against the world\u201d vibe.\\n\\n\r\nAnother problem with this show is that if you\u2019re really observant during the first two episode you\u2019ll spot one of the major plot elements of this entire route/show, given what happens in the episodes towards the end, you\u2019ll be able to guess it if you\u2019re lucky. I suppose the action scenes should be mentioned, and this goes from both parties when I say that they\u2019re some of the best we\u2019ll ever, because they have such a sense of impact. Every time a hit lands you feel the weight of said blow, and that\u2019s something that very hard to do given that some of the fights are little more than a couple of fast moving blurs. \\n\\n\r\nThe ending itself so obvious sets up for a sequel that it\u2019s almost painful, almost. The amount of rage and hype is generated at the time was fucking hilarious, but let\u2019s be glad that nowadays you can move straight to S2 without any hassle.\\n\\n\r\nThe Characters (UNX (6/10) EPX (8/10)): The characters, or rather, the main character of this show will be unpopular with the any newcomers to say the least. He\u2019s such a hard-line Idealistic that it\u2019s annoying, even when a much more sensible course of action is present he\u2019ll take the moral victory over the logical victory. For the EXP we wouldn\u2019t accept anyone but this hopeless, loveable idiot as the lead of this show.\\n\\n\r\nShirou Emiya: The annoying prick from above, and a hopeless bastard.\\n\\n\r\nRin Tohshaka: Main chick for this route and the much more capable mage than Shirou.\\n\\n\r\nSaber: Servant to Shirou and an undisputed god of combat.\\n\\n\r\nArcher: Main source of conflict for Shirou and has his fair share of epic fighting moments.\\n\\n\r\nWith regards to the other characters of the show, only some of them will that any real impact in the show while others are literally there for one purpose and nothing else. Both side will definitely, definitely have a problem with these characters. Keep in mind however that this is a single route of a massive visual novel, you should have expected this.\\n\\n\r\nArt & Sound (UNX (9/10) EPX (8/10) & (8/10) 8/10): For both new comers and experienced veterans the animation that ufotable put into this show is top tier shit, but the reason UNX would be more daseled by it would be because ufotable does a great job at their lighting and blending of 3D & 2D, but when you stop and stare at it for longer than you should. You realize that it\u2019s just more shadows than usual of on the characters and environment, that and it\u2019s generally a lot darker than the standard anime.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound however of both sides is more than exceptional, the entire OST should be bought by everyone, end of story.\\n\\n\r\nWhat do you think of this anime?\\n\\n\r\nReally? You\u2019re asking a fan-boy who spend $260 on a limited edition boxset that question?\\n\\n\r\nWould you recommend this anime?\\n\\n\r\nFor the UNX sure. For the EPX on two conditions; don\u2019t expect the full package of the visual novel and don\u2019t expect another Fate/Zero.\\n\\n\r\nGoodbye my brethren, see you in the next one.",
