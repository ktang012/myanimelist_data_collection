            "content": "If you've spent enough time familiarizing yourself with the anime community, you'll come to realize that we're a demanding bunch. That should go without saying, given just how much anime tend to diverge from most mainstream trends. Because of this, we're always on the lookout for the next best thing. Constantly asking for something innovative. Captivating. Unique. Competent. Something to not only entertain but also to satisfy on some intellectual level. In a way, we're spoiled, but that's not necessarily a bad thing. We push for more because we've seen the medium deliver time and time again. Anime isn't afraid of addressing social taboos, nordoes it shy away from concepts that most other mediums won't dare to touch. It's a format that isn't afraid of stepping on a few toes (also, it helps that Japan is batshit insane). So we make demands. We ask for further development. We lobby for anime's continuous growth because we care about the medium... and yet... despite this progressive attitude... every season without fail, we support and exalt the titles that stand as the antithesis of all of the requirements we beckon for. \\n\\n\r\nWe could always point the finger at the industry, holding them accountable for the type of shows we get, but that's just pointing out the symptom and not addressing the actual problem. The anime industry is a business, and like any other business, it provides a consumer need. If consumers show an invested interest in schlock entertainment, then guess what? Schlock entertainment is what they'll offer on a silver platter. Ladies and gentlemen, at the risk of sounding like a condescending prick, I write this intro, not for some personal agenda but for us as a community. If we want better, we must first discard inferior goods. Nipping the bud of Kabaneri of the Iron Fortress's popularity isn't something you passively acknowledge while twiddling your thumbs, it's a matter of civil duty at this point. If you want change, supporting another cheap Attack on Titan substitute is not the answer. But you know what would be a step in the right direction? Gathering up your pitchforks with me as we burn this title at the stake.\\n\\n\r\nWatching Kabaneri is like watching a 5-car pile-up on a busy intersection. It's devastating, but hard to look away from. With each plume of smoke breathes a new fiery furnace of stupor; divulging deeper into new unforeseen territories of hackneyed writing. Where other shows simply crash and burn, Kabaneri decides to push forward with a broken axle and the power of irrationality to combust its engine. It's a wondrous, smoldering pile of fecal matter on wheels. A beautiful travesty captured in frame by uninspired creators, seeing just how close they could pass their hand over the surface of unoriginality without being scorched by the heat. And trust me when I say that Wit Studio got their hands pretty fucking close. Had they gotten any further, we'd be naming this Shingeki no Kabaneri: Volume II.  To say they're cashing in on an existing fanbase would be an understatement. These hacks took the cash-cow home, milked it dry, then butchered it for any remaining morsels that they could scrape together. Kabaneri isn't just below average, it's the residual excrement that resides at the bottom of the barrel. \\n\\n\r\nThe only thing more overwrought than my need to articulate ways of calling this show shit is the actual execution of the show itself. This anime is bad, I cannot for the life of me stress that point enough. There isn't a mountain high enough to utter this phrase to unexpected viewers. So instead, let's trudge through the latest member of the dung heap, as we explore the hidden depths of Kabaneri of the Iron Fortress. \\n\\n\r\nSet during the time of 'unexplored settings' in the lands of 'who cares about proper world building', we're introduced to our protagonist SeaweedWig-kun (also known as Ikoma), as he grunts around mad at everyone and everything around him, working as a steam smith for his town. In a world overran by kabane (humanoid super zombies), SeaweedWig-kun and the rest of society find themselves residing inside giant walled-in cities to protect themselves from annihilation. With the assistance of steam propelled weapons they\u2014... wait, what am I doing? Silly me, just recite Shingeki No Kyojin's synopsis and call it a day. After all, this is Wit Studio's 3rd repackaging of the same setup. \\n\\n\r\nIn my Owari no Seraph review, I created a template to help viewers identify shows with this typical premise. For the sake of saving ourselves time and me not paraphrasing what I've explained in the past, I'll just insert that here as well: \\n\\n\r\nOne day humanity is suddenly attacked by a group of [insert name of threat here] and is brought to the brink of annihilation. Over [insert amount of years] later and it seems like there's no coming back from this almost divine punishment. But with the discovery of [insert name of weapons or power here], they were able to fight back. We follow our protagonist [insert name here] as he and his comrades use [insert name of weapon or power] to fight the [insert name of threat here] and reclaim humanity in this post-apocalyptic world and slowly discover the crazy mystery of their sudden appearance that might be closer to home than everyone thinks.\\n\\n\r\nKabaneri joins its cousins God Eater, Black Bullet, Knights of Sidonia, Owari No Seraph and others as the new iteration of this tired trend. With the same director, musical composer, theme song performers, script writers, sound director, color designer, and much more being brought back from their work on Attack on Titan, the intent of Wit studio couldn't be more obvious. I could drill this point home further if need be, but every show deserves to be evaluated independently (even if there's very little worth evaluating). And while Kabaneri isn't winning any anime awards in innovation anytime soon, there are a few distinctions made that separate it from the rest. For one, it's heavy use of steampunk. \\n\\n\r\nWhile the steampunk in Kabaneri is treated with as much relevance as a script for a porno, it was still a distinction that many were initially drawn to. It gave it an identity outside of its overused setup. As pointed out by fellow colleague themegamancave, the involvement of massive trains made to accommodate and sustain people while they travel from city to city, had aspects that were reminiscent of the movie Snowpiercer. This may have given off an impression that the show was possibly going to be more than its doppelgangers (no matter how brief that hope was). With zombies, huge trains, steampunk and an industrial-like setting, Kabaneri could have been an entertaining romp, had it been entrusted in the hands of more capable creators. Even the protagonist, as rambunctious as he was at times, still demonstrated some qualities, that if smoothed out, could have made for a compelling lead. \\n\\n\r\nBut that's as far as the show got, by the end of episode one the writing was already on the wall. The show was going to be a trainwreck. Many may not have seen it, but for those that did, we buckled up, grabbed a tub of popcorn and waited for the title to eventually derail. Thankfully, we didn't have to wait long, as Kabaneri started off stumbling, only to further lose its footing on its quick descend downwards (which I would discuss in detail in my spoiler section).\\n\\n\r\nIn typical fashion for this type of show, SeaweedWig-kun's homeland is invaded by the kabane after a freak accident causes a part of the wall to be knocked down. Accompanying us on our trainwreck to hell, we're introduced to Mumei, or as I like to call her, Bipolar-chan. While the citizens run around in a panic with the kabane slowly picking them off, SeaweedWig-kun and Bipolar-chan takes matters into their own hands. Bipolar-chan, a 12-year-old terminator, made quick work of the kabane fodder while giving us glances of her prepubescent pantsu. And while this is going on, our protagonist SeaweedWig-kun concocts a plan to ambush a zombie with a weapon he made with what remaining time he didn't dedicate to yelling at people. After the dust settles from all the chaos, our remaining citizens find themselves aboard Thomas the Tank Engine as they leave behind the charred remains of what they called home. And so our adventure begins. \\n\\n\r\nWith caked on color gradients, a grandiose soundtrack by Sawano, and nice action set pieces, it isn't hard to see why initial impressions would cause mass hysteria for more Kabaneri. But little did people know, what they were getting was a ticking time bomb, just waiting for the slightest nudge to explode. Even elements that seemed to be a strong attribute at 1st couldn't keep up the fa\u00e7ade for long. Take the art and animation for example. Because of the polish look the show draped over everything, many viewers often fail to notice the fact that several scenes throughout each episode were actually still shots, with no more than a shaky-cam effect to mask it. And outside the moments that fight scenes broke out, the actual fluidity of the animation was no higher than the usual standards demonstrated by other studios. Kabaneri was a mess only held together by duct tape. And when it started bursting from the seams, episodes like 9 began to happen. And what little makeup it had to distract from the truth that was there all along, it was no longer enough to fool even the most gullible of individuals. \\n\\n\r\nThese slight of hand tricks weren't limited to later episodes either. The degree to which the audience notice these shortcomings depended entirely on their initial investment. And seeing how my invested level was lower than dirt, Kabaneri was an eyesore from the moment SeaweedWig-kun had bright ideas about how the body's circulatory system works.\\n\\n\r\nBut even a trainwreck like Kabaneri had some positive qualities. As previously mentioned, the soundtrack by Sawano did wonders for the show. It helped shape the mood and tone of the show's universe. Swelling up whenever the action came to a boiling point or simmering down during quiet moments; whatever the occasion, Sawano had all ends covered. It made the experience far more enjoyable than it would have been had a less talented composer been given the job.\\n\r\nOn a side note, there was a minor character with a widely inconsistent vernacular. I'm not sure if the voice actor wanted to be British, American or Australian. It's like trying to get Arnold Schwarzenegger to trick someone into believing he's a part of the British Intelligence. The random hammy phrases uttered by this individual got me to chuckle every time. Outside of that, the rest of the cast did fine. But ultimately the biggest highlight from the auditory department was that of Sawano. A man that unfortunately had to sully his hands once again with a project undeserving of his talents.\\n\\n\r\nAnd speaking about creators that elevated Kabaneri from the shit pile, Tetsur\u014d Araki directorial work once again shines through. No matter the project he takes on, his flare for the dramatic is never underplayed. The man knows how to get the most from the material he's given. Whether he's directing the Spiderman view shots of the 3D maneuver gear in Attack on Titan, or defying physics with the matrix boobs on High School of the Dead; Araki goes all out every time. He's to anime what Zach Synder is to film. Whether you view that as an insult or not isn't of concern, the fact is he never stops delivering his signature flare, no matter the quality of show he's working with. \\n\\n\r\nBut this is where the praise comes to an end, as our trainwreck makes its final pit stop. For those of you who've seen the show and had a hard time spotting plot inconsistencies or contrive narrative decisions, don't worry, because I'm feeling extra generous today. Join me in the spoiler section as I break down this idiotic title by each episode. And for those of you who haven't seen Kabaneri yet, scroll down past the \"end of spoilers\" indication to avoid having this 'masterpiece' ruined to you.\\n\\n\r\n***spoiler section****\\n\r\n. \\n\r\n.\\n\r\nKabaneri showed cracks in its foundation from the very beginning. This breakdown will cover them all.\\n\\n\r\nep1:\\n\r\nThe show thinks the body circulatory system works by bullshit logic, with the main character hanging himself to stop a virus. There're two kinds of choking: one that restricts blood flow to the brain, denying oxygen intake, and the other is strangulation, which cuts off your air intake altogether by closing your windpipe. Restricting your blood flow or air intake doesn't stop blood from going to your brain, it restricts it. It's like going from a gush of water to a slow trickle. So choking yourself isn't going to prevent a virus from spreading to your brain, all that would do is leave you unconscious and eventually cause death when there's no one around to help resuscitate you. This still doesn't even address the fact that he slit his wrist, which, if you don't know, could cause you to bleed to death. There's a reason it's a common method of committing suicide. So our protagonist committed two acts back to back that would usually lead to death, yet survives both, all for an end goal that logically makes no sense whatsoever. \\n\r\nEven if we put aside how illogical this solution is, and suspend our disbelief to buy into it, the fact remains that our protagonist never informs anyone of this accomplishment. If temporarily cutting off circulation to your brain and infected area is all that it takes to combat this virus, why would he not inform the other citizens about this after he had gained their trust, instead of having them kill themselves with pocket bombs? When you take this into consideration, our protagonist is essentially responsible for the deaths of hundreds, if not thousands of people. For someone who tries his hardest to protect others, he sure does a piss poor job at doing it. \\n\\n\r\nep2: \\n\r\nMumei single-handily wipes out dozens of Kabane with ease. This may not seem like a big deal until you realize what it does for the stakes of the show. If these monsters are made out to be such an imposing force to humanity, only to have them be taken out with little effort by a 12-year-old girl, what does that do to the stakes? Yes, the Kabaneri inclusion spices up the story but it also removes any sense of tension when you have a one-man army on your side.\\n\\n\r\nep3:\\n\r\nAfter saving the lives of everyone, the Kabaneri are scrutinized by the people. This isn't the actions of sensible adults, this is the writers turning an entire population into imbeciles. No matter the time period or cultural upbringing, using weapons to extend survival has always been intrinsic to mankind. Taking precaution to keep them locked up? Sure. But to outright discard them right after seeing their effectiveness in combat? Now that's plain lunacy. To top it off, these buffoonish adults gather in a mob to threaten the Kabaneri, despite seeing their physical prowess against kabane; beasts they could barely take out as a group. This is also where Bipolar-chan began to show her wishy-washy personality; switching from one archetype to another at the drop of a hat.\\n\\n\r\nep4:\\n\r\nA kabane has the ability to wield a samurai sword with as much proficiency as a trained warrior. At this point, red flags should be going off in your head. This is insanely stupid, I shouldn't have to explain why this is a huge problem. \\n\\n\r\nep5:\\n\r\nMumei's flip flopping characteristics become increasingly worse. She's always been bipolar before this episode, but this is the point where the writers show that they don't know how to write a mentally disturbed character, from one that simply flip flops between different personality traits. She goes from tsundere, to yandere, to kuudere, to dandere, back to tsundere again. This is terrible characterization. The last time I've seen a character this inconsistent was Slaine Troyard from Aldnoah.Zero.\\n\\n\r\nep6:\\n\r\nLOL The Black Smoke. Do I need to say more? At this point, those red flags in your head should be set ablaze. This is where the show nosedives at 100mph. \\n\\n\r\nep7:\\n\r\nImpoverished, with little food to feed their people, yet they have enough resources to waste on a celebration? This desperate attempt to add levity only backfires. To top it off they light fireworks... FIREWORKS! That's how you attract hoards of kabane to your location. The show temporarily forgot that it was a zombie survival story and does something far too stupid to be excused. Also, this is where Biba makes his first appearance lol And God knows what that means. \\n\\n\r\nep8:\\n\r\nIt's the introduction of Biba and the relinquishment of any integrity Kabaneri may have been holding on to. Not only does he collect Kabane like he's a pokemon master, but he's also a genocidal lunatic with little in the way of proper reasoning for any of his actions. Where other antagonists take an inch, Biba takes a mile, and then some. Also, Bipolar-chan's gullible personality is poorly excused with the actions taken by Biba to get her to the mental state she's in. \\n\\n\r\nep9:\\n\r\nAs far as I'm concerned, the show jumped the shark with the colony kabane monster, but this serves as the most noticeable case of it going off the rails completely. The Kabaneri are now pokemon, with Hyper Beams, agility, and double team. This, my friends, is what schlock action looks like. This is also the moment that many people gave up on the show. There's literally no defense possible to excuse this. The show has 0 value at this point. \\n\r\nThis doesn't even touch upon the fact that Biba killed thousands of innocent people for what amounts to him being butthurt. \\n\\n\r\nep10: \\n\r\nMumei is still a flip flopping idiot, Biba is still demonstrating Saturday morning cartoon levels of villainy, and in what was suppose to be an emotional sacrifice, where Ikoma's friend Takumi jumps in front of a bullet to protect him, losing his life in the process, turns out to be just another failed attempt by the show. You see, there's just one problem with this \"emotional\" scene, he didn't need protecting, to begin with. We've seen Ikoma have chunks of flesh ripped from him by hoards of kabane on several occasions, as well as other life-threatening injuries. The kabaneri are known to have amazing regenerative abilities. So had Ikoma been shot, it wouldn't have mattered all that much. This makes Takumi's sacrifice pointless and only there to add emotional weight for a moment that didn't have any. And after hitting a conveniently placed lever that opens up the train's walls (seriously, what function does this even serve?), Ikoma falls into the river after Bipolar-chan stabs him, in what is the most overused fake death scene in any storytelling medium.\\n\\n\r\nep11:\\n\r\nIkoma turns into Rambo and staples a gun to his arm (because reasons) and takes a drug to go super saiyan, which has the side effect of depleting his life and killing him (remember this); while Biba devises a plan that operates entirely on plot convenience. It required his father to kill him using a weapon that he himself had devised as a trap, with a convenient formula that instantly infuses your blood with Kabane's, a substance that we never saw before (which makes no sense given the prior cases of kabane transformations we've seen). \\n\\n\r\nep12\\n\r\nThe show couldn't keep its promise and at least deliver Ikoma as a sacrifice for Mumei's life. Instead, it chose the pussy way out, by keeping him alive (despite what they said just one episode prior to him taking the drug). Ikoma temporarily became a Jedi and used the force to send a train flying off the tracks. They also try to humanize Biba at the last minute with perhaps the dumbest revelation up to this point. Remember, this is a guy that committed multiple genocides because he's a little butthurt, so seeing the show try to add humanity to him at the very last minute is not only unwarranted but plain stupid. And the way he goes about receiving this forced \"redemption\" opens up another can of worms, in perhaps the show's stupidest mistake up to this point. If Biba cured the Kabaneris with the formula that the scientist had, doesn't it stand to reason that the same cure could work if you're bitten by one? This revelation not only ruins what little semblance of urgency the show had, it effectively erased all the danger of every encounter up to this point. It also negates the struggle that Kabaneris faced with not being completely human. It's astonishing just how many dumb things the show does in the last few minutes of airing. This isn't even accounting for the numerous stupid moments littered throughout the episode. The show went full-retard, there's no other way to describe what happened. \\n\\n\r\nSo with all this said, when I see people say the show was good then got bad after a Kabaneri spammed a 'Grand Rey Cero', I'm honestly perplexed, because, from my account of every episode up to that point, the show has always been bad.\\n\r\n.\\n\r\n.\\n\\n\r\n***end of spoiler***\\n\\n\r\nWhenever a title receives widespread popularity, a slew of variations and rehashes of that project tend to follow. Like in the case of The Matrix, which effectively started a trend of high-concept dystopian action movies like Equilibrium, Ultraviolet, and Minority Report. The anime community has no shortage of this event happening either, with the two biggest recent examples being Sword Art Online and Attack on Titan. Titles that saw with it a huge incentive for the anime industry to pump out MMO augmented reality shows and the next humanity monster survival tale. \\n\r\nThe only time these trendsetting tidal waves subside is when the audiences no longer express interest for that product. Kabaneri wouldn't be the last unless we as an audience say enough is enough. And while they're anime viewers who simply love the idea of more Attack on Titan, remember that this will only lead to negative backlash later on. If you consume the same product every day, sooner or later you're going to get sick of the taste. Over-saturation is what kills interest, and as long as you give these half-baked shows a monetary gain, studio heads would see no incentive to stop.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 7.5/10\\n\\n\r\nKabaneri is entertaining in the way watching a dumpster fire could be seen as fun. \\n\r\nThankfully the only casualty of this trainwreck was the integrity of Wit Studio's staff, and perhaps the brain cells of those that actually thought this had a chance of being good. I really hated this show at first, it was doing illogical things but not to the point of alerting other viewers. So while I sat there uninterested, others saw something \"good\" or at the very least, entertaining. But then the show got increasingly worse, eventually getting to the point where even casual viewers couldn't possibly ignore it anymore. And as it quickly decreased in quality, my enjoyment quickly shot up as a result. \\n\r\nKabaneri's writing is impressively bad, like worthy of a Razzie bad. I'm all for dumb fun, but what I don't advocate, however, is confusing \"so bad it's good\" titles with actual \"good\" ones. And while I enjoyed making fun of this show, laughing at each new idiotic plot thread, it is by no means a good title. It's a confused, contrived mess that made for great B-movie entertainment. So while this dumpster fire occasionally whizzed out fireworks for my amusement, I can't promise the same results for everyone else. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 3/10\\n\\n\r\nKabanaeri is the malignant tumor slowly eating away at the anime community's set standards of what constitutes as a \"good\" title. Each new layer is like a slow descent into madness; deciphering your way through the muddled maze of abysmal writing and \"so bad it's good\" narrative decisions that even experienced viewers would be baffled by. Very few shows left me dumbfounded with its stupidity in the way Kabaneri did. I suffered many convulsions trying to process the sheer level of absurdity that each new episode brought, and just as I thought it was done with its surprises, it manages to pull another rabbit out of its (ass)hat. Unintelligible, uninspired and gasping for air, this anime is on the verge of being comatose. Pulling the plug is the only humane solution left. It reached the apex of nonsensical writing, and there's no cure potent enough to save it from dying of brain damage. This is truly the representation of \"schlock\" in its unadulterated form.",

            "content": "If you happen to be someone who has a steady job within the anime industry, what is the best possible way to earn some decent $$$ when making an original anime? Is it to try and come up with the best and most original setting that comes to mind? To create characters with seemingly limitless potential? A thought-provoking story? If you think it's any of the above, you may as well be delusional. Wit Studio has it all figured out. Sadly, after milking the dried up and shriveled old cow that is Attack on Titan for a solid three years now, I think they mayhave forgotten how to make an actual original anime. Here, I'll paint you a somewhat-clearer picture of the feeling I got upon reading the series' synopsis. Imagine arriving to school with a brand new pair of shoes, right? So as you're walking down the hallway, your shoes are suddenly stepped on by some snot-nosed kid wearing a monster energy T-shirt and a hat turned sideways. That's right, the feeling of true despair.\\n\\n\r\nSo humans are at the brink of extinction again, blah blah blah. Only this time, our enemies are much less intimidating than ever before. They are just these mindless glowing zombies that raid trains once in a while and occasionally manage to get into the fortress. Oh, but don't get the fortress confused with the great walls from AoT as they are two totally separate entities and do not resemble each other a single bit. So seeing as regular humans are always as useless as one can be in these types of series, we are introduced to Kabaneri, the humans who got bitten by the glowing zombies and received superpowers because of it. Our main superhero is our boy Ikoma, who is out on a quest of revenge against the Kabane, accompanied by our loli heroine Mumei. These two form an invincible bond and so their journey begins. \\n\\n\r\nAttack on Titan was one of the first anime that got me back into the medium and I still faintly remember the dread I felt while watching the first few episodes. That feeling is completely gone this time around which can probably be entirely accounted for by the lackluster execution, more or less. To say that the Kabane's designs are lacking would be an understatement but we also have these people who can kill a hundred of them within the span of a minute which makes the threat feel that much more nonexistent. Then the setting apparently takes place during an industrial revolution yet they don't put any emphasis on this point what so ever. This could have been a great way to delve deeper into the world and give more depth to the setting if it were utilized properly. I'm not going to settle down for those fucking trains being the only reason this takes places in an industrial revolution. The potential is there but unfortunately it is left untouched.\\n\\n\r\nThere were also minor inconsistencies within some of the writing. Like why the hell do they have the people who are bitten be locked up for 3 days straight when with every single on-screen instance we've had of a human turning into a Kabane when bitten has happened within a time period of 5 minutes max? This show is too stupid for its own good. Speaking of stupid, the drama between the humans and the Kabaneri never disappoints. Despite the Kabaneri protecting the humans for the entirety of the series, if they happen to do a single, usually insignificant thing that the public deems as questionable, they are to be locked up and shunned immediately.\"You spilled a cup of coffee? Looks like you're no different from a Kabane after all, damn wench!\" \\n\\n\r\nThe main cast just honestly really impressed me. Our protagonist was a guy who got bit by a Kabane, went through some kinky bondage porn and emerged a Kabaneri. He is as original as one can be, making an oath to himself that he will exterminate all of the zombies after a death of a certain family member. This backstory got me really emotional. It is something that we have never once seen before and is very original. Design-wise, he is sort of what I would picture Harry Potter's edgier twin brother to look like. Having such a strong resemblance to that character may be a good or a bad thing depending on preference. Who knows. It has been a good few years since I've last seen the Harry Potter films so I couldn't really say. We literally know not a single thing about his background and past apart from the fact that his sister, who we also knew nothing about, had died. Such a tragic tale this is.\\n\\n\r\nOur heroine is an awfully cocky and narcissistic brute of a 12 year old girl. She is a strong and agile fighter who helps our protagonist along the way as well as guide him when he is initially bit and turns suicidal. She seems to make a lot of decisions that are considered questionable by the other characters for some reason, like killing a pregnant woman who was about to give birth to a Kabane. This is somehow questioned and deemed not to be acceptable despite the soldiers casually putting every single bitten person to death on a daily basis. Is it morally right or not? Make up your mind already. Her backstory is neither here nor there but is definitely better than Ikoma's as we do get some flashbacks that tell us bits and pieces of her upbringing and how she became the way she is. Despite being extremely obnoxious, she is easily the most developed character in the entire show as by the time the show reaches its climax her personality would have already done a 180 and if she were not so damn stupid, I may have actually of been able to sympathize with her situation.\\n\\n\r\nThe antagonist of the series (who we shall refer to as Jimmy because spoilers) is so poorly-written that he almost manages to make the rest of the cast look good while on screen. Jimmy's motivations are extremely incoherent and shallow as well as just plain stupid. He developed daddy issues because his papi used to randomly assault him with a knife when he was 8 years old, as he apparently \"feared\" him. Hence, his primary objective is to end his father's reign because of the previously mentioned and for the fact that he for some reason let the Kabane destroy one of the cities which little Jimmy was defending at the time. I don't know why or how his father would benefit from doing so but apparently he does. And you know what they say - The apple doesn't fall far from the tree. Even after getting his revenge he still goes out of his way to wreak havoc upon the innocent civilians who've got not a single thing to do with this by releasing the Kabane upon them. Ahh so much shock factor ahh such good villain.\\n\\n\r\nWhen it is necessary, Jimmy also enjoys pulling out the Plot Convenience Serum out of his pocket and injecting it into other characters in order to turn them into mindless drones. This of course has one hell of an influence on the overarching plot as you can imagine since you have people who hate his guts one episode turning into his slaves the next. This was obviously just an extremely lazy way of making the plot progress further in the way the writers wanted it to. What's a good anime without plot convenience anyway? Funny thing is, if the characters had any semblance of a brain inside their thick skulls, Jimmy would have no chance to even get near the fortress to begin with, much less get inside. No side characters stuck out as literally all of them are either useless or obnoxious and on special occasions maybe even both.\\n\\n\r\nI have somewhat of an educated guess that Wit Studio may have made a tiny winy ounce of cash with the production of a show a few years back, as well as one more recently. So naturally, it may be worth considering that by now they can put in a pretty decent budget, and so they did. The animation is buttery smooth and the art is very appealing. The choreography is very impressive and engaging whenever the fights aren't entirely one-sided. They used some weird shading technique on the character designs which I think worked well for the most part. The blood and gore looked very fluid and liquid-y. As for sound, I've got no clue. I put IceJJFish and Anton Maiden songs in the background in order to ease the pain, sorry. Opening and ending are pretty nifty though.\\n\\n\r\nJust dreadful in all honestly. Every single individual factor of the show managed to hinder my enjoyment in one way or another. Be it the subpar and messy plot, the gigantic amount of plotholes riddled throughout, the horrid characterization and character development, unparalleled edge, horrible antagonist, shitty worldbuilding, rushed ending.. The list could go on. To make the long story short, it was not enjoyable. That being said, I imagine most people will actually find something here, be it the over the top execution, well-done action choreography or simply poking fun at how bad it is. I myself am not an action junkie so the choreography, while impressive, didn't leave an everlasting impression of sorts and unfortunately I wasn't able to get a kick out of how bad it was either, rather it just left me with the impression that it was trying too hard. It really is the worst thing when an awful show takes itself too seriously. Where is Mitsumune when you need him?\\n\\n\r\nA true trainwreck till the very end. Kabaneri wasn't even a disappointment, it was exactly what I expected from the synopsis. The production studio was unable to keep consistency within its mediocre 12-episode runtime as shown clearly by the spiraling transition of quality the further the series progressed. I want to say that it would have worked better if it were 24 episodes long but I really can't, judging from how poorly they handled a measly 12. I'm really inclined to believe that this was just a cheap cash grab by Wit Studio since they know far too well that they can get a decent amount of income just by having the show have Attack on Titan vibes, and boy, does it have that. Hell, I'm pretty sure I could sum up both of the first episodes using the exact same sentence. Now, a moment of appreciation for Wit Studio... Thank you. And so the second season of AoT is delayed yet again. Satisfied?",

            "content": "A society in the middle of an industrial revolution. Gigantic steampunk-iron fortresses protecting its citizens. Zombies that terrorizes the lands, where large tank-like trains are the only means of transport and communication with the different fortifications. Such is the setting of Koutesujou no Kabaneri: mankind's struggle to survive the everluring doors of death and despair. Zombies threatening mankind is nothing new, yet is arguably oddly entertaining - when it is done right that is. What could have been a simple story about humankind's struggle for survival, sadly turned out into a petty revenge story: despite its flaws, an enjoyable first part, but with a verylackluster second part. That being said, it has some great visuals and spectacular action scenes.\\n\\n\r\n~Story~\\n\\n\r\nThe story of Koutesujou no Kabaneri revolves mainly around Ikoma who works as an engineer in the train station, while making his very own gun to eradicate the zombies. Incidently, a train enters the station with an infected man, and thus, mankind's main fear became true: infections happening left and right within the fortress itself. This proves for the protagonist a big chance to test his very own weapon, and thus the survival story begins. A thing to note is that action is quite predominant in the series, where story and characterization basically take a back seat, although changes a bit in the second half. It is often well-coordinated, with here and there some causes of the fights itself rather lackluster. This also means that there are quite some gory sequences, full with blood, which may be a no-go for some.\\n\\n\r\nAt first sight it can be quite engaging, the protagonist not finding justice in indiscriminately killing the turned human: a confrontation of what defines a human being, yet naturally comes down to kill or be killed. This of course causes ruckus within society itself, in which the population displays the cowardly nature of mankind when pressured or under fear. Now there should be rules to avoid such occurrences (infected entering the city), yet the logic used by the script writers is bland and plain non-sensical at times to say the least. A lot of the rules applied have no real logic behind them, for example thorough body inspections, when the infection is nearly instantaneous, making this particular one mute. There are many more examples within the anime, where some can be overlooked up to a certain extend; this is to say, up to the first half of the story.\\n\\n\r\nWhat is important to note, is that the anime is initially a simple story of survival with its obvious flaws, but overlookable, as it was not trying to be anything more than that. However, with the introduction of a character, Amatori Biba, the whole anime takes a significant dip in overall quality. In fact, the whole anime essentially turns into a petty revenge story, being the above mentioned character the main \"villain\", but to this later. There are also special powers in the anime, as well as beings: for instance, kabaneri are half-human, half kabane. This gives a plausible solution of why a small group of people being able to withstand the hordes of zombies. There are different types of zombies to spice the things up a bit, but were minimal, up to a certain point in the anime where it simply became superfluous with various increasingly overpowered ones. The main problem with this is that the anime was still trying to make it as \"realistic\" as possible, but with such elements thrown into it, it simply lost any credibility it had left.\\n\\n\r\n~Characters~\\n\\n\r\nConcerning the cast of characters in Koutesujou no Kabaneri, although varied, they share the archetypes common in the genre. There is also a problem when it comes to the characterization of its cast: it is introduced too late for it to take a big effect, which incidentally is introduced mid-way up to the end of the anime. Possibly by that time viewers won't have had any reason to consolidate with the characters as nothing of crucial importance or aspect was known about them. On the one hand there is Ikoma, a young simple-minded smith who wants to create a powerful weapon to counter the kabane with more ease. He has different views on how to treat the infected: yet also shares an aversion to the kabane. His very reason on why he desires to wipe out the kabane is very basic. Despite being the protagonist of the series, he undergoes little character development, even to the point of losing his very identity - which was rather lackluster to say the least, as its implementation was badly executed, feeling out of place.\\n\\n\r\nOn the other hand there is Mumei, an initially young girl who is quiet and arrogant, but essentially scared with no people to rely on other than what she considers her \"big brother\", Biba. As the series progresses, she slowly opens up a bit, just to be \"brainwashed\" - which in turn leaves the character development she experienced mute. Then there is one of the main reasons the anime took another huge dip in quality, the villain Biba. Although initially presented as an interesting character in charge of cleansing zombies, as well as being implied as an important character to develop the cast, it takes a turn to the worse as his main goal becomes apparent. The very motive behind it is severely lacking and uninspired - what is worse, his very character is terribly basic: just an emotionless and ruthless man, pursuing blindly his objective, while sacrificing everything in the process. \\n\\n\r\nAn additional problem with the introduction of the above mentioned character is the implementation of the revenge plan: a handful, or rather a stream of unlikely events just continuously happen in the rest of the series, which is where any remaining logic the series had flied out the window to accommodate it. This could be naturally due to its short airing time, yet it should have been done in a more graceful manner. As for the other characters, there is nobody else of importance to mention or care for, as hardly any fleshing out or characterization was done.\\n\\n\r\n~Animation and sound~\\n\\n\r\nOn the bright side, the art style of Koutesujou no Kabaneri was surely refreshing and very well done, having some fantastic detail in both the design of its characters as well as the backgrounds. It is true that in some ocassions the background detail of characters where basic, even when only two were present. It is somewhat out of the norm, but is surely one I'd like to see more in the future. The animation itself was another great aspect, with fluid combat scenes and motions of the characters: fast and graceful slashes, blood, the lightning, you name it. CG is used in the anime, in particular that of the train, but as a whole was easily overlookable.\\n\\n\r\nConcerning the soundtrack of the show, while mostly it is befitting of the atmosphere with the use of classical instruments, drums, guitar, there are numerous instances where there were inappropriate ones that felt out of place. The same could be said about the voice actors, while mostly it was performed in a satisfying manner, quite some characters constantly had an angry tone, to the point of being annoying - such as the protagonist. It emanates the feeling as if the character only possesed one single emotion. As for the opening and ending of the series, although visually very pleasing, it had no memorable music attached to it.\\n\\n\r\n~Enjoyment~\\n\\n\r\nDespite having somewhat enjoyed the first half of series, Koutesujou no Kabaneri was as a whole disappointing: it should have just stuck to a simple survival story about humanity instead of what the second half introduced. This transition made the numerous issues the series had just more apparent, in addition to adding new ones. Now it must be said that the action scenes were an enjoyable watch, but were hindered by the laughable logic behind the events tied to them, as well as the characters. So do I recommend this anime? Is it the second Attack on Titan? Not really, unless viewers are able to easily dismiss the issues as inconsequential, and enjoy the mindless action there is, as the story won't be the main interest.\\n\\n\r\nThank you for reading.",

I dont really understand why people are starting to rate Koutetsujou no Kabaneri lower now that they've watched the last episode. Overall, the last episode wasnt even that bad. IN FACT, it kind of gives way to saying the the story isnt really finished yet, which then leads to a hint that there could even be a second season. If people want to rate this anime, they should at least try not to be as biased as possible. Anyways, Hiroyuki Sawano, as usual, created anamazing set of OST (original soundtrack). The art was quite good, making it look more realistic. The characters are quite unique, although there is a slight sense of cliche with some of the personalities like Ikoma's for example. The anime really was enjoyable. Even though the ending seems to be kind of rushed, the overall thing was quite good, and it isnt exactly as bad as what some people say. As for the story, i think that the pace was going at a satisfying pace (excluding the ending). The plot really made it unique since it has been a long time since a good post-apocalyptic anime came out after HOTD and SNK.",

            "content": "This is one of the worst anime that has been gaining too much hype this season. \r\nOverall - 5\r\nThe anime has a mildly interesting storyline spoiled by generic characters. As far as the episodes that have come out, the anime has no purpose whatsoever other than fulfilling its quota of okayish action sequences with moderate amounts of gore and no horror whatsoever. The only reason you should watch this anime is if you were fooled into watching it by the amount of hype that built up to its release or you are simply into shitty action anime with retarded characters.\r\nStory - 3\r\nA generic dystopian futurewhere humans are fighting \"kabane\", which are sorta like titan zombies. I say fighting but it's more like getting slaughtered till a mechanic and a ninja girl come together and kick some moderate ass. People travel around in trains which connect stations and most of the actions revolve around these train being attacked. The plot is driven by the stupidity of the characters and there is no major plot whatsoever. There are serious logical inconsistencies so if you want to enjoy the anime, I'd suggest lobotomy and removing the frontal lobe of your brain. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 2\\n\r\nWhile designing the characters I guess the writers were as short sighted as Ikoma (wears glasses) himself. I have visceral hate towards the anime to the extent that I make sure to tell everyone what a piece of shit this is, and I believe most of it stems from my disgust with the characters in this anime. The only characters I find good are the children in the story and Ikoma's friends.\\n\\n\r\nIkoma is a enthusiastic mechanic with shitty hair and weird metal arm who hates the adults for their narrow mindedness towards sh*t in general, especially victims of Kabane attacks. Every episode has him spouting generic motivational bullsh*t and taking illogical decisions that everyone agrees to because, well they are fu**ing retarded. \\n\\n\r\nMumei is a arrogant, self-righteous prick who is wearing rouge permanently and maybe thats why her facial expressions come before the dialogues. I mean even before Ikoma vomits his \"why she is worth saving\" speech, her eyes and mouth open with the cheeks becoming redder than the usual rouge...ugh...hate her.\\n\\n\r\nAyame is the \"damsel in distress\", who has little contribution to the story. Actually scratch that, she doesn't matter to the story.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation,Sound - 8\\n\r\nmeh, whatever.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 1\\n\r\nKill me now\\n\\n\r\nHonestly, I'm done.

Well rounded and done extremely well, I highly recommend Koutetsujou no Kabaneri for anyone who is a fan of zombies and thrillers.\r\nStory: 9 \r\nAs I said, this was a very original anime, especially the story.  We don't see many zombie anime's, and the ones we do see tend to be slice-of-life or, oddly, romantic.  I can only think of 1 or 2 other zombie anime, and neither one even came close to this.  Exciting and adrenaline-pumping action, you really feel invested in the story and the characters.\r\nArt: 9\r\nWeirdly, this anime has a sortof throwback type of art, reminiscent of anime in the 90's and early 2000's.  But what can I say... It works.  The art is unique but beautiful, and each character is unique and easy to remember.  I loved the designs and the outfits of the female characters in particular.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9 \\n\r\nThe music is perfectly fitted to the intense action sequences as well as the more tender moments, and can even be creepy and scifi-sounding at all the right parts.  The seiyuu's did a great job creating memorable characters as well.  \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9\\n\r\nI fell in love with Mumei in the last scene of the first episode (it's an epic moment, so I won't spoil it for you).  Ikoma is also a character you really root for (although I wasn't particularly fond of his hair).  You grow to love some of the side characters as well - all of them are really well done.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9\\n\r\nI really recommend binge-watching this anime.  It is so intense and full of adrenaline pumping moments that keep you on the edge of your seat, and so if you stop watching after each episode it's sort of like jumping off the ride right before you get to the best part.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9 \\n\r\nI highly recommend Koutetsujou no Kabaneri.  In a world full of boring, same-same anime's with cliched overused plot devices and silly tropes, Kabaneri is wholly original and thrilling.\\n\r\nI just really hope there will be a second season that will explain some of our lingering questions (like the origin of the Kabane!!)",

            "content": "Koutetsujou no Kabaneri was the show that I was the most excited for this anime season. Sure, it seemed like a lot of the ideas were borrowed from Wit studio's other anime, the widely known and critically acclaimed Attack on Titan, but I was willing to overlook that and view Kabaneri as its own, separate anime. I was initially impressed by the first two episodes, however the hype train slowly ran out of steam as the anime progressed. It was truly heading down the right track, but the anime simply derailed itself when it failed to expand its plot beyond generic characters fighting mindless zombies.This unfortunately resulted in Kabaneri being nothing more then a mediocre anime, when it had the potential to be something great. \\n\\n\r\nPlot: 3/10\\n\\n\r\nThe weakest part of the show. Kabaneri is a typical zombie apocalypse show, so it's not entirely original. However I've yet to see a zombie show heavily involving trains, so that's new, although it may be a bit of a comically stupid idea. I also noticed a decent amount of plot holes used as an excuse to have the kabane (the name of the zombies) attack. Sometimes they just randomly appeared without anyone noticing their loud moaning or bulking masses in random places to randomly attack random people. Other times the kabane just simply broke through the giant walls protecting the cities and the armored trains that humanity probably spent many a year constructing like they were made out of paper. The amount of plot holes was honestly quite pathetic, maybe even more so then Kabaneri's supporting cast, and that's really saying something. Also, the anime rarely explored any plot points other than those revolving around surviving the kabane, which I felt left this anime with a lack of depth.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nThis anime has pretty adequate visuals all around. The characters are designed beautifully and there aren't many inconsistencies with the art. My biggest problem is that the majority of the scenery is the inside of a train, which resulted in some very dull backgrounds. It turns out that the grey interior of a train makes for incredibly bland scenery. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nThe opening theme is done by Egoist and the ending by Aimer, two great artists in my opinion, so Kabaneri is obviously going to get high marks in this category. While neither song is the best by either performer, they are still very good and enjoyable to listen to. Also the soundtrack was composed by Hiroyuki Sawano, the man who developed the background tracks for widely known anime like Attack on Titan and Guilty Crown. In my opinion he is a musical genius who has composed many superb pieces, and the soundtrack that he created for this anime is no exception.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 5/10\\n\\n\r\nMumei singlehandedly saves this category. She's a total badass who can also be very adorable. Mumei has her cute moments that bring a smile to my face. She also has her epic moments, like when she singlehandedly eliminates a large group of kabane, and is disappointed that she couldn't do it in under 100 seconds. Mumei also has depth and experiences conflict throughout the show that helps her to develop as a person, though her gradual transformation admittedly isn't always believable. Sadly, she's the only character in this anime who's like this, and the rest are as dull as the zombies that they fight. The other protagonist, Ikoma, is decent, but he's nothing special. Ikoma doesn't start off as a typical weak or uncertain protagonist. From the beginning he shows signs of badassery. However after episode two, he just seems to run out of steam. In fact, I don't think he develops at all as a character throughout the entirety of the anime. Most of the side characters are rather annoying since they rarely know how to properly deal with the kabane and constantly try to get rid of Ikoma and Mumei, two of the very few people in this show who actually manage to accomplish anything. You'd think that being on the verge of extinction would make the senses of these people keener, but instead it feels like some of these characters have the intelligence level of your average mindless zombie.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 6/10\\n\\n\r\nDespite its flaws, this is a pretty entertaining anime. It has a large sum of faced paced action mixed with a good amount of tension that leaves viewers on edge. Plus Mumei is really enjoyable to watch and she has her moments of awesomeness. Also the atmosphere created by the sound and animation makes watching Kabaneri an even better experience. Unfortunately, the show got duller as it progressed, which consequently sucked out some of the enjoyment that I derived from watching it.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 5/10\\n\\n\r\nAlthough a 5/10 is an average score, I can't help but feel a twinge of disappointment. I predicted that Kabaneri would be a strong 8/10 after watching it's initial episodes, and I just think that the anime partially let me down. It was mainly the poorly constructed story that held this anime back. Nonetheless, Kabaneri is a somewhat exciting show, and I would recommend it to people who love intense action and gore.",

            "content": "Survival is a theme that is touched upon quite a lot, and not only when it comes to the anime medium. Most of these kinds of series tend to engage this rather generic theme with interesting and good-looking fights, completely ignoring the plot's development and the characters' growth on the audience, instead adding a lot of gore which apparently triggers the \"feels\" of ignorant masses because, you know, losing someone precious is hard. There are many ways to strike a certain series despite the generic concept, instead of doing that you might as well develop some characters hence making it feel not as retarded. Kabaneridoes not do that, and it also is full of the \"retarded adults syndrome\", it being apparent in the whole anime, despite the main characters themselves being idiotic. Consequently, all it manages to be is a copy of Attack on Titan, if not even worse than that, and yup, that ain't good at all.\\n\\n\r\nKoutetsujou no Kabaneri takes place in a post-apocalyptic Earth, in the face of an industrial revolution, where unknown creatures named Kabane have appeared, them eating flesh and drinking human blood, hence becoming humanity's natural enemy. Once a Kabane bites a human, that human becomes a Kabane and so on. Post apocalyptic Japan has been colonized into train stations, which themselves are cities and are surrounded by walls, with trains travelling between them for many reasons, including provisions and soldier transfers. Interesting huh? Well, despite some of the points of the concept being indeed interesting, such as combining a steampunk setting with survival in a world that has been destroyed were, not really, because there was nothing left in order for the concept to be supported, therefore the execution being extremely weak. Letting alone that the dialogue was really cringy and reminded me of SAO, everything else except the production values was, likewise. After all, trains can not save anything. \\n\\n\r\nThe havoc has wreaked, and then there is our main character, Ikoma, who is an overenthusiastic fellow. Guess what, he wants to kill the Kabane in order to avenge his sister who was bitten by them. He develops a weapon which can kill Kabane in an easier manner, and boards Koutetsujou because the city is not to be inhabited anymore with several other people, to whom I will get into later, him broadening his horizons and deciding that it's not fair that only strong people have to survive or whatnot. The moods of the main character change quickly depending on the situation, so he sometimes is extremely badass whilst in others you wanna hit him in his head with a screwdriver because of how retarded his actions are. Another bad thing about him is that he actually is the most likable character in Kabaneri. Unfortunately.\\n\\n\r\nEnter Mumei, our second main character, who is your generic fare of courageous on the outside, feelsy yet manipulated in her childhood on the inside. Not that it matters, but it is the revelations about her that are extremely lazy, leaving me with a hand scratching my head. She is the one to inherit the standard \"strong people survive, weak people die\". The portrayal of that ideal is really bad, as it is played with and goes round and round to reveal that, in the end, Mumei should not become like her mum who was killed by the Kabane, and that she should remain strong and get experimented in order for her to become her \"brother's\" puppet, becoming a Kabaneri and wandering around like an idiot not knowing what to do with her life.\\n\\n\r\nMumei's symbol of admiration, Biba, whom she calls her brother, is the most interesting character in the whole series, appearing relatively later in the series, only for the audience to learn that he is the leader of the Kabane extermination troops in order to satisfy his egoistical means, adding yet another idiotic character to the cast. By the end of the series, he has become your common villain with only a flashback to be supported with, following the quote \"in the face of our supposedly enemies, he is the one that should be exterminated because of his evil means\". Apart from these three, there are other side characters which are cookie cutter like our mains, including your Ayame-sama, her knight who is always by her side, Ikoma's friend who dies for the sake of melodrama and many many more, including the retarded adults whose IQ is minus 150. Bad writing is all over the place, there are no explanations given about what the hell the Kabane are, and true, some but few characters might have gotten some development, but that was done with some of the lamest, laziest and most boring excuses aka. Plot devices I've ever encountered in my life. Along with an ending that obviously was not the best, after the trainwrecks all the other episodes were, the outcome most surely is not that noteworthy.\\n\\n\r\nWhat Koutetsujou no Kabaneri lacks in every other department, somehow wins when it comes to the art and animation sections, because you might as well make something bad at least look good. The backgrounds are great, them being the best point of the whole series, the sceneries being fresh and given a good amount of lighting. The choreography of the so-judged significant battles, especially the ones in episode 8, is pretty detailed and make up for some shortcomings incoming with the drop of budget in the middle episodes, although it looks a whole lot like Attack on Titan's 3D Maneuver Gear. The character designs are as a matter of fact not bad-looking, but they somehow are unappealing in certain moments, especially when it comes to the character's faces. Mumei's face is a huge representative example, as when included in light-hearted moments, like those where she plays with the kids, where her face looks extremely moe-ish and unfitting to the whole thing (her armpits and legs make up for it though). A character design that I personally liked is that of Horobi, which is quite detailed and looks great in a certain battle scene. A plus, amongst others, would also be the costumes of each and every significant character, which are cool enough and remind me a lot of a crossover between the cheap clothes used by people back in the industrial revolution along with some style to support the steampunk setting. Overall, despite the animation quality drop in some episodes, the section as a whole smelled success, over how bad other things in the series were per say.\\n\\n\r\nSoundtrack-wise, Koutetsujou no Kabaneri is fine. It comes down to each person to how much they will like edgy music or not after all, and in Kabaneri's case, the opening and ending songs have fitting music and lyrics to the series' concept. The OST was misused some times, a good example being Mumei's flashback where a happy-toned song was used in a scene which was downright sad. The voice acting was quite okay, though forgettable most of the times, the exception being Ikoma's, which was both exaggerated and unforgettable in a whole bad way. He sounded like someone who was getting laid off at the time and place he spoke in. Consequently, the soundtrack was above average despite myself not being a fan of Sawano-esque music because it is repetitive as heck.\\n\\n\r\nTo say the truth, I somehow enjoyed Koutetsujou no Kabaneri quite much, with both its goods and its of significant amount bads. I enjoyed the fights and their choreography, the sceneries and the backgrounds and I laughed at how tarded the characters were. Noticing how much of a \"Nothing happened: The Animation\" it was, was incredibly fun as well. It literally went round and round and achieved nothing but nothingness, void, darkness. And even if it did achieve something, it was by default pointless, because in the end, nothing happened. Only edgy teens trying to survive in a post apocalyptic world full of blood-drinking creatures, generic and undeveloped villains and retarded adults, with the whole meaning of the word. I would have enjoyed it way more, hadn't it tried to be as supposedly serious as it was in the first place.\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion, Koutetsujou no Kabaneri is just another one show of the kind which includes overhyped Attack on Titan-esque shows like Black Bullet. If you expect a show with relatable characters, a realistic depiction of survival and interesting yet explained lore, avoid it like the plague it is. However, if you just need a show to cool off with and do not care about any kind of flaw and shortcoming, engage Kabaneri of the Iron Fortress like the ephemeral and cathartic journey it is. To finish with a bang, I am going to quote a friend: \"It will be performed as an opera on the holodecks of the ships that disperse us into the heavens. We were really just clothed monkeys until it allowed us to transcend our animalism. I shall sing its praises to all that shall come forth and be enlightened. If it was not Clannad After Story that could make you cry, try Kabaneri, that is how amazing it is\".\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 3/10",

            "content": "This show reminded me that one can immerse in the anime world just by simply watching it. With its breathtaking visuals and compelling story, I was taken into the world of Koutetusjou no Kabaneri.\r\nNow a lot of people will say it's a rip-off of the mainstream anime, Shingeki no Kyojin. Well, I digress. This show actually offers more than suspense and action. For one, not everyone in this show is powerless. The characters are actually able to fight back from the monsters easily. Not everyone is at harm because the threat wasn't that big (no pun intended). The real problem lies outside the walls, butnot the monsters. It's the humans themselves. The way I see it, it has more similarities with Guilty Crown than Attack on Titan.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of Guilty Crown, the characters themselves resembled those from the show. Even the mechanisms and biology of the show was the same with the one in Guilty Crown. I mean, the main character even resembled Shu in some way. Mumei is just an energetic Inori, and The villains are... you get my point.\\n\\n\r\nWhat I liked about this show the most was its setting. A steampunk Japan surrounded by zombie-like creatures, and people can still travel to different places without enclosing themselves in walls. Also, the animation focused more on the movement of still scenes rather than bloodshed in action scenes. It doesn't even try to become a horror anime. More like its main priority is to present exciting visuals and storyline rather than excite viewers through the use of fanservice.\\n\\n\r\nIn short, this series was well-done. I definitely recommend this to Aot and non-AoT fans alike. Then come back and tell me if you're human, Kabane or Kabaneri.",

            "content": "Koutetsujou no Kabaneri (also known as Kabaneri of the Iron Fortress) is honestly one of those series that almost wants to make you rip your hair out. By first impressions, the show seemed to be on the right track. Dubbed by some as a generic clone of \u201cAttack on Titan\u201d or the next \u201cbig thing\u201d, this series is one that is filled with controversy.\r\nAs an original anime by Wit Studio, Koutetsujou no Kabaneri seems to be inspired by a lot of generic concepts taken from the dark fantasy genre. These concepts ranges in variety from survival horror, revenge, tragic past, monster invasion, betrayal, experimentation, youname it. If you\u2019ve seen a monster movie, chances are, you\u2019ll find one of these ideas stuffed into this show. As the first few episodes rolled through, I do have to admit that the series is highly entertaining. The storytelling sparks interest, the setting has potential, the characters are diverse, and the production is solid. So what exactly went wrong?\\n\r\nBefore we get to the meat of the series, it\u2019s probably best to understand the staff behind the series. Besides Wit Studio, we got director Tetsuro Araki who is well-known for his work on Attack on Titan. Then, there\u2019s Ichirou Okouchi, the guy that wrote the scripts for Guilty Crown. And finally, the music you hear throughout the show is crafted by Hiroyuki Sawano who is well known for many series (Kill la Kill, Aldnoah Zero, Owari no Seraph) Take this in all a second and you may see a pattern. And chances are, you\u2019ll find some familiarity with these shows if you\u2019ve seen them.\\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s pretty much one of those mainstream shows that tries to appeal to a broader audience. And by that, I mean it\u2019s a show that tries to do everything possible to make it entertaining. Not necessarily entertaining for its story but more about its over the top notch action. It\u2019s pretty obvious though. The production quality of the series is stellar. A simple glance at the first two episodes will have you in awe with the action as we see humans fight monsters (or otherwise known as Kabane). These monsters seems mindless and inspires horror based just on their appearance, behavior, and way to try to assimilate others into their race. The setting has the apocalyptic feel with the widespread destruction caused by the Kabane. Furthermore, we also have steampunk technology in the form \u2026trains. That\u2019s right, trains. They are actually called Hayajiro and are locomotives used for transport and protection due to their armor. The most infamous one is the Koutetsujou where we meet our main characters.\\n\\n\r\nCollectively, the characters are both generic but also has some unique traits about them. The main protagonist is Ikoma. He may seem like the typical teenager but has genius intellect when it comes to inventions. On the other hand, there\u2019s nothing too special about him except for his main role in the show because of his personality. You\u2019ll probably notice it right away from other series similar to this: the type of characters where they have a strong will power to protect what they believe in and make a difference in their world. Then, there\u2019s Mumei, a strange petite girl with a lot of mysteries of her own. Unlike Ikoma, she has the personality of a child despite her powerful abilities to fight the Kabane. It\u2019s also shown that she had a tragic past so expect PTSD-like scenes in some of the later episodes. In essence, what she lacks is more of a character that can be relatable or we can feel attached with. Although throughout the series, Mumei does forge a strong bond with Ikoma that seems to grow more and more. However, the way some characters develop throughout the series is rather questionable. While Ikoma follows a straightforward progress of becoming a savior of mankind, Mumei\u2019s character seems to develop backwards from a badass fighter to damsel in distress. While I still find the chemistry between Ikoma and Mumei to be fun to watch, their characterization is something that really degenerated. \\n\\n\r\nOf course, we do have the princess of the series. Meet Ayame Yomogawa who is blessed with noble blood. She\u2019s pretty much the typical female character you\u2019ll find in books who has a reasonable understanding about certain individuals, is honest, and even shows mercy to her enemies. She also shows potential as a leader and unlike Mumei has more of a mature personality. And if you can guess by now, she also has her own personal bodyguards such as Kurusu, a serious man with a code of honor and skilled fighter. So on paper, the majority of the characters from the series each has their own strengths and weaknesses. You\u2019ll discover them easily through their role in the story and believe me, some of them are generic to the core. On the other hand, I do like some of the relationship dynamics throughout the show. Strong friendships such as Ikoma and his childhood friend Takumi, the deeper bond between Ayame and Yukina (engineer of the Kotetsujo), and Ikoma and Mumei\u2019s building trust are just a few to name. \\n\\n\r\nSo initially, I had little problems with the show mostly because it\u2019s what I had expected and nothing really took me by surprise. The revelations and identities of the Kabaneri, zombie symptoms spread through like a \u201ccurse\u201d by infections, background history/storytelling, or the weaknesses of the Kabanei never really bothered me. What started to become rather questionable is the storytelling and execution of the episodes around mid-season. Out of nowhere, we get antagonists whom I find as some of the most stereotypical characters I\u2019ve ever seen. Their motivation and roles in the story almost makes me puke just because how preposterous they are. As I\u2019ve also mentioned before, Mumei becomes one of the most insufferable female characters in the series later on. That\u2019s actually a bit disappointing to realize as well because the show has painted most of the female characters as strong women. Otherwise, storytelling takes a swerve with two faced characters, the overemphasis on certain plot devices (such as mind control), and overall just seems unrecoverable after certain episodes in the latter half of the season. The inserted breather episodes are overshadowed despite their importance while deaths of certain characters are extremely predictable from miles away. \\n\\n\r\nBy technical standards, the show is gorgeous. There\u2019s little concern about it as production values remain high throughout the entire series ranging from battle segments to cinematic choreography. The setting of the series is also designed with high caliber quality with rich backgrounds. The technology has a crude yet firm design such as the weapons that Ikoma and Mumei uses or the locomotives we see every episode. The monsters also gives a horrific feel with their design and although isn\u2019t too unique still inspires fear. Finally, character designs sophisticated that makes both the male and female characters credible with their roles.\\n\\n\r\nIf you got headphones, then definitely put them on for the show. It\u2019s worth it because the OST is something that will get you in the mood quickly. Because the show is very action oriented (especially in the first few episodes), you\u2019ll quickly catch on with the flow. The OP and ED theme songs are also nicely choreographed and sung by world class talents. Speaking of talent, Sawano\u2019s skills are easily recognized as well that combines elements of thriller and his instrumental style to bring the show larger than life when it comes to music. On a lesser note, character voice mannerism is moderate and you\u2019ll hear plenty of screaming. \\n\\n\r\nSo, the big question mark is if you should watch Koutetsujou no Kabaneri. It\u2019s an original show so there\u2019s nothing to lose when it comes to adaptation. But for its storytelling, do be aware that it\u2019s not exactly as impressive as it seems. Characterization throughout the series is questionable for certain characters and the show also suffers from numerous flaws about them. But if you\u2019re in it for some fun entertainment, then this is definitely the show to go see. Put those headphones on, ride the train, and see what\u2019s ahead.\\n",

            "content": "BOKU WA KABANERI DA!!!!!!!!!!!1!!!one!!!oneoneshiftone!!!!eleven!!!\r\n\r\nKabaneri. What happened? This show was supposed to be the Attack on Titan that everyone wanted. All the pieces were there to get everything on track- Tetsuro Araki as the CONDUCTOR, Wit Studio in the boiler room, and my main man Hiroyuki Sawano handling the harmonic balancing in the CABOOSE. With these three wheels churning, Kabaneri should have been a hit. But oh man... did it ever DERAIL itself about halfway through. \r\nThey say that monorails make for a good one liner, but Kabaneri really RAILROADS you through the story. There's something tobe said for a fast paced show, but this one is full steam ahead from the first minute, burning off much needed characterization in favor of jumping from one action setpiece to another. The inclusion of a machiavellian villain who has no discernible goals other than to be a giant dickhead and watch the world burn could have been a great DEPARTURE from the norm in anime- villains who have some grandiose rule the world or become immortal plot. However, Biba truly is just evil for the sake of being evil, and his entrance into the plot comes far too late to have much effect in taking us DOWN THE LINE. \\n\\n\r\nFor those who don't mind getting OFF TRACK into mindless violence involving a little girl and a level 87 Platinum Edgemaster of the Balron, though, this show could be your TICKET! For everyone who is looking for characters to EXPRESS themselves through something more than action, the show runs out of STEAM very quickly. Once the shock value of decapitating a pregnant woman, killing children, and generally showing no mercy to most characters that aren't listed in the main cast wears off, it pretty well SIGNALS the end of anything that's not pure action schlock for Kabaneri. \\n\\n\r\nIn fact, this show could have been a FIRST CLASS alternative to Attack on Titan, had it just come out of the gate sooner. It's almost like there was a DELAY, and this made it to the STATION late, but nobody got a refund or free trip. All told, this show is basically a one way trip to high action, but never gets back to any kind of real storytelling. Revenge is a powerful motivator, but when it's the only thing DRIVING the show- it looses a lot of its STEAM. \\n\\n\\n\r\nThe bottom line: \\n\\n\r\nIf you liked Attack on Titan, you'll probably like this. It's all the action with very little of the teen angst. Another zombie series that's heavy on action, light on characterization, and a visual feast- just don't BOARD with too many expectations, or it might just RUN YOU OFF THE TRACK.",

            "content": "Remember the last time an anime truly gripped you, a show that you couldn't put down and was complex and intellectual? If you're looking for something like that, Kabaneri of the Iron Fortress is not the anime for you. Plagued by vanilla characters and repetitious fight scenes, Kabaneri was the disappointment of the season for me. How could something combining zombies, samurai and steam punk be bad? Please allow me to explain ...\r\nLong, long ago in a galaxy far, far away there exists a populace chronically threatened by incessant hordes of zombies called Kabane. Most of the world's people are confined to living in tightsettlements or aboard one of several titanic locomotives. Although the Attack on Titan comparisons are evident, I initially found the setting reminiscent of the recent cult classic film, Snowpiercer (those of you film buffs who have seen it will probably understand where I'm coming from). All we as viewers seem to need to care about is that the zombies attack by the shitload, are very hard to kill and pretty much everybody is a pussy about it. Ikoma enters stage left with the hatred and knowledge of these creatures that seems to transcend virtually anyone else in the show, despite the fact that he's probably only a teenager. Why? Because anime says so. I was initially receptive of Ikoma's zealous personality, and thought he was a protagonist I could really get behind. He had just cause and didn't whine like a baby. Nowadays that's just about all I need to not hate a character.\\n\\n\r\nThe first episode was rather intense, and I could feel my expectations building. I kept thinking \"if the show just keeps it up, if it keeps up this intensity it'll be good\". However, the main area where Kabaneri fails is depth. It doesn't have much going for it past its shock and awe face value, and it started to bore me after a few episodes. It's like a young puppy let loose after being in its crate all day. At first it runs around hyperactively and makes lots of noises but eventually ends up just chasing its tail and pooping on the carpet once it loses its excitement. We see Ikoma turn into a Kabaneri, or half man/half Kabane, by a process which is lazily explained. He uses this newfound power to defeat more Kabane, meets this wild child who is also a Kabaneri, develops awkward feelings for her, then the bad guy is introduced, everyone is irritated/mesmerized by him, more Kabane are killed, some people die... yadda, yadda, yadda. I think this script may have actually been stolen from a B movie director and pawned off as an anime. Kabaneri literally has nothing else going for it other then impressive fight scenes and questionable lolli fan service with Mumei. \\n\\n\r\nThe writing in Kabaneri is just dreadful. I'm not asking for a Pulitzer Prize winning script here, but I would like something better than what can be comprised by a third grader with writer's block. The dialogue is stale and unsettling with constantly recycled lines and sporadic conversations that don't necessarily seem to fit. Mumei is the most frequent culprit here. One minute she's laughing and joking around with little kids and the next she's a cutthroat lapdog unwilling to listen to reason. I get the whole half Kabane thing, but is there also mind control going on? If so, that certainly wasn't explained properly. It's also quite amusing how the Kabane horde attacks are written in the script, as if to say \"oh yeah, in case you forgot, here comes another zombie attack!\" Timing is impeccable. Most of the scenes seem reactionary, like nothing in the show is premeditated. So many different themes or touched on but never really explored. The writers spent too much time delivering cheap action sequences rather than focusing on the characters or what made the Kabane tick.\\n\\n\r\nWith the zombie genre, Kabaneri had a unique opportunity to do something most anime don't have the luxury of, being scary. While some of the moments were intense, it never really captured the fear that SnK did. I felt rather apathetic when characters were killed off, because the poor writing didn't really make me care. The individuals killed felt more like useless fodder than real people with families and friends that cared about them. I think back to other zombie films like 28 days later and World War Z where I was absolutely frightened during some scenes, wishing that one day an anime is able to capture that same emotion in me.\\n\\n\r\nSometimes, even by anime standards, some events that transpired in Kabaneri can be unreasonable and unrealistic. The fact that I'm questioning the validity in Ikoma's process in becoming a Kabaneri in the first episode speaks volumes. If what he did was truly possible, I feel like it wouldn't be such a revelation and that somebody would've figured it out long before he did considering the Kabane have been around for a while. There's also a portion in episode six or seven (I can't remember which) where a precarious, intense battle where many lives were lost jaggedly transitions to some kind of a festival? How can they sit around making fireworks when they can't even establish rice fields? Are they so na\u00efve to think that fireworks arent going to attract a horde of zombies? Possibly the dumbest scene in the entire anime. If there was anything well-placed in this series, it was Mumei's skirt, since I wasn't unnecessarily bombarded with panty shots while she was flipping through the air in damn near every episode.\\n\\n\r\nI could write a lengthy dissertation on all of the issues I had with Kabaneri and its script, but I should probably point out a couple positives for good measure. If there's one upside to the writing that I can attribute, it is undoubtably the fight scenes. For the most part, the scenes are well choreographed and intense with characters introducing new weapons and tactics at various points throughout the show. I also like how they wrote scenes with Ikoma, with incorporating his severe lack of battle experience into his fighting style. He'd be rumbling and bumbling while slightly skiddish, and I often thought he would get overrun by the Kabane... Only to prevail at the last possible moment. This is one of the few areas that I wouldnt improve on.\\n\\n\r\nTo elaborate on the character aspect, let's start with our protagonist, Ikoma. If anime has taught me anything, it's that the list of badass characters with glasses is rather small (Sakamoto, Shiro etc.). I should've heeded to that red flag when Ikoma was introduced, because underneath it all he really doesn't get that much development. Aside from the first episode or two he serves more as a placeholder in the generic protagonist trope than anything else. The writers were negligent on his past and focused on other aspects of the story instead. Mumei serves as the necessary fan service part of the series, as I've already seen some rather scantily clad images of her floating around the Internet. It's actually kind of sick considering the fact that I think she's only like 13 or 14 in the show. At least we learn a little bit about her past, and how she turned into a Kabaneri to begin with. She arguably has the most depth of any character in the show, as she experiences multiple flashbacks along the way. The villain seems like a spoiled brat who resents his father and wants to bring down everyone else because of it. I don't know if it's just me, but I'm so sick of these archetypes. I mean we get it, your dad was mean to you but can you stop whining about it already? I feel like killing thousands of innocent people to get your point across isn't necessarily the way to get back to your father. The rest of the cast is as bland as they come, all replaceable in their own right. Being the nerd that I am, I really wanted to delve in deeper and see what I was missing in the character's motives and aspirations since they were never really explained. Unfortunately, there's really no source material for me to gander at, as Kabaneri is a standalone anime and not transposed from a manga.\\n\\n\r\nEven though I've already watched 12 episodes, I still can't decide if I like the art in this series or not. On one hand, the character models are unique and the environments remind me of an early 2000's anime. But also in some respects I can see that as a negative. It could be used as an excuse for lazy artistry since it didn't have a lavish budget or use the standard illustrations we're used to seeing in anime today. I'll have to go ahead and give the artists the benefit of the doubt on this one, since most steam punk animes seem to have different styles (Last Exile, etc.), and given the fact that there was no overuse of CG.\\n\\n\r\nThe opening for Kabaneri is actually quite enjoyable. I've seen more and more anime utilizing a small intro phrase or something of that nature to get their opening started, and it really seemed to be effective here. The music seems to fit the setting well, and the animation and choreography was top notch. This is what truly got me hyped for the anime initially. Perhaps even more polarizing than the opening was the ending. Despite the overall disappointment I have for the show, I have since added the ending song to my playlist of top anime music. Some of the rest of the background music fits in decently, but the show still suffers from recycled tracks and occasionally missplaced music. Incorporating a ballad with strong female vocals is normally nice, but not in the middle of a fight scene were Kabane hearts are being ripped out. I don't really know what they were thinking here. The voice acting cast was buffed up, and even ironically included the likes of Yuki Kaji (Eren from SnK), but no single performance really stuck out to me. Not to mention one of the engineers randomly spoke English from time to time. Really, what the hell was that about?\\n\\n\r\nWhenever I look back to Kabaneri, I will always think about what could have been. While Attack on Titan was certainly not my favorite anime of all time, Kabaneri had an opportunity to learn from its shortcomings, but it just didn't capitalize. You know what they say, you can lead a horse to water but not make him drink it. If I could recommend this anime to anyone, it would be those who play videogames where they like to mash a button repeatedly (i.e. Dynasty Warriors). There's not much else to be explored then mindless drivel and flashy fight scenes. Eventually someone in anime will get this zombie thing right, but until that day I await with bated breath. As always, thanks for reading and be sure to check out the rest of my spring 2016 reviews!\\n",

            "content": "No matter who the enemy might seem to be (zombies, titans, mutant bees, flying pigs), the real enemy for humans will always be humanity itself. I believe kabane were only a tool meant to emphasize that. I'm not gonna lie, I'm not very bright and this review's not gonna be the most intelligent thing for you to read. Just a humble review for humble people interested in giving Koutetsujou no Kabaneri a shot. \r\nStory\r\n6/10\r\nReally messy, but somehow its mediocrity made it seem like a piece of reality adjusted to fit a steampunk puzzle. Real world is filled with people who make bad decisions, kill (apparently)for no reason and do reckless and pointless things. Same happens in Koutetsujou no Kabaneri, making the story confusing and a real pain to take in certain moments. The ending was not great, but satisfying, even though some said it was rushed, I didn't want to get more than this.\\n\\n\r\nArt & Animation\\n\r\n10/10\\n\\n\r\nIf you pay attention and look closely, you'll notice how even the hairs in the eyebrows slightly move when the wind blows. I've never seen such details until now, I'm really impressed with how meticulously the animation was done. The art style and colors fit the story perfectly, turning plain backgrounds into an explosion of details. The character designs are also unique. \\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\r\n9/10\\n\\n\r\nI've noticed a lot of new voice actors (like Ikoma's), pretty refreshing considering that I've heard some voices so many times I've had enough of them. And not only they were new, but also very good. \\n\r\nI liked both the OP and ED, performed by EGOIST and Aimer respectively. The background music was like honey for my ears, a happy combination of classic, electronic, ambiental and rock music.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter\\n\r\n7/10\\n\\n\r\nSome were annoying and some were memorable. The writers failed at creating strong personalities for most of the characters and in all that mess of people acting subjectively I wish there was at least one to save the disaster. Given only 12 episodes, the character development is impressive in Ayame's case which turns into a brave leader from a daddy's girl not long time ago. \\n\\n\r\nOverall\\n\r\n8/10\\n\\n\r\nEnjoy it for what it is, not for what you expect it to be.\\n\\n\\n\r\n--Thank you--",

            "content": "Dammit, Kabaneri! You had it! You were good! But then you just had to had to make things human, didn\u2019t you? You couldn\u2019t just stick to what you were actually good at, no; in fact, you\u2019ve completely forgotten what made you great in the first place!\r\nIt\u2019s not every day that I get to say an anime was not only the most surprisingly good show of the season, but also the most disappointingly bad. With a strong start, a shaky midsection, and a complete disaster of an endgame, the anime had gone completely off the rails. Kabaneri of the Iron Fortress truly is a trainwreck.\r\nThere, yougot your fucking train jokes. Are you happy?\\n\\n\r\nBut before things go south, let\u2019s sit in a circle with our juiceboxes and thinking caps and really think about the idea of Kabaneri for a second. Let\u2019s get the obvious out of the way: the guys making the Attack on Titan anime understand that the second season is taking way too fucking long, so they made Kabaneri as an appetizer. But is that all?\\n\\n\r\nThink about what\u2019s popular these days. What\u2019s the biggest anime of the 2010\u2019s? Attack on Titan, pretty much. What else is popular in mainstream media? Zombies. Somehow. It\u2019s been a while and they\u2019ve gotten kinda old, but The Walking Dead is about to put out a seventh season, so I hope everyone\u2019s happy. While Titans were like zombies to begin with, Kabaneri has Kabane, which are literally zombies, but with a small Titanic twist that makes them a little harder to kill than normal.\\n\\n\r\nPut these two things together, and you have instant potential for a big mainstream hit.\\n\\n\r\nNext, the production. Wit Studio have been working on Kabaneri for well over a year (Noitamina first announced it in November \u201814), so they\u2019ve had a lot of time to add a modern polish to an otherwise timely-looking art style, with the more realistic faces, stellar lighting and shading, and less saturated coloring. It looks fucking awesome, and I\u2019d consider it perfect if the close-ups didn\u2019t look so ancient and if the anime industry would finally learn how to do CG decently. MFW the iconic Koutetsujou is just a bad CG train.\\n\\n\r\nSo where am I going with this? Well, call me crazy, but I think Koutetsujou no Kabaneri was made as a way of celebrating anime, by making a concept that best defines mainstream anime of today, while presenting it with a classic style. By blending the old and the new, Kabaneri could possibly have been meant to be iconic in anime\u2019s history, and a tribute to all fans of the medium.\\n\\n\r\nNow, does that mean it\u2019s good? No, Kabaneri sucks lol\\n\\n\r\nBut, while I\u2019m doling out compliments, the art isn\u2019t good because just because an old-looking show that still feels new. Solid character designs, gorgeous vistas, and a great steampunk setting combined with an Edo-period look help define Attack on Train\u2019s aesthetics. Zombies, aka Kabane, are creepy-looking buggers with blood of molten iron, or some shit like that, which not only makes them (literally) metal as fuck, but it gives them a pretty, fiery glow to contrast with their dark purple bodies, and they look great as a result. Fighting them often involves some fantastic choreography with a lot of animation and camera movement, with some overall good direction from Tetsuro \u201cI Need To Make Everything Look Dramatic As Fuck\u201d Araki, and creative ideas in the technology. ...Until you get to the lazer-firing zombiwaiT NO FUCK STOP READING YOU DIDN\u2019T READ THAT\\n\\n\r\nMeanwhile, Hiroyuki \u201cI Need To Make Everything Sound Dramatic As Fuck\u201d Sawano composed a beautiful score, blending his cinematic orchestra with an electronic flair as usual. To be honest, it sounds like every soundtrack he\u2019s ever done, which is good or bad depending on your opinion of the guy, but I think he\u2019s consistently great. While not particularly his fault, I felt that the music was a little intrusive at times; as in, it sounded louder than it needed to be, and I had trouble focusing on what people were saying. \\n\\n\r\nAnd while the OP is nowhere near the best of Egoist, her soft-yet-powerful voice takes the reigns of the song KABANERI OF THE IRON FORTRESS WHICH IS WRITTEN IN ALL CAPS FOR SOME REASON. It works well for the anime, as it takes an epic choral and string arrangement and layers it over electronics, going along with what I said about blending old and new. I think the song\u2019s just okay, though. The ED is much, much better, with a beautiful duet by Egoist again, as well as the singer Aimer; the composition is a lot more interesting with its riffs on piano and acoustic guitar on top of a hard-hitting percussion. \\n\\n\r\nGolly, I sure am positive about Kabaneri for someone who gave it a 5/10. What the fuck happened? Oh... that's a good question, honestly.\\n\\n\r\nOn top of what I said above, we have the main protagonist, Ikoma, as in \u201ceek!! omagod the habaneros broke through the wall!!\u201d This guy is pretty standard as a hero, but he\u2019s not bad. He\u2019s respectable for having the drive to do things himself instead of being thrust into a situation against his will. he\u2019s experienced loss, but, very surprisingly, they don\u2019t play this up very much so he doesn\u2019t have an annoyingly corny sob story. Moreover, his ideals don\u2019t align with those of the rest of the world, who live in great fear of the Kabane to the point of the officials acting like American cops killing anyone even remotely suspicious. Don\u2019t mind me, just taking my edgy jokes for a walk. Ikoma also develops his own steam gun, which is powerful, but not exactly the best weapon ever, but he turns half-Habanero so he still gets some extraordinary power, all of which being the result of his desire for changing the world. He\u2019s a standard shounen guy, which is good enough, but he can be pretty badass at times. At the very least, he\u2019s better than a lot of other characters here...\\n\\n\r\nThe first four of episodes are good for introducing the characters and establishing the setting pretty well, but the next few (and the third, I guess) can basically be summed up with \u201cMumei is a fucking idiot.\u201d This stupid girl, with the most troll-ish character design ever, being a 12-year-old with the body of someone much older, changes personality almost every episode and goes along with everything anyone says, unless their name is \"eek! omagod the zombies r breaking through the gate because mumei gj stupid\". She gets told about a small hint at some conspiracy, so then she acts like a cunt to everyone. She trusts someone so much that she\u2019ll do anything they say, not think about the overwhelming consequences, and then look in horror as everything goes to shit because of her. But I was at least willing to forgive some fuck-ups if Kabaneri could get its shit back together.\\n\\n\r\nIt didn\u2019t. It got so shit that even flies were repulsed by its stench.\\n\\n\r\nThe main villain is established late into the series, and he\u2019s so utterly boring. His motive is basically revenge, but then he fucks up everything else around him and paints it as \u201cliberation\u201d or some bullshit. \u201cI just killed this entire village for the sake of humanity! You\u2019re fucking welcome!\u201d Sure, he has a brutal backstory, but his excessiveness prevents the audience from feeling sympathetic in anyway. It\u2019s more of the writers making him as hateable as possible.\\n\\n\r\nBut that hardly even compares to what eventually happens with the Kabane. You think this is just a bunch of steampunk weapons and zombies? Hahahaha\u2026 fuck you. Bring in superpowers. Because why not, I guess. Once you see a weird humanoid Kabane fire a freaking laser, that\u2019s when you know the train has derailed. That\u2019s when all the clever ideas were thrown out the window in one fell swoop. It\u2019s over. But oh no\u2026 the show still has a couple episodes left. And you spend them getting frustrated at a random bad guy killing someone asking for help, listen to the villain babble about god-knows-what, watch Mumei get completely used like a cheap, underage hooker, and then eventually understand Ikoma\u2019s disappointment towards the rest of civilization for being such idiotic dickfucks all the time.\\n\\n\r\nThe second half is just a clusterfuck of bad game-changing ideas, inconsistencies, and people being idiots, heavily contrasting the ambitious first half. Could it have been fixed with a higher episode count? I don\u2019t really see what good that would\u2019ve done. I guess you could flesh out the characters more, but you\u2019d still have the dumb Kabane shit. Is the second half still good in any way? Well, the action is still\u2026 okay, at least, and the production\u2019s still there, but everything worth seeing is in the first half. This habanero tastes pretty weird after a while.\\n\\n\r\nKabaneri was good. It was actually really good in the beginning. It was the most hyped show at the start and had a lot of reason to be at the top. I would love to say that Kabaneri is iconic, that it\u2019s something that will live through the ages as a beloved series, but even if they dare to continue it, it\u2019s just not meant to be. \\n\\n\r\nAlso, Ikoma\u2019s haircut is stupid and I don\u2019t like it.\\n\\n\r\nStory - 5/10\\n\r\nArt - 9/10\\n\r\nSound - 9/10\\n\r\nCharacters - 3/10\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 4/10\\n\r\nMumei - 12yearsoldneverforget/10\\n\r\nOverall - 5/10\\n\r\nFavorite episode - 1\\n\r\nFavorite character - Ikoma\\n\r\nRecommendation level - Medium",

            "content": "Ahh, a show about humanity being pushed to the brink of extinction due to a sudden appearance of man-eating monsters who are overwhelmingly powerful. Wait, doesn\u2019t that sound familiar? If you say yes, it\u2019s Attack on Titan, then you\u2019re absolutely right. There\u2019s absolutely nothing wrong with an AoT clone if it improves on AoT, but somehow Kabaneri of the Iron Fortress manages to do everything worse, spiralling down into a ludicrous mess of melodramatic, illogical plot elements and a villain so poorly founded and comically evil that it is laughable. Kabaneri of the Iron Fortress (especially the latter half) can only be best described asa the love child between Guilty Crown and Attack on Titan, and in absolutely no way (literally no way) is this a good thing. At all. This show is deplorable. \\n\\n\\n\r\nHailing from the same studio (and director, and composer) as Attack on Titan, it\u2019s understandable and inevitable that there are going to be some similarities between the shows; However, whenever Kabaneri of the Iron Fortress attempts to differentiate itself, it fails in a spectacular fashion. In the first episode, they attempt to replicate the \u201chooking\u201d effect the premier episode of AoT had, sweeping you up into a violent and dramatic rollercoaster, keeping you at the edge of your seat as you eagerly anticipate the following episodes. What made AoT\u2019s premier episode do this so effectively, is how the show juxtaposes the peaceful, cattle-like life of the civilians within the walls, with the violent massacre that ensues once the Colossal Titan shows up and everything turns to shit. None of this intensive juxtaposition is present in Kabaneri of the Iron Fortress. Right from the get-go this show emphasized its edgy, violent and melodramatic nature, so when things turn to shit it doesn\u2019t have the same effect AoT\u2019s first episode had. It was predictable, and on top of that, came off as very soulless. \\n\\n\\n\r\nLet\u2019s look at plot holes and elements that are entirely illogical. The Kabane are the Titan equivalent in Kabaneri of the Iron Fortress (or KNK, from here on out). The concept is simple, once you get bittn by a Kabane you turn into one, and the only way to kill one is to pierce their heart that is protected by a solid iron rib cage. This presents a great obstacle for humanity, as their simple steam based weaponry isn\u2019t powerful enough to penetrate the rib cage. This honestly blew my mind with stupidity; The zombies can\u2019t heal or regenerate, so cutting their heads off is the most efficient and effective way to get rid of these zombies.They can\u2019t hear, see, and most important of all, BITE YOU! There are so many moments where humans are wielding Katanas trying to JAB THE KABANE\u2019S HEART! I MEAN SERIOUSLY!? You have a weapon designed SPECIFICALLY for cutting yet you are JABBING its heart like you\u2019re fencing or something. It just doesn\u2019t make sense, how can their be humans so dumb to think that\u2019s an effective way of killing the Kabane? That\u2019s how you know what little thought was put into this show, when such an obviously blatant plot hole is present yet no writer decides to even remotely justify it.\\n\\n\r\n Another thing is the abundance of slitting wrists in this show. Literally, the characters slit their wrists. I mean, I know the show is edgy but there has to be a limit, in the first episode Ikoma slits his wrist thinking it\u2019s a good idea to attract zombies that way, I mean seriously? Your wrists, where a crucial artery lies? You\u2019re going to slice that? I don\u2019t understand how he didn\u2019t die from blood loss. He isn\u2019t the only one who thinks that\u2019s a good idea, either, and that\u2019s the scary part. It\u2019s like the writers in this show just decided to abandon reality entirely and write whatever they want; it perplexes me that nobody working on the show pointed this out, does nobody at Wit Studio understand how bad of an idea it is to cut your wrists? \\n\\n\\n\r\nLet\u2019s talk about this show\u2019s meager world building and insufficient world exploration. According to its synopsis, Kabaneri of the Iron Fortress is set in the far east on the island of Himoto, where humanity resides behind the safety of a colony of walled shelters connected via train tracks. Yet, the only settings of this show are the train and 2 stations, one of which is the biggest one in the entire island. KNK is another show to fall victim for biting off more than they can chew, as they tell you how big their world is but never expand on it in any way (granted, this show\u2019s limited run time is partly to blame). The mechanics of their civilization are never explained, how the Shogun (authoritarian leader of the colonies) gets messages across, how food is grown, etc. Speaking of food, apparently rice hasn\u2019t been grown or eaten for decades in the show, but how does that make any sense? Rice isn\u2019t even that hard to grow, all you need is sufficient rainfall and a warm climate, neither of which were shown to be absent from the show\u2019s setting. They can\u2019t just say things like \u201cRice hasn\u2019t been eaten for a long time\u201d without explaining why, hell, a quick google search shows 11 ways to grow rice in your damn backyard, but you\u2019re telling me the entire island of Himoto can\u2019t grow rice? How can there be no rice, but there can be fireworks? Mines? Bamboo? Peas? Garlic? Onion? I mean come on. I know I\u2019m literally getting mad over rice, but what may seem trivial is in reality extremely lazy writing especially when the show leads you to believe that there are going to be more things than available, as many loose ends are formed that are shrouded with uncertainty. \\n\\n\\n\r\nKabaneri of the Iron Fortress attempts to differentiate itself from Attack on Titan towards the latter half of the show. They do this by changing the conflict from humans vs Kabane to humans vs humans, with the Kabane as a weapon. This could have worked if the antagonist of the humans vs humans conflict was a well-founded, understandable and coherent character. Instead, we get this comically evil, cold-hearted sibling figure that has daddy issues. His motivations are unrealistic and laughable, and the fact that there are people working for him perplexes me, since there is no logical reason anyone would aid his unnecessarily destructive unhealthy grudge. There were a few melodramatic scenes that attempt to intimidate you by showing off the villain\u2019s overwhelming evil prowess, but it\u2019s so farcical that I was unable to stop laughing. Every trait that makes a typically good antagonist is entirely absent from the villain in KNK, his motivations are illogical, he\u2019s not intimidating, his dialogue is cringeworthy and nonsensical, I could go on but the point remains the same. Almost everything pertaining to the villain was done wrong. Kabaneri of the Iron Fortress even attempts to foreshadow the villain very early on, but it fails remarkably once more. There is a difference between subtly foreshadowing an event, and simply insulting the viewer\u2019s intelligence by acting like they haven\u2019t figured out the twist out already. Just from the dialogue of certain characters you can tell who the villain is going to be from the FIRST EPISODE, yet the show constantly tries act live they\u2019ve kept it hidden very well. \\n\\n\\n\r\nUltimately in terms of plot, Kabaneri of the Iron Fortress is simply a poorer version of Attack on Titan. The show tries to sell you something that they don\u2019t have, relying heavily on melodramatic and action scenes to entertain you\u2014this show doesn\u2019t have any substance to it; mediocre mindless entertainment at best. Don\u2019t get me wrong, though, there is indeed such a thing as good mindless entertainment and this show simply doesn\u2019t get it; for mindless entertainment to be good your cast needs to be likeable and endearing, and your show needs to understand itself that it\u2019s mindless entertainment. KNK has no idea that their show is a joke and consistently tries to be something it simply isn\u2019t, making this show the best comedy this season. t\\n\\n\r\nThe characters of Kabaneri of the Iron Fortress are extremely shallow, with little to no layers, as well as offensively stupid. There are only two characters that undergo any mentionable development, and the rest of the cast never behave consistently. Let\u2019s first take a look at our protagonist, Ikoma. In the beginning, Ikoma was portrayed as a better version of Eren Jaeger from Attack on Titan; he had a deep and well-founded hate for the Kabane, but, unlike Eren, was very capable, intelligent, and actually developed an effective weapon to fight against the Kabane. Throughout the course of the show, however, it\u2019s as if Ikoma relapsed, falling prey to the same annoying character traits Eren had, including incapability, na\u00efvety, and his off-putting incessant rage. It\u2019s as if Ikoma is incapable of having a calm and normal conversation with anyone, he always has to be yelling or some other dramatic motion. There are several moments when Ikoma spews these really cringeworthy lines of dialogue, too, including but not limited to \u201cyou have a lot to learn\u201d and \u201cyou\u2019re not as fast as X character!\u201d. These shortcomings pertaining to his character make it difficult to connect and admire Ikoma as for the most part you\u2019re simply annoyed with him.\\n\\n\\n\r\nLet\u2019s take a look at Mumei, now. Mumei is actually one of the only characters in KNK that undergoes some mentionable development, but it\u2019s not like this development is very profound or original. Being 12 years old (let\u2019s just ignore the obnoxious hypersexualization of her character, no way her body and age correlate) Mumei is obviously vulnerable to mood swings and rash decision making. But the writers of KNK don\u2019t understand how to write this part of her personality properly and realistically. There are several scenes where she is playing with the children and cheering them up, and then seconds later her personality does a 180 and she becomes this entirely different character. I\u2019m reluctant to believe that the writers actually think that is how you write a 12 year old\u2019s mood swings. No child (half-zombie or not) behaves like this, opinions change on a whim but personalities do not--especially in the drastic matter Mumei\u2019s does. The writers simply do this to fall back on to the only thing they can use to entertain their audience: shock factor. \\n\\n\\n\r\nMoving onto Ayame, who is the shining light in this endless dark pit of distasteful characters. Being based on the \u201cHime-sama\u201d character archetype, Ayame is the daughter of a governing family and is very elegant, soft-spoken and protective. Ayame, being the heir of the Yomogawa family (governing family within the walls) is naturally put in a position of leadership when her father is absent. Her sheltered personality and reliance on her father and bodyguards make it difficult for her to effectively lead her people, as seen during her incapability to control the people\u2019s panic when the Kabane had invaded the walls. However, the more difficult positions Ayame is put in throughout the show, the more she is able to fluently grow into the position of leader and the more effective she becomes at it. There is a scene in the second episode where her authority is questioned, and her position is revoked in a pseudo-revolution as people rely on fear instead of rational thinking. By the end of the episode Ayame confronts these people once more, and there you get to see a very profound change in power dynamics as she realizes her natural talent for leadership and seizes back her authority. Her naturally protective nature makes for some very interesting moments as she interacts with several characters who pose threats to her people. Ayame\u2019s development from the sheltered and soft-spoken princess to the stern and iron-willed leader is easily one of the best parts of Kabaneri of the Iron Fortress. \\n\\n\\n\r\nWit Studio absolutely killed it production wise, producing what I think is the best looking show this season. The characters have these great vintage-esque facial and character designs with some absolutely stunning fight choreography and cinematography. The soundtrack was produced by my personal favourite composer Hiroyuki Sawano, and as someone who\u2019s listened to all of his soundtracks, I can safely say the KNK OST is some of his best work. \\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 4/10:\\n\\n\r\nHonestly, the beginning 6 episodes of this show probably deserved an enjoyment score of 7 or 8, as the show was bad, sure, but at least it was fun. That is until the latter half of the show where it changed from fun to boring, and from bad to deplorable. It got to the point where it became a chore to sit through the final episodes as I had little to no interest in any of the characters or any of the events. I honestly wouldn\u2019t have picked up this show if I knew how bad it was going to get. \\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall 3/10:\\n\\n\r\nEasily one of the worst shows I have seen in awhile, and probably the most disappointing show this season. I wouldn\u2019t even recommend this show to someone who liked Attack on Titan, it\u2019s a try-hard wanna be of it as Wit Studio attempts to replicate their success. The writing in Kabaneri lacks any sense of originality and creativity, relying heavily on stolen plot elements and clich\u00e9s that culminate in an unbelievably ridiculous, edgy, melodramatic finale that solidified its position as the most disappointing show that came out of this season. The only thing original about this show is the fashion in which it failed.\\n\\n\r\nI hope this review was informative and helpful.\\n",

            "content": "*SPOILERS FOR KOUTETSUJOU NO KABANERI aka KABANERI OF THE IRON FORTRESS*\r\nI'm sure you've heard this question before: What do you prefer? Starting off strong but ending badly, or starting off weak, but ending strongly? Whatever your answer may be, this show falls into the former, like a rooftop jump gone wrong. The first 7 episodes were this fun run that had a few stumbles but was still cool, episode 8 was that big leap, and episodes 9-12 were this random ass train smashing our fucked, airborne friend into the concrete, showing a hand in hope that it wasn't all in vain, before the finale explodedthe train into gloriously sad bits, as all of the show's  issues were put on full blast. Nonetheless, I still like the show all things considered, but there's a reason this earned the nickname \"trainwreck.\"\\n\\n\r\nIn the middle of an industrial revolution, an outbreak of armor-clad zombies known as Kabane has spread into a zombie apocalypse, and now it is up to the likes of Ikoma and all members of the Koutetsujou to hopefully out and end to it. Now, this show has some questionable things from the beginning, but with enough decent pseudoscience and explanations, we could've seen a really unorthodox and interesting zombie show. Instead, a lot of the radical moments weren't explained with decent and interesting reasonings, but were handwaved for the sake of plot and maybe time. It seemed like a standard story at first but with clever science, could've made for a really good and interesting steampunk zombie apocalypse, but then, with the lackluster villain, and the ludicrously safe and plot mangling finale, it unfortunately falls short of what it could've been. It definitely has more than its fair share of plot holes as well. I mean, it's a mess! Things like Kabane muscle memory and later, OP Kabaneri steroids don't get explained at all because \"action\" and interesting things like Kabaneri being resistant to heat, Kabane clinging on to each other to make a colony beast with one Kabane used as the heart, or the knowledge on how to halt and slow down the Kabane virus in order to be a badass Kabaneri get the same treatment. That is the sad thing. Plus, the motivations of our true villain Biba, don't add up with his actions, and well, and honestly, the second half was so stupidly and boringly written.\\n\\n\r\nIkoma is a slightly more calculated shounen character whose traits I just mentioned flip-flop and clash with each other. Sometimes, it's understandable, like when he loses his best friend in EP 10 for the soft and shounen side, and like when he has to kill actual people in the finale as well as Kabane because not every human is an ally, and not every human has shown a reason to be allowed to live when it comes to the harsher and calculating side. He's probably the best character here for being a remotely solid character. Plus, he actually feels real at some points, as well as his best friend, due to some of their reactions and conversations in times like this being what most actual people would do rather than just simple characters, like freaking out when they find out that their project for making a weapon to combat Kabane in episode 1 actually works as Ikoma kills a Kabane. Mumei, is a badass and jerkass in the first half, and a total child for most of the 2nd. She has an interesting bit in episode 4 where her mouth and grim ideals get her admonished by her already stupidly jumpy and dickish co-passengers, but that's the closest thing to anything she has going for her as a character. Kurusu is just a samurai with a jerkass side, and Ayame, is barely any better, being that type of female authority figure that likes cooperation between enemies rather than needless violence, which only really gets to shine in the last few episodes. The villain Biba, is easily the worst, however. He's shallow, cold and calm, with grim ideals, and a vendetta against his asshole father that should've been fleshed out more so that we can buy into his motivations. His actions are pretty deplorable as is, so, meh. His death scene was the only time we saw any sparks of life in this husk of a character. At least one of his lackeys has some decency despite being kind of a rouge guy. Also, poor Horobi. She never got fleshed out, and she still managed to call her death.\\n\\n\r\nI do like how the first half of the show focuses on these unlikely allies on the Koutetsujou cooperating to defeat a common enemy despite being at each other's throats all the time, and how betrayal of that begrudging trust by one of the members in episode 10 leaves a detriment in one's reputation, even if it turns out he was a spy to get our heroes some benefits later on, courtesy of Ikoma. If only we actually saw this with interesting personalities.\\n\\n\r\nSome awkward 3D CGI in episode 6 aside, this show looks amazing. The fully detailed and high def look to the realistic art style really gels with everything beautifully, and the action scenes are well done with some incredible bits here and there. The explosions, spark effects for whenever a Kabane or Kabaneri gets stabbed in the heart, and the well done and detailed explosion effects are downright astonishing, even if there are some odd bits here and there with some action scenes. Hell, the art style is an epic update on that 80's OVA shading art style, and has numerous references to 80's art style themes, like Ikoma's cool new haircut in the end of episode 11 reflecting they badass punk-looking character type in the 80's. Given that the character designer was Haruhiko Mikimoto, legendary designer behind the characters of Macross, Gundam 0080 War in the Pocket, and Gunbuster. His work is legendary and I'm glad to see his stuff again, even if it is for a train wreck. The character designs look amazing, and more anime need this upgraded shading style. This was by far, Studio Wit's best work yet in terms of art. Just, look at how detailed and well done the character models, environmental and explosion effects, and backgrounds are! That's probably the main reason why many people like this show so much. It looks impressive and the action is bombastic and glorious.\\n\\n\r\nThe music in this series has several tracks that are as catchy as they are fitting. This soundtrack was done by Hiroyuki Sawano after all; it's pretty much expected for him to knock it out of the park every time. The songs are definitely good, and the cola tracks are all great, and while they aren't all that memorable on their own, most of them feel like they were tailor-made for this series. Not one song feels out of place at all, and another large part of what makes the action in this show so breathtaking is how each fight has a piece of music that fits perfectly with what is going on, whether that be an action scene or that transformation sequence from Kabaneri Ikoma to Steroids Kabaneri Ikoma. Also, the OP, Kotetsujou no Kabaneri, is done by EGOIST, so of course it sounds catchy and awesome. The ED, done by AIMER sounds really cool too, and I wish there was some cool animation stretched to it. Plus, some of their songs were used in this OST, so good for them. Plus, \"Through My Blood\" (the song that plays during Ikoma's roofed out transformation) by AIMER is an awesome track as well. Also, WarCry (which is sung entirely in English) is pretty damn catchy.\\n\\n\r\nFor the first 7 episodes, I absolutely loved this show. It was so awesome and epic. It even had some nice comedy, especially in episode 7, and some nice realistic banter and reactions that we don't really get to see a lot of in anime, which I mentioned was a cool thing about this show in my review of ERASED, which had bits like that. However, some of the later episodes really crashed and burned in my eyes, ruining what could've been an incredibly fun show. Plus, the finale really aggravated me with all the BS and asspulls in there.\\n\\n\r\nThe group consensus for this show is that while it was entertaining and impressive to look at and listen to, it fell short of what it could've been via failure to explain interesting yet radical things, and failure to give a decent finale and antagonist. I wholeheartedly agree. It's not as good as what it could've been, but it was a pretty entertaining show to watch, even if it turned out to be a bit of a \"Trainwreck\". Well, with all that said, I bid you adieu.",

            "content": "\u201cTHE APOCLAYPSE STARTER PACK\u201d \r\nWhatever disaster happen in this world. Absolutely, we can\u2019t predicted about that. That\u2019s why we must make preparations and brainstorm our mind to address this problem. You\u2019d better prepare your transportation, shelter and food for emergency. Sometimes, natural disaster occurs in the several country and there\u2019s a lot of cost to recover all this things. In fact, this is just information of the catastrophe. Henceforth, our discussion is about the theme of post-apocalyptic & you know? \u201cweapon & suit & tank is the paramount things in the battle against zombie, right?\u201d In the year 2016, the WIT Studio launched their newAnime project & it\u2019s not an adaptation of manga or novel. Now, I\u2019m proud to present the most popular Anime as we know it. \u201cKoutetsujou no Kabaneri (Kabaneri of the Iron Fortress)\u201d\\n\\n\r\n\u201cHaters gonna Hate and ain\u2019t-ers gonna ain\u2019t\u201d. Basically, we can see there was a lot of criticism of the Koutetsujou no Kabaneri in the myanimelist review, previously. I know everyone of you have a different opinion about the story. In fact, some people think it's one of the greatest and they gave a compliment for the series. Meanwhile, haters are being a bit too harsh on it because they say this series is a blatant stole from Shingeki no Kyojin. Besides, I bet all of you comparing Koutetsujou no Kabaneri with that Shingeki no Kyojin, when you write a review about the series \u201cAM I RIGHT\u201d. Actually, I was a bit reluctant to watch this Anime for the first time. However, I\u2019m just ignored my scepticism. Basically, I tried to evaluate a situation of the story. In my considered opinion, this series have a lot of the struggle to retain humanity in front of impossible conditions and their characters always have strategies to solve the problem. One question \u201cBefore you are waiting for Shingeki no Kyojin 2nd season - would you like Koutetsujou no Kabaneri instead\u201d, Yes or No. \\n\\n\r\nWait a minute!!! You want to know a secret formula of Koutetsujou no Kabaneri, it\u2019s :\\n\r\n[World War Z film + The Walking Dead series + Highschool of the Dead + Shingeki no Kyojin + Unstoppable film  =  Koutetsujou no Kabaneri]\\n\\n\\n\r\nStory : 5\\n\r\nJust trivia, Tetsur\u014d Araki who was the director organizes the actual making of the Koutetsujou no Kabaneri series. He is best known as the director of the Death Note, Highschool of the Dead, Guilty Crown and Attack on Titan anime adaptations and I never thought Okouchi Ichiro (Script, Series Composition) is scriptwriters for the Koutetsujou no Kabaneri series. I believe everyone know, he\u2019s also original creator of Code Geass (In my considered opinion, Code Geass is a masterpiece). \u201cForget about it\u201d let\u2019s focus our discussion. According to the story, a monsters it\u2019s called Kabane. If humans got bite by the monster & they become Kabane creatures. That\u2019s why people have built stations to shelter themselves from these Kabane. Hayajiro or locomotive running on steam, its transport wares between people & they can access the station. \\n\\n\r\nOne night, one of the locomotive running on steam or Hayajiro, called Fusang Fortress is coming. However, the train hijack was organized by a group Kabane and the train is really fast and there is little probability of the train crashed into a Aragane station. When they realized about this situation. A few people at the station, attempt to seal the railway station. \u201cTIME IS RUNNING OUT\u201d they can\u2019t make it in time. The accident happened and this is the beginning of Kabane to assault on a people at the island country Hinomoto. \\n\\n\r\n***NOTE : Another words is \u201cKabaneri\u201d it means half human and half Kabane\\n\\n\r\nHowever, I have my doubts about the story & crucially, \u201cI\u2019M CURIOUS\u201d ok firstly, this story explain the infection transforming humans into Kabane and rapidly spreads. However, it never explained to any degree where this Kabane comes from???? Because I want to know the history a mysterious virus appears during the industrial revolution. Do you remember?? What did Eru Chitanda says, when she's has a curious about something and she's always says \u201cWATASHI KIRINARIMASU\u201d.\\n\\n\r\nNow, we move on to another topic. You know what? Sometimes Koutetsujou no Kabaneri reminds me of the Twilight film & Strike the Blood series. The both of story is about vampire creatures. In fact, Ikoma & Mumei both of them have the same personality with Vampire (I guess!!). Besides, if there has been a decrease of the blood in their body. All they need is blood from human being. Sometimes, they couldn\u2019t control themselves, if they have craving for blood. Fundamentally, they took the human blood to preventative measures to stop their body become Kabane form. Guess what, who\u2019s the volunteers to help them and they become blood donors for them, \u201cOF COURSE\u201d the Princess Ayame, Kurusu, Kajika, Kibito, Takumi and Yukina (watch episode 4). Crucially, I never thought this might be happen in the story. At the beginning, I can\u2019t make any sense of what the purpose of the motive. However, I realized blood is circulates round the body going from the heart and lungs along arteries and returns to the heart through the veins (especially human). Which means Kabaneri has a heart failure and that\u2019s why they always need some blood. By the way, I can deduce for this case \u201cHALF KABANE + HALF HUMAN + VAMPIRE = KABANERI\u201d.\\n\\n\r\nI found the series was reaching its climax when \u201cOUR HEROES IS BACK\u201d Ikoma is reunited with his team-mate to save Mumei. Next, Ikoma had to battle against Biba (the villain, who\u2019s unleashed the chaos) and finally, he did it to defeat Biba. However, Biba awoke and tried to kill Ikoma (Ikoma's collapsed at the moment). Out of the blue, Biba was stabbed in the chest by Mumei and Biba died. Of course \u201cHAPPY ENDING\u201d. Actually, the most ridiculous part is Ikoma has return after he was killed by Mumei. Seriously, I thought he\u2019s die at the moment, however he\u2019s still alive. \u201cWHAT THE F**K\u201d. It\u2019s really strange. OK just remember one thing, I assume the protagonist of the story is \u201cIMMORTAL\u201d. Nobody can kill him.\\n\\n\r\nI thought, could it be possible Shingeki no Kyojin & World War Z film inspired WIT Studio to made Koutetsujou no Kabaneri series??? Well, this series is an exact \u201ccopy & paste\u201d, yet is not much different with SNK & World War Z film. I mean look at the performance of the character in the story & don\u2019t forget about the plot of the story, seriously it\u2019s quite similar. Truthfully, WIT Studio imitates its competitors by making very similar story. In fact, the final score in the myanimelist was score 7.94/10 (scored by 47,219 users) & it\u2019s really different based on IMDb score (627 IMDb users have given a weighted average vote of 8.30/10). By the way, Koutetsujou no Kabaneri deserve the appellation of \u201cPlagiarism\u201d. \\n\\n\r\nFurthermore, Koutetsujou no Kabaneri mainly focus on the drama, emotion, and the action. The best slogan for Koutetsujou no Kabaneri utilizes is \"One For All & All For One\" and also \u201cThe Strong Survive While The Weak Perish\u201d. I realized there\u2019s a few of a butterflies comes out in the series and it was one of the shock scenes I have ever seen. Crucially, it\u2019s really same scenario with the STEINS;GATE and Boku dake ga Inai Machi (ERASED).\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacter : 8\\n\r\nFirstly, I really appreciate the \u201cseiyuu\u201d have contributed to the Koutetsujou no Kabaneri project \u201cWELL DONE\u201d and they are very talented as voice actress. Based on my opinion, all of them are \u201cseiyuu\u201d prodigy & they are having unique voice for casting of the character in the series.\\n\\n\r\nFrom my observation about the protagonist, Ikoma\u2019s very brave & knowledgeable about the weapon & he\u2019s always make a new strategies to solve a problem. In fact, he\u2019s engineer too and he creates his own weapon called Tsuranukizutsu or Piercing Cannon. I saw Ikoma was in trauma after her younger sister was attacked by a Kabane. However, the pain was more than he could endure. Next, the heroine is Mumei, \u201cseriously\u201d she\u2019s really \u201cBADASS\u201d and she\u2019s has 3 personality same with the characters of Shingeki no Kyojin, for example Mikasa & Levi & Annie. In fact, she\u2019s has same personality with Mikasa (as you know Mikasa has outstanding ability in the battle against Titan and this is same thing happen, she\u2019s (Mumei) has outstanding ability in the battle against Kabane) & Levi (she\u2019s reminds me about Levi kicked Eren face and that\u2019s what she did to Ikoma. She has no doubt to \u201cKICK HIS ASS\u201d, watch episode 3) & also Annie (we know that Annie has good fighting with her opponent and it\u2019s similar with Mumie, she\u2019s has oriental fighting techniques, when she\u2019s against someone). Now about the princess Ayame. Fundamentally, she\u2019s is leader of Aragane station. Since her father die, she\u2019s going instead of him. Besides, she has a kindness personality. Next, the characters is Kurusu. He\u2019s appearance like a samurai warrior. Besides, he always make sure that all his soldiers know exactly what they must do in the battle against Kabane. Besides, he\u2019s always care about the people. The next supporter characters is Yukina. She piloted the train (Ironclad Fortress) into another country and she\u2019s working with 3 crewmen who can operate an express fortress, they are Takumi & Sukari & Suzuki. Besides, they are an expert engineers.\\n\\n\\n\r\nArts : 10\\n\r\nIt was great work done by Haruhiko Mikimoto because his contribution for original character designs. Next, I want to compliment the arts it\u2019s really accurate, superb and this series has really high quality art and animation. I really loved how they did all of the facial expressions in the series. I like the character expression in the animation, sometime it have wrath expressions, fear expression and it has grief-stricken expressions. Based on my opinion, Koutetsujou no Kabaneri animation is quite similar with Shingeki no Kyojin. Furthermore, the utopia of the story is really unique and the construction of the fort, city, train and the railway is the magnificent construction, I have seen. \\n\\n\\n\r\nSound : 9\\n\r\nIn fact, I really love their opening theme \"KABANERI OF THE IRON FORTRESS\" by EGOIST and the Opening song video featured the characters in the battle against corpse and present about their struggle to save humanity and it\u2019s really impressive. Next, I\u2019m not forget about the ending sequence \"ninelie\" by Aimer with chelly (EGOIST) is really beautiful song. I\u2019m glad to see Aimer featuring chelly (EGOIST) to sing this song & previously I heard Aimer song for opening theme Fate/Stay Night : UBW 2nd season. Based on my opinion, EGOIST is a professional singer & I like the latest song in the year 2014, it\u2019s \u201cEGOIST \u2013 Fallen\u201d for PSYCHO-PASS 2 Ending song. Now, I will talk about theme song composition, music. It\u2019s really great because the soundtrack created by Sawano Hiroyuki. In fact, he\u2019s the creator of soundtrack for Shingeki no Kyojin too. Besides, the soundtrack has a catchy tune and f**king awesome.\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment : 4\\n\r\nSo far, I love the action, adventure, and drama of the story. However, I would not said the story, \u201cit was most enjoyable\u201d because there\u2019s a few of flaw in the plot of the story. Next, there is only another unique of the story. Its show the apocalyptic scenes of destruction caused by the zombie in the Edo era and I think is really impressive. The soundtrack of the story it\u2019s really magnificent, \u201cThanks Sawano Hiroyuki and you are the brilliant person & the BEST composer\u201d.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall : 3\\n\r\nEssentially, this story taught me about brave and struggle to gain something, such as happiness, freedom, peace and save humanity from this doom. I want to compliment about the teamwork. For example, their warrior tried to ensure the safety of the people. I think its good things they did. So far, my expectation for this story will surpassed Shingeki no Kyojin (I hope so!!!).To be honest, the narrative part of the story it\u2019s really disappointing and for the whole of the story Koutetsujou no Kabaneri is POOR. Guess what rating would I give that story, it is 3.00/10. I wouldn't say that the story in Koutetsujou no Kabaneri is particularly notable or masterpiece. However, Koutetsujou no Kabaneri is something that I could call a straightforward and clich\u00e9.\\n\\n\\n\r\nI hope that this review makes you consider what the pros and cons in the story.\\n",

For example, it was obvious the Black Smoke monster was used with CGI and sometimes, when they showed a zoomed out action scene, they used CGI for the characters.\r\nSound: 10/10\r\nJust go listen to the OST. Words can't describe how amazing it is.\r\nCharacter: 4/10\r\nI have to be honest: I hated most, if not all of the characters. They getlittle to no development and I hated how paranoid everyone was. That rule they had for whenever you enter a new station, you have to stay in the train for 3 days made no sense. They were already checking people for bites, so why the 3 day rule? Also, I understood how the people were suspicious of Ikoma and Mumei because they didn't know about Kabaneri, but it got ridiculous to the point that they almost abandoned them twice even when they got saved by them. Finally, how is it that Ikoma is the only person in the entire anime that was researching a cure for the virus?? I know that it's the Industrial Revolution, but if something was threatening the very existence of the human race, wouldn't you want to do everything in your power to stop it??\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9/10\\n\r\nI loved the action.\\n\r\nFinal score: 8/10\\n\r\nAlthough there were some aggravating things about this anime, I still really enjoyed it overall because of the action.

            "content": "**SPOILER REVIEW** \r\nIf I had to describe iron fortress in a word it would be... generic. Now you don\u2019t have to tell me how overused and pretentious that word is, because I\u2019m very well aware of that. But I suppose it\u2019s the most appropriate word to use for this anime because that\u2019s exactly what it is. This is indisputably one of the most generic anime I\u2019ve seen in a long time. The biggest problem with this iron fortress is that the vast majority of it is so standardized and uninspired.  It's a show you've probably seen many times in the past and probably morein the future. I envy anyone that\u2019s capable of watching and enjoying something that\u2019s been retold countless times in different ways. Not only is the story of Kabaneri hackneyed, the actual execution of the story is filled with ludicrous moments and poor characters. With its formulaic structure, it's at best a low-end ditto.\\n\\n\r\nStory\\n\\n\r\nSo the story is about humans on the verge of extinction again, but this time they\u2019re up against kabunes. Basically, the kabunes are mindless zombies that eat human flesh and raid trains and towns occasionally. From there we are introduced to kabaneris,  human-kabane hybrids that have super strength and healing abilities that fight off the kabunes. The story follows Ikoma, who is a kabaneri that wants vengeance against the kabane. He\u2019s accompanied by loli Mumei and wimpy friend Takumi. Sound familiar? It\u2019s as if I\u2019m repeating the synopsis of Attack on Titan. Wit Studio has done this story structure twice already. Hell, iron fortress and attack on titan even share the same director. \\n\\n\r\nTo start off, the kabune infection and main threats of the story is plain ridiculous and, by addition, the story is too. Sometimes the infection turns a human into a kabune within minutes, except when the plot decides to change this to days for no reason. It can be deterred by strangling yourself (no joke) and or even given through magical serums. They explain how Ikoma learned about the strangling technique through his research, but how and when was a scenario or an experiment ever shown to him or the audience? Despite finding out crucial information about keeping your humanity when turning into a kabune, Ikoma illogically, never informed anyone of this.\\n\\n\r\nWithout a delay, the humans quickly establish a bad relationship with the kabaneri. Initially with their given situation and miniscule knowledge of the kabaneri, it made enough sense that they wouldn\u2019t trust them. But after watching the kabaneri protecting the humans for a large portion of the story, it is apparent that the drama between the humans and kabaneris became too absurd for its own good. For example, Mumei killed a pregnant women that had just turned into a kabune. For some odd reason, the other characters antagonized her despite there being numerous incidents where soldiers killed a bitten person. There\u2019s even a scene where people thought the kabaneri brought the kabunes to them which led to the their imprisonment. \u201cYou're no different from a Kabane after all!\" All the adults being stupid are just plot conveniences to continue this tense climate between humans and the kabaneri. It\u2019s just lazy writing altogether. \\n\\n\r\nAfter the story wanders around aimlessly, we\u2019re introduced to the villain, Biba. His intentions and overall plan just baffles me and I\u2019ll get to him later. Ikoma and friends try to rebel against him with Mumei being somewhere in the middle. Takumi ends up dying along the lines by taking a bullet for Ikoma. This is just a really half-assed effort to tear-jerk the audience. Takumi has already witnessed Ikoma survive severe injuries with his regenerative powers. Why would he even feel the need to jump in and \u201csave\u201d him in the first place? Could the exact same scene of occurred in a way where Ikoma was shot and then Takumi dies? It would\u2019ve made much more sense and far less stupid.\\n\\n\r\nSo after Biba finally ends his father\u2019s life, he continues to bring about widespread destruction on everyone in the city for no reason. The Kotetsujyo are imprisoned and Mumei turns into what appears to be a shadowy dog with butterfly wings. Ikoma comes in with Kurusu and it\u2019s up to them to save the day. Prior to this, Ikoma used a drug to basically turn into a super saiyan, but it will cost him his life. The white blood can only save him or Mumei. So after an underwhelming fight, Ikoma is able to save Mumei. Mumei kills Biba and everyone escapes on a train. Ikoma is alive and breathing. WTF?! It\u2019s implied that Biba somewhere along the lines used the white blood to help him. Why, when, and how did he do this? \\n\\n\r\nCharacters\\n\\n\r\nI don\u2019t have much to say about most of them, so I\u2019ll be talking about the ones I felt were important, starting off with Ikoma. He is as original as the premise of this anime can be, not at all. He makes a pledge to himself to never run away against the kabune after the death of his little sister. There is nothing else that defines his character. We know nothing about his past other than the death of his sister. We also knew nothing about his sister. Can anyone describe this character, without also describing similar main characters in other anime? Ikoma doesn\u2019t get that much development. He\u2019s more like a stand-in of a generic protagonist. \\n\\n\r\nMumei\u2019s development was handled better than Ikoma, but her bipolar personality is hard to take seriously. She can quickly change from being friendly with kids, to a cold-blooded killer, to being motivational, to being arrogant, or conflicted. There\u2019s no transition or anything that makes it gradual. She is unable to communicate with others and her irrational behaviour loathsome. She doesn\u2019t listen to reason and acts idiotically. There are some flashbacks here and there that show why she is how she is. Even though I disliked her character, she is developed the best out of everyone. \\n\\n\r\nEnter Biba, the show\u2019s antagonist. Biba is so poorly-written, it makes me sad to hear Mamoru voice him. His intentions and motivations as logical as someone getting ran over by a parked car. He\u2019s butthurt about his daddy issues and he constantly tries to thrust the idea that the weak die and strong survive. He\u2019s a butthurt villain whose main objective is to kill the shogun, his father, and end his reign. For some odd reason, his father let the Kabane attack a city Biba was protecting at the time. Why or how his father let this happen is never explored. He\u2019s the cause of thousands of innocent deaths because he has some grudge against his father as a child. They also attempt (quite unsuccessfully, I might add) to humanize and add some depth to him in the last episode by showing him riding a horse with his papi. Remember kids, daddy issues= genocides. \\n\\n\r\nArt & Animation / Sound\\n\\n\r\nThis is the only department in this anime that stand out as being particularly well done. Tetsur\u014d Araki is once again fantastic. Admittedly it feels over the top, but I loved the writing scenes from Death Note and the swinging with the 3D maneuver gear in Attack on Titan. His style and sweeping movements along with his variance of camera angles are superb. The choreography is exceptional and captivating. It could have been much simpler to have the camera remain static. The art is pleasant and the animation is mellow. The soundtrack was as epic as it possibly could be. It climaxed during action sequences and toned down in calmer, quieter scenes.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 3/10\\n\\n\r\nI\u2019ve only enjoyed some of the action sequences. I\u2019m not much of an action fanatic, so it did very little for me. There were so many parts of the story that made me go, \u201cReally?\u201d Ok, a kabune is somehow able to fight like a trained warrior with a sword. If this isn't pushing the limits of suspension of disbelief, I don't know what is. In addition, the black smoke further exemplifies how comical this show is. The black smoke is a giant shadowy figure made up of dead or alive kabunes/humans. REALLY?! Need I say more? One episode in particular featured them celebrating and lighting up fireworks. ARE THEY SERIOUSLY NOT WORRIED AT ALL OF THE ATTRACTION OF KABANE? The unoriginal plot, the plot holes, the characterization, terrible antagonist, and character development all ruined my enjoyment. \\n\\n\r\nOverall 3/10\\n\\n\r\nI criticize this anime because I\u2019ve already seen a similar plot structure numerous times but it\u2019s being marked as something new. Because of the magical power I like to call memory, I've already experienced every formulaic plot turn they can throw. \u201cEver get that feeling of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu?\u201d Not only did that take away from the overall score, but the level of ridiculousness progressed with each episode. It's bland and soulless, created with little effort. I\u2019m willing to believe the Wit Studio dished this out for some easy $$$. They\u2019ve already done it twice, so if it ain\u2019t broke, don\u2019t fix it. If you\u2019re not aware of these cliches, then I\u2019m glad that you\u2019re able to enjoy the same stories over and over.    \\n\\n",

            "content": "Kabaneri of the Iron Fortress, or Disappointment of the Iron Fortress, you choose the best title for this.\r\nSPOILERS AHEAD\r\nThe show started very well. Despite of the amount of people comparing it with AoT, the first seemed that this show would be a blast, and also would be nothing like AoT. However, after 3 episodes, this show became a trainwreck.\r\nThe plot is almost nonsensical. Kabaneris wear tight necklaces that for some reason don't asphyxiate them, Mumei gets transformed to Kabaneri by Biba just because of silly reasons, Biba wants to transform everybody into Kabane because of silly reasons etc.\r\nFurthermore, there are disturbing plot holes. Katanas, thatare fragile swords, somehow could pierce a Kabane heart. In contrast to that, in the following episode, Ikoma had to build a Kabane-based Katana for the samurai guy because a normal one can't pierce the zombie heart!!!!!! WHAT????\\n\\n\r\nThe main problem with the show is that the plot isn't straightfoward. To be exact, the plot is almost inexistent. It's a train trip with friends. Sometimes the train gets attacked by the zombies and BOOM, we get nice action scenes and it's over. Later on, they meet a group of anarchist Kabane exterminators that in the end will try to kill everybody. And what happened in the last episode? Suddenly Ikoma becomes Ouma Shu and started to have Guilty Crown-ish powers. I was like \"WHAT THE HELL?\"\\n\\n\r\nAlso, the plot conveniences and the idiotic actions that some characters take in some chapters really annoys me, like when the purple-haired girl cuts herself wasting a lot of blood that could have be given to the Kabaneris instead of being wasted.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters were totally undeveloped. The only one that we could say that had a decent development was Mumei.\\n\\n\r\nOn the other hand, the ost and animation saved the day. They have Sawano, EGOIST and Aimer. This is a dream team! The art was very beautiful. That steampunk vibe was very nice too. KotIF is one of the best looking anime that I have ever watched, only losing to the Fate series (ufot. vers.).\\n\\n\r\nTo sum up, the anime wasn't very original, but had some potential that wasn't well explored. If you want to watch this, expect nothing more than a very nice ost and action scenes, because the plot is utterly trash\\n\\n",

            "content": "If you've spent enough time familiarizing yourself with the anime community, you'll come to realize that we're a demanding bunch. That should go without saying, given just how much anime tend to diverge from most mainstream trends. Because of this, we're always on the lookout for the next best thing. Constantly asking for something innovative. Captivating. Unique. Competent. Something to not only entertain but also to satisfy on some intellectual level. In a way, we're spoiled, but that's not necessarily a bad thing. We push for more because we've seen the medium deliver time and time again. Anime isn't afraid of addressing social taboos, nordoes it shy away from concepts that most other mediums won't dare to touch. It's a format that isn't afraid of stepping on a few toes (also, it helps that Japan is batshit insane). So we make demands. We ask for further development. We lobby for anime's continuous growth because we care about the medium... and yet... despite this progressive attitude... every season without fail, we support and exalt the titles that stand as the antithesis of all of the requirements we beckon for. \\n\\n\r\nWe could always point the finger at the industry, holding them accountable for the type of shows we get, but that's just pointing out the symptom and not addressing the actual problem. The anime industry is a business, and like any other business, it provides a consumer need. If consumers show an invested interest in schlock entertainment, then guess what? Schlock entertainment is what they'll offer on a silver platter. Ladies and gentlemen, at the risk of sounding like a condescending prick, I write this intro, not for some personal agenda but for us as a community. If we want better, we must first discard inferior goods. Nipping the bud of Kabaneri of the Iron Fortress's popularity isn't something you passively acknowledge while twiddling your thumbs, it's a matter of civil duty at this point. If you want change, supporting another cheap Attack on Titan substitute is not the answer. But you know what would be a step in the right direction? Gathering up your pitchforks with me as we burn this title at the stake.\\n\\n\r\nWatching Kabaneri is like watching a 5-car pile-up on a busy intersection. It's devastating, but hard to look away from. With each plume of smoke breathes a new fiery furnace of stupor; divulging deeper into new unforeseen territories of hackneyed writing. Where other shows simply crash and burn, Kabaneri decides to push forward with a broken axle and the power of irrationality to combust its engine. It's a wondrous, smoldering pile of fecal matter on wheels. A beautiful travesty captured in frame by uninspired creators, seeing just how close they could pass their hand over the surface of unoriginality without being scorched by the heat. And trust me when I say that Wit Studio got their hands pretty fucking close. Had they gotten any further, we'd be naming this Shingeki no Kabaneri: Volume II.  To say they're cashing in on an existing fanbase would be an understatement. These hacks took the cash-cow home, milked it dry, then butchered it for any remaining morsels that they could scrape together. Kabaneri isn't just below average, it's the residual excrement that resides at the bottom of the barrel. \\n\\n\r\nThe only thing more overwrought than my need to articulate ways of calling this show shit is the actual execution of the show itself. This anime is bad, I cannot for the life of me stress that point enough. There isn't a mountain high enough to utter this phrase to unexpected viewers. So instead, let's trudge through the latest member of the dung heap, as we explore the hidden depths of Kabaneri of the Iron Fortress. \\n\\n\r\nSet during the time of 'unexplored settings' in the lands of 'who cares about proper world building', we're introduced to our protagonist SeaweedWig-kun (also known as Ikoma), as he grunts around mad at everyone and everything around him, working as a steam smith for his town. In a world overran by kabane (humanoid super zombies), SeaweedWig-kun and the rest of society find themselves residing inside giant walled-in cities to protect themselves from annihilation. With the assistance of steam propelled weapons they\u2014... wait, what am I doing? Silly me, just recite Shingeki No Kyojin's synopsis and call it a day. After all, this is Wit Studio's 3rd repackaging of the same setup. \\n\\n\r\nIn my Owari no Seraph review, I created a template to help viewers identify shows with this typical premise. For the sake of saving ourselves time and me not paraphrasing what I've explained in the past, I'll just insert that here as well: \\n\\n\r\nOne day humanity is suddenly attacked by a group of [insert name of threat here] and is brought to the brink of annihilation. Over [insert amount of years] later and it seems like there's no coming back from this almost divine punishment. But with the discovery of [insert name of weapons or power here], they were able to fight back. We follow our protagonist [insert name here] as he and his comrades use [insert name of weapon or power] to fight the [insert name of threat here] and reclaim humanity in this post-apocalyptic world and slowly discover the crazy mystery of their sudden appearance that might be closer to home than everyone thinks.\\n\\n\r\nKabaneri joins its cousins God Eater, Black Bullet, Knights of Sidonia, Owari No Seraph and others as the new iteration of this tired trend. With the same director, musical composer, theme song performers, script writers, sound director, color designer, and much more being brought back from their work on Attack on Titan, the intent of Wit studio couldn't be more obvious. I could drill this point home further if need be, but every show deserves to be evaluated independently (even if there's very little worth evaluating). And while Kabaneri isn't winning any anime awards in innovation anytime soon, there are a few distinctions made that separate it from the rest. For one, it's heavy use of steampunk. \\n\\n\r\nWhile the steampunk in Kabaneri is treated with as much relevance as a script for a porno, it was still a distinction that many were initially drawn to. It gave it an identity outside of its overused setup. As pointed out by fellow colleague themegamancave, the involvement of massive trains made to accommodate and sustain people while they travel from city to city, had aspects that were reminiscent of the movie Snowpiercer. This may have given off an impression that the show was possibly going to be more than its doppelgangers (no matter how brief that hope was). With zombies, huge trains, steampunk and an industrial-like setting, Kabaneri could have been an entertaining romp, had it been entrusted in the hands of more capable creators. Even the protagonist, as rambunctious as he was at times, still demonstrated some qualities, that if smoothed out, could have made for a compelling lead. \\n\\n\r\nBut that's as far as the show got, by the end of episode one the writing was already on the wall. The show was going to be a trainwreck. Many may not have seen it, but for those that did, we buckled up, grabbed a tub of popcorn and waited for the title to eventually derail. Thankfully, we didn't have to wait long, as Kabaneri started off stumbling, only to further lose its footing on its quick descend downwards (which I would discuss in detail in my spoiler section).\\n\\n\r\nIn typical fashion for this type of show, SeaweedWig-kun's homeland is invaded by the kabane after a freak accident causes a part of the wall to be knocked down. Accompanying us on our trainwreck to hell, we're introduced to Mumei, or as I like to call her, Bipolar-chan. While the citizens run around in a panic with the kabane slowly picking them off, SeaweedWig-kun and Bipolar-chan takes matters into their own hands. Bipolar-chan, a 12-year-old terminator, made quick work of the kabane fodder while giving us glances of her prepubescent pantsu. And while this is going on, our protagonist SeaweedWig-kun concocts a plan to ambush a zombie with a weapon he made with what remaining time he didn't dedicate to yelling at people. After the dust settles from all the chaos, our remaining citizens find themselves aboard Thomas the Tank Engine as they leave behind the charred remains of what they called home. And so our adventure begins. \\n\\n\r\nWith caked on color gradients, a grandiose soundtrack by Sawano, and nice action set pieces, it isn't hard to see why initial impressions would cause mass hysteria for more Kabaneri. But little did people know, what they were getting was a ticking time bomb, just waiting for the slightest nudge to explode. Even elements that seemed to be a strong attribute at 1st couldn't keep up the fa\u00e7ade for long. Take the art and animation for example. Because of the polish look the show draped over everything, many viewers often fail to notice the fact that several scenes throughout each episode were actually still shots, with no more than a shaky-cam effect to mask it. And outside the moments that fight scenes broke out, the actual fluidity of the animation was no higher than the usual standards demonstrated by other studios. Kabaneri was a mess only held together by duct tape. And when it started bursting from the seams, episodes like 9 began to happen. And what little makeup it had to distract from the truth that was there all along, it was no longer enough to fool even the most gullible of individuals. \\n\\n\r\nThese slight of hand tricks weren't limited to later episodes either. The degree to which the audience notice these shortcomings depended entirely on their initial investment. And seeing how my invested level was lower than dirt, Kabaneri was an eyesore from the moment SeaweedWig-kun had bright ideas about how the body's circulatory system works.\\n\\n\r\nBut even a trainwreck like Kabaneri had some positive qualities. As previously mentioned, the soundtrack by Sawano did wonders for the show. It helped shape the mood and tone of the show's universe. Swelling up whenever the action came to a boiling point or simmering down during quiet moments; whatever the occasion, Sawano had all ends covered. It made the experience far more enjoyable than it would have been had a less talented composer been given the job.\\n\r\nOn a side note, there was a minor character with a widely inconsistent vernacular. I'm not sure if the voice actor wanted to be British, American or Australian. It's like trying to get Arnold Schwarzenegger to trick someone into believing he's a part of the British Intelligence. The random hammy phrases uttered by this individual got me to chuckle every time. Outside of that, the rest of the cast did fine. But ultimately the biggest highlight from the auditory department was that of Sawano. A man that unfortunately had to sully his hands once again with a project undeserving of his talents.\\n\\n\r\nAnd speaking about creators that elevated Kabaneri from the shit pile, Tetsur\u014d Araki directorial work once again shines through. No matter the project he takes on, his flare for the dramatic is never underplayed. The man knows how to get the most from the material he's given. Whether he's directing the Spiderman view shots of the 3D maneuver gear in Attack on Titan, or defying physics with the matrix boobs on High School of the Dead; Araki goes all out every time. He's to anime what Zach Synder is to film. Whether you view that as an insult or not isn't of concern, the fact is he never stops delivering his signature flare, no matter the quality of show he's working with. \\n\\n\r\nBut this is where the praise comes to an end, as our trainwreck makes its final pit stop. For those of you who've seen the show and had a hard time spotting plot inconsistencies or contrive narrative decisions, don't worry, because I'm feeling extra generous today. Join me in the spoiler section as I break down this idiotic title by each episode. And for those of you who haven't seen Kabaneri yet, scroll down past the \"end of spoilers\" indication to avoid having this 'masterpiece' ruined to you.\\n\\n\r\n***spoiler section****\\n\r\n. \\n\r\n.\\n\r\nKabaneri showed cracks in its foundation from the very beginning. This breakdown will cover them all.\\n\\n\r\nep1:\\n\r\nThe show thinks the body circulatory system works by bullshit logic, with the main character hanging himself to stop a virus. There're two kinds of choking: one that restricts blood flow to the brain, denying oxygen intake, and the other is strangulation, which cuts off your air intake altogether by closing your windpipe. Restricting your blood flow or air intake doesn't stop blood from going to your brain, it restricts it. It's like going from a gush of water to a slow trickle. So choking yourself isn't going to prevent a virus from spreading to your brain, all that would do is leave you unconscious and eventually cause death when there's no one around to help resuscitate you. This still doesn't even address the fact that he slit his wrist, which, if you don't know, could cause you to bleed to death. There's a reason it's a common method of committing suicide. So our protagonist committed two acts back to back that would usually lead to death, yet survives both, all for an end goal that logically makes no sense whatsoever. \\n\r\nEven if we put aside how illogical this solution is, and suspend our disbelief to buy into it, the fact remains that our protagonist never informs anyone of this accomplishment. If temporarily cutting off circulation to your brain and infected area is all that it takes to combat this virus, why would he not inform the other citizens about this after he had gained their trust, instead of having them kill themselves with pocket bombs? When you take this into consideration, our protagonist is essentially responsible for the deaths of hundreds, if not thousands of people. For someone who tries his hardest to protect others, he sure does a piss poor job at doing it. \\n\\n\r\nep2: \\n\r\nMumei single-handily wipes out dozens of Kabane with ease. This may not seem like a big deal until you realize what it does for the stakes of the show. If these monsters are made out to be such an imposing force to humanity, only to have them be taken out with little effort by a 12-year-old girl, what does that do to the stakes? Yes, the Kabaneri inclusion spices up the story but it also removes any sense of tension when you have a one-man army on your side.\\n\\n\r\nep3:\\n\r\nAfter saving the lives of everyone, the Kabaneri are scrutinized by the people. This isn't the actions of sensible adults, this is the writers turning an entire population into imbeciles. No matter the time period or cultural upbringing, using weapons to extend survival has always been intrinsic to mankind. Taking precaution to keep them locked up? Sure. But to outright discard them right after seeing their effectiveness in combat? Now that's plain lunacy. To top it off, these buffoonish adults gather in a mob to threaten the Kabaneri, despite seeing their physical prowess against kabane; beasts they could barely take out as a group. This is also where Bipolar-chan began to show her wishy-washy personality; switching from one archetype to another at the drop of a hat.\\n\\n\r\nep4:\\n\r\nA kabane has the ability to wield a samurai sword with as much proficiency as a trained warrior. At this point, red flags should be going off in your head. This is insanely stupid, I shouldn't have to explain why this is a huge problem. \\n\\n\r\nep5:\\n\r\nMumei's flip flopping characteristics become increasingly worse. She's always been bipolar before this episode, but this is the point where the writers show that they don't know how to write a mentally disturbed character, from one that simply flip flops between different personality traits. She goes from tsundere, to yandere, to kuudere, to dandere, back to tsundere again. This is terrible characterization. The last time I've seen a character this inconsistent was Slaine Troyard from Aldnoah.Zero.\\n\\n\r\nep6:\\n\r\nLOL The Black Smoke. Do I need to say more? At this point, those red flags in your head should be set ablaze. This is where the show nosedives at 100mph. \\n\\n\r\nep7:\\n\r\nImpoverished, with little food to feed their people, yet they have enough resources to waste on a celebration? This desperate attempt to add levity only backfires. To top it off they light fireworks... FIREWORKS! That's how you attract hoards of kabane to your location. The show temporarily forgot that it was a zombie survival story and does something far too stupid to be excused. Also, this is where Biba makes his first appearance lol And God knows what that means. \\n\\n\r\nep8:\\n\r\nIt's the introduction of Biba and the relinquishment of any integrity Kabaneri may have been holding on to. Not only does he collect Kabane like he's a pokemon master, but he's also a genocidal lunatic with little in the way of proper reasoning for any of his actions. Where other antagonists take an inch, Biba takes a mile, and then some. Also, Bipolar-chan's gullible personality is poorly excused with the actions taken by Biba to get her to the mental state she's in. \\n\\n\r\nep9:\\n\r\nAs far as I'm concerned, the show jumped the shark with the colony kabane monster, but this serves as the most noticeable case of it going off the rails completely. The Kabaneri are now pokemon, with Hyper Beams, agility, and double team. This, my friends, is what schlock action looks like. This is also the moment that many people gave up on the show. There's literally no defense possible to excuse this. The show has 0 value at this point. \\n\r\nThis doesn't even touch upon the fact that Biba killed thousands of innocent people for what amounts to him being butthurt. \\n\\n\r\nep10: \\n\r\nMumei is still a flip flopping idiot, Biba is still demonstrating Saturday morning cartoon levels of villainy, and in what was suppose to be an emotional sacrifice, where Ikoma's friend Takumi jumps in front of a bullet to protect him, losing his life in the process, turns out to be just another failed attempt by the show. You see, there's just one problem with this \"emotional\" scene, he didn't need protecting, to begin with. We've seen Ikoma have chunks of flesh ripped from him by hoards of kabane on several occasions, as well as other life-threatening injuries. The kabaneri are known to have amazing regenerative abilities. So had Ikoma been shot, it wouldn't have mattered all that much. This makes Takumi's sacrifice pointless and only there to add emotional weight for a moment that didn't have any. And after hitting a conveniently placed lever that opens up the train's walls (seriously, what function does this even serve?), Ikoma falls into the river after Bipolar-chan stabs him, in what is the most overused fake death scene in any storytelling medium.\\n\\n\r\nep11:\\n\r\nIkoma turns into Rambo and staples a gun to his arm (because reasons) and takes a drug to go super saiyan, which has the side effect of depleting his life and killing him (remember this); while Biba devises a plan that operates entirely on plot convenience. It required his father to kill him using a weapon that he himself had devised as a trap, with a convenient formula that instantly infuses your blood with Kabane's, a substance that we never saw before (which makes no sense given the prior cases of kabane transformations we've seen). \\n\\n\r\nep12\\n\r\nThe show couldn't keep its promise and at least deliver Ikoma as a sacrifice for Mumei's life. Instead, it chose the pussy way out, by keeping him alive (despite what they said just one episode prior to him taking the drug). Ikoma temporarily became a Jedi and used the force to send a train flying off the tracks. They also try to humanize Biba at the last minute with perhaps the dumbest revelation up to this point. Remember, this is a guy that committed multiple genocides because he's a little butthurt, so seeing the show try to add humanity to him at the very last minute is not only unwarranted but plain stupid. And the way he goes about receiving this forced \"redemption\" opens up another can of worms, in perhaps the show's stupidest mistake up to this point. If Biba cured the Kabaneris with the formula that the scientist had, doesn't it stand to reason that the same cure could work if you're bitten by one? This revelation not only ruins what little semblance of urgency the show had, it effectively erased all the danger of every encounter up to this point. It also negates the struggle that Kabaneris faced with not being completely human. It's astonishing just how many dumb things the show does in the last few minutes of airing. This isn't even accounting for the numerous stupid moments littered throughout the episode. The show went full-retard, there's no other way to describe what happened. \\n\\n\r\nSo with all this said, when I see people say the show was good then got bad after a Kabaneri spammed a 'Grand Rey Cero', I'm honestly perplexed, because, from my account of every episode up to that point, the show has always been bad.\\n\r\n.\\n\r\n.\\n\\n\r\n***end of spoiler***\\n\\n\r\nWhenever a title receives widespread popularity, a slew of variations and rehashes of that project tend to follow. Like in the case of The Matrix, which effectively started a trend of high-concept dystopian action movies like Equilibrium, Ultraviolet, and Minority Report. The anime community has no shortage of this event happening either, with the two biggest recent examples being Sword Art Online and Attack on Titan. Titles that saw with it a huge incentive for the anime industry to pump out MMO augmented reality shows and the next humanity monster survival tale. \\n\r\nThe only time these trendsetting tidal waves subside is when the audiences no longer express interest for that product. Kabaneri wouldn't be the last unless we as an audience say enough is enough. And while they're anime viewers who simply love the idea of more Attack on Titan, remember that this will only lead to negative backlash later on. If you consume the same product every day, sooner or later you're going to get sick of the taste. Over-saturation is what kills interest, and as long as you give these half-baked shows a monetary gain, studio heads would see no incentive to stop.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 7.5/10\\n\\n\r\nKabaneri is entertaining in the way watching a dumpster fire could be seen as fun. \\n\r\nThankfully the only casualty of this trainwreck was the integrity of Wit Studio's staff, and perhaps the brain cells of those that actually thought this had a chance of being good. I really hated this show at first, it was doing illogical things but not to the point of alerting other viewers. So while I sat there uninterested, others saw something \"good\" or at the very least, entertaining. But then the show got increasingly worse, eventually getting to the point where even casual viewers couldn't possibly ignore it anymore. And as it quickly decreased in quality, my enjoyment quickly shot up as a result. \\n\r\nKabaneri's writing is impressively bad, like worthy of a Razzie bad. I'm all for dumb fun, but what I don't advocate, however, is confusing \"so bad it's good\" titles with actual \"good\" ones. And while I enjoyed making fun of this show, laughing at each new idiotic plot thread, it is by no means a good title. It's a confused, contrived mess that made for great B-movie entertainment. So while this dumpster fire occasionally whizzed out fireworks for my amusement, I can't promise the same results for everyone else. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 3/10\\n\\n\r\nKabanaeri is the malignant tumor slowly eating away at the anime community's set standards of what constitutes as a \"good\" title. Each new layer is like a slow descent into madness; deciphering your way through the muddled maze of abysmal writing and \"so bad it's good\" narrative decisions that even experienced viewers would be baffled by. Very few shows left me dumbfounded with its stupidity in the way Kabaneri did. I suffered many convulsions trying to process the sheer level of absurdity that each new episode brought, and just as I thought it was done with its surprises, it manages to pull another rabbit out of its (ass)hat. Unintelligible, uninspired and gasping for air, this anime is on the verge of being comatose. Pulling the plug is the only humane solution left. It reached the apex of nonsensical writing, and there's no cure potent enough to save it from dying of brain damage. This is truly the representation of \"schlock\" in its unadulterated form.",

            "content": "If you happen to be someone who has a steady job within the anime industry, what is the best possible way to earn some decent $$$ when making an original anime? Is it to try and come up with the best and most original setting that comes to mind? To create characters with seemingly limitless potential? A thought-provoking story? If you think it's any of the above, you may as well be delusional. Wit Studio has it all figured out. Sadly, after milking the dried up and shriveled old cow that is Attack on Titan for a solid three years now, I think they mayhave forgotten how to make an actual original anime. Here, I'll paint you a somewhat-clearer picture of the feeling I got upon reading the series' synopsis. Imagine arriving to school with a brand new pair of shoes, right? So as you're walking down the hallway, your shoes are suddenly stepped on by some snot-nosed kid wearing a monster energy T-shirt and a hat turned sideways. That's right, the feeling of true despair.\\n\\n\r\nSo humans are at the brink of extinction again, blah blah blah. Only this time, our enemies are much less intimidating than ever before. They are just these mindless glowing zombies that raid trains once in a while and occasionally manage to get into the fortress. Oh, but don't get the fortress confused with the great walls from AoT as they are two totally separate entities and do not resemble each other a single bit. So seeing as regular humans are always as useless as one can be in these types of series, we are introduced to Kabaneri, the humans who got bitten by the glowing zombies and received superpowers because of it. Our main superhero is our boy Ikoma, who is out on a quest of revenge against the Kabane, accompanied by our loli heroine Mumei. These two form an invincible bond and so their journey begins. \\n\\n\r\nAttack on Titan was one of the first anime that got me back into the medium and I still faintly remember the dread I felt while watching the first few episodes. That feeling is completely gone this time around which can probably be entirely accounted for by the lackluster execution, more or less. To say that the Kabane's designs are lacking would be an understatement but we also have these people who can kill a hundred of them within the span of a minute which makes the threat feel that much more nonexistent. Then the setting apparently takes place during an industrial revolution yet they don't put any emphasis on this point what so ever. This could have been a great way to delve deeper into the world and give more depth to the setting if it were utilized properly. I'm not going to settle down for those fucking trains being the only reason this takes places in an industrial revolution. The potential is there but unfortunately it is left untouched.\\n\\n\r\nThere were also minor inconsistencies within some of the writing. Like why the hell do they have the people who are bitten be locked up for 3 days straight when with every single on-screen instance we've had of a human turning into a Kabane when bitten has happened within a time period of 5 minutes max? This show is too stupid for its own good. Speaking of stupid, the drama between the humans and the Kabaneri never disappoints. Despite the Kabaneri protecting the humans for the entirety of the series, if they happen to do a single, usually insignificant thing that the public deems as questionable, they are to be locked up and shunned immediately.\"You spilled a cup of coffee? Looks like you're no different from a Kabane after all, damn wench!\" \\n\\n\r\nThe main cast just honestly really impressed me. Our protagonist was a guy who got bit by a Kabane, went through some kinky bondage porn and emerged a Kabaneri. He is as original as one can be, making an oath to himself that he will exterminate all of the zombies after a death of a certain family member. This backstory got me really emotional. It is something that we have never once seen before and is very original. Design-wise, he is sort of what I would picture Harry Potter's edgier twin brother to look like. Having such a strong resemblance to that character may be a good or a bad thing depending on preference. Who knows. It has been a good few years since I've last seen the Harry Potter films so I couldn't really say. We literally know not a single thing about his background and past apart from the fact that his sister, who we also knew nothing about, had died. Such a tragic tale this is.\\n\\n\r\nOur heroine is an awfully cocky and narcissistic brute of a 12 year old girl. She is a strong and agile fighter who helps our protagonist along the way as well as guide him when he is initially bit and turns suicidal. She seems to make a lot of decisions that are considered questionable by the other characters for some reason, like killing a pregnant woman who was about to give birth to a Kabane. This is somehow questioned and deemed not to be acceptable despite the soldiers casually putting every single bitten person to death on a daily basis. Is it morally right or not? Make up your mind already. Her backstory is neither here nor there but is definitely better than Ikoma's as we do get some flashbacks that tell us bits and pieces of her upbringing and how she became the way she is. Despite being extremely obnoxious, she is easily the most developed character in the entire show as by the time the show reaches its climax her personality would have already done a 180 and if she were not so damn stupid, I may have actually of been able to sympathize with her situation.\\n\\n\r\nThe antagonist of the series (who we shall refer to as Jimmy because spoilers) is so poorly-written that he almost manages to make the rest of the cast look good while on screen. Jimmy's motivations are extremely incoherent and shallow as well as just plain stupid. He developed daddy issues because his papi used to randomly assault him with a knife when he was 8 years old, as he apparently \"feared\" him. Hence, his primary objective is to end his father's reign because of the previously mentioned and for the fact that he for some reason let the Kabane destroy one of the cities which little Jimmy was defending at the time. I don't know why or how his father would benefit from doing so but apparently he does. And you know what they say - The apple doesn't fall far from the tree. Even after getting his revenge he still goes out of his way to wreak havoc upon the innocent civilians who've got not a single thing to do with this by releasing the Kabane upon them. Ahh so much shock factor ahh such good villain.\\n\\n\r\nWhen it is necessary, Jimmy also enjoys pulling out the Plot Convenience Serum out of his pocket and injecting it into other characters in order to turn them into mindless drones. This of course has one hell of an influence on the overarching plot as you can imagine since you have people who hate his guts one episode turning into his slaves the next. This was obviously just an extremely lazy way of making the plot progress further in the way the writers wanted it to. What's a good anime without plot convenience anyway? Funny thing is, if the characters had any semblance of a brain inside their thick skulls, Jimmy would have no chance to even get near the fortress to begin with, much less get inside. No side characters stuck out as literally all of them are either useless or obnoxious and on special occasions maybe even both.\\n\\n\r\nI have somewhat of an educated guess that Wit Studio may have made a tiny winy ounce of cash with the production of a show a few years back, as well as one more recently. So naturally, it may be worth considering that by now they can put in a pretty decent budget, and so they did. The animation is buttery smooth and the art is very appealing. The choreography is very impressive and engaging whenever the fights aren't entirely one-sided. They used some weird shading technique on the character designs which I think worked well for the most part. The blood and gore looked very fluid and liquid-y. As for sound, I've got no clue. I put IceJJFish and Anton Maiden songs in the background in order to ease the pain, sorry. Opening and ending are pretty nifty though.\\n\\n\r\nJust dreadful in all honestly. Every single individual factor of the show managed to hinder my enjoyment in one way or another. Be it the subpar and messy plot, the gigantic amount of plotholes riddled throughout, the horrid characterization and character development, unparalleled edge, horrible antagonist, shitty worldbuilding, rushed ending.. The list could go on. To make the long story short, it was not enjoyable. That being said, I imagine most people will actually find something here, be it the over the top execution, well-done action choreography or simply poking fun at how bad it is. I myself am not an action junkie so the choreography, while impressive, didn't leave an everlasting impression of sorts and unfortunately I wasn't able to get a kick out of how bad it was either, rather it just left me with the impression that it was trying too hard. It really is the worst thing when an awful show takes itself too seriously. Where is Mitsumune when you need him?\\n\\n\r\nA true trainwreck till the very end. Kabaneri wasn't even a disappointment, it was exactly what I expected from the synopsis. The production studio was unable to keep consistency within its mediocre 12-episode runtime as shown clearly by the spiraling transition of quality the further the series progressed. I want to say that it would have worked better if it were 24 episodes long but I really can't, judging from how poorly they handled a measly 12. I'm really inclined to believe that this was just a cheap cash grab by Wit Studio since they know far too well that they can get a decent amount of income just by having the show have Attack on Titan vibes, and boy, does it have that. Hell, I'm pretty sure I could sum up both of the first episodes using the exact same sentence. Now, a moment of appreciation for Wit Studio... Thank you. And so the second season of AoT is delayed yet again. Satisfied?",

            "content": "A society in the middle of an industrial revolution. Gigantic steampunk-iron fortresses protecting its citizens. Zombies that terrorizes the lands, where large tank-like trains are the only means of transport and communication with the different fortifications. Such is the setting of Koutesujou no Kabaneri: mankind's struggle to survive the everluring doors of death and despair. Zombies threatening mankind is nothing new, yet is arguably oddly entertaining - when it is done right that is. What could have been a simple story about humankind's struggle for survival, sadly turned out into a petty revenge story: despite its flaws, an enjoyable first part, but with a verylackluster second part. That being said, it has some great visuals and spectacular action scenes.\\n\\n\r\n~Story~\\n\\n\r\nThe story of Koutesujou no Kabaneri revolves mainly around Ikoma who works as an engineer in the train station, while making his very own gun to eradicate the zombies. Incidently, a train enters the station with an infected man, and thus, mankind's main fear became true: infections happening left and right within the fortress itself. This proves for the protagonist a big chance to test his very own weapon, and thus the survival story begins. A thing to note is that action is quite predominant in the series, where story and characterization basically take a back seat, although changes a bit in the second half. It is often well-coordinated, with here and there some causes of the fights itself rather lackluster. This also means that there are quite some gory sequences, full with blood, which may be a no-go for some.\\n\\n\r\nAt first sight it can be quite engaging, the protagonist not finding justice in indiscriminately killing the turned human: a confrontation of what defines a human being, yet naturally comes down to kill or be killed. This of course causes ruckus within society itself, in which the population displays the cowardly nature of mankind when pressured or under fear. Now there should be rules to avoid such occurrences (infected entering the city), yet the logic used by the script writers is bland and plain non-sensical at times to say the least. A lot of the rules applied have no real logic behind them, for example thorough body inspections, when the infection is nearly instantaneous, making this particular one mute. There are many more examples within the anime, where some can be overlooked up to a certain extend; this is to say, up to the first half of the story.\\n\\n\r\nWhat is important to note, is that the anime is initially a simple story of survival with its obvious flaws, but overlookable, as it was not trying to be anything more than that. However, with the introduction of a character, Amatori Biba, the whole anime takes a significant dip in overall quality. In fact, the whole anime essentially turns into a petty revenge story, being the above mentioned character the main \"villain\", but to this later. There are also special powers in the anime, as well as beings: for instance, kabaneri are half-human, half kabane. This gives a plausible solution of why a small group of people being able to withstand the hordes of zombies. There are different types of zombies to spice the things up a bit, but were minimal, up to a certain point in the anime where it simply became superfluous with various increasingly overpowered ones. The main problem with this is that the anime was still trying to make it as \"realistic\" as possible, but with such elements thrown into it, it simply lost any credibility it had left.\\n\\n\r\n~Characters~\\n\\n\r\nConcerning the cast of characters in Koutesujou no Kabaneri, although varied, they share the archetypes common in the genre. There is also a problem when it comes to the characterization of its cast: it is introduced too late for it to take a big effect, which incidentally is introduced mid-way up to the end of the anime. Possibly by that time viewers won't have had any reason to consolidate with the characters as nothing of crucial importance or aspect was known about them. On the one hand there is Ikoma, a young simple-minded smith who wants to create a powerful weapon to counter the kabane with more ease. He has different views on how to treat the infected: yet also shares an aversion to the kabane. His very reason on why he desires to wipe out the kabane is very basic. Despite being the protagonist of the series, he undergoes little character development, even to the point of losing his very identity - which was rather lackluster to say the least, as its implementation was badly executed, feeling out of place.\\n\\n\r\nOn the other hand there is Mumei, an initially young girl who is quiet and arrogant, but essentially scared with no people to rely on other than what she considers her \"big brother\", Biba. As the series progresses, she slowly opens up a bit, just to be \"brainwashed\" - which in turn leaves the character development she experienced mute. Then there is one of the main reasons the anime took another huge dip in quality, the villain Biba. Although initially presented as an interesting character in charge of cleansing zombies, as well as being implied as an important character to develop the cast, it takes a turn to the worse as his main goal becomes apparent. The very motive behind it is severely lacking and uninspired - what is worse, his very character is terribly basic: just an emotionless and ruthless man, pursuing blindly his objective, while sacrificing everything in the process. \\n\\n\r\nAn additional problem with the introduction of the above mentioned character is the implementation of the revenge plan: a handful, or rather a stream of unlikely events just continuously happen in the rest of the series, which is where any remaining logic the series had flied out the window to accommodate it. This could be naturally due to its short airing time, yet it should have been done in a more graceful manner. As for the other characters, there is nobody else of importance to mention or care for, as hardly any fleshing out or characterization was done.\\n\\n\r\n~Animation and sound~\\n\\n\r\nOn the bright side, the art style of Koutesujou no Kabaneri was surely refreshing and very well done, having some fantastic detail in both the design of its characters as well as the backgrounds. It is true that in some ocassions the background detail of characters where basic, even when only two were present. It is somewhat out of the norm, but is surely one I'd like to see more in the future. The animation itself was another great aspect, with fluid combat scenes and motions of the characters: fast and graceful slashes, blood, the lightning, you name it. CG is used in the anime, in particular that of the train, but as a whole was easily overlookable.\\n\\n\r\nConcerning the soundtrack of the show, while mostly it is befitting of the atmosphere with the use of classical instruments, drums, guitar, there are numerous instances where there were inappropriate ones that felt out of place. The same could be said about the voice actors, while mostly it was performed in a satisfying manner, quite some characters constantly had an angry tone, to the point of being annoying - such as the protagonist. It emanates the feeling as if the character only possesed one single emotion. As for the opening and ending of the series, although visually very pleasing, it had no memorable music attached to it.\\n\\n\r\n~Enjoyment~\\n\\n\r\nDespite having somewhat enjoyed the first half of series, Koutesujou no Kabaneri was as a whole disappointing: it should have just stuck to a simple survival story about humanity instead of what the second half introduced. This transition made the numerous issues the series had just more apparent, in addition to adding new ones. Now it must be said that the action scenes were an enjoyable watch, but were hindered by the laughable logic behind the events tied to them, as well as the characters. So do I recommend this anime? Is it the second Attack on Titan? Not really, unless viewers are able to easily dismiss the issues as inconsequential, and enjoy the mindless action there is, as the story won't be the main interest.\\n\\n\r\nThank you for reading.",

            "content": "Why are people comparing this anime to shingeki no kyojin? I mean, this anime by itself is already very good. I dont really understand why people are starting to rate Koutetsujou no Kabaneri lower now that they've watched the last episode. Overall, the last episode wasnt even that bad. IN FACT, it kind of gives way to saying the the story isnt really finished yet, which then leads to a hint that there could even be a second season. If people want to rate this anime, they should at least try not to be as biased as possible. Anyways, Hiroyuki Sawano, as usual, created anamazing set of OST (original soundtrack). The art was quite good, making it look more realistic. The characters are quite unique, although there is a slight sense of cliche with some of the personalities like Ikoma's for example. The anime really was enjoyable. Even though the ending seems to be kind of rushed, the overall thing was quite good, and it isnt exactly as bad as what some people say. As for the story, i think that the pace was going at a satisfying pace (excluding the ending). The plot really made it unique since it has been a long time since a good post-apocalyptic anime came out after HOTD and SNK.",

            "content": "This is one of the worst anime that has been gaining too much hype this season. \r\nOverall - 5\r\nThe anime has a mildly interesting storyline spoiled by generic characters. As far as the episodes that have come out, the anime has no purpose whatsoever other than fulfilling its quota of okayish action sequences with moderate amounts of gore and no horror whatsoever. The only reason you should watch this anime is if you were fooled into watching it by the amount of hype that built up to its release or you are simply into shitty action anime with retarded characters.\r\nStory - 3\r\nA generic dystopian futurewhere humans are fighting \"kabane\", which are sorta like titan zombies. I say fighting but it's more like getting slaughtered till a mechanic and a ninja girl come together and kick some moderate ass. People travel around in trains which connect stations and most of the actions revolve around these train being attacked. The plot is driven by the stupidity of the characters and there is no major plot whatsoever. There are serious logical inconsistencies so if you want to enjoy the anime, I'd suggest lobotomy and removing the frontal lobe of your brain. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 2\\n\r\nWhile designing the characters I guess the writers were as short sighted as Ikoma (wears glasses) himself. I have visceral hate towards the anime to the extent that I make sure to tell everyone what a piece of shit this is, and I believe most of it stems from my disgust with the characters in this anime. The only characters I find good are the children in the story and Ikoma's friends.\\n\\n\r\nIkoma is a enthusiastic mechanic with shitty hair and weird metal arm who hates the adults for their narrow mindedness towards sh*t in general, especially victims of Kabane attacks. Every episode has him spouting generic motivational bullsh*t and taking illogical decisions that everyone agrees to because, well they are fu**ing retarded. \\n\\n\r\nMumei is a arrogant, self-righteous prick who is wearing rouge permanently and maybe thats why her facial expressions come before the dialogues. I mean even before Ikoma vomits his \"why she is worth saving\" speech, her eyes and mouth open with the cheeks becoming redder than the usual rouge...ugh...hate her.\\n\\n\r\nAyame is the \"damsel in distress\", who has little contribution to the story. Actually scratch that, she doesn't matter to the story.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation,Sound - 8\\n\r\nmeh, whatever.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 1\\n\r\nKill me now\\n\\n\r\nHonestly, I'm done. I have no hope for this anime. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "What an amazing, exciting, and shockingly original anime!  Well rounded and done extremely well, I highly recommend Koutetsujou no Kabaneri for anyone who is a fan of zombies and thrillers.\r\nStory: 9 \r\nAs I said, this was a very original anime, especially the story.  We don't see many zombie anime's, and the ones we do see tend to be slice-of-life or, oddly, romantic.  I can only think of 1 or 2 other zombie anime, and neither one even came close to this.  Exciting and adrenaline-pumping action, you really feel invested in the story and the characters.\r\nArt: 9\r\nWeirdly, this anime has a sortof throwback type of art, reminiscent of anime in the 90's and early 2000's.  But what can I say... It works.  The art is unique but beautiful, and each character is unique and easy to remember.  I loved the designs and the outfits of the female characters in particular.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9 \\n\r\nThe music is perfectly fitted to the intense action sequences as well as the more tender moments, and can even be creepy and scifi-sounding at all the right parts.  The seiyuu's did a great job creating memorable characters as well.  \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9\\n\r\nI fell in love with Mumei in the last scene of the first episode (it's an epic moment, so I won't spoil it for you).  Ikoma is also a character you really root for (although I wasn't particularly fond of his hair).  You grow to love some of the side characters as well - all of them are really well done.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9\\n\r\nI really recommend binge-watching this anime.  It is so intense and full of adrenaline pumping moments that keep you on the edge of your seat, and so if you stop watching after each episode it's sort of like jumping off the ride right before you get to the best part.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9 \\n\r\nI highly recommend Koutetsujou no Kabaneri.  In a world full of boring, same-same anime's with cliched overused plot devices and silly tropes, Kabaneri is wholly original and thrilling.\\n\r\nI just really hope there will be a second season that will explain some of our lingering questions (like the origin of the Kabane!!)",

            "content": "Koutetsujou no Kabaneri was the show that I was the most excited for this anime season. Sure, it seemed like a lot of the ideas were borrowed from Wit studio's other anime, the widely known and critically acclaimed Attack on Titan, but I was willing to overlook that and view Kabaneri as its own, separate anime. I was initially impressed by the first two episodes, however the hype train slowly ran out of steam as the anime progressed. It was truly heading down the right track, but the anime simply derailed itself when it failed to expand its plot beyond generic characters fighting mindless zombies.This unfortunately resulted in Kabaneri being nothing more then a mediocre anime, when it had the potential to be something great. \\n\\n\r\nPlot: 3/10\\n\\n\r\nThe weakest part of the show. Kabaneri is a typical zombie apocalypse show, so it's not entirely original. However I've yet to see a zombie show heavily involving trains, so that's new, although it may be a bit of a comically stupid idea. I also noticed a decent amount of plot holes used as an excuse to have the kabane (the name of the zombies) attack. Sometimes they just randomly appeared without anyone noticing their loud moaning or bulking masses in random places to randomly attack random people. Other times the kabane just simply broke through the giant walls protecting the cities and the armored trains that humanity probably spent many a year constructing like they were made out of paper. The amount of plot holes was honestly quite pathetic, maybe even more so then Kabaneri's supporting cast, and that's really saying something. Also, the anime rarely explored any plot points other than those revolving around surviving the kabane, which I felt left this anime with a lack of depth.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nThis anime has pretty adequate visuals all around. The characters are designed beautifully and there aren't many inconsistencies with the art. My biggest problem is that the majority of the scenery is the inside of a train, which resulted in some very dull backgrounds. It turns out that the grey interior of a train makes for incredibly bland scenery. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nThe opening theme is done by Egoist and the ending by Aimer, two great artists in my opinion, so Kabaneri is obviously going to get high marks in this category. While neither song is the best by either performer, they are still very good and enjoyable to listen to. Also the soundtrack was composed by Hiroyuki Sawano, the man who developed the background tracks for widely known anime like Attack on Titan and Guilty Crown. In my opinion he is a musical genius who has composed many superb pieces, and the soundtrack that he created for this anime is no exception.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 5/10\\n\\n\r\nMumei singlehandedly saves this category. She's a total badass who can also be very adorable. Mumei has her cute moments that bring a smile to my face. She also has her epic moments, like when she singlehandedly eliminates a large group of kabane, and is disappointed that she couldn't do it in under 100 seconds. Mumei also has depth and experiences conflict throughout the show that helps her to develop as a person, though her gradual transformation admittedly isn't always believable. Sadly, she's the only character in this anime who's like this, and the rest are as dull as the zombies that they fight. The other protagonist, Ikoma, is decent, but he's nothing special. Ikoma doesn't start off as a typical weak or uncertain protagonist. From the beginning he shows signs of badassery. However after episode two, he just seems to run out of steam. In fact, I don't think he develops at all as a character throughout the entirety of the anime. Most of the side characters are rather annoying since they rarely know how to properly deal with the kabane and constantly try to get rid of Ikoma and Mumei, two of the very few people in this show who actually manage to accomplish anything. You'd think that being on the verge of extinction would make the senses of these people keener, but instead it feels like some of these characters have the intelligence level of your average mindless zombie.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 6/10\\n\\n\r\nDespite its flaws, this is a pretty entertaining anime. It has a large sum of faced paced action mixed with a good amount of tension that leaves viewers on edge. Plus Mumei is really enjoyable to watch and she has her moments of awesomeness. Also the atmosphere created by the sound and animation makes watching Kabaneri an even better experience. Unfortunately, the show got duller as it progressed, which consequently sucked out some of the enjoyment that I derived from watching it.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 5/10\\n\\n\r\nAlthough a 5/10 is an average score, I can't help but feel a twinge of disappointment. I predicted that Kabaneri would be a strong 8/10 after watching it's initial episodes, and I just think that the anime partially let me down. It was mainly the poorly constructed story that held this anime back. Nonetheless, Kabaneri is a somewhat exciting show, and I would recommend it to people who love intense action and gore.",

            "content": "Survival is a theme that is touched upon quite a lot, and not only when it comes to the anime medium. Most of these kinds of series tend to engage this rather generic theme with interesting and good-looking fights, completely ignoring the plot's development and the characters' growth on the audience, instead adding a lot of gore which apparently triggers the \"feels\" of ignorant masses because, you know, losing someone precious is hard. There are many ways to strike a certain series despite the generic concept, instead of doing that you might as well develop some characters hence making it feel not as retarded. Kabaneridoes not do that, and it also is full of the \"retarded adults syndrome\", it being apparent in the whole anime, despite the main characters themselves being idiotic. Consequently, all it manages to be is a copy of Attack on Titan, if not even worse than that, and yup, that ain't good at all.\\n\\n\r\nKoutetsujou no Kabaneri takes place in a post-apocalyptic Earth, in the face of an industrial revolution, where unknown creatures named Kabane have appeared, them eating flesh and drinking human blood, hence becoming humanity's natural enemy. Once a Kabane bites a human, that human becomes a Kabane and so on. Post apocalyptic Japan has been colonized into train stations, which themselves are cities and are surrounded by walls, with trains travelling between them for many reasons, including provisions and soldier transfers. Interesting huh? Well, despite some of the points of the concept being indeed interesting, such as combining a steampunk setting with survival in a world that has been destroyed were, not really, because there was nothing left in order for the concept to be supported, therefore the execution being extremely weak. Letting alone that the dialogue was really cringy and reminded me of SAO, everything else except the production values was, likewise. After all, trains can not save anything. \\n\\n\r\nThe havoc has wreaked, and then there is our main character, Ikoma, who is an overenthusiastic fellow. Guess what, he wants to kill the Kabane in order to avenge his sister who was bitten by them. He develops a weapon which can kill Kabane in an easier manner, and boards Koutetsujou because the city is not to be inhabited anymore with several other people, to whom I will get into later, him broadening his horizons and deciding that it's not fair that only strong people have to survive or whatnot. The moods of the main character change quickly depending on the situation, so he sometimes is extremely badass whilst in others you wanna hit him in his head with a screwdriver because of how retarded his actions are. Another bad thing about him is that he actually is the most likable character in Kabaneri. Unfortunately.\\n\\n\r\nEnter Mumei, our second main character, who is your generic fare of courageous on the outside, feelsy yet manipulated in her childhood on the inside. Not that it matters, but it is the revelations about her that are extremely lazy, leaving me with a hand scratching my head. She is the one to inherit the standard \"strong people survive, weak people die\". The portrayal of that ideal is really bad, as it is played with and goes round and round to reveal that, in the end, Mumei should not become like her mum who was killed by the Kabane, and that she should remain strong and get experimented in order for her to become her \"brother's\" puppet, becoming a Kabaneri and wandering around like an idiot not knowing what to do with her life.\\n\\n\r\nMumei's symbol of admiration, Biba, whom she calls her brother, is the most interesting character in the whole series, appearing relatively later in the series, only for the audience to learn that he is the leader of the Kabane extermination troops in order to satisfy his egoistical means, adding yet another idiotic character to the cast. By the end of the series, he has become your common villain with only a flashback to be supported with, following the quote \"in the face of our supposedly enemies, he is the one that should be exterminated because of his evil means\". Apart from these three, there are other side characters which are cookie cutter like our mains, including your Ayame-sama, her knight who is always by her side, Ikoma's friend who dies for the sake of melodrama and many many more, including the retarded adults whose IQ is minus 150. Bad writing is all over the place, there are no explanations given about what the hell the Kabane are, and true, some but few characters might have gotten some development, but that was done with some of the lamest, laziest and most boring excuses aka. Plot devices I've ever encountered in my life. Along with an ending that obviously was not the best, after the trainwrecks all the other episodes were, the outcome most surely is not that noteworthy.\\n\\n\r\nWhat Koutetsujou no Kabaneri lacks in every other department, somehow wins when it comes to the art and animation sections, because you might as well make something bad at least look good. The backgrounds are great, them being the best point of the whole series, the sceneries being fresh and given a good amount of lighting. The choreography of the so-judged significant battles, especially the ones in episode 8, is pretty detailed and make up for some shortcomings incoming with the drop of budget in the middle episodes, although it looks a whole lot like Attack on Titan's 3D Maneuver Gear. The character designs are as a matter of fact not bad-looking, but they somehow are unappealing in certain moments, especially when it comes to the character's faces. Mumei's face is a huge representative example, as when included in light-hearted moments, like those where she plays with the kids, where her face looks extremely moe-ish and unfitting to the whole thing (her armpits and legs make up for it though). A character design that I personally liked is that of Horobi, which is quite detailed and looks great in a certain battle scene. A plus, amongst others, would also be the costumes of each and every significant character, which are cool enough and remind me a lot of a crossover between the cheap clothes used by people back in the industrial revolution along with some style to support the steampunk setting. Overall, despite the animation quality drop in some episodes, the section as a whole smelled success, over how bad other things in the series were per say.\\n\\n\r\nSoundtrack-wise, Koutetsujou no Kabaneri is fine. It comes down to each person to how much they will like edgy music or not after all, and in Kabaneri's case, the opening and ending songs have fitting music and lyrics to the series' concept. The OST was misused some times, a good example being Mumei's flashback where a happy-toned song was used in a scene which was downright sad. The voice acting was quite okay, though forgettable most of the times, the exception being Ikoma's, which was both exaggerated and unforgettable in a whole bad way. He sounded like someone who was getting laid off at the time and place he spoke in. Consequently, the soundtrack was above average despite myself not being a fan of Sawano-esque music because it is repetitive as heck.\\n\\n\r\nTo say the truth, I somehow enjoyed Koutetsujou no Kabaneri quite much, with both its goods and its of significant amount bads. I enjoyed the fights and their choreography, the sceneries and the backgrounds and I laughed at how tarded the characters were. Noticing how much of a \"Nothing happened: The Animation\" it was, was incredibly fun as well. It literally went round and round and achieved nothing but nothingness, void, darkness. And even if it did achieve something, it was by default pointless, because in the end, nothing happened. Only edgy teens trying to survive in a post apocalyptic world full of blood-drinking creatures, generic and undeveloped villains and retarded adults, with the whole meaning of the word. I would have enjoyed it way more, hadn't it tried to be as supposedly serious as it was in the first place.\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion, Koutetsujou no Kabaneri is just another one show of the kind which includes overhyped Attack on Titan-esque shows like Black Bullet. If you expect a show with relatable characters, a realistic depiction of survival and interesting yet explained lore, avoid it like the plague it is. However, if you just need a show to cool off with and do not care about any kind of flaw and shortcoming, engage Kabaneri of the Iron Fortress like the ephemeral and cathartic journey it is. To finish with a bang, I am going to quote a friend: \"It will be performed as an opera on the holodecks of the ships that disperse us into the heavens. We were really just clothed monkeys until it allowed us to transcend our animalism. I shall sing its praises to all that shall come forth and be enlightened. If it was not Clannad After Story that could make you cry, try Kabaneri, that is how amazing it is\".\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 3/10",

            "content": "This show reminded me that one can immerse in the anime world just by simply watching it. With its breathtaking visuals and compelling story, I was taken into the world of Koutetusjou no Kabaneri.\r\nNow a lot of people will say it's a rip-off of the mainstream anime, Shingeki no Kyojin. Well, I digress. This show actually offers more than suspense and action. For one, not everyone in this show is powerless. The characters are actually able to fight back from the monsters easily. Not everyone is at harm because the threat wasn't that big (no pun intended). The real problem lies outside the walls, butnot the monsters. It's the humans themselves. The way I see it, it has more similarities with Guilty Crown than Attack on Titan.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of Guilty Crown, the characters themselves resembled those from the show. Even the mechanisms and biology of the show was the same with the one in Guilty Crown. I mean, the main character even resembled Shu in some way. Mumei is just an energetic Inori, and The villains are... you get my point.\\n\\n\r\nWhat I liked about this show the most was its setting. A steampunk Japan surrounded by zombie-like creatures, and people can still travel to different places without enclosing themselves in walls. Also, the animation focused more on the movement of still scenes rather than bloodshed in action scenes. It doesn't even try to become a horror anime. More like its main priority is to present exciting visuals and storyline rather than excite viewers through the use of fanservice.\\n\\n\r\nIn short, this series was well-done. I definitely recommend this to Aot and non-AoT fans alike. Then come back and tell me if you're human, Kabane or Kabaneri.",

            "content": "Koutetsujou no Kabaneri (also known as Kabaneri of the Iron Fortress) is honestly one of those series that almost wants to make you rip your hair out. By first impressions, the show seemed to be on the right track. Dubbed by some as a generic clone of \u201cAttack on Titan\u201d or the next \u201cbig thing\u201d, this series is one that is filled with controversy.\r\nAs an original anime by Wit Studio, Koutetsujou no Kabaneri seems to be inspired by a lot of generic concepts taken from the dark fantasy genre. These concepts ranges in variety from survival horror, revenge, tragic past, monster invasion, betrayal, experimentation, youname it. If you\u2019ve seen a monster movie, chances are, you\u2019ll find one of these ideas stuffed into this show. As the first few episodes rolled through, I do have to admit that the series is highly entertaining. The storytelling sparks interest, the setting has potential, the characters are diverse, and the production is solid. So what exactly went wrong?\\n\r\nBefore we get to the meat of the series, it\u2019s probably best to understand the staff behind the series. Besides Wit Studio, we got director Tetsuro Araki who is well-known for his work on Attack on Titan. Then, there\u2019s Ichirou Okouchi, the guy that wrote the scripts for Guilty Crown. And finally, the music you hear throughout the show is crafted by Hiroyuki Sawano who is well known for many series (Kill la Kill, Aldnoah Zero, Owari no Seraph) Take this in all a second and you may see a pattern. And chances are, you\u2019ll find some familiarity with these shows if you\u2019ve seen them.\\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s pretty much one of those mainstream shows that tries to appeal to a broader audience. And by that, I mean it\u2019s a show that tries to do everything possible to make it entertaining. Not necessarily entertaining for its story but more about its over the top notch action. It\u2019s pretty obvious though. The production quality of the series is stellar. A simple glance at the first two episodes will have you in awe with the action as we see humans fight monsters (or otherwise known as Kabane). These monsters seems mindless and inspires horror based just on their appearance, behavior, and way to try to assimilate others into their race. The setting has the apocalyptic feel with the widespread destruction caused by the Kabane. Furthermore, we also have steampunk technology in the form \u2026trains. That\u2019s right, trains. They are actually called Hayajiro and are locomotives used for transport and protection due to their armor. The most infamous one is the Koutetsujou where we meet our main characters.\\n\\n\r\nCollectively, the characters are both generic but also has some unique traits about them. The main protagonist is Ikoma. He may seem like the typical teenager but has genius intellect when it comes to inventions. On the other hand, there\u2019s nothing too special about him except for his main role in the show because of his personality. You\u2019ll probably notice it right away from other series similar to this: the type of characters where they have a strong will power to protect what they believe in and make a difference in their world. Then, there\u2019s Mumei, a strange petite girl with a lot of mysteries of her own. Unlike Ikoma, she has the personality of a child despite her powerful abilities to fight the Kabane. It\u2019s also shown that she had a tragic past so expect PTSD-like scenes in some of the later episodes. In essence, what she lacks is more of a character that can be relatable or we can feel attached with. Although throughout the series, Mumei does forge a strong bond with Ikoma that seems to grow more and more. However, the way some characters develop throughout the series is rather questionable. While Ikoma follows a straightforward progress of becoming a savior of mankind, Mumei\u2019s character seems to develop backwards from a badass fighter to damsel in distress. While I still find the chemistry between Ikoma and Mumei to be fun to watch, their characterization is something that really degenerated. \\n\\n\r\nOf course, we do have the princess of the series. Meet Ayame Yomogawa who is blessed with noble blood. She\u2019s pretty much the typical female character you\u2019ll find in books who has a reasonable understanding about certain individuals, is honest, and even shows mercy to her enemies. She also shows potential as a leader and unlike Mumei has more of a mature personality. And if you can guess by now, she also has her own personal bodyguards such as Kurusu, a serious man with a code of honor and skilled fighter. So on paper, the majority of the characters from the series each has their own strengths and weaknesses. You\u2019ll discover them easily through their role in the story and believe me, some of them are generic to the core. On the other hand, I do like some of the relationship dynamics throughout the show. Strong friendships such as Ikoma and his childhood friend Takumi, the deeper bond between Ayame and Yukina (engineer of the Kotetsujo), and Ikoma and Mumei\u2019s building trust are just a few to name. \\n\\n\r\nSo initially, I had little problems with the show mostly because it\u2019s what I had expected and nothing really took me by surprise. The revelations and identities of the Kabaneri, zombie symptoms spread through like a \u201ccurse\u201d by infections, background history/storytelling, or the weaknesses of the Kabanei never really bothered me. What started to become rather questionable is the storytelling and execution of the episodes around mid-season. Out of nowhere, we get antagonists whom I find as some of the most stereotypical characters I\u2019ve ever seen. Their motivation and roles in the story almost makes me puke just because how preposterous they are. As I\u2019ve also mentioned before, Mumei becomes one of the most insufferable female characters in the series later on. That\u2019s actually a bit disappointing to realize as well because the show has painted most of the female characters as strong women. Otherwise, storytelling takes a swerve with two faced characters, the overemphasis on certain plot devices (such as mind control), and overall just seems unrecoverable after certain episodes in the latter half of the season. The inserted breather episodes are overshadowed despite their importance while deaths of certain characters are extremely predictable from miles away. \\n\\n\r\nBy technical standards, the show is gorgeous. There\u2019s little concern about it as production values remain high throughout the entire series ranging from battle segments to cinematic choreography. The setting of the series is also designed with high caliber quality with rich backgrounds. The technology has a crude yet firm design such as the weapons that Ikoma and Mumei uses or the locomotives we see every episode. The monsters also gives a horrific feel with their design and although isn\u2019t too unique still inspires fear. Finally, character designs sophisticated that makes both the male and female characters credible with their roles.\\n\\n\r\nIf you got headphones, then definitely put them on for the show. It\u2019s worth it because the OST is something that will get you in the mood quickly. Because the show is very action oriented (especially in the first few episodes), you\u2019ll quickly catch on with the flow. The OP and ED theme songs are also nicely choreographed and sung by world class talents. Speaking of talent, Sawano\u2019s skills are easily recognized as well that combines elements of thriller and his instrumental style to bring the show larger than life when it comes to music. On a lesser note, character voice mannerism is moderate and you\u2019ll hear plenty of screaming. \\n\\n\r\nSo, the big question mark is if you should watch Koutetsujou no Kabaneri. It\u2019s an original show so there\u2019s nothing to lose when it comes to adaptation. But for its storytelling, do be aware that it\u2019s not exactly as impressive as it seems. Characterization throughout the series is questionable for certain characters and the show also suffers from numerous flaws about them. But if you\u2019re in it for some fun entertainment, then this is definitely the show to go see. Put those headphones on, ride the train, and see what\u2019s ahead.\\n",

            "content": "BOKU WA KABANERI DA!!!!!!!!!!!1!!!one!!!oneoneshiftone!!!!eleven!!!\r\n\r\nKabaneri. What happened? This show was supposed to be the Attack on Titan that everyone wanted. All the pieces were there to get everything on track- Tetsuro Araki as the CONDUCTOR, Wit Studio in the boiler room, and my main man Hiroyuki Sawano handling the harmonic balancing in the CABOOSE. With these three wheels churning, Kabaneri should have been a hit. But oh man... did it ever DERAIL itself about halfway through. \r\nThey say that monorails make for a good one liner, but Kabaneri really RAILROADS you through the story. There's something tobe said for a fast paced show, but this one is full steam ahead from the first minute, burning off much needed characterization in favor of jumping from one action setpiece to another. The inclusion of a machiavellian villain who has no discernible goals other than to be a giant dickhead and watch the world burn could have been a great DEPARTURE from the norm in anime- villains who have some grandiose rule the world or become immortal plot. However, Biba truly is just evil for the sake of being evil, and his entrance into the plot comes far too late to have much effect in taking us DOWN THE LINE. \\n\\n\r\nFor those who don't mind getting OFF TRACK into mindless violence involving a little girl and a level 87 Platinum Edgemaster of the Balron, though, this show could be your TICKET! For everyone who is looking for characters to EXPRESS themselves through something more than action, the show runs out of STEAM very quickly. Once the shock value of decapitating a pregnant woman, killing children, and generally showing no mercy to most characters that aren't listed in the main cast wears off, it pretty well SIGNALS the end of anything that's not pure action schlock for Kabaneri. \\n\\n\r\nIn fact, this show could have been a FIRST CLASS alternative to Attack on Titan, had it just come out of the gate sooner. It's almost like there was a DELAY, and this made it to the STATION late, but nobody got a refund or free trip. All told, this show is basically a one way trip to high action, but never gets back to any kind of real storytelling. Revenge is a powerful motivator, but when it's the only thing DRIVING the show- it looses a lot of its STEAM. \\n\\n\\n\r\nThe bottom line: \\n\\n\r\nIf you liked Attack on Titan, you'll probably like this. It's all the action with very little of the teen angst. Another zombie series that's heavy on action, light on characterization, and a visual feast- just don't BOARD with too many expectations, or it might just RUN YOU OFF THE TRACK.",

            "content": "Remember the last time an anime truly gripped you, a show that you couldn't put down and was complex and intellectual? If you're looking for something like that, Kabaneri of the Iron Fortress is not the anime for you. Plagued by vanilla characters and repetitious fight scenes, Kabaneri was the disappointment of the season for me. How could something combining zombies, samurai and steam punk be bad? Please allow me to explain ...\r\nLong, long ago in a galaxy far, far away there exists a populace chronically threatened by incessant hordes of zombies called Kabane. Most of the world's people are confined to living in tightsettlements or aboard one of several titanic locomotives. Although the Attack on Titan comparisons are evident, I initially found the setting reminiscent of the recent cult classic film, Snowpiercer (those of you film buffs who have seen it will probably understand where I'm coming from). All we as viewers seem to need to care about is that the zombies attack by the shitload, are very hard to kill and pretty much everybody is a pussy about it. Ikoma enters stage left with the hatred and knowledge of these creatures that seems to transcend virtually anyone else in the show, despite the fact that he's probably only a teenager. Why? Because anime says so. I was initially receptive of Ikoma's zealous personality, and thought he was a protagonist I could really get behind. He had just cause and didn't whine like a baby. Nowadays that's just about all I need to not hate a character.\\n\\n\r\nThe first episode was rather intense, and I could feel my expectations building. I kept thinking \"if the show just keeps it up, if it keeps up this intensity it'll be good\". However, the main area where Kabaneri fails is depth. It doesn't have much going for it past its shock and awe face value, and it started to bore me after a few episodes. It's like a young puppy let loose after being in its crate all day. At first it runs around hyperactively and makes lots of noises but eventually ends up just chasing its tail and pooping on the carpet once it loses its excitement. We see Ikoma turn into a Kabaneri, or half man/half Kabane, by a process which is lazily explained. He uses this newfound power to defeat more Kabane, meets this wild child who is also a Kabaneri, develops awkward feelings for her, then the bad guy is introduced, everyone is irritated/mesmerized by him, more Kabane are killed, some people die... yadda, yadda, yadda. I think this script may have actually been stolen from a B movie director and pawned off as an anime. Kabaneri literally has nothing else going for it other then impressive fight scenes and questionable lolli fan service with Mumei. \\n\\n\r\nThe writing in Kabaneri is just dreadful. I'm not asking for a Pulitzer Prize winning script here, but I would like something better than what can be comprised by a third grader with writer's block. The dialogue is stale and unsettling with constantly recycled lines and sporadic conversations that don't necessarily seem to fit. Mumei is the most frequent culprit here. One minute she's laughing and joking around with little kids and the next she's a cutthroat lapdog unwilling to listen to reason. I get the whole half Kabane thing, but is there also mind control going on? If so, that certainly wasn't explained properly. It's also quite amusing how the Kabane horde attacks are written in the script, as if to say \"oh yeah, in case you forgot, here comes another zombie attack!\" Timing is impeccable. Most of the scenes seem reactionary, like nothing in the show is premeditated. So many different themes or touched on but never really explored. The writers spent too much time delivering cheap action sequences rather than focusing on the characters or what made the Kabane tick.\\n\\n\r\nWith the zombie genre, Kabaneri had a unique opportunity to do something most anime don't have the luxury of, being scary. While some of the moments were intense, it never really captured the fear that SnK did. I felt rather apathetic when characters were killed off, because the poor writing didn't really make me care. The individuals killed felt more like useless fodder than real people with families and friends that cared about them. I think back to other zombie films like 28 days later and World War Z where I was absolutely frightened during some scenes, wishing that one day an anime is able to capture that same emotion in me.\\n\\n\r\nSometimes, even by anime standards, some events that transpired in Kabaneri can be unreasonable and unrealistic. The fact that I'm questioning the validity in Ikoma's process in becoming a Kabaneri in the first episode speaks volumes. If what he did was truly possible, I feel like it wouldn't be such a revelation and that somebody would've figured it out long before he did considering the Kabane have been around for a while. There's also a portion in episode six or seven (I can't remember which) where a precarious, intense battle where many lives were lost jaggedly transitions to some kind of a festival? How can they sit around making fireworks when they can't even establish rice fields? Are they so na\u00efve to think that fireworks arent going to attract a horde of zombies? Possibly the dumbest scene in the entire anime. If there was anything well-placed in this series, it was Mumei's skirt, since I wasn't unnecessarily bombarded with panty shots while she was flipping through the air in damn near every episode.\\n\\n\r\nI could write a lengthy dissertation on all of the issues I had with Kabaneri and its script, but I should probably point out a couple positives for good measure. If there's one upside to the writing that I can attribute, it is undoubtably the fight scenes. For the most part, the scenes are well choreographed and intense with characters introducing new weapons and tactics at various points throughout the show. I also like how they wrote scenes with Ikoma, with incorporating his severe lack of battle experience into his fighting style. He'd be rumbling and bumbling while slightly skiddish, and I often thought he would get overrun by the Kabane... Only to prevail at the last possible moment. This is one of the few areas that I wouldnt improve on.\\n\\n\r\nTo elaborate on the character aspect, let's start with our protagonist, Ikoma. If anime has taught me anything, it's that the list of badass characters with glasses is rather small (Sakamoto, Shiro etc.). I should've heeded to that red flag when Ikoma was introduced, because underneath it all he really doesn't get that much development. Aside from the first episode or two he serves more as a placeholder in the generic protagonist trope than anything else. The writers were negligent on his past and focused on other aspects of the story instead. Mumei serves as the necessary fan service part of the series, as I've already seen some rather scantily clad images of her floating around the Internet. It's actually kind of sick considering the fact that I think she's only like 13 or 14 in the show. At least we learn a little bit about her past, and how she turned into a Kabaneri to begin with. She arguably has the most depth of any character in the show, as she experiences multiple flashbacks along the way. The villain seems like a spoiled brat who resents his father and wants to bring down everyone else because of it. I don't know if it's just me, but I'm so sick of these archetypes. I mean we get it, your dad was mean to you but can you stop whining about it already? I feel like killing thousands of innocent people to get your point across isn't necessarily the way to get back to your father. The rest of the cast is as bland as they come, all replaceable in their own right. Being the nerd that I am, I really wanted to delve in deeper and see what I was missing in the character's motives and aspirations since they were never really explained. Unfortunately, there's really no source material for me to gander at, as Kabaneri is a standalone anime and not transposed from a manga.\\n\\n\r\nEven though I've already watched 12 episodes, I still can't decide if I like the art in this series or not. On one hand, the character models are unique and the environments remind me of an early 2000's anime. But also in some respects I can see that as a negative. It could be used as an excuse for lazy artistry since it didn't have a lavish budget or use the standard illustrations we're used to seeing in anime today. I'll have to go ahead and give the artists the benefit of the doubt on this one, since most steam punk animes seem to have different styles (Last Exile, etc.), and given the fact that there was no overuse of CG.\\n\\n\r\nThe opening for Kabaneri is actually quite enjoyable. I've seen more and more anime utilizing a small intro phrase or something of that nature to get their opening started, and it really seemed to be effective here. The music seems to fit the setting well, and the animation and choreography was top notch. This is what truly got me hyped for the anime initially. Perhaps even more polarizing than the opening was the ending. Despite the overall disappointment I have for the show, I have since added the ending song to my playlist of top anime music. Some of the rest of the background music fits in decently, but the show still suffers from recycled tracks and occasionally missplaced music. Incorporating a ballad with strong female vocals is normally nice, but not in the middle of a fight scene were Kabane hearts are being ripped out. I don't really know what they were thinking here. The voice acting cast was buffed up, and even ironically included the likes of Yuki Kaji (Eren from SnK), but no single performance really stuck out to me. Not to mention one of the engineers randomly spoke English from time to time. Really, what the hell was that about?\\n\\n\r\nWhenever I look back to Kabaneri, I will always think about what could have been. While Attack on Titan was certainly not my favorite anime of all time, Kabaneri had an opportunity to learn from its shortcomings, but it just didn't capitalize. You know what they say, you can lead a horse to water but not make him drink it. If I could recommend this anime to anyone, it would be those who play videogames where they like to mash a button repeatedly (i.e. Dynasty Warriors). There's not much else to be explored then mindless drivel and flashy fight scenes. Eventually someone in anime will get this zombie thing right, but until that day I await with bated breath. As always, thanks for reading and be sure to check out the rest of my spring 2016 reviews!\\n",

            "content": "No matter who the enemy might seem to be (zombies, titans, mutant bees, flying pigs), the real enemy for humans will always be humanity itself. I believe kabane were only a tool meant to emphasize that. I'm not gonna lie, I'm not very bright and this review's not gonna be the most intelligent thing for you to read. Just a humble review for humble people interested in giving Koutetsujou no Kabaneri a shot. \r\nStory\r\n6/10\r\nReally messy, but somehow its mediocrity made it seem like a piece of reality adjusted to fit a steampunk puzzle. Real world is filled with people who make bad decisions, kill (apparently)for no reason and do reckless and pointless things. Same happens in Koutetsujou no Kabaneri, making the story confusing and a real pain to take in certain moments. The ending was not great, but satisfying, even though some said it was rushed, I didn't want to get more than this.\\n\\n\r\nArt & Animation\\n\r\n10/10\\n\\n\r\nIf you pay attention and look closely, you'll notice how even the hairs in the eyebrows slightly move when the wind blows. I've never seen such details until now, I'm really impressed with how meticulously the animation was done. The art style and colors fit the story perfectly, turning plain backgrounds into an explosion of details. The character designs are also unique. \\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\r\n9/10\\n\\n\r\nI've noticed a lot of new voice actors (like Ikoma's), pretty refreshing considering that I've heard some voices so many times I've had enough of them. And not only they were new, but also very good. \\n\r\nI liked both the OP and ED, performed by EGOIST and Aimer respectively. The background music was like honey for my ears, a happy combination of classic, electronic, ambiental and rock music.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter\\n\r\n7/10\\n\\n\r\nSome were annoying and some were memorable. The writers failed at creating strong personalities for most of the characters and in all that mess of people acting subjectively I wish there was at least one to save the disaster. Given only 12 episodes, the character development is impressive in Ayame's case which turns into a brave leader from a daddy's girl not long time ago. \\n\\n\r\nOverall\\n\r\n8/10\\n\\n\r\nEnjoy it for what it is, not for what you expect it to be.\\n\\n\\n\r\n--Thank you--",

            "content": "Dammit, Kabaneri! You had it! You were good! But then you just had to had to make things human, didn\u2019t you? You couldn\u2019t just stick to what you were actually good at, no; in fact, you\u2019ve completely forgotten what made you great in the first place!\r\nIt\u2019s not every day that I get to say an anime was not only the most surprisingly good show of the season, but also the most disappointingly bad. With a strong start, a shaky midsection, and a complete disaster of an endgame, the anime had gone completely off the rails. Kabaneri of the Iron Fortress truly is a trainwreck.\r\nThere, yougot your fucking train jokes. Are you happy?\\n\\n\r\nBut before things go south, let\u2019s sit in a circle with our juiceboxes and thinking caps and really think about the idea of Kabaneri for a second. Let\u2019s get the obvious out of the way: the guys making the Attack on Titan anime understand that the second season is taking way too fucking long, so they made Kabaneri as an appetizer. But is that all?\\n\\n\r\nThink about what\u2019s popular these days. What\u2019s the biggest anime of the 2010\u2019s? Attack on Titan, pretty much. What else is popular in mainstream media? Zombies. Somehow. It\u2019s been a while and they\u2019ve gotten kinda old, but The Walking Dead is about to put out a seventh season, so I hope everyone\u2019s happy. While Titans were like zombies to begin with, Kabaneri has Kabane, which are literally zombies, but with a small Titanic twist that makes them a little harder to kill than normal.\\n\\n\r\nPut these two things together, and you have instant potential for a big mainstream hit.\\n\\n\r\nNext, the production. Wit Studio have been working on Kabaneri for well over a year (Noitamina first announced it in November \u201814), so they\u2019ve had a lot of time to add a modern polish to an otherwise timely-looking art style, with the more realistic faces, stellar lighting and shading, and less saturated coloring. It looks fucking awesome, and I\u2019d consider it perfect if the close-ups didn\u2019t look so ancient and if the anime industry would finally learn how to do CG decently. MFW the iconic Koutetsujou is just a bad CG train.\\n\\n\r\nSo where am I going with this? Well, call me crazy, but I think Koutetsujou no Kabaneri was made as a way of celebrating anime, by making a concept that best defines mainstream anime of today, while presenting it with a classic style. By blending the old and the new, Kabaneri could possibly have been meant to be iconic in anime\u2019s history, and a tribute to all fans of the medium.\\n\\n\r\nNow, does that mean it\u2019s good? No, Kabaneri sucks lol\\n\\n\r\nBut, while I\u2019m doling out compliments, the art isn\u2019t good because just because an old-looking show that still feels new. Solid character designs, gorgeous vistas, and a great steampunk setting combined with an Edo-period look help define Attack on Train\u2019s aesthetics. Zombies, aka Kabane, are creepy-looking buggers with blood of molten iron, or some shit like that, which not only makes them (literally) metal as fuck, but it gives them a pretty, fiery glow to contrast with their dark purple bodies, and they look great as a result. Fighting them often involves some fantastic choreography with a lot of animation and camera movement, with some overall good direction from Tetsuro \u201cI Need To Make Everything Look Dramatic As Fuck\u201d Araki, and creative ideas in the technology. ...Until you get to the lazer-firing zombiwaiT NO FUCK STOP READING YOU DIDN\u2019T READ THAT\\n\\n\r\nMeanwhile, Hiroyuki \u201cI Need To Make Everything Sound Dramatic As Fuck\u201d Sawano composed a beautiful score, blending his cinematic orchestra with an electronic flair as usual. To be honest, it sounds like every soundtrack he\u2019s ever done, which is good or bad depending on your opinion of the guy, but I think he\u2019s consistently great. While not particularly his fault, I felt that the music was a little intrusive at times; as in, it sounded louder than it needed to be, and I had trouble focusing on what people were saying. \\n\\n\r\nAnd while the OP is nowhere near the best of Egoist, her soft-yet-powerful voice takes the reigns of the song KABANERI OF THE IRON FORTRESS WHICH IS WRITTEN IN ALL CAPS FOR SOME REASON. It works well for the anime, as it takes an epic choral and string arrangement and layers it over electronics, going along with what I said about blending old and new. I think the song\u2019s just okay, though. The ED is much, much better, with a beautiful duet by Egoist again, as well as the singer Aimer; the composition is a lot more interesting with its riffs on piano and acoustic guitar on top of a hard-hitting percussion. \\n\\n\r\nGolly, I sure am positive about Kabaneri for someone who gave it a 5/10. What the fuck happened? Oh... that's a good question, honestly.\\n\\n\r\nOn top of what I said above, we have the main protagonist, Ikoma, as in \u201ceek!! omagod the habaneros broke through the wall!!\u201d This guy is pretty standard as a hero, but he\u2019s not bad. He\u2019s respectable for having the drive to do things himself instead of being thrust into a situation against his will. he\u2019s experienced loss, but, very surprisingly, they don\u2019t play this up very much so he doesn\u2019t have an annoyingly corny sob story. Moreover, his ideals don\u2019t align with those of the rest of the world, who live in great fear of the Kabane to the point of the officials acting like American cops killing anyone even remotely suspicious. Don\u2019t mind me, just taking my edgy jokes for a walk. Ikoma also develops his own steam gun, which is powerful, but not exactly the best weapon ever, but he turns half-Habanero so he still gets some extraordinary power, all of which being the result of his desire for changing the world. He\u2019s a standard shounen guy, which is good enough, but he can be pretty badass at times. At the very least, he\u2019s better than a lot of other characters here...\\n\\n\r\nThe first four of episodes are good for introducing the characters and establishing the setting pretty well, but the next few (and the third, I guess) can basically be summed up with \u201cMumei is a fucking idiot.\u201d This stupid girl, with the most troll-ish character design ever, being a 12-year-old with the body of someone much older, changes personality almost every episode and goes along with everything anyone says, unless their name is \"eek! omagod the zombies r breaking through the gate because mumei gj stupid\". She gets told about a small hint at some conspiracy, so then she acts like a cunt to everyone. She trusts someone so much that she\u2019ll do anything they say, not think about the overwhelming consequences, and then look in horror as everything goes to shit because of her. But I was at least willing to forgive some fuck-ups if Kabaneri could get its shit back together.\\n\\n\r\nIt didn\u2019t. It got so shit that even flies were repulsed by its stench.\\n\\n\r\nThe main villain is established late into the series, and he\u2019s so utterly boring. His motive is basically revenge, but then he fucks up everything else around him and paints it as \u201cliberation\u201d or some bullshit. \u201cI just killed this entire village for the sake of humanity! You\u2019re fucking welcome!\u201d Sure, he has a brutal backstory, but his excessiveness prevents the audience from feeling sympathetic in anyway. It\u2019s more of the writers making him as hateable as possible.\\n\\n\r\nBut that hardly even compares to what eventually happens with the Kabane. You think this is just a bunch of steampunk weapons and zombies? Hahahaha\u2026 fuck you. Bring in superpowers. Because why not, I guess. Once you see a weird humanoid Kabane fire a freaking laser, that\u2019s when you know the train has derailed. That\u2019s when all the clever ideas were thrown out the window in one fell swoop. It\u2019s over. But oh no\u2026 the show still has a couple episodes left. And you spend them getting frustrated at a random bad guy killing someone asking for help, listen to the villain babble about god-knows-what, watch Mumei get completely used like a cheap, underage hooker, and then eventually understand Ikoma\u2019s disappointment towards the rest of civilization for being such idiotic dickfucks all the time.\\n\\n\r\nThe second half is just a clusterfuck of bad game-changing ideas, inconsistencies, and people being idiots, heavily contrasting the ambitious first half. Could it have been fixed with a higher episode count? I don\u2019t really see what good that would\u2019ve done. I guess you could flesh out the characters more, but you\u2019d still have the dumb Kabane shit. Is the second half still good in any way? Well, the action is still\u2026 okay, at least, and the production\u2019s still there, but everything worth seeing is in the first half. This habanero tastes pretty weird after a while.\\n\\n\r\nKabaneri was good. It was actually really good in the beginning. It was the most hyped show at the start and had a lot of reason to be at the top. I would love to say that Kabaneri is iconic, that it\u2019s something that will live through the ages as a beloved series, but even if they dare to continue it, it\u2019s just not meant to be. \\n\\n\r\nAlso, Ikoma\u2019s haircut is stupid and I don\u2019t like it.\\n\\n\r\nStory - 5/10\\n\r\nArt - 9/10\\n\r\nSound - 9/10\\n\r\nCharacters - 3/10\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 4/10\\n\r\nMumei - 12yearsoldneverforget/10\\n\r\nOverall - 5/10\\n\r\nFavorite episode - 1\\n\r\nFavorite character - Ikoma\\n\r\nRecommendation level - Medium",

            "content": "Ahh, a show about humanity being pushed to the brink of extinction due to a sudden appearance of man-eating monsters who are overwhelmingly powerful. Wait, doesn\u2019t that sound familiar? If you say yes, it\u2019s Attack on Titan, then you\u2019re absolutely right. There\u2019s absolutely nothing wrong with an AoT clone if it improves on AoT, but somehow Kabaneri of the Iron Fortress manages to do everything worse, spiralling down into a ludicrous mess of melodramatic, illogical plot elements and a villain so poorly founded and comically evil that it is laughable. Kabaneri of the Iron Fortress (especially the latter half) can only be best described asa the love child between Guilty Crown and Attack on Titan, and in absolutely no way (literally no way) is this a good thing. At all. This show is deplorable. \\n\\n\\n\r\nHailing from the same studio (and director, and composer) as Attack on Titan, it\u2019s understandable and inevitable that there are going to be some similarities between the shows; However, whenever Kabaneri of the Iron Fortress attempts to differentiate itself, it fails in a spectacular fashion. In the first episode, they attempt to replicate the \u201chooking\u201d effect the premier episode of AoT had, sweeping you up into a violent and dramatic rollercoaster, keeping you at the edge of your seat as you eagerly anticipate the following episodes. What made AoT\u2019s premier episode do this so effectively, is how the show juxtaposes the peaceful, cattle-like life of the civilians within the walls, with the violent massacre that ensues once the Colossal Titan shows up and everything turns to shit. None of this intensive juxtaposition is present in Kabaneri of the Iron Fortress. Right from the get-go this show emphasized its edgy, violent and melodramatic nature, so when things turn to shit it doesn\u2019t have the same effect AoT\u2019s first episode had. It was predictable, and on top of that, came off as very soulless. \\n\\n\\n\r\nLet\u2019s look at plot holes and elements that are entirely illogical. The Kabane are the Titan equivalent in Kabaneri of the Iron Fortress (or KNK, from here on out). The concept is simple, once you get bittn by a Kabane you turn into one, and the only way to kill one is to pierce their heart that is protected by a solid iron rib cage. This presents a great obstacle for humanity, as their simple steam based weaponry isn\u2019t powerful enough to penetrate the rib cage. This honestly blew my mind with stupidity; The zombies can\u2019t heal or regenerate, so cutting their heads off is the most efficient and effective way to get rid of these zombies.They can\u2019t hear, see, and most important of all, BITE YOU! There are so many moments where humans are wielding Katanas trying to JAB THE KABANE\u2019S HEART! I MEAN SERIOUSLY!? You have a weapon designed SPECIFICALLY for cutting yet you are JABBING its heart like you\u2019re fencing or something. It just doesn\u2019t make sense, how can their be humans so dumb to think that\u2019s an effective way of killing the Kabane? That\u2019s how you know what little thought was put into this show, when such an obviously blatant plot hole is present yet no writer decides to even remotely justify it.\\n\\n\r\n Another thing is the abundance of slitting wrists in this show. Literally, the characters slit their wrists. I mean, I know the show is edgy but there has to be a limit, in the first episode Ikoma slits his wrist thinking it\u2019s a good idea to attract zombies that way, I mean seriously? Your wrists, where a crucial artery lies? You\u2019re going to slice that? I don\u2019t understand how he didn\u2019t die from blood loss. He isn\u2019t the only one who thinks that\u2019s a good idea, either, and that\u2019s the scary part. It\u2019s like the writers in this show just decided to abandon reality entirely and write whatever they want; it perplexes me that nobody working on the show pointed this out, does nobody at Wit Studio understand how bad of an idea it is to cut your wrists? \\n\\n\\n\r\nLet\u2019s talk about this show\u2019s meager world building and insufficient world exploration. According to its synopsis, Kabaneri of the Iron Fortress is set in the far east on the island of Himoto, where humanity resides behind the safety of a colony of walled shelters connected via train tracks. Yet, the only settings of this show are the train and 2 stations, one of which is the biggest one in the entire island. KNK is another show to fall victim for biting off more than they can chew, as they tell you how big their world is but never expand on it in any way (granted, this show\u2019s limited run time is partly to blame). The mechanics of their civilization are never explained, how the Shogun (authoritarian leader of the colonies) gets messages across, how food is grown, etc. Speaking of food, apparently rice hasn\u2019t been grown or eaten for decades in the show, but how does that make any sense? Rice isn\u2019t even that hard to grow, all you need is sufficient rainfall and a warm climate, neither of which were shown to be absent from the show\u2019s setting. They can\u2019t just say things like \u201cRice hasn\u2019t been eaten for a long time\u201d without explaining why, hell, a quick google search shows 11 ways to grow rice in your damn backyard, but you\u2019re telling me the entire island of Himoto can\u2019t grow rice? How can there be no rice, but there can be fireworks? Mines? Bamboo? Peas? Garlic? Onion? I mean come on. I know I\u2019m literally getting mad over rice, but what may seem trivial is in reality extremely lazy writing especially when the show leads you to believe that there are going to be more things than available, as many loose ends are formed that are shrouded with uncertainty. \\n\\n\\n\r\nKabaneri of the Iron Fortress attempts to differentiate itself from Attack on Titan towards the latter half of the show. They do this by changing the conflict from humans vs Kabane to humans vs humans, with the Kabane as a weapon. This could have worked if the antagonist of the humans vs humans conflict was a well-founded, understandable and coherent character. Instead, we get this comically evil, cold-hearted sibling figure that has daddy issues. His motivations are unrealistic and laughable, and the fact that there are people working for him perplexes me, since there is no logical reason anyone would aid his unnecessarily destructive unhealthy grudge. There were a few melodramatic scenes that attempt to intimidate you by showing off the villain\u2019s overwhelming evil prowess, but it\u2019s so farcical that I was unable to stop laughing. Every trait that makes a typically good antagonist is entirely absent from the villain in KNK, his motivations are illogical, he\u2019s not intimidating, his dialogue is cringeworthy and nonsensical, I could go on but the point remains the same. Almost everything pertaining to the villain was done wrong. Kabaneri of the Iron Fortress even attempts to foreshadow the villain very early on, but it fails remarkably once more. There is a difference between subtly foreshadowing an event, and simply insulting the viewer\u2019s intelligence by acting like they haven\u2019t figured out the twist out already. Just from the dialogue of certain characters you can tell who the villain is going to be from the FIRST EPISODE, yet the show constantly tries act live they\u2019ve kept it hidden very well. \\n\\n\\n\r\nUltimately in terms of plot, Kabaneri of the Iron Fortress is simply a poorer version of Attack on Titan. The show tries to sell you something that they don\u2019t have, relying heavily on melodramatic and action scenes to entertain you\u2014this show doesn\u2019t have any substance to it; mediocre mindless entertainment at best. Don\u2019t get me wrong, though, there is indeed such a thing as good mindless entertainment and this show simply doesn\u2019t get it; for mindless entertainment to be good your cast needs to be likeable and endearing, and your show needs to understand itself that it\u2019s mindless entertainment. KNK has no idea that their show is a joke and consistently tries to be something it simply isn\u2019t, making this show the best comedy this season. t\\n\\n\r\nThe characters of Kabaneri of the Iron Fortress are extremely shallow, with little to no layers, as well as offensively stupid. There are only two characters that undergo any mentionable development, and the rest of the cast never behave consistently. Let\u2019s first take a look at our protagonist, Ikoma. In the beginning, Ikoma was portrayed as a better version of Eren Jaeger from Attack on Titan; he had a deep and well-founded hate for the Kabane, but, unlike Eren, was very capable, intelligent, and actually developed an effective weapon to fight against the Kabane. Throughout the course of the show, however, it\u2019s as if Ikoma relapsed, falling prey to the same annoying character traits Eren had, including incapability, na\u00efvety, and his off-putting incessant rage. It\u2019s as if Ikoma is incapable of having a calm and normal conversation with anyone, he always has to be yelling or some other dramatic motion. There are several moments when Ikoma spews these really cringeworthy lines of dialogue, too, including but not limited to \u201cyou have a lot to learn\u201d and \u201cyou\u2019re not as fast as X character!\u201d. These shortcomings pertaining to his character make it difficult to connect and admire Ikoma as for the most part you\u2019re simply annoyed with him.\\n\\n\\n\r\nLet\u2019s take a look at Mumei, now. Mumei is actually one of the only characters in KNK that undergoes some mentionable development, but it\u2019s not like this development is very profound or original. Being 12 years old (let\u2019s just ignore the obnoxious hypersexualization of her character, no way her body and age correlate) Mumei is obviously vulnerable to mood swings and rash decision making. But the writers of KNK don\u2019t understand how to write this part of her personality properly and realistically. There are several scenes where she is playing with the children and cheering them up, and then seconds later her personality does a 180 and she becomes this entirely different character. I\u2019m reluctant to believe that the writers actually think that is how you write a 12 year old\u2019s mood swings. No child (half-zombie or not) behaves like this, opinions change on a whim but personalities do not--especially in the drastic matter Mumei\u2019s does. The writers simply do this to fall back on to the only thing they can use to entertain their audience: shock factor. \\n\\n\\n\r\nMoving onto Ayame, who is the shining light in this endless dark pit of distasteful characters. Being based on the \u201cHime-sama\u201d character archetype, Ayame is the daughter of a governing family and is very elegant, soft-spoken and protective. Ayame, being the heir of the Yomogawa family (governing family within the walls) is naturally put in a position of leadership when her father is absent. Her sheltered personality and reliance on her father and bodyguards make it difficult for her to effectively lead her people, as seen during her incapability to control the people\u2019s panic when the Kabane had invaded the walls. However, the more difficult positions Ayame is put in throughout the show, the more she is able to fluently grow into the position of leader and the more effective she becomes at it. There is a scene in the second episode where her authority is questioned, and her position is revoked in a pseudo-revolution as people rely on fear instead of rational thinking. By the end of the episode Ayame confronts these people once more, and there you get to see a very profound change in power dynamics as she realizes her natural talent for leadership and seizes back her authority. Her naturally protective nature makes for some very interesting moments as she interacts with several characters who pose threats to her people. Ayame\u2019s development from the sheltered and soft-spoken princess to the stern and iron-willed leader is easily one of the best parts of Kabaneri of the Iron Fortress. \\n\\n\\n\r\nWit Studio absolutely killed it production wise, producing what I think is the best looking show this season. The characters have these great vintage-esque facial and character designs with some absolutely stunning fight choreography and cinematography. The soundtrack was produced by my personal favourite composer Hiroyuki Sawano, and as someone who\u2019s listened to all of his soundtracks, I can safely say the KNK OST is some of his best work. \\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 4/10:\\n\\n\r\nHonestly, the beginning 6 episodes of this show probably deserved an enjoyment score of 7 or 8, as the show was bad, sure, but at least it was fun. That is until the latter half of the show where it changed from fun to boring, and from bad to deplorable. It got to the point where it became a chore to sit through the final episodes as I had little to no interest in any of the characters or any of the events. I honestly wouldn\u2019t have picked up this show if I knew how bad it was going to get. \\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall 3/10:\\n\\n\r\nEasily one of the worst shows I have seen in awhile, and probably the most disappointing show this season. I wouldn\u2019t even recommend this show to someone who liked Attack on Titan, it\u2019s a try-hard wanna be of it as Wit Studio attempts to replicate their success. The writing in Kabaneri lacks any sense of originality and creativity, relying heavily on stolen plot elements and clich\u00e9s that culminate in an unbelievably ridiculous, edgy, melodramatic finale that solidified its position as the most disappointing show that came out of this season. The only thing original about this show is the fashion in which it failed.\\n\\n\r\nI hope this review was informative and helpful.\\n",

            "content": "*SPOILERS FOR KOUTETSUJOU NO KABANERI aka KABANERI OF THE IRON FORTRESS*\r\nI'm sure you've heard this question before: What do you prefer? Starting off strong but ending badly, or starting off weak, but ending strongly? Whatever your answer may be, this show falls into the former, like a rooftop jump gone wrong. The first 7 episodes were this fun run that had a few stumbles but was still cool, episode 8 was that big leap, and episodes 9-12 were this random ass train smashing our fucked, airborne friend into the concrete, showing a hand in hope that it wasn't all in vain, before the finale explodedthe train into gloriously sad bits, as all of the show's  issues were put on full blast. Nonetheless, I still like the show all things considered, but there's a reason this earned the nickname \"trainwreck.\"\\n\\n\r\nIn the middle of an industrial revolution, an outbreak of armor-clad zombies known as Kabane has spread into a zombie apocalypse, and now it is up to the likes of Ikoma and all members of the Koutetsujou to hopefully out and end to it. Now, this show has some questionable things from the beginning, but with enough decent pseudoscience and explanations, we could've seen a really unorthodox and interesting zombie show. Instead, a lot of the radical moments weren't explained with decent and interesting reasonings, but were handwaved for the sake of plot and maybe time. It seemed like a standard story at first but with clever science, could've made for a really good and interesting steampunk zombie apocalypse, but then, with the lackluster villain, and the ludicrously safe and plot mangling finale, it unfortunately falls short of what it could've been. It definitely has more than its fair share of plot holes as well. I mean, it's a mess! Things like Kabane muscle memory and later, OP Kabaneri steroids don't get explained at all because \"action\" and interesting things like Kabaneri being resistant to heat, Kabane clinging on to each other to make a colony beast with one Kabane used as the heart, or the knowledge on how to halt and slow down the Kabane virus in order to be a badass Kabaneri get the same treatment. That is the sad thing. Plus, the motivations of our true villain Biba, don't add up with his actions, and well, and honestly, the second half was so stupidly and boringly written.\\n\\n\r\nIkoma is a slightly more calculated shounen character whose traits I just mentioned flip-flop and clash with each other. Sometimes, it's understandable, like when he loses his best friend in EP 10 for the soft and shounen side, and like when he has to kill actual people in the finale as well as Kabane because not every human is an ally, and not every human has shown a reason to be allowed to live when it comes to the harsher and calculating side. He's probably the best character here for being a remotely solid character. Plus, he actually feels real at some points, as well as his best friend, due to some of their reactions and conversations in times like this being what most actual people would do rather than just simple characters, like freaking out when they find out that their project for making a weapon to combat Kabane in episode 1 actually works as Ikoma kills a Kabane. Mumei, is a badass and jerkass in the first half, and a total child for most of the 2nd. She has an interesting bit in episode 4 where her mouth and grim ideals get her admonished by her already stupidly jumpy and dickish co-passengers, but that's the closest thing to anything she has going for her as a character. Kurusu is just a samurai with a jerkass side, and Ayame, is barely any better, being that type of female authority figure that likes cooperation between enemies rather than needless violence, which only really gets to shine in the last few episodes. The villain Biba, is easily the worst, however. He's shallow, cold and calm, with grim ideals, and a vendetta against his asshole father that should've been fleshed out more so that we can buy into his motivations. His actions are pretty deplorable as is, so, meh. His death scene was the only time we saw any sparks of life in this husk of a character. At least one of his lackeys has some decency despite being kind of a rouge guy. Also, poor Horobi. She never got fleshed out, and she still managed to call her death.\\n\\n\r\nI do like how the first half of the show focuses on these unlikely allies on the Koutetsujou cooperating to defeat a common enemy despite being at each other's throats all the time, and how betrayal of that begrudging trust by one of the members in episode 10 leaves a detriment in one's reputation, even if it turns out he was a spy to get our heroes some benefits later on, courtesy of Ikoma. If only we actually saw this with interesting personalities.\\n\\n\r\nSome awkward 3D CGI in episode 6 aside, this show looks amazing. The fully detailed and high def look to the realistic art style really gels with everything beautifully, and the action scenes are well done with some incredible bits here and there. The explosions, spark effects for whenever a Kabane or Kabaneri gets stabbed in the heart, and the well done and detailed explosion effects are downright astonishing, even if there are some odd bits here and there with some action scenes. Hell, the art style is an epic update on that 80's OVA shading art style, and has numerous references to 80's art style themes, like Ikoma's cool new haircut in the end of episode 11 reflecting they badass punk-looking character type in the 80's. Given that the character designer was Haruhiko Mikimoto, legendary designer behind the characters of Macross, Gundam 0080 War in the Pocket, and Gunbuster. His work is legendary and I'm glad to see his stuff again, even if it is for a train wreck. The character designs look amazing, and more anime need this upgraded shading style. This was by far, Studio Wit's best work yet in terms of art. Just, look at how detailed and well done the character models, environmental and explosion effects, and backgrounds are! That's probably the main reason why many people like this show so much. It looks impressive and the action is bombastic and glorious.\\n\\n\r\nThe music in this series has several tracks that are as catchy as they are fitting. This soundtrack was done by Hiroyuki Sawano after all; it's pretty much expected for him to knock it out of the park every time. The songs are definitely good, and the cola tracks are all great, and while they aren't all that memorable on their own, most of them feel like they were tailor-made for this series. Not one song feels out of place at all, and another large part of what makes the action in this show so breathtaking is how each fight has a piece of music that fits perfectly with what is going on, whether that be an action scene or that transformation sequence from Kabaneri Ikoma to Steroids Kabaneri Ikoma. Also, the OP, Kotetsujou no Kabaneri, is done by EGOIST, so of course it sounds catchy and awesome. The ED, done by AIMER sounds really cool too, and I wish there was some cool animation stretched to it. Plus, some of their songs were used in this OST, so good for them. Plus, \"Through My Blood\" (the song that plays during Ikoma's roofed out transformation) by AIMER is an awesome track as well. Also, WarCry (which is sung entirely in English) is pretty damn catchy.\\n\\n\r\nFor the first 7 episodes, I absolutely loved this show. It was so awesome and epic. It even had some nice comedy, especially in episode 7, and some nice realistic banter and reactions that we don't really get to see a lot of in anime, which I mentioned was a cool thing about this show in my review of ERASED, which had bits like that. However, some of the later episodes really crashed and burned in my eyes, ruining what could've been an incredibly fun show. Plus, the finale really aggravated me with all the BS and asspulls in there.\\n\\n\r\nThe group consensus for this show is that while it was entertaining and impressive to look at and listen to, it fell short of what it could've been via failure to explain interesting yet radical things, and failure to give a decent finale and antagonist. I wholeheartedly agree. It's not as good as what it could've been, but it was a pretty entertaining show to watch, even if it turned out to be a bit of a \"Trainwreck\". Well, with all that said, I bid you adieu.",

            "content": "\u201cTHE APOCLAYPSE STARTER PACK\u201d \r\nWhatever disaster happen in this world. Absolutely, we can\u2019t predicted about that. That\u2019s why we must make preparations and brainstorm our mind to address this problem. You\u2019d better prepare your transportation, shelter and food for emergency. Sometimes, natural disaster occurs in the several country and there\u2019s a lot of cost to recover all this things. In fact, this is just information of the catastrophe. Henceforth, our discussion is about the theme of post-apocalyptic & you know? \u201cweapon & suit & tank is the paramount things in the battle against zombie, right?\u201d In the year 2016, the WIT Studio launched their newAnime project & it\u2019s not an adaptation of manga or novel. Now, I\u2019m proud to present the most popular Anime as we know it. \u201cKoutetsujou no Kabaneri (Kabaneri of the Iron Fortress)\u201d\\n\\n\r\n\u201cHaters gonna Hate and ain\u2019t-ers gonna ain\u2019t\u201d. Basically, we can see there was a lot of criticism of the Koutetsujou no Kabaneri in the myanimelist review, previously. I know everyone of you have a different opinion about the story. In fact, some people think it's one of the greatest and they gave a compliment for the series. Meanwhile, haters are being a bit too harsh on it because they say this series is a blatant stole from Shingeki no Kyojin. Besides, I bet all of you comparing Koutetsujou no Kabaneri with that Shingeki no Kyojin, when you write a review about the series \u201cAM I RIGHT\u201d. Actually, I was a bit reluctant to watch this Anime for the first time. However, I\u2019m just ignored my scepticism. Basically, I tried to evaluate a situation of the story. In my considered opinion, this series have a lot of the struggle to retain humanity in front of impossible conditions and their characters always have strategies to solve the problem. One question \u201cBefore you are waiting for Shingeki no Kyojin 2nd season - would you like Koutetsujou no Kabaneri instead\u201d, Yes or No. \\n\\n\r\nWait a minute!!! You want to know a secret formula of Koutetsujou no Kabaneri, it\u2019s :\\n\r\n[World War Z film + The Walking Dead series + Highschool of the Dead + Shingeki no Kyojin + Unstoppable film  =  Koutetsujou no Kabaneri]\\n\\n\\n\r\nStory : 5\\n\r\nJust trivia, Tetsur\u014d Araki who was the director organizes the actual making of the Koutetsujou no Kabaneri series. He is best known as the director of the Death Note, Highschool of the Dead, Guilty Crown and Attack on Titan anime adaptations and I never thought Okouchi Ichiro (Script, Series Composition) is scriptwriters for the Koutetsujou no Kabaneri series. I believe everyone know, he\u2019s also original creator of Code Geass (In my considered opinion, Code Geass is a masterpiece). \u201cForget about it\u201d let\u2019s focus our discussion. According to the story, a monsters it\u2019s called Kabane. If humans got bite by the monster & they become Kabane creatures. That\u2019s why people have built stations to shelter themselves from these Kabane. Hayajiro or locomotive running on steam, its transport wares between people & they can access the station. \\n\\n\r\nOne night, one of the locomotive running on steam or Hayajiro, called Fusang Fortress is coming. However, the train hijack was organized by a group Kabane and the train is really fast and there is little probability of the train crashed into a Aragane station. When they realized about this situation. A few people at the station, attempt to seal the railway station. \u201cTIME IS RUNNING OUT\u201d they can\u2019t make it in time. The accident happened and this is the beginning of Kabane to assault on a people at the island country Hinomoto. \\n\\n\r\n***NOTE : Another words is \u201cKabaneri\u201d it means half human and half Kabane\\n\\n\r\nHowever, I have my doubts about the story & crucially, \u201cI\u2019M CURIOUS\u201d ok firstly, this story explain the infection transforming humans into Kabane and rapidly spreads. However, it never explained to any degree where this Kabane comes from???? Because I want to know the history a mysterious virus appears during the industrial revolution. Do you remember?? What did Eru Chitanda says, when she's has a curious about something and she's always says \u201cWATASHI KIRINARIMASU\u201d.\\n\\n\r\nNow, we move on to another topic. You know what? Sometimes Koutetsujou no Kabaneri reminds me of the Twilight film & Strike the Blood series. The both of story is about vampire creatures. In fact, Ikoma & Mumei both of them have the same personality with Vampire (I guess!!). Besides, if there has been a decrease of the blood in their body. All they need is blood from human being. Sometimes, they couldn\u2019t control themselves, if they have craving for blood. Fundamentally, they took the human blood to preventative measures to stop their body become Kabane form. Guess what, who\u2019s the volunteers to help them and they become blood donors for them, \u201cOF COURSE\u201d the Princess Ayame, Kurusu, Kajika, Kibito, Takumi and Yukina (watch episode 4). Crucially, I never thought this might be happen in the story. At the beginning, I can\u2019t make any sense of what the purpose of the motive. However, I realized blood is circulates round the body going from the heart and lungs along arteries and returns to the heart through the veins (especially human). Which means Kabaneri has a heart failure and that\u2019s why they always need some blood. By the way, I can deduce for this case \u201cHALF KABANE + HALF HUMAN + VAMPIRE = KABANERI\u201d.\\n\\n\r\nI found the series was reaching its climax when \u201cOUR HEROES IS BACK\u201d Ikoma is reunited with his team-mate to save Mumei. Next, Ikoma had to battle against Biba (the villain, who\u2019s unleashed the chaos) and finally, he did it to defeat Biba. However, Biba awoke and tried to kill Ikoma (Ikoma's collapsed at the moment). Out of the blue, Biba was stabbed in the chest by Mumei and Biba died. Of course \u201cHAPPY ENDING\u201d. Actually, the most ridiculous part is Ikoma has return after he was killed by Mumei. Seriously, I thought he\u2019s die at the moment, however he\u2019s still alive. \u201cWHAT THE F**K\u201d. It\u2019s really strange. OK just remember one thing, I assume the protagonist of the story is \u201cIMMORTAL\u201d. Nobody can kill him.\\n\\n\r\nI thought, could it be possible Shingeki no Kyojin & World War Z film inspired WIT Studio to made Koutetsujou no Kabaneri series??? Well, this series is an exact \u201ccopy & paste\u201d, yet is not much different with SNK & World War Z film. I mean look at the performance of the character in the story & don\u2019t forget about the plot of the story, seriously it\u2019s quite similar. Truthfully, WIT Studio imitates its competitors by making very similar story. In fact, the final score in the myanimelist was score 7.94/10 (scored by 47,219 users) & it\u2019s really different based on IMDb score (627 IMDb users have given a weighted average vote of 8.30/10). By the way, Koutetsujou no Kabaneri deserve the appellation of \u201cPlagiarism\u201d. \\n\\n\r\nFurthermore, Koutetsujou no Kabaneri mainly focus on the drama, emotion, and the action. The best slogan for Koutetsujou no Kabaneri utilizes is \"One For All & All For One\" and also \u201cThe Strong Survive While The Weak Perish\u201d. I realized there\u2019s a few of a butterflies comes out in the series and it was one of the shock scenes I have ever seen. Crucially, it\u2019s really same scenario with the STEINS;GATE and Boku dake ga Inai Machi (ERASED).\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacter : 8\\n\r\nFirstly, I really appreciate the \u201cseiyuu\u201d have contributed to the Koutetsujou no Kabaneri project \u201cWELL DONE\u201d and they are very talented as voice actress. Based on my opinion, all of them are \u201cseiyuu\u201d prodigy & they are having unique voice for casting of the character in the series.\\n\\n\r\nFrom my observation about the protagonist, Ikoma\u2019s very brave & knowledgeable about the weapon & he\u2019s always make a new strategies to solve a problem. In fact, he\u2019s engineer too and he creates his own weapon called Tsuranukizutsu or Piercing Cannon. I saw Ikoma was in trauma after her younger sister was attacked by a Kabane. However, the pain was more than he could endure. Next, the heroine is Mumei, \u201cseriously\u201d she\u2019s really \u201cBADASS\u201d and she\u2019s has 3 personality same with the characters of Shingeki no Kyojin, for example Mikasa & Levi & Annie. In fact, she\u2019s has same personality with Mikasa (as you know Mikasa has outstanding ability in the battle against Titan and this is same thing happen, she\u2019s (Mumei) has outstanding ability in the battle against Kabane) & Levi (she\u2019s reminds me about Levi kicked Eren face and that\u2019s what she did to Ikoma. She has no doubt to \u201cKICK HIS ASS\u201d, watch episode 3) & also Annie (we know that Annie has good fighting with her opponent and it\u2019s similar with Mumie, she\u2019s has oriental fighting techniques, when she\u2019s against someone). Now about the princess Ayame. Fundamentally, she\u2019s is leader of Aragane station. Since her father die, she\u2019s going instead of him. Besides, she has a kindness personality. Next, the characters is Kurusu. He\u2019s appearance like a samurai warrior. Besides, he always make sure that all his soldiers know exactly what they must do in the battle against Kabane. Besides, he\u2019s always care about the people. The next supporter characters is Yukina. She piloted the train (Ironclad Fortress) into another country and she\u2019s working with 3 crewmen who can operate an express fortress, they are Takumi & Sukari & Suzuki. Besides, they are an expert engineers.\\n\\n\\n\r\nArts : 10\\n\r\nIt was great work done by Haruhiko Mikimoto because his contribution for original character designs. Next, I want to compliment the arts it\u2019s really accurate, superb and this series has really high quality art and animation. I really loved how they did all of the facial expressions in the series. I like the character expression in the animation, sometime it have wrath expressions, fear expression and it has grief-stricken expressions. Based on my opinion, Koutetsujou no Kabaneri animation is quite similar with Shingeki no Kyojin. Furthermore, the utopia of the story is really unique and the construction of the fort, city, train and the railway is the magnificent construction, I have seen. \\n\\n\\n\r\nSound : 9\\n\r\nIn fact, I really love their opening theme \"KABANERI OF THE IRON FORTRESS\" by EGOIST and the Opening song video featured the characters in the battle against corpse and present about their struggle to save humanity and it\u2019s really impressive. Next, I\u2019m not forget about the ending sequence \"ninelie\" by Aimer with chelly (EGOIST) is really beautiful song. I\u2019m glad to see Aimer featuring chelly (EGOIST) to sing this song & previously I heard Aimer song for opening theme Fate/Stay Night : UBW 2nd season. Based on my opinion, EGOIST is a professional singer & I like the latest song in the year 2014, it\u2019s \u201cEGOIST \u2013 Fallen\u201d for PSYCHO-PASS 2 Ending song. Now, I will talk about theme song composition, music. It\u2019s really great because the soundtrack created by Sawano Hiroyuki. In fact, he\u2019s the creator of soundtrack for Shingeki no Kyojin too. Besides, the soundtrack has a catchy tune and f**king awesome.\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment : 4\\n\r\nSo far, I love the action, adventure, and drama of the story. However, I would not said the story, \u201cit was most enjoyable\u201d because there\u2019s a few of flaw in the plot of the story. Next, there is only another unique of the story. Its show the apocalyptic scenes of destruction caused by the zombie in the Edo era and I think is really impressive. The soundtrack of the story it\u2019s really magnificent, \u201cThanks Sawano Hiroyuki and you are the brilliant person & the BEST composer\u201d.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall : 3\\n\r\nEssentially, this story taught me about brave and struggle to gain something, such as happiness, freedom, peace and save humanity from this doom. I want to compliment about the teamwork. For example, their warrior tried to ensure the safety of the people. I think its good things they did. So far, my expectation for this story will surpassed Shingeki no Kyojin (I hope so!!!).To be honest, the narrative part of the story it\u2019s really disappointing and for the whole of the story Koutetsujou no Kabaneri is POOR. Guess what rating would I give that story, it is 3.00/10. I wouldn't say that the story in Koutetsujou no Kabaneri is particularly notable or masterpiece. However, Koutetsujou no Kabaneri is something that I could call a straightforward and clich\u00e9.\\n\\n\\n\r\nI hope that this review makes you consider what the pros and cons in the story.\\n",

For example, it was obvious the Black Smoke monster was used with CGI and sometimes, when they showed a zoomed out action scene, they used CGI for the characters.\r\nSound: 10/10\r\nJust go listen to the OST. Words can't describe how amazing it is.\r\nCharacter: 4/10\r\nI have to be honest: I hated most, if not all of the characters. They getlittle to no development and I hated how paranoid everyone was. That rule they had for whenever you enter a new station, you have to stay in the train for 3 days made no sense. They were already checking people for bites, so why the 3 day rule? Also, I understood how the people were suspicious of Ikoma and Mumei because they didn't know about Kabaneri, but it got ridiculous to the point that they almost abandoned them twice even when they got saved by them. Finally, how is it that Ikoma is the only person in the entire anime that was researching a cure for the virus?? I know that it's the Industrial Revolution, but if something was threatening the very existence of the human race, wouldn't you want to do everything in your power to stop it??\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9/10\\n\r\nI loved the action.\\n\r\nFinal score: 8/10\\n\r\nAlthough there were some aggravating things about this anime, I still really enjoyed it overall because of the action.

            "content": "**SPOILER REVIEW** \r\nIf I had to describe iron fortress in a word it would be... generic. Now you don\u2019t have to tell me how overused and pretentious that word is, because I\u2019m very well aware of that. But I suppose it\u2019s the most appropriate word to use for this anime because that\u2019s exactly what it is. This is indisputably one of the most generic anime I\u2019ve seen in a long time. The biggest problem with this iron fortress is that the vast majority of it is so standardized and uninspired.  It's a show you've probably seen many times in the past and probably morein the future. I envy anyone that\u2019s capable of watching and enjoying something that\u2019s been retold countless times in different ways. Not only is the story of Kabaneri hackneyed, the actual execution of the story is filled with ludicrous moments and poor characters. With its formulaic structure, it's at best a low-end ditto.\\n\\n\r\nStory\\n\\n\r\nSo the story is about humans on the verge of extinction again, but this time they\u2019re up against kabunes. Basically, the kabunes are mindless zombies that eat human flesh and raid trains and towns occasionally. From there we are introduced to kabaneris,  human-kabane hybrids that have super strength and healing abilities that fight off the kabunes. The story follows Ikoma, who is a kabaneri that wants vengeance against the kabane. He\u2019s accompanied by loli Mumei and wimpy friend Takumi. Sound familiar? It\u2019s as if I\u2019m repeating the synopsis of Attack on Titan. Wit Studio has done this story structure twice already. Hell, iron fortress and attack on titan even share the same director. \\n\\n\r\nTo start off, the kabune infection and main threats of the story is plain ridiculous and, by addition, the story is too. Sometimes the infection turns a human into a kabune within minutes, except when the plot decides to change this to days for no reason. It can be deterred by strangling yourself (no joke) and or even given through magical serums. They explain how Ikoma learned about the strangling technique through his research, but how and when was a scenario or an experiment ever shown to him or the audience? Despite finding out crucial information about keeping your humanity when turning into a kabune, Ikoma illogically, never informed anyone of this.\\n\\n\r\nWithout a delay, the humans quickly establish a bad relationship with the kabaneri. Initially with their given situation and miniscule knowledge of the kabaneri, it made enough sense that they wouldn\u2019t trust them. But after watching the kabaneri protecting the humans for a large portion of the story, it is apparent that the drama between the humans and kabaneris became too absurd for its own good. For example, Mumei killed a pregnant women that had just turned into a kabune. For some odd reason, the other characters antagonized her despite there being numerous incidents where soldiers killed a bitten person. There\u2019s even a scene where people thought the kabaneri brought the kabunes to them which led to the their imprisonment. \u201cYou're no different from a Kabane after all!\" All the adults being stupid are just plot conveniences to continue this tense climate between humans and the kabaneri. It\u2019s just lazy writing altogether. \\n\\n\r\nAfter the story wanders around aimlessly, we\u2019re introduced to the villain, Biba. His intentions and overall plan just baffles me and I\u2019ll get to him later. Ikoma and friends try to rebel against him with Mumei being somewhere in the middle. Takumi ends up dying along the lines by taking a bullet for Ikoma. This is just a really half-assed effort to tear-jerk the audience. Takumi has already witnessed Ikoma survive severe injuries with his regenerative powers. Why would he even feel the need to jump in and \u201csave\u201d him in the first place? Could the exact same scene of occurred in a way where Ikoma was shot and then Takumi dies? It would\u2019ve made much more sense and far less stupid.\\n\\n\r\nSo after Biba finally ends his father\u2019s life, he continues to bring about widespread destruction on everyone in the city for no reason. The Kotetsujyo are imprisoned and Mumei turns into what appears to be a shadowy dog with butterfly wings. Ikoma comes in with Kurusu and it\u2019s up to them to save the day. Prior to this, Ikoma used a drug to basically turn into a super saiyan, but it will cost him his life. The white blood can only save him or Mumei. So after an underwhelming fight, Ikoma is able to save Mumei. Mumei kills Biba and everyone escapes on a train. Ikoma is alive and breathing. WTF?! It\u2019s implied that Biba somewhere along the lines used the white blood to help him. Why, when, and how did he do this? \\n\\n\r\nCharacters\\n\\n\r\nI don\u2019t have much to say about most of them, so I\u2019ll be talking about the ones I felt were important, starting off with Ikoma. He is as original as the premise of this anime can be, not at all. He makes a pledge to himself to never run away against the kabune after the death of his little sister. There is nothing else that defines his character. We know nothing about his past other than the death of his sister. We also knew nothing about his sister. Can anyone describe this character, without also describing similar main characters in other anime? Ikoma doesn\u2019t get that much development. He\u2019s more like a stand-in of a generic protagonist. \\n\\n\r\nMumei\u2019s development was handled better than Ikoma, but her bipolar personality is hard to take seriously. She can quickly change from being friendly with kids, to a cold-blooded killer, to being motivational, to being arrogant, or conflicted. There\u2019s no transition or anything that makes it gradual. She is unable to communicate with others and her irrational behaviour loathsome. She doesn\u2019t listen to reason and acts idiotically. There are some flashbacks here and there that show why she is how she is. Even though I disliked her character, she is developed the best out of everyone. \\n\\n\r\nEnter Biba, the show\u2019s antagonist. Biba is so poorly-written, it makes me sad to hear Mamoru voice him. His intentions and motivations as logical as someone getting ran over by a parked car. He\u2019s butthurt about his daddy issues and he constantly tries to thrust the idea that the weak die and strong survive. He\u2019s a butthurt villain whose main objective is to kill the shogun, his father, and end his reign. For some odd reason, his father let the Kabane attack a city Biba was protecting at the time. Why or how his father let this happen is never explored. He\u2019s the cause of thousands of innocent deaths because he has some grudge against his father as a child. They also attempt (quite unsuccessfully, I might add) to humanize and add some depth to him in the last episode by showing him riding a horse with his papi. Remember kids, daddy issues= genocides. \\n\\n\r\nArt & Animation / Sound\\n\\n\r\nThis is the only department in this anime that stand out as being particularly well done. Tetsur\u014d Araki is once again fantastic. Admittedly it feels over the top, but I loved the writing scenes from Death Note and the swinging with the 3D maneuver gear in Attack on Titan. His style and sweeping movements along with his variance of camera angles are superb. The choreography is exceptional and captivating. It could have been much simpler to have the camera remain static. The art is pleasant and the animation is mellow. The soundtrack was as epic as it possibly could be. It climaxed during action sequences and toned down in calmer, quieter scenes.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 3/10\\n\\n\r\nI\u2019ve only enjoyed some of the action sequences. I\u2019m not much of an action fanatic, so it did very little for me. There were so many parts of the story that made me go, \u201cReally?\u201d Ok, a kabune is somehow able to fight like a trained warrior with a sword. If this isn't pushing the limits of suspension of disbelief, I don't know what is. In addition, the black smoke further exemplifies how comical this show is. The black smoke is a giant shadowy figure made up of dead or alive kabunes/humans. REALLY?! Need I say more? One episode in particular featured them celebrating and lighting up fireworks. ARE THEY SERIOUSLY NOT WORRIED AT ALL OF THE ATTRACTION OF KABANE? The unoriginal plot, the plot holes, the characterization, terrible antagonist, and character development all ruined my enjoyment. \\n\\n\r\nOverall 3/10\\n\\n\r\nI criticize this anime because I\u2019ve already seen a similar plot structure numerous times but it\u2019s being marked as something new. Because of the magical power I like to call memory, I've already experienced every formulaic plot turn they can throw. \u201cEver get that feeling of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu?\u201d Not only did that take away from the overall score, but the level of ridiculousness progressed with each episode. It's bland and soulless, created with little effort. I\u2019m willing to believe the Wit Studio dished this out for some easy $$$. They\u2019ve already done it twice, so if it ain\u2019t broke, don\u2019t fix it. If you\u2019re not aware of these cliches, then I\u2019m glad that you\u2019re able to enjoy the same stories over and over.    \\n\\n",

            "content": "Kabaneri of the Iron Fortress, or Disappointment of the Iron Fortress, you choose the best title for this.\r\nSPOILERS AHEAD\r\nThe show started very well. Despite of the amount of people comparing it with AoT, the first seemed that this show would be a blast, and also would be nothing like AoT. However, after 3 episodes, this show became a trainwreck.\r\nThe plot is almost nonsensical. Kabaneris wear tight necklaces that for some reason don't asphyxiate them, Mumei gets transformed to Kabaneri by Biba just because of silly reasons, Biba wants to transform everybody into Kabane because of silly reasons etc.\r\nFurthermore, there are disturbing plot holes. Katanas, thatare fragile swords, somehow could pierce a Kabane heart. In contrast to that, in the following episode, Ikoma had to build a Kabane-based Katana for the samurai guy because a normal one can't pierce the zombie heart!!!!!! WHAT????\\n\\n\r\nThe main problem with the show is that the plot isn't straightfoward. To be exact, the plot is almost inexistent. It's a train trip with friends. Sometimes the train gets attacked by the zombies and BOOM, we get nice action scenes and it's over. Later on, they meet a group of anarchist Kabane exterminators that in the end will try to kill everybody. And what happened in the last episode? Suddenly Ikoma becomes Ouma Shu and started to have Guilty Crown-ish powers. I was like \"WHAT THE HELL?\"\\n\\n\r\nAlso, the plot conveniences and the idiotic actions that some characters take in some chapters really annoys me, like when the purple-haired girl cuts herself wasting a lot of blood that could have be given to the Kabaneris instead of being wasted.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters were totally undeveloped. The only one that we could say that had a decent development was Mumei.\\n\\n\r\nOn the other hand, the ost and animation saved the day. They have Sawano, EGOIST and Aimer. This is a dream team! The art was very beautiful. That steampunk vibe was very nice too. KotIF is one of the best looking anime that I have ever watched, only losing to the Fate series (ufot. vers.).\\n\\n\r\nTo sum up, the anime wasn't very original, but had some potential that wasn't well explored. If you want to watch this, expect nothing more than a very nice ost and action scenes, because the plot is utterly trash\\n\\n",

            "content": "[4.0/10]\r\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________________\r\nThe ability to elevate your work is paramount to show growth within an inherently creative medium. I feel as though that is what Wit Studios really attempted to accomplish with Kabaneri. A show that is essentially a retread of their breakout hit Attack on Titan, with only slight deviations in the storytelling. The fact that Kabaneri came out as the next show they created is further proof that it felt like a test project, something to hone your skills by. A sharpening stone. \r\nThe theme of human versus monster, only to realize that humans may be the real monsters is well-explored in anime. It isa popular idea mainly because you get away with feigning deep thematic meaning when in reality all they are trying to do is force a bare-bones story while showcasing design and animation. Which, to Kabaneri's credit, is the series' highlight and what kept it mostly enjoyable. \\n\\n\r\nPersonally, I have no issues with these kinds of creative projects. It doesn't necessarily feel like a rip off, since the studio creating this is essentially what created the original, popular show, even if it was an adaptation. So we just get some refined animation and compositing that will hopefully be seen in Attack on Titan. However, story-wise, it is the same thing done a little more clumsily. \\n\\n\r\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________________\\n\\n\r\n[Pros]\\n\\n\r\nKeeping this review short and sweet, I'll outline Kabaneri's standout elements. Firstly, the animation is generally solid throughout. With solid choreography and bombastic movement-heavy action, I couldn't help but feel impressed by how much effort Wit put into bringing the action to life. While the action doesn't really have much tension, what it lacks in tension is made up for in spectacle. Especially in the first half, before the story was, no pun intended, completely derailed. \\n\\n\r\nThe character design is also something warranting infinite praise. Kabaneri's lead character designer is Haruhiko Makimoto, who I wasn't aware of before I saw this show. I do understand that he's an old-school name, though, which shows. The characters have a distinct aesthetic that seems to call back to the 80's, while still retaining a clean, modern palate. The eyes are beautiful in particular, as certain shots are especially jaw-dropping as Wit studios employs a pretty revolutionary and incredible stylistic choice to their illustration.\\n\\n\r\nThis comes in the hand of Sachiko Matsumoto, who is the teams lead make-up animator, who's job is to make these gorgeous designs look equally beautiful in motion. Matsumoto's work is nothing short of astounding, as some close up shots of these characters are dazzling. Discussing the art in Kabaneri, she says \"having a delicate texture, even in every strand of hair. But that cannot be reproduced properly by using the regular coloring techniques. That is why in Kabaneri, we are putting make-up on by hand into each image.\u201d \\n\\n\r\nThe ability to add intricate shading and texturing to every keyframe creates a spell-binding feel to this show's character portraits. While the use of these post-effect make up isn't inherently new, it is utilized in new ways, as we see characters in full motion with these kinds of lavish effects. \\n\\n\r\nThere is also solid compositing in this show. CGI is often incredibly noticeable and distracting in anime, however, in Kabaneri, while noticeable, there weren't many moments where it was wholly obnoxious, which is definitely worth praise. The setting, as well, while similar to Attack on Titan in more ways than one inhabits a realm between steampunk and edo-era Japan. The mix of samurai and massive, leviathan-esq armed trains and cities is beautiful and bad ass. \\n\\n\r\nFor the first half, the story is fairly palatable too. For a moment, I was actually happy to see a main character of a completely shounen anime not be overcome by morality-driven ideals. While later that unfortunately changes, the first six or so episodes were easy to watch and fun, albeit incredibly shlocky entertainment. I particularly enjoyed the inclusion of Mumei, or \"No-name\", an inexplicably bad ass twelve year old that can easily pass off as a twenty year old. Not only is her design exquisite, but seeing a powerful female that doesn't just hold political, or noble function in anime is actually refreshing. Especially since most \"strong\" female characters are generally left for shows with a wholly female cast. \\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack was pretty solid as well. The intro or the main themes weren't all too interesting, especially since their lyrics would pop up on screen in a karaoke-style, which was annoying. But the actual episode stingers were pretty great! I remember some of the more somber music was also solid, overall, with some really melodic and catchy production backing the impressive visuals. \\n\\n\r\nKabaneri was shaping up to be a fun romp. \\n\\n\r\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________________\\n\\n\r\n[Cons]\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately, that fun romp comes to a grinding halt, as the entire premise quickly becomes muddled as the show's writers begin to try and flesh out the character's motivations and backstory. We get some odd self-aware meta-commentary about how our protagonist's backstory is cliche, yet that is quickly ignored in favor of his backstory becoming the sole reason he is over-powered and capable of being stronger than most, even if they themselves have the same powers he does. \\n\\n\r\nMumei, while not too interesting character-wise, devolves into a plot-point and a visual metaphor for our protagonist's life. The worst part is the show is hardly subtle about any of this, and in typical anime fashion everything is nauseatingly exposited to the audience. Cheap writing gimmicks such as brain-washing are exploited to further dehumanize Mumei and simply create a an object of affection, rather than a character. This brings me back to a lot of initial complaints I've had about anime, whether it be the over-idolization and inherent dehumanization of females to obnoxious power-fantasies that apparently need to be shoehorned into every pore of the show.\\n\\n\r\nRegardless of this show's R-rating, it is obviously aimed at a younger audience, much like most shounen anime. There is blood, but nothing really graphic is shown. There are limbs being chopped off, but none of that feels gory in the slightest. The marketing to an audience that wants to power-trip through this escapist entertainment is what drags this entire show's second half down. \\n\\n\r\nWhile yes, the nonsensical and completely illogical characters, and therefore story, are definitely elements of that derailment. I will say that the part that frustrated me the most was the blatant power fantasy bullshit. A bad ass character reverts into nothing but a crying nothing, while our big, burly, cool protagonist whisks here away and saves her. Hell, the entire second half's story is just two men fighting over this poor girl. \\n\\n\r\nThis disappointing shift of focus is what ultimately causes this show to be woefully below-average as a piece of entertainment, even if the visuals are truly something magnificent. I don't think visuals in and of themselves are enough to excuse offensively annoying entertainment that I will not support or recommend. The second this kind of anime drifts away from using females for nothing but marketing and idolization is the second the medium improves from a character perspective. An entirely one-dimensional sex meant to only look good and occasionally get to do something isn't offensive to me as a human, no, it is offensive to me as someone who values characterization and entertainment through characterization. These kinds of purely market-driven elements are what plague bad character writing, which in turn plagues the medium overall. One-dimensional females also end up dragging down male characters that are potentially not one-dimensional. It's their character relationships that end up being completely ruined and destroy any suspense of disbelief I was trying to develop. \\n\\n\r\nI'm left high and dry with these elements that don't appeal to me whatsoever. I don't watch these kinds of shows for escapism or for a power fantasy. I don't watch any show for that. It comes off as overly-focused on marketing to an audience rather than just crafting an engaging story and setting. Which is disappointing, because the first half was generally as fun as a simplistic action television anime can be. The rushed storytelling could've been looked past, however, the tedious and myopic story that struggles to balance any kind of engaging thematic elements and interesting character drama weigh Kabaneri down. \\n\\n\r\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________________\\n\\n\r\n[Conclusion] \\n\\n\r\nThe show is undoubtedly beautiful. The unique use of post-effect makeup as well as lavish character design elevate it to something memorable. At least at first. The characters introduced, while nothing original, provide enough to understand the story and believe in the setting. However, much like Attack on Titan and a lot of other Shounen, Kabaneri elevates the stakes much too quickly and it becomes a clusterfuck of incomprehensible power levels and incomprehensible motivations. \\n\\n\r\nIn the second half, certain characters are stripped down to their bare essentials, becoming nothing but objects of affection that the main character must save. It is disheartening to see yet another power-fantasy show in a field of power-fantasy shows. It comes off as formulaic and completely devoid of human attachment, like something skating along an assembly line. However, the standout visuals make me think otherwise. This interesting dichotomy is why I can't fully hate a show like this.\\n\\n\r\nIt is undoubtedly below-average once the second half is weighed against the above-average first, although, I won't say that it is wholly bad. I think that for someone who enjoys this kind of entertainment it can be pretty great viewing, especially with the visuals. For me, however, it is too blunt, immature, and simplistic in its morality and story. It loses itself in its thematic elements and crafts a piece of work that is completely devoid of any kind of attachment. Like a beautiful stone, this show is pretty to look at but cold to touch.",

            "content": "So whilst we're waiting for the Attack on Titan sequel to appease the fanboys, let's look at what Araki is making whilst waiting for the manga to pick up steam. Kabaneri of the Iron Fortress, an original anime where the Guilty Crown team decide to move on from ripping off Code Geass to ripping off Wit Studio's first big hit - which is okay with Wit Studio as long as they're the ones producing it. And why wouldn't they? The majority of their resume pretty much consists of ripping off Attack on Titan as is, so they might as well trade in the Vertical ManeuveringEquipment for trains and the giant titans for video game zombies if it means turning up a profit. It's a pity they also ripped off that show's low-budget moments as well. Given how long it took for this show to come out, I expected some less noticeable outsourcing.\\n\\n\r\nI think I've said this before, but I'd say it again anyways: Kabaneri of the Iron Fortress - and Wit Studio's action stuff in general - is the kind of shonen action show that anime should be producing all the time. When I watch a show about people bashing other people's faces in and forming manly bonds with either male or female, I don't want something that's completely self-aware of its stupidity and plays that aspect up with their super moves and their idiotic one-liners like an insecure child who spends thousands of hours on Nether Realms' fighting games. I want them to take the stupidity completely seriously and just run with it, like with Hot Shots or every video game Hideo Kojima has ever made. Nothing says camp more than the most ludicrous of shit being treated like we're in the setting of Apocalypse Now, and it's that kind of self-seriousness that made Guilty Crown one of the best anime of the last decade, whilst every other anime comedy pretty much failed by the first three seconds.\\n\\n\r\nAnd believe me, you can easily tell it's the same team without looking it up, because Kabaneri shares alot of plot points from its predecessor. You've got bullshit religious symbolism that's mostly just there to be cool, just like Guilty Crown. You've got a main final antagonist whose motivations make about as much sense as the existence of Pepsi, just like Guilty Crown. You've got a protagonist who powers himself up into something inhuman, but said power doesn't cure his complete stupidity, just like Guilty Crown. And if anyone bothered to explain where this mysterious virus that created the Kabane came from, they'd probably just say \"outer space\", exactly like Guilty Crown did.\\n\\n\r\nHaving said that, Kabaneri doesn't really have much of a story to give it the same kind of momentum its predecessor had. There's not much to say about the plot besides \"group of individuals trying to survive zombie apocalypse on a train\" and most of the conflict comes from compromises regarding what's necessary in order to survive, which all gets resolved relatively cleanly for the most part. The majority of the characters are fun and interesting enough, but they're mostly there to be support to the show's two main half-human/half-zombie leads: a young angry science nerd named Ikoma and a little badass, yet emotional girl named Mumei. And even then, the former mostly exists either to support the latter or just be a fighting nerd, only really coming into his own as a character in the last arc when he's confronted with an antagonist who can actually speak the human language. Or at least I assume that's what Biba speaks, even though I had about as much trouble understanding him as everyone else did.\\n\\n\r\nWithout that sort of momentum, Kabaneri's cheesiness can be more cringeworthy than hilarious at times. One moment in particular that comes to my mind is Mumei's un-ironic desire to eat rice after the Kabane virus disappears from the Earth that persists all the way to the end of the show when she makes it, and Ikoma's own goal to help Mumei get that desire. Oh yeah, I should point out that even when he comes into his own as a character, Ikoma's existence and drive is pretty much entirely dependent on helping out the female lead. Again, just like Guilty Crown. Mumei isn't exactly Inori, but only to the same degree that Ikoma isn't exactly Shu. A large part of her character arc involves learning to depend on others whilst also breaking her bond with the person she grew up depending on, so you're pretty much looking at the wrong show when it comes to particularly strong characterizations, especially since Kabaneri's execution of its tale is mostly straightforward.\\n\\n\r\nBut hey, how about those production values? Well the animation gets progressively worse over time, but Wit delivers in terms of pleasing the eyes for the most part, and manages to keep the quality when it actually matters. The action is generally good and they get so many points for relying on strategy, not speaking when that gets thrown away for being \"badass\", and keeping the fights short and sweet that they'd have to turn everyone in stick figures before I start marking that down. I'm a little disappointed that almost all the fights are against zombies who can't speak, as they don't exactly make for the most charismatic of villains, but at least they're a genuine threat so there's some actual tension when people fight them. The super zombies kind of push it a little in terms of threat credibility, but the bullshit religious metaphors associated with the creation of one makes it hard to really mark them down because I'm too busy chuckling at how much effort the writers are putting into making me take them seriously.\\n\\n\r\nMy conclusion is that in terms of action anime, you can do a whole lot worse than Kabaneri of the Iron Fortress, but you won't get much better in terms of the Spring 2016 season overall - if only because almost everything else this season has self-awareness issues up the butt. It's accessible to both anime nerds and casual audiences and delivers on all the basics without really excelling in anything. Not something I'd call popcorn, but nothing I'd revisit anywhere down the line. Having said that, I hope this team plans to make more of the show sometime in the near future because it pretty much ends on a \"let's continue our journey\" sort of way and the characters are about as close to solving the zombie problem as I am in getting the Republicans to admit that global warming exists. I know a lot of people are down on the last arc, but I thought it could have been worse. That statement isn't exactly something Crunchyroll is going to quote on its DVD box, but overall I think there's quite a bit more you can do with this setting and I'm definitely looking forward to seeing how that pans out. Like maybe in the second season, the Kotetsujo crew run into a bunch of Nazi zombies and Ikoma becomes their Fuhrer, leading them into ransacking an evil dictatorship as expendable fodder. Basically the facist arc in Guilty Crown by way of Empire of Corpses.",

Japanese shogun steampunk walls trains fire-zombies and just cool shit. As Digibro put it - rule of cool wins out and the art is mucho bueno.\r\nSound: Okay, so it's kind of odd with it's -selection- of sound here and there, like in some scenes it's like \"really, you chose this song for THIS moment? did someone just tell you \"something happy happens here so insert X\" and you didn't really even watch it beforehand? In some places it would have been better off with no music just to make somemoments more impact but hey, it's not terrible and the pieces themselves are actually pretty wonderful (sparing the opening as it gets old quick)\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: While some people say that they're bland or w/e, I found them much more relatable than their AoT-esque counterparts sparing mumei. In particular Ikoma's mix of being badass and weak really shines through. Although the \"I VOW TO PLUG MY COLON FOR HUMANITY\" really seems out of place, lame, and a filler from (you guessed it) AoT.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Sit back, enjoy the flashy colors and AMAZING animation and design, ignore some of the nonsensical shit and you've got a 10/10 experience - of course this is subjective but what fucking isn't.

            "content": "It is easy to compare this show to Attack on Titan (AoT), seeing as Kabaneri was made by the exact same team and was only made to fill the time between the first and second season of AoT. However, I personally think this show is atleast on par with AoT, as it took the premise and made it its own.\r\nStory: 6\r\nThe story begins by introducing Ikoma, a mechanic living in a steampunk dystopia where a kind of zombie virus took over the world- or, well, atleast Japan judging by the opening. These zombies, the Kabane, are a quite original breed of zombies, changing the humanbody into a much stronger version. The only way to kill them is by piercing their hearts, which are protected by a layer of iron. Luckily a gigantic fortress protects him and his friends from the outside threat that is the Kabane. Massive trains are their main way of transport, which allows them to travel to other fortresses around the country. Eventually Ikoma meets Mumei, a young girl traveling in one of these trains. They briefly talk right after Ikoma was put in jail, untill an explosion interupts them. The main gate was breached and the Kabane are forcing their way in, killing everything that is alive in the process. Luckily Ikoma had thought of a way to finish his steamgun and actually manages to kill a Kabane with it. However, he was bitten and like any other zombie virus it is trying to take over his brain. He manages to stop the blood flow to his head by choking himself and he manages to stop it from reaching his brain, giving him a much stronger body in the process. He manages to reach the train which Mumei arrived with and he escapes together with Mumei and a group of villagers by train. The rest of the story is pretty straight forward: Ikoma and the rest need to survive in this world and all the things you'd expect from this world will appear. \\n\\n\r\nPersonally, I just love the setting which the creators made. Being a fan of zombie films and series, I couldn't help but think the Kabane were great enemies. They are the natural enemy of humanity. A predator only seeking to end the human race. They're very durable, making it next to impossible to take one out without being able to penetrate their hearts. There wasn't much story really, just characters and their struggles.\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9\\n\r\nOfcourse it is good. I didn't expect anything less from the creators of Attack on Titan and they definitely did not let me down. They've done a great job making the Kabane threatening and character designs were honestly pretty good.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10\\n\r\nOutstanding. It really complimented all of the scenes and I like every opening and ending sequence just as well. Ninelie is, in my opinion, the best ending of any anime in 2016 of which I've seen so far.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 7\\n\r\nThere are good characters and bad characters. Most of the main cast were actually written very well, and their backstories really fleshed them out and character development were realistic and I got attached to them. I liked that they used a lead driven by revenge, but he was actually smart as well. He understands the enemy and he has done his research before everything went down so he could, for example, restrain the virus after the bite.\\n\\n\r\nMumei is my favourite, introduced as a badass killing every Kabane in her way. But she's shown that she is as reckless as her strength, because of her backstory which you will ofcourse find out along the way.\\n\\n\r\nSadly, there is a character which ruins quite a bit of the show. The one who made Mumei the way she is now. Biba, one of the infamous liberators who take back fortresses infested by Kabane. However, he isn't what he seems to be. The creators of the show took him a bit too seriously and the writing got kind of bad when they introduced this guy. He is supposed to be a intelligent and charismatic man who is also cunning. However, I think that he lacks all of those qualities and it is more due to stupidity of others that he can do the things he does. You'll see.\\n\\n\r\nI included the Kabane in here as well, but I've already talked about them enough.\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8\\n\r\nI really enjoyed this show. It is pretty straight forward and has a lot of great action scenes. Kabaneri doesn't need an intricate plot to make things enjoyable and the tempo of the show was very good because it didn't feel rushed or slow at all. A lot happened in every episode, but not too much and it respected the viewer because it didn't feel the need to explain every little thing.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8\\n\r\n(6+9+10+7+8)/5=8. Easy, ainit?\\n\\n\r\nAgain, it is easy to compare it to AoT, but I feel a lot of people are biased because of this by calling it a cheap ripoff. Just because it took elements from AoT doesn't mean it is bad. AoT took a lot of elements from other shows too, like any other show really. I mean, a wall surrounding a city? Do you think AoT was the first to do this? It's not like there were walls surrounding castles in the middle ages, right? Wrong. It's not a unique concept limited to AoT, so stop bashing Kabaneri because they rightfully used a wall (walls are known to keep things out, which was their goal: keeping things out). Both anime are good in their own way so try to keep an open mind when you start watching this show.",

And 'Kabaneri of The Iron Fortress' is really worth to watch.\r\nI might say it is a great anime, not up to my masterpiece score but it is pretty thrilling and I ended up watching the whole episode in one day (it is that good for me).\r\nWatching this isn't that exhausting like when I watch Kill la Kill (with that extensive animation) or watching Hyouka or Bakemonogatari (with those extensive screenwriting) but I wouldn't say itis a light anime as well, in fact it is quite heavy in that regard.\\n\\n\r\nIt might be the reason people putting up low score reviews (I said reviews because in overall rating it is almost reach 8.0 which is way above average). The story theme quite..hmm..how to say it..its quite general survival anime. It is on the line with anime such as 'Shingeki no Kyoujin'...'High School School of The Dead'..hmm..what else...maybe with a bit influence of that western movie \"Snowpiercer\"..yeah I think combination of that 3 is this anime. \\n\\n\r\nI really like the heroine (Mumei). Her costumes, combat animation, as well as her cool but energetic atmosphere she bring in the anime. \\n\\n\r\nWell...since I have said that 'Koutetsujou no Kabaneri' resemblance a lot from that 3 movie I mentioned above, most of the detail and character are pretty the combination of them. The villain while not strong enough in terms of purpose and the way he executing his evil plan (unlike General Zod from Superman Man of Steel, one of those villain I like to watch).\\n\\n\r\nOne of the regret from this anime is that the story and the climax seems too rushed and the anticlimax/the ending not long enough to actually cool you down from the heat of the final battle.\\n\\n\r\nMakes me wonder for 2nd season...\\n\r\nAnd I can't wait if it does have 2nd season..\\n\r\nTanoshimi desu! :)\\n\\n",

            "content": "NOTE: This review CONTAINS SPOILERS!\r\nSTORY (8/10): With an anime like Koutetsujou No Kabaneri\u2026 it definitely contains a lot of action and drama. We get to explore the journey that the community of Aragane (led by Princess Ayame) to find a safe place away from harm. The storylines lets us get to know some of the characters along the way and sees a small glimpse of their past. There is also cliffhangers that makes us question their fate each time if anything bad happens to them. There are also some moments (especially in the beginning) that really makes you upset. (Trust me, it has happened alot\u2026)\\n\\n\r\n**SIDE NOTE: (FYI: Kabanes are a different type of zombies that can fight back in a more hostile manner. They kind of have \"some consciousness\" in their mind (ironically) & their main goal is to destroy everyone in their own path). \\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS (8/10): Both of the main characters are Kabaneri.\\n\r\n-Ikoma is an inventor/engineer who is intelligent, passionate & determined. Since the beginning of the series, Ikoma's goal is to get rid of Kabanes in world and restore humanity. There are some moments where he is scared, but he has started to gain confidence along the way (thanks to everyone on the train who believes in him).\\n\r\n-Mumei is a small mysterious & confident girl who can be sometimes cocky. She is very strong and powerful. Mumei is able to take on hundreds of Kabanes before she has reach to her boiling point. Deep down, we can see that she does care for others and want to save humankind.\\n\r\n-Ayame was the princess of Aragane Station until her father's death. Now Ayame is the Empress (technically) who is incharge of everyone in the train. Plus, she's also an archer! :D She's caring, mature & very strong. (Luckily, she's still human in the series and hasn't been biten yet).\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL ENJOYMENT (8/10): Great anime! This anime also reminds me of ATTACK ON TITANS due to their similarities made by the same creator. As I said previously, never dull a moment when we see the main characters continuing their efforts of fighting evil. I always wondered\u2026 In a world where Attack on Titan & Koutetsujou no Kabaneri were to have a crossover\u2026 which monster will win -- Titans or Kabanes? When it comes to this anime\u2026 I tend to cringe a lot because humanity is panicking way too much and people are betraying their love ones during their time of crisis. In the end, if you love great fighting scenes and sense of adventure -- I definitely recommend this one to watch! \u2665",

            "content": "What can we say about Kabaneri and the Iron Fortress? Well it definitely is ironic that it starts all guns blazing before grinding to a halt due various limitations; these included undeveloped characters, an incoherent storyline and the fact that the show had been congested to 12 episodes helped alleviate these issues. \r\nWhilst the show has been criticised heavily on MAL, I firmly believe it is greatly exaggerated and the positives of the show does indeed outweigh the negatives. It was voted the second best rated show in a 2016 survey in Japan and can be thoroughly enjoyable if you just let the spectacle unfold.\r\nAswith every review, I try to limit it to 500 words. Short but sweet as per say. \\n\\n\r\nLet\u2019s start with the positives:\\n\\n\r\nSound (10/10)\\n\\n\r\nI am going to go out of my way and say that this is one of the best soundtracks I have heard in a while, not just for anime but even movies. Hiroyuki Sawano composing managed to add so much to each battle scene spectacle and really give you those goosebumps. \\n\r\nThe stand out being KABANERIOFTHEIRONFORTRESS (Featuring Eliana), this can be heard here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q5dB09YdVMM\\n\\n\r\nThe whole OST can be found here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_D6evVTZFg\\n\\n\r\nFurthermore, this is further complimented by Egoist's opening KABANERI OF THE IRON FORTRESS (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYTTDecPO7I) and Aimer x Chelly\u2019s ending Ninelie (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q5dB09YdVMM) which quite simply put are outstanding. \\n\r\nWithout a doubt the soundtrack is one of the saving graces of the show; this should definitely not be understated.\\n\\n\r\nART/ANIMATION (8/10)\\n\\n\r\nFrom a general perspective the art has received criticism from the minorities for its unique style and outlook on rural Japan. Personally I enjoyed how Wit Studio put incredible amount of passion and detail into the show. The Kabane are frightening, each settlement has its unique design and each character has been drawn and animated excellently. It\u2019s consistent throughout and the fight choreography should be applauded, what more could be expected from the director Araki Tetsurou (High School of the Dead, Attack on Titan, Guilty Crown) who excels in this department.\\n\\n\r\nNow for the sad part, the bad:\\n\\n\r\nSTORY/CHARACTERS (6/10)\\n\\n\r\nAssuming this show does not have a second season, without going into spoiler territory it felt like none of our questions were really answered by the end of the season. Without being too harsh it felt like Wit ran out of running time to give us a proper ending within 12 episodes. The story itself feels rushed (I am looking at your episode 9 and 11) and various characters are extremely underdeveloped. Especially the main villain who literally sweeps in like a hurricane, smashes everything and then gives the vaguest explanation for his actions. As well as this character\u2019s decisions are beyond stupid, superlatives cannot be used to describe how they came to these conclusions. \\n\r\nHowever, I enjoyed the dynamics between Ikuma, Mumei and the fellow supporting characters. It was an interesting dynamic which really made you care for the characters and their interactions. Mumei has got a lot of criticism from people, but she\u2019s 12 and is likely still as gullible as they come. Obviously these dynamics come crashing down once the main villain is introduced (episode 7), meaning appreciate it whilst it lasts.\\n\\n\r\nOverall (8/10)\\n\\n\r\nSome final thoughts,\\n\\n\r\nI really hope for a second season, the story to me feels incomplete, and could really add to the overall depth and quality of this show. Guess we will have to wait and see.\\n\\n\r\nWord Count (473/500)\\n",

            "content": "****************************************************\r\nThis review contains minor spoilers\r\n****************************************************\r\nBut before that, let us take a moment to learn about human psychology;\r\nimagine you're a regular citizen (as most of you probably are), in restaurant for example, when suddenly a well-known, insane terrorist comes in, with an AK and grenades and a machete, all scary and stuff.\r\nThe question is; what do you do?\r\nA) You hide somewhere, frightened?\r\nB) You faint?\r\nC) Maybe you cry and beg for your life?\r\nWell, according to this anime, you may;\r\nA) throw an empty can at said insane terrorist\r\nB) you charge in, shouting, with a butterknife\r\nC) you start insulting said insane terrorist.\r\nSanity is a stranger to this show.\r\nIn theworld of Koutetsujou no Kabaneri, where super-zombies known as Kabane forced humans to withdraw behind walls, we follow MC-kun, Jesus reborn, doing whatever he damn pleases, along with the most gullible 12 years old kiddie who happens to be an exterminator, the kind hearted princess, the loyal (and ignorant) bodyguard of said princess, and a bunch of forgettable characters.\\n\r\nIn this show, being a forgettable character is most definitely a plus.\\n\\n\r\n\"Kabane\" is what the zombies of the show are called, while the \"Kabaneri\" are \"half-turned zombies\" who retrained their personalities, their humanity, while gained immunity to zombie bites, super strength, speed and durability, high pain threshold and the ability to sense zombies.\\n\r\nHere comes the human psychology of the show;\\n\r\nupon realizing that \"some aren't exactly human\", but super-strong Kabaneri, they begin to hate.\\n\\n\r\nFearing the unknown is definitely not bad. Keeping a distance from possibly dangerous elements, or detaining them is not bad. Hating them is not necessarily bad either.\\n\\n\r\nStill, they would stand as good a chance as you, charging the previously mentioned insane terrorist with a butterknife, naked and shouting. That is, none whatsoever.\\n\r\nBut make no mistake, agitating and taunting a terrorist isn't a good idea either, something characters of the show couldn't comprehend even if you were to shove it down their throats.\\n\\n\r\nNow it would have been a horrid experience watching it, even if these \"demihumans\" were actually the bad guys,\\n\r\nhowever, they were not.\\n\r\nIn fact they saved the worthless lives of these mindless imbeciles, not once, killing dozens if not hundreds of the (clearly evil) zombies in the meanwhile, proving their affinity and their superior physique, reasons NOT to screw with them.\\n\r\nYet for a good while, those peasants did continue to taunt them, cuss at them, threaten them, and despite seeing their far superior speed, strength and durability, they even attacked them.\\n\r\nIt's as if they were doing their very best to get themselves killed.\\n\\n\r\nIndeed, part of the weak and forced melodrama is about the people who just can't, for the love of god, make the difference between a decaying, goaning, bloodthirsty zombie with the intelligence that of a mentally challenged snail,\\n\r\nand a talking, reasoning (demi)human being, who, again, saved them multiple times.\\n\\n\r\nOh yes, sanity is a stranger to this show, and this is just one example out of so many.\\n\\n\r\nAside from the obviously unreal human behaviour which demolished all my hopes for the show in the matter of (~20) minutes, the show didn't really excel at anything else either.\\n\r\nZombies have their hearts enclosed in some hard material, to kill them, you have to pierce it with brute force! Luckily, we have exterminator girl and Jesus reborn to do the thing!\\n\r\n...Or any other regular citizen could just destroy/chop off the zombies' squishy heads, which seemingly has the very same effect. However, this topic is avoided like pest. Design of the threat is mediocre at best.\\n\r\nThe \"virus\" that turns humans into zombies in minutes (except when it takes days because you know, \"plot\") we know nothing about, except that if you strangle yourself, you avoid the virus spreading to the brain, and so you retrain your humanity. That it wouldn't work in reality is one thing, how you don't have to strangle yourself continually, but only for a few seconds until the virus just \"gives up\" on infecting your brain, that's a bit more pressing issue. Idea of the cause is just bad.\\n\r\nIt could've saved the lives of a great number of people, and yet again, this miraculous(ly idiotic) solution is *never* discussed again. Ever.\\n\r\nIndeed, it's not \"chance\" or \"fate\" that turns people, \"chosen ones\" into super-humans, nothing that clich\u00e9. Instead it is plain idiocy.\\n\\n\r\nAs for characters...\\n\r\nCharacters were clich\u00e9 with the depth of a teaspoon; MC-kun with his sad backstory, wanting peace, equality, to save and protect everyone, Miss Exterminator, extremely gullible and stubborn to no end, Mr. knight-on-a-white-horse with his outstanding arrogance and ignorance, wanting to protect the princess first and foremost, who (the princess) is a weak willed but kind and (supposedly) beautiful young girl and nothing more, contributing nothing to the story. Clich\u00e9 asF if you ask me, which is NOT necessarily bad, but nothing new, and certainly nothing praiseworthy either.\\n\r\nStill, combining these already dull and overused characteristics with unquantifiable  amounts of idiocy makes them rather unbearable.\\n\\n\r\nDuring the 2nd half of the show, we are introduced to another gang and \"the bad guy\" too, a clinically insane psychopath with god complex, with a large number of similarly brain-dead followers, at which point the anime introduces a crappy revenge story to the already painful survival story, making it worse than it was.\\n\\n\r\nDialogues were cringy. Enough said.\\n\\n\r\nThere are two upsides I can name, none of which I care much about, so take it with a grain of salt:\\n\\n\r\nAs for Audio, character voices I found average for the most part. Some befitting their characters, others not so much, some rather monotone, while others had a decent amount of variety.\\n\r\nOther sounds (aside from music) such as the goan of zombies, I found to be good.\\n\r\nMusic that I managed to perceive between two mental breakdowns were fitting for the most part, only occasionally I found them to be out of place.\\n\\n\r\nAs for visuals, I liked the Steampunk setting, disliked the traditional Japanese touch to it.\\n\r\nStill, it was detailed and nice, the animations were more often drawn by hand and were well choreographed and fluid. CG was used for the trains and the spoilers I'll not share, but was done better than average, better than expected, I found it to be acceptable/good.\\n\\n\r\nOP/ED;\\n\r\nskipped them as always. Couldn't care less.\\n\\n\r\nStory additions; nothing. A story doesn't need a thorough explanation, a prologue nor an epilogue, yet having some information on the hows and whys is never a bad thing, while sometimes having no information whatsoever is.\\n\r\nHere we know next to nothing about the background of their world. When and how the zombies came to be, when, how and who built the railroads, trains and walled cities, nothing. Not even characters speculating. Laziness or lack of imagination, I don't know.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment; I don't care about visuals or audio. No matter how horrible, or horribly good it is, it most likely won't change the way I experience the show.\\n\r\nSimply because what I care about is a good story, reasonable characters with reasonable motives and goals, with realistic interactions, a logical plot/events etcetera, etcetera.\\n\r\nFor me, there was no enjoyment, only curiosity kept me going, and the ability to skip scenes I couldn't bear watching.",

The zombies are actually terrifying and the impact that they have on the world is presented throughout the show. Kabanero is an entertaining show with some beautiful animation; absolutely the best part of the show. The music was appropriate and but overall forgettable. The main character started off really strong with a generic backstory but a really strong sense of character. The supporting cast is filled with a bunch of essentially useless characters but this shows best girl truly earns that role. Inthe end, Habanero pepper was an okay show that i'd recommend to all who enjoy action, zombies, or steampunk.",

            "content": "Quick Review (No spoilers)\r\n I read a couple of other reviews saying this was the most unoriginal thing ever, claiming it was a ripoff of attack on titan and parasyte -the maxim-, which compelled me to write this review. Don't let those reviews dissuade you from giving this anime a shot. Kabaner is anything but lacking originality, and the animation and soundtrack are both some of the best, if not the best I have seen from a TV series. It easily matched the beauty of a Ghibli film, while harboring a bit darker of a plot. The characters were the weakest aspect for lack ofdepth, but for a 12 episode anime it was on par. Overall for the sake of the review I give it an 8, but to me personally its an easy 9 or 10.\\n\\n\r\nFull Review (Minor spoilers)\\n\\n\r\n At it's heart Kabaneri is about a group of people traveling together, overcoming their downfalls, fighting for survival, and learning to accept indifference. If you're looking for an adventurous anime with some emotional moments packed in for the ride, Kabaneri may be just for you. The artwork and soundtrack both leave nothing to be desired, with a suspenseful plot that constantly evolves. The characters could of used a bit more depth, but given the amount of episodes it was far from lacking, providing enough to relate to the characters emotions.\\n\\n\r\n The action is pretty frequent, and while it isn't something on the level of a dragon ball z/Naruto style fight, it is no doubt entertaining and incredibly well animated.\\n\\n\r\n The characters are on par with what you would expect for an anime this short. The most relevant characters who get the most screen time are fairly well developed, with some insight into their pasts. I found myself emotionally invested in multiple characters, namely the two main protagonists Ikoma and Mumei, but some side characters as well.\\n\\n\r\n The plot is fairly fast paced, with the earlier episodes often presenting and resolving minor tribulations within the single episode, as it works towards the final episodes confronting the main plot.\\n\\n\r\n The only element of the show that had negative appeal to me was the \"steampunk\" themes, namely in the clothing and characters visual designs (ikome post kabaneri transformation) however it was far from enough to ruin what was an incredible story for me. \\n\\n\r\n On to the claims of unoriginality, it is referenced by some as an attack on titan/parasyte knock off, because both deal with humanity's struggle to survive against a new species above them on the food chain, and both have a protagonist who attain the power of said species. While that particular theme of the show may be similar, the plot is very unique in it's entirety, and to call it a knock off on that alone is far from accurate. Attack on titan (which I love, incase this comes across otherwise) and parasyte (Havn't finished) are hardly the first stories of humanity fighting against extinction. Do NOT let these claims persuade from giving this masterpiece an unbiased watch.",

However, there are some important differences.\r\nThe \"creatures\" are just humans infected that become cannibalistic killing machines. The humans do fight against these mutants, but there is a train aspect added -- fighting on trains, using trains to ferry humans between cities, etc. The music, again Hiroyuki Sawano, is awesome as usual, and the art (Wit Studio), like that for Owari no Seraph, is bloody brilliant. The protagonist, Ikoma, is a young steamsmith who just wants to fight against these Kabaneri, and isassisted by friends and a mysterious girl with amazing fighting prowess. Like Attack on Titan, the situation seems bleak, but hope yet rises through the darkness. Can they ever hope to defeat the Kabaneri for good, and to return to a peaceful world where one can eat rice? Quite short, only 12 episodes, but again, these anime creators can stack a lot into one episode and so lots of things happen in 12 episodes. An exhilarating way to spend two or three days, it is.",

            "content": "(This is a spoiler-free review adapted for this site)\r\n[Synopsis]:  Twenty years ago, the Kabane inexplicably appeared \u2013 undead, humanoid monsters possessing an infectious bite and an iron cage around their hearts. Their aggressive and resilient nature quickly pushed humanity to the brink, forcing them to flee behind the walls of fortress-esque stations connected by a network of rails and ironclad locomotives. When the walls of Aragane station are breached by an out of control train and it is overrun by Kabane, a young engineer named Ikoma (Hatanaka Tasuku) is forced to fight for his life and has a chance encounter with Mumei (Senbongi Sayaka),a girl who is neither Kabane nor entirely human.\\n\\n\r\n[Characters]:\\n\\n\r\nPerhaps Kabaneri\u2019s most overwhelming weakness was its frustrating cast of characters and their individual characterization. Though there are a handful of outlying characters that are introduced later in the show, Kabaneri focuses primarily upon the crew of the Koutetsujou \u2013 the titular, armored train that hails from the Aragane station. There are several characters of at least some import within the crew however whatever convictions or goals they have are ultimately pretty dismissible due to plot revolving so heavily around the Kabaneri Ikoma and Mumei.\\n\\n\r\nIkoma is quite a mixed bag in that, he possesses a number of traits that feel over-typical of  a protagonist such as his stereotypical revenge story and never-back-down personality however he also exhibits a few refreshing characteristics. His guilt ridden conscience in both abandoning his sister to the Kabane years ago as well as his station\u2019s abandonment of other people speaks well to his initial cynicism and underlying anger. These traits back up his otherwise conventional quality of facing his problems head on and at least gives the viewer something to chew on when the story starts out. Unfortunately for Ikoma, whatever interesting ideologies or quirks he at first possesses are quickly forgotten for the most part as the show blunders forward and he receives very little in terms of meaningful development.\\n\\n\r\nMumei is a different story altogether and has her own unique set of problems. Kabaneri attempts to establish her as a young and arrogant girl who slowly, over the course of her journey, opens up to others however this is executed rather ineffectively. Her propensity for changing her personality from scene to scene makes her feel very inconsistent as she switches constantly from impulsive to sincere to uncooperative. Mumei at her core represents what is probably the biggest singular issue within the cast which is their staggering lack of communication. Many issues that arise within the plot are almost solely to blame on Mumei\u2019s own failure to communicate either what she is doing or what important information she knows. This results in the many dilemmas and developments born out of this miscommunication to feel frustrating and avoidable and many of the cast members are guilty of this beyond Mumei. People act how they want when they want and fail to convey themselves properly despite being contextualized as intelligent people.\\n\\n\r\nThe rest of the cast doesn\u2019t offer much in order to make up for Kabaneri\u2019s lackluster protagonists. The show initially paints the elders and nobility of the Aragane station as hardheaded and superstitious in order to develop an \u2018Us versus Them\u2019 scenario where we can more easily sympathize with Ikoma\u2019s plight. This leaves them feeling one-dimensional and unhelpful before they eventually fade into the show\u2019s backdrop. The antagonist is similarly problematic in that, though his reasons and goals have some legitimacy about them, Kabaneri does a horrific job in conveying what they are to the viewer and he ultimately appears cartoonishly evil in how he behaves \u2013 manipulating children and scheming genocide.\\n\\n\r\n[Art/Animation]:\\n\\n\r\nWith the advent of Kabaneri, the show marks Wit Studio\u2019s third stab at the post-apocalyptic monster story after Shingeki no Kyojin and Owari no Seraph. Given the studio\u2019s familiarity with the premise, especially of the former, Kabaneri\u2019s visuals are its singular worthwhile attribute. The first episode does well in exhibiting the kind of steampunk atmosphere and art style used by the show and with a couple flashy action sequences, promises impressive quality going forward. What\u2019s more is that the quality is pretty consistent and between the feudal, steampunk environment and the action animation, the show is visually pretty entertaining to watch.\\n\\n\r\n[Story]:\\n\\n\r\nWere it not for Kabaneri\u2019s generally frustrating cast and lack of compelling characters, the story would certainly represent its biggest issue. After their station is overrun with Kabane, Ikoma and Mumei as well as the remaining nobility and the rest of its residents flee on the Koutetsujou in hopes of making it safely to another station. Though its first episode is rather exciting and compelling, the plot slows to a crawl and stagnates significantly afterwards. Kabaneri doesn\u2019t visit more than 3 or 4 locations and despite the constant action and conflict the show itself is rather uneventful. Combine this with the show\u2019s other issues of poorly implemented plot devices, a generally predicable progression of events, plot contrivances, and a cast full of infuriating characters and the show as a whole becomes uninteresting and disappointing.\\n\\n\r\nThe Kabaneri \u2013 the half-human, half-Kabane hybrids capable of inhuman strength and speed are effectively the heart of the show as they are integral to the plot and an important trait of it\u2019s main characters. The way their abilities are executed however presents an additional problem for the show. The Kabane, outside of their zombie-esque ability to \u2018turn\u2019 other people, are defined by their resilience \u2013 to the point that Ikoma\u2019s development of a pressurized gun capable of punching through the iron cage surrounding their heart is a notable development and achievement.\\n\\n\r\nWhen Mumei is then shown capable of dispatching entire groups of them almost effortlessly it sacrifices some of the tension of the show in exchange for a cinematic experience. Ikoma often exhibits the Kabaneri\u2019s regenerative properties as well and as he pulls through each near-death experience, his and Mumei\u2019s own fortitude further weakens the show\u2019s tension.\\n\\n\r\nIn a similar way, the Kabane themselves too are characterized problematically. What is initially kind of a refreshing zombie design turns into something more as each episode reveals more and more features of the Kabane. As we learn more about them, what they are capable of grows steadily more and more outlandish and by the end of the show it is hard to say what the Kabane can and can\u2019t do. This uncertain characteristic makes them feel too flexible to the situation as if they would become capable of whatever the story wanted them to be or what ever would be most theatrically pleasing.\\n\\n\r\n[Music]:\\n\\n\r\nWhile the presence of Sawano Hiroyuki is typically reason-alone enough to pick up a show, his appearance here does very little to alleviate Kabaneri\u2019s problematic elements. While the soundtrack is exactly what you would expect out of him, it delivers only the most typical attributes of his style \u2013 many of the songs sounding completely indistinguishable from one another and collectively more akin to a continuous bridge than anything else. Barring the intermittent use of a few insert songs, the soundtrack was rather forgettable though fans of Sawano\u2019s music should enjoy it just fine.\\n\\n\r\n[Final Thoughts and Rating]: \\n\\n\r\nKabaneri is a visually exhilarating experience littered with poor writing and bad characters. The plot was slow to arrive at any interesting events, the cast was frustrating in how they conversed and dealt with one another, and the latter half of the show exacerbated the issues it had run into early on.\\n\\n\r\nRating: 4\\n\\n\r\nI gave Kabaneri a 4 because it suffered from numerous issues with its only beneficial trait being its flashy, visual presentation. The characters acted like idiots giving way to frustrating developments and foreseeable outcomes. The story was poorly written and involved far too many awkward plot contrivances to actually evoke any of the drama or tension it was aiming for.\\n\\n\r\n[Recommendations]:\\n\\n\r\nI would recommend Kabaneri primarily based upon its subject matter of post-apocalyptic human versus monster survival. It\u2019s quite similar to other shows that share a comparable premise to it and those that enjoyed those shows will likely be entertained by Kabaneri as well. While it leaves a lot to be desired in the writing and character departments, its a pretty decent action show if your aim is to sit back and enjoy the explosions.",

Almost right fromthe start, they set you up for a good story, and that's what was delivered. idk, maybe its just cause I'm not picky, but I really think you should give it a try yourself first, cause i honestly dont think it was nearly as bad as what others are making it out to be.

            "content": "I really want to consider this as two separate animes aptly title before Biba and after Biba. Lets gets the cat out of the bag, the anime is dog shit but its mainly because of one character called Biba who really had no place in this anime. \r\nThe first 6 episodes can be considered before Biba and it delivers solid popcorn flick fun. It aint gonna knock your socks off with deeply multi-faceted characters and an astounding story but it delivers solid action with amazing set-pieces and slick over the top animation. Logic is never a strong point of the series and there is alot of ass pull but hey its fun to see. The main focus of the story at this point is survival against an overwhelming enemy and humanity's ability to adapt and survive. \\n\\n\r\nThe final 6 episodes are sadly shit. This the after Biba arc and seriously.. just.. FUCK BIBA. The focus moves from Survival to routing revenge, cartoony bad guy trope.What little logic was there in the first few episodes is thrown just to add some flash to the animation. Suddenly its no longer teh zombies who are the threat but the humans themselves. All this understandably culminates in a final battle where unsurprisingly the bad guy dies but *gasp* he was really a good guy inside. Ass pull after ass pull. \\n\\n\r\nComing to the animation, it is solid and extremely well done. Amazing visuals really sell the devastation and generally the battle scenes are very, very smooth. I feel the earlier episodes did the animation slightly better especially scenes with Mumei zipping around killing the zombies. Later half though, the animation takes a hit. FUCK BIBA, he ruined the animation too.  \\n\\n\r\nMusic is straight up awesome. After watching the first episode, I decided to buy the OST. Thats how good its. You want some music in the backgroud to pump you up while you pwn some noobs while playing this is it. The main song called Kabaneri of the Iron fortress is especially amazing. The female vocals swell in the background and gets me super pumped up. Whether you watch the anime or not, listen to this awesome, awesome song. \\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nEpisodes 1-3: Before Biba, pretty much awesome.\\n\r\nEpisodes 4-6: Before Biba - cheesy scenes (Ayame cuting her hand on the top of the train and feeding Ikoma lol) and downright stupid ones (we have no food but we will enjoy firecrackers suure) but still bearable. \\n\r\nEpisodes 7-12: FUCK BIBA.\\n\\n\r\nI love movies like Transformers. I do not expect to be mind blown but entertained. Kabaneri is like the Transformers of anime. Check out your brain and try to not think too much and its a very enjoyable watch. It would have been better if there was no Biba. FUCK BIBA.",

There are many similiarities between this and attack on titan.\r\nSecond of all. Is it a copycat anime? No completely the opposite.\r\nthe characters are unique, at the very least the main character is. He is quite different from typical dumb anime characters or the over the top attack on titan main character.\r\nThis is a smart character. Which is evidenced by thefact that he singlehandedly managed to create ways for them to actually kill the kabaneri in a manner of days. All the inventiosn stemming from his steam nail gun that could penetrate them.\\n\r\nThis is a good character.\\n\r\nThe music in this anime is by far one the best i have ever heard. Which is obvious considering who made the music.  \\n\r\nThe art is very good, but i dont much care for art usually, however in this case it surpasses even that of the so loved attack on titan.\\n\\n\r\nDon't listen the negative reviews if they even for a moment compare seriously to attack on titan.\\n\r\nThis is a beast of its own. And it deserves to be watched. Its an anime that makes you cheer for their survival and makes you yell out at the stupidity and fear of the others.\\n\r\nFear is a big theme in this anime. And the way it handles it is great.\\n\r\nI recommend it whole heartedly to everyone, espeically people who did not like attack on titan.

            "content": "Koutetsujou no Kabaneri is a Wit Studio original production. The writing was handled by Okouchi Ichiro, who also worked on Code Geass, Shigofumi and the Brave Story film. Yeah, the quality of his work varies a lot. So, how does he do with this one? Let's take a look.\r\nStory:\r\nOur tale takes place in a steam punk world where a zombie-like infection is turning humans into monsters called Kabane. Survivors live in walled cities called stations and travel betwixt them using massive armoured trains. Our protagonist, Ikoma, is a scientist in Aragane station and he's trying to develop a new weapon that can better pierce thekabane's heart cage. We see the station authorities following the procedure to bring in a train. During the course of inspecting the people for bite marks, the guards become paranoid over one of the passengers. Ikoma steps in, earning himself a night in prison. That's when there's an accident with the second train and the station finds itself swarming with kabane. Can the people of the station escape to the train and get out of there alive?\\n\\n\r\nThat actually brings me to the first problem with the series. During the inspection of the first train, we see the procedure they go through and we see how paranoid these people are when it comes to the kabane. Then the second train comes and they immediately ignore those procedures which directly results in the station getting overrun. Basically, the story requires these people blatantly acting like idiots in order to get momentum. There's also the kabaneri, creatures that are part human and part kabane. We're told that males are rare, but we only see a few in the series and half of those are male. Furthermore, there's nothing about the way that they get manufactured that should favour women so there's no readily apparent reason behind the men being any rarer and they don't offer any explanation. Even something as simple as the X chromosome being more resistant to the process would have worked. That brings me to the third narrative issue I had with the series, the ending. I'll try not to spoil too much but the very basic issue here is that they set everything up for a bitter-sweet ending but they don't have the ovarian fortitude to follow through with it. The result is an ending that's safer but also trite and disappointing.\\n\\n\r\nWith all that being said, there are quite a few positive aspects to the series as well. The world building is strong, with a lot of detail going into the whole thing. I will also give the series full credit for taking the basic idea of zombies and using them in a unique and creative way. That's not easy to do, given how much they've been over-used in mass media. The narrative itself is also quite engaging and does a good job of keeping you invested, in spite of its few major missteps.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\\n\r\nThis is one of those series where the major characters are pretty well fleshed out and have complexity to them while the side characters vary. Some of the side characters have verisimilitude, in spite of us not spending much time with them. Others are pretty much there as fodder or stay on the sidelines just to be present in big scenes while not really contributing anything that you couldn't use any other random character for. I do quite like the stuff that explores Mumei's past and Ayame's whole arc of building herself up as a leader is nicely handled. Then we have the antagonist. He has motivation behind his actions, but they're also kind of flimsy. To be fair, a big part of that is just that there's not much time devoted to him. If the series had had one or two more episodes to flesh him out he might have been a really strong villain, albeit a bit bonkers.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\\n\r\nI'll give Wit Studio full credit on this one, the artwork looks really damn good. The backgrounds are nicely detailed, the character designs are fairly unique, the action sequences are strong. The various steam punk gadgets we see just look really interesting. It's basically what you'd expect from one of the studios who worked on Shingeki no Kyojin.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\\n\r\nThe acting is nicely done. We get strong performances from Senbongi Sayaka, Hatanaka Tasuku, Uchida Maaya & Masuda Toshiki. The side characters all get actors who are minimally competent although most of them do give performances that are pretty good.\\n\\n\r\nHo-yay:\\n\\n\r\nThere's not much. The dynamic between Mumei and Kajika comes across as a bit homo-erotic.\\n\\n\r\nFinal Thoughts:\\n\\n\r\nKoutetsujou no Kabaneri is a pretty decent series that could have been great. My final rating is going to be a 6/10. It has a lot of potential, but also some significant problems. If you like the idea of a steam punk world with a zombie infestation, consider trying it. Next week I'll look at something a bit lighter with Sansha Sanyou.",

            "content": "I am actually quite surprised by the discontent for the show and how many people just straight up didn't like this. Was it really that bad?\r\nI personally disagree. It was an original animation that helped quench a little of the thirst from not having Attack on Titan at the time. I mention AOT because I know there are obvious parallels, I mean same studio, but still, the slightly incompetent MC that becomes like the thing they are fighting, the OP female MC, the undead army that is on the verge of destroying humanity as we speak. \r\nIn truth, I think with KNK they took allthe best elements and amplified them to the fullest. The steampunk aesthetic present throughout was quite nice. It felt a little more realistic than some of the other sci-fi animes I've seen. \\n\\n\r\nThe story and character development went as planned, but it was still enjoyable. there is just something about seeing humans fight an army looking to end humanity that gets me every time. Also, the \"half-blood\" hero is theme I won't ever get tired of. Ikoma as the self-righteous hero is something we have seen before but I think it still works because we see how far he is willing to go, how far he has to fall, and how much he has to sacrifice to achieve the final goal. \\n\\n\r\nMumei is great all around. The heartless killer that grows to love life, how can you hate that? Her action scenes are amazing all around. Which speaks to the animation art of the show as a whole. The atmosphere really weighs well on the story and you can fell the darkness and despair. The fluidity of the fight scenes is great. It's a beautiful anime to watch if nothing else. \\n\\n\r\nI believe the weakest point comes in the form of Biba as the other \"enemy\" or the main antagonist. A man that just wants to see all of humanity burn for the sake of it. I believe so many others who watched will agree and have probably already said the same. His arc and development not thought through well, but they do aid in driving home the final points and raising the levels of the climactic ending that much more. \\n\\n\r\nHaving Suwano on the soundtrack didn't hurt at all either. The music as we are all aware was beautiful. There were a fair amount of epic fight tracks, the beauty of humanity tracks, and triumphant tracks as well. The music was yet another layer that added to the rich textures that made up KNK. \\n\\n\r\nI think this narrative could work as a longer series, I would definitely watch, but it also works as a one off. It ended in a way where there wasn't much set up for a second season and to be fair, I wouldn't be upset if there wasn't It was a great, action packed, slugfest that made the spring all the more enjoyable.  A must watch for all anime fans.",

Kabaneri have people that have experience supporting their work, so even using an idea that have us surrounded nowadays, the enjoyment could be reached thanks to that people.\r\nThe art and audio stand out by themselves, the art have its own passion corresponding to the era, and you heard familiar voices and songs authors that have you very connected to the story and its flow. And OP and ED have beautiful and passionate voices that make your starts and ends of chapter more inspirited.\r\nThe story even with a idea that hada mob use these days, has its own romance, having trains at the principal transport and the cities building thinking in that, so it's something great to the sight.\\n\\n\r\nThe charas and their interaction have a multiple facets and situations, so in times you have a great action or joy and others only drama and blah blah blah, but overall I think all are very unique, even with their holes in their roles, together are a great unit for the plot.\\n\\n\r\nThe plot have a number of holes, the weak points, you going to notice them because normally are filled with extreme drama or MacGyver solutions, but can be tolerated, we need to be some thoughtful about the idea, because their are telling us a apocalypse story, so, sometimes using the Anime Laws for the plot flow, always is an option.\\n\\n\r\nI think overall it is a enjoyable story, even with it's flaws, it shows a good image and a good effort, so if you are searching something to hunt, this could be a great prey.\\n\\n\r\nIf you reach this point of the review, thanks for read it all and I hope you can like this anime as much as I.",

            "content": "As much flak as everyone gives this show for being too similar to \u9032\u6483\u306e\u5de8\u4eba (Attack on Titan), there are some interesting things worth noting. SCROLL ALL THE WAY DOWN FOR THE TLDR IF YOU'D RATHER SKIP AN ENTIRELY DIFFERENT ANALYSIS FROM THE OTHER REVIEWS.\r\nStory\r\nOf course, as many point out, the story has lots of loopholes, unexplained occurrences and the like, which makes the storytelling weak. I think there are some interesting ideas going into this. I particularly liked the fusion between Meiji, Shogun/Sengokujidai and industrial steampunk. While all of the elements/ideas aren't fused together perfectly, it's passable that I watched all the way until theend of the series (and I've been known to drop the \"popular\" Shounen Jump ones like Bleach and Naruto for repetition and reuse of the same formula for hundreds of episodes, even if their storytelling is good).\\n\\n\r\nLike all \"like-iterations\" of the same core ideas, it's important to recognize \u30ab\u30d0\u30cd\u30ea (Kabaneri) as something that had the potential to be great, but fell short, partly because of the above flaws, but also because it lives under the shadow of Attack on Titan. The rest of this review is focused with the idea onward that Kabaneri is not the same as Attack on Titan, and shouldn't be treated as such.\\n\\n\r\nArt\\n\\n\r\nI'm an artist, while there's some awkward inconsistencies here and there with anatomical limits (especially when it comes to orchestrating battle scenes), it's well drawn, especially in an age where anime is a modern commodity and less effort goes into them than it once was in the 90's. I typically stay for series that are well drawn, or at least make SOME semblance of anatomical accuracy (I'm sure we can all do without the ecchi, unrealistic rocket-flop boobs - thanks for not putting that in).\\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\\n\r\nWhat can I say - sound direction is great. I watched most of with headphones on and I felt my heart skip in certain scenes with the \u30ab\u30d0\u30cd (Kabane) howling in the distance. Don't even get me started on Hiroyuki Sawano, because we all know that man is a genius at evoking emotion through sound.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter\\n\\n\r\nSuffers the same issues as the story really, low development, unexplained personality inconsistencies and the like. It does touch however on some themes about human nature that I find particularly poignant. They illustrated well how humans in general writhe in fear, not many of us are heroes, or can be. We all too easily descend into fear and madness, collapsing our own societies at the drop of a hat. We're talking ideology and rhetoric here, of people driven by fear, loss, grief, and emotions that all too often make even the most rational of us into the same kind of beasts the Kabane are - albeit of the breathing, thinking kind. It's also important to talk about naivety and how easily some following the ideology they believe in, even if they don't understand its consequences. Given this, while individual characters are weak, the overarching themes are apparent. Besides, what kind of character development can you get from a 12 episode anime anyway? Bring back the 52-series!\\n\\n\r\nTLDR:\\n\\n\r\nYes, we all know it's Attack on Titan (if it fell short) and we all know that lots of people rated it poorly for that reason. That itself isn't a sufficient reason to completely ignore it. The story is passable, art is good, sound is great. Not once while I was watching did I make cross comparisons to Attack on Titan, to anyone who watches this, please don't do this series injustice by following with the majority opinion. Come to your own conclusions after giving some time to think about what it highlights AFTER you finish the series.",

The villain makes no sense and is clearly just there so Ikoma can save a girl, and in general, a lot of things are never explained. What is the black blood? What is the white blood? Why does Biba do the things he does? I could try to tell you, but I don't quite get it myself. The characters are also pretty cliche.\r\nBut here comes the shower of compliments.\r\nFirst of all, the music and visuals are stunning. I couldstare at Mumei's face for the rest of my life and the fight scenes are entertaining and intense. The music is dramatic, sounds great, and fits with the scenes.\\n\\n\r\nMore important than the story or the art or the characters or the music is the themes, ideas, emotions, and power packed into this show.\\n\\n\r\nSteampunk samurai? Zombie-human hybrids that drink blood? This anime is cool. It's fun, exciting, entertaining, you feel like a badass just for knowing it exists. The anime leaves you excited, blood pumping, it gets your heart racing. It's intense. \\n\\n\r\nAny anime that manages to make me feel things, any anime that manages to make me care, is a good anime. The story and characters fall short, but the amount of cool things that happen is certainly enough to keep me going.\\n\\n\r\nCall me a simple person, but I can't help but appreciate this show, simply for being the most metal thing ever.",

It was simply a fast paced anime which i personally like. Personally, i love anime that is morbid and well, thrilling. Well, i can say that i am really looking forward to season 2.\r\nArt\r\nThe art is 10/10 for me. \r\nThe way the character looked like is really and truly fitting. And the way they designed the zombie is pretty unique too.\r\nSound \r\n8/10\r\nI don't really like the ost that much but the character's voices is kind of great.\r\nCharacter\r\n10/10\r\nIkoma - Ikoma isnot your typical hero. He doesn't carry anything in his past, he just simply wanna survive. He is week in moral and physical. But he doesn't know when to give up! He shows how strong his will really is. And poof he saved the day! He is also smart. He cared a lot about his friends and comrade. He has a strong believe that humanity will survived. He helped people a lot without wanting anything in return. In fact, when his life is on the line, he still won't give up unless he saves his friends. He is the true hero of this series!\\n\\n\r\nMumei - You can say that she is this typical reckless heroine. She does stuff her way and doesn't really care about others. On the last episode when they were fighting that black smoke zombie she kind of ruined everything. She is so arrogant and self-centered but all the way, i began to love her. She had this dark past that she carried behind her and we can't really blame her for acting that way. Though her appearance is way different from her personality. At first, she look week and so vulnerable but later on the anime, she shows her true self. A invulnerable girl who can kill kabane.\\n\\n\r\nBiba - He is your typical antagonist who became the bad guy due to some betrayal incident. Though he may seem so kindhearted, he is such a cunning man. Well, looks can really be deceiving after all! Like Mumei, he carries a painful past too. Can't really hate him much though.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment\\n\r\n10/10\\n\r\nThe series is not that unique since there a lot of story which involves zombie apocalypse. But for me, i enjoyed it a lot more that i expected. When i hear that there's a zombie series coming, i was kind of excited! I enjoy morbid, gore and horror series. I would pretty much re-watched this while waiting for season 2.\\n\\n\r\nOverall \\n\r\n9/10\\n\r\nThere are still some unexplained things which i think will unravel in the later season. I would pretty much watch the next season. It's not so unique but there are some scenes which will make you root for more. I was also rooting for some mix of romance.\\n",

A tedious tug of war of masquerading lies and weak personalities. With normal humans constantly getting the advantage over Ikoma, it gets tiring fast. \r\nI give this Anime a heart wretched 5: It had gorgeous animation, stunning character design, an interesting universe that could have taken it in so many directions, butin the end it feels like they just butchered what could have been a classic for years to come.\\n",

            "content": "Inspiration can vary in numerous ways. It can make you create a work of art that is your own, yet spawned from an idea due to a masterpiece you witnessed. Depending on how said work is done, it will either be loved or berated as a cheap imitation. Let us take a look at Kabaneri of the Iron Fortress, an original anime from the spring 2016 lineup. With it being similar to a certain well-known anime, how does it fair on its own? \r\nStory & Characters:\r\nLooking at the production of Kabaneri of the Iron Fortress, you'll notice that most of it is similar to Attackon Titan's production. You have the same director, studio, and even the composer is the same. This had led Kabaneri to receive claims of it being a rip off of Attack on Titan, but I do not believe that is the case. Kabaneri is an anime that holds well on its own and despite its flaws, it makes for great entertainment due to its spontaneous production. \\n\\n\r\nThe story and progression of Kabaneri has the same feeling some shounen series do due to it being an action-adventure with dark undertones. Kabaneri has a formulaic routine on how it runs along with the progression until a certain point. Traveling by train to get from one destination to another while fending against adversaries known as the \u201cKabane\u201d show said routine. Seeing how the story continues is entertaining with the intense action scenes, character interaction, and thrilling violence. \\n\\n\r\nDespite any intensity Kabaneri may contain, it does have its own flaws with the mechanics of its Kabane adversaries. Due to the origins of the virus not being fully explained, we are left in the dark about the idea, which could have added to the story. For what Kabaneri does lack it makes up with its great use of steampunk. The display of weapons, world, and even a sturdy koutetsujou shows how creatively steampunk is used in this series. Specifically, how weapons are used helps stir up any action that takes place. Kabaneri also adds in some slight sci-fi gimmicks that looks intriguing, but doesn't work out well due to deus ex machina cliches and plot devices. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters, while all do not get fleshed out, add to the progression of Kabaneri. Character interaction with other characters helps the flow of the story and allows opportunity to give spotlight to individual cast members. Development is strongest in moments of intensity where action is taking place with vital roles being set in motion. Whether if it is Ikoma being a nerd and fighting Kabane, or Mumei being heroic, each character has a part to play that is important to the story. One gripe would be the inserting of a villain at the half point of the series since it makes the series stumble a bit. How Kabaneri progresses with said villain can feel forced, rushed, clich\u00e9 and some of his actions resemble that of a typical antagonist. \\n\\n\r\nArt & Animation:\\n\\n\r\nWith studio Wit handling the production of art and animation, a lot of skill and quality went into making Kabaneri. The art is something to focus on due to the amount of detail that it contains. The shading of the atmosphere to represent the post-apocalyptic setting, symbolic objects, and coloring of the Kabane are good examples of detail. Character designs are unique and fit well with the setting Kabaneri is setting its sights on. They do not look too flashy, yet, not plain either, which makes the designs just right for this series. Despite the fantastic art, there are moments where it can get gory with tons of bloodshed and dark visuals of dead bodies. If you are of the squeamish, you may want to take caution before watching Kabaneri. \\n\\n\r\nAnimation is something to gaze upon as scenes are well animated no matter what is taking place. Whether its a fight for whoever gets more food, idle chatting, and even training, the animation pumps out levels of quality to fit each situation. Strongest moments of animation are during action sequences when characters are fighting to defend from the Kabane. The fluidity becomes superb with each movement and adds to the enjoyment value. Even with the high quality action scenes, the art along with animation can drop down below its level of excellence at times. Noticeable moments such as still frames, sloppy movement, and dip in art showcases the lower levels of quality. \\n\\n\r\nMusic:\\n\\n\r\nKabaneri's music soundtrack is composed by Hiroyuki Sawano and If you're familiar with Attack on Titan, you will notice the similarities. Besides, Attack on Titan, Sawano has done music for anime such as Blue Exorcist and even Kill la Kill. With that being said, just like the series mentioned, they all have an impactful soundtrack and the same goes for Kabaneri. The music used is intense, exaggerative, and loud, especially in moments of tension. Powerful tracks fit well for Kabaneri due to the action and adventure that takes place, which makes it more thrilling. Even in moments of turmoil, the soundtrack shifts its tone to deliver that ominous sensation, which accompanies the situation. If I may say so, the music certainly has been a blast and listening to it while watching Kabaneri raises my excitement for each scene. \\n\\n\r\nFinal Thoughts:\\n\\n\r\nI strongly defend Kabaneri when someone calls it an Attack on Titan rip off. As a matter of fact, I would even go as far as to say it is better than Attack on Titan for the most part. The characters have more personality compared to the ones in Attack on Titan. Also, the adventure aspect is something Kabaneri has that Attack on Titan doesn't. Still, I will admit that Kabaneri does have its issues. It almost dropped the ball near the end because of cliches, a cookie-cutter villain, and rushed progression. \\n\\n\r\nAlso, is it just me or does Kajika look like Kotori from Love-Live? Except, if Kotori were in a post-apocalyptic setting!",

            "content": "Attack on Kabaneri is one of the most popular shows on spring 2016 with a premise never seen in anime (*cough* Shingeki *cough),edgy scenes and amazing animatation and ost.You clearly see that it's a SnK,with the same staff,the same story,the same studio and so on and so on.\r\nLet's start with the story,the story,it's complete bullshit.Humanity has been taken by titans,sorry,I mean,kabanes and it's living in train stations using trains to move arround\r\nThe setting it's really cool.It set in steampunk feudal japan,so it's more attractive than your typical japanese school setting.They use technology which doesn't clash with the time and the social structure it's simliar tofeudal one but unfortunatly,it doesn't get explored and it's only used of decoration,it established that there're some groups to fight the zombies and something with the clans families going on but it doesn't get developed and the story only focuses on killing all zombies.The premise is interesting and attractive even though we have seen it a million times already but attractive indeed.\\n\r\nThe pacing is really fast but chaotic,since thing move so fast there's no time to let the characters introduced and the events to sink it,so you don't have any clue of what's going on.\\n\r\nThe writter is Ichiro Okouchi and this is double-edged sword,on one hand the writter was the same guy who wrote Code Geass and Planetes,on the other hand we wrote Valvrave,and unfortunatly,Kabaneri falls into the latter type.The story abuses the using of cliffhangers and plot twists to make you forget the complete bullshit of the script,Guilty Crown style.\\n\r\nAlso,the zombie part is complete bullshit,nobody explains you a shit why they appeared?How?,and you can see,oh but it's a mystery,yeah,well nobody cares about them,at least in AoT they investigated about them and you got some information,eventhough,Eren's basement is still like in another galaxy.In addition,some random weird zombies and powers appeared just like \"pum\" and when I say that I don't want 2 hours infodump about the zombies but a least some information but no,the zombies only appered and the gigant zombies appeared out of nowhere and nobody explais a shit,the show doesn't care to have a little consistency,so the plot holes were getting bigger and bigger as the show gets dumber and dumber.Moreover,we started with a funny typical zombie apocalypse with trains and we ended with evil guys that want to kill humanity,super kabanes,injections that are power-ups.\\n\r\nFinally,we have the edning that ends this clustter-fuck of story with so many plot holes that it's not even funnywell,I previously explained that we have a bad,1-D guy,well he wants to kill everybody,he has a plan to do it and our MC tries to stop him which ended with him getting stabbed in the heart and threw into the water but he doesn't get killed because plot convenience,so yes he's OP as hell,later on,he appears in an island and he met some characters that disappeared some episodes ago and they went to kill the bad guy and save everyone,but before that,he gets a power-up with an asspull in a form of an injection that we don't know what it is or how they get it,but up to this point is just another plot hole in the story,after our main character got his asspull,he went to fight and he fights the big monster that is the girl that he loves being turned into a big kabaneri controlled by the bad guy but some how our MC saves her by screaming and running towards it.Then,we kills the bad guy and \"yaay\" everyone is saved and the bad guy followers' joins the good guys to go to the city that was supposed to be main objective of the series but they go together like nothing happens,it's not like they hijacked the train ruling them and even killing some of them.\\n\r\nTo sum it up,the story it's a complete trainwreck.\\n\\n\r\nThe art and animation are amazing,WIT Studio is well know for making really well animated series like Attack on Titan and the Rolling girls.\\n\r\nThe aesthetics pretty cool,because of it's setting the series has a really cool steampunk feeling to it\\n\r\nThe charcter design is pretty as hell,even the zombies are beautiful,well,that's not true,but the character design is indeed really well done and we have here some waifu and husbando material\\n\r\nAlso,there're a lot of character expression and setting details that make the inmersion even further.\\n\r\nThe animation it's amazing with a level of quality which most studios are unable to produce,been only comparable to ufotable or KyoAni shows,the action is fluid and clean,the action is amazing and excites you,thanks to the animation and Araki's style,being the same as Death Note or Shingeki.\\n\r\nIn conclusion,the animation and art are great and the best aspect of the show and thanks to the good staff it's enjoyable by itself\\n\\n\r\nThe sound is also really well done,let's start with the OP and ED\\n\r\nThe OP was fine,the action excites you and the song was sung by EGOIST and is really catchy and lovely\\n\r\nThe ED is amazing,the visuals are breaththaking and stunning with an amazing song sung by Chelly and Aimer attached to it.\\n\r\nThe ost was composed by Sawano,the guy that gave us a collection of unforgettables soundtracks like the Shingeki ones or like the Guilty Crown ones,so yeah,it's good,it makes you excited for the action scenes and added to the great handling of them of Araki.\\n\r\nThe sound is also get handled like to noises that the guns make and the trains,when they stop and its moving,the details aren't overlooked\\n\r\nThe voice acting is also good,with the same seiyuu for our MC as the AoT MC,so there's a lot of screaming,the seiyuus did a good performance.\\n\r\nThe sound department is really well done as well,like animation.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are by far the worst aspect of the show.They're a boring copy-paste of the shingeki cast,the MC who wants to kill'em all(Ikoma),the super op girl that is interested on the MC (Mumei),etc,etc.They're one-dimentional and forgettable and most of them are annoying clich\u00e9s like the rich and fragile girl.The characterization is also bad,because os the AoT syndrome,most of them are killed and the story and the \"kill of the zombies\" is the focus and nobody cares about the characters.The story also tries to add tension making you feel that nobody is safe but you clearly see that's bullshit,since the main cast is plot armor and op as hell and since this show suffers from the AoT syndrome,a lot of people die,so you won't care about them,only about their deaths,so the characterization doesn't existed.Moreover,the development is nonexistent,because the only thing that matters is the spectacle.You won't care about the characters,tou only will care about their deaths.Also,most of the characters aren't fleshed out in any way,they remain as cliches but to be honest,Mumei,gets some flesh out in the form of a flashback showing as how traumatic was her past but the character moves from a dynamic woman to a imoto thing,so her character suffers from a character regresion,ending the show like a damsel in distress like it's a LN adaptation.Then,we have Ani-sama,the evil bad guy with no redeeming cualities.\\n\r\nSo,at the end of the day,we have a boring cast full of walking cliches and without any character development or fleshing out.\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion,this show is a trainwreack (no pun intended) scriptwise but thanks to the pretty impresive animation and music it's really enjoyable\\n\r\nIn the end,we have a show with really good production values but a bullshit script.\\n\r\nIf you want something like AoT but with the consistency of Guilty Crown,go for it to rest that doesn't want dumb entertainment,stay the fuck away\\n\\n\r\nOverall,I give this anime a 3 out of 10\\n\\n\r\nFor similar shows you can go Attack on Titan,for a zombie apocalypse and for cluster fuck of random bullshit with good production values you can go for Guilty Crown or Valvrave.",

Now I know a lot of you would say \"oh this is like AOT therefore I will rate it super low because it's so boring and blah blah blah\" but you know what? I think this anime is worth watching because we've all been through searching for good animes that are \"related\" to the ones we've watched previously and I am one of those people. \r\nAfter watching AOT, I sure did look for recommendations and a sh*t ton of animes with almost the same concept and storyline as AOT but nothing compared to Koutetsujou no Kabaneri. Thisanime made me feel all kinds of things and I don't think it's an AOT rip off at all! Each character is very unique and you will really feel the action throughout the episodes (love the idea of zombies/vampires vibe too). And hey, this is coming from a girl who mostly watches shoujo and romcom animes XD sometimes you just gotta switch it up and find that adventurous side of ya once in a while!\\n\\n\r\nBut of course, people have their own opinions and you have the choice to listen to other negative reviews or see for yourself because only you can tell if you love it or hate it. Good luck!",

            "content": "After reading quite a lot of questionable reviews I've decided to chip in. This review is spoiler-free and only hints at some parts of the story non-relevant for the full experience. Remember to go into this anime with an open mind and accept it for what it is. As many are comparing to this and that, you can completely go ahead and ignore those people.\r\nStory: \r\nThe story is as expected walking along, pretty much, standard paths of these types of post-apocalyptic scenarios. Calmness, sudden change, action, calmness, and repeat. We are faced with episodial cliffhangers together with several good tension building plot twists along thestoryline. The show tries hard to cater to an audience that mainly enjoy post-apocalyptic scenarios, an audience which I actually do not really belong to, but one I nonetheless got drawn into thanks to this anime. \"The red thread\" throughout the story are indeed on rails, if you catch my drift, and thus the progress of the story falls very naturally. This series has a very direct and clear approach towards the viewer in what the characters want, what they will do etc. Very few character motives are \"hidden\" from the viewer, some might not like this aspect of the story. This anime is also exceptionally good at showing the true nature of people when faced with a crisis, almost frighteningly good. Because of the series focus and shortness(only 12 episodes), they have left several \"plotholes\" open for further explanation which is a minus. This series is, as said, slightly too short for its own good, which left me with a vague feeling of the story \"wanting\" to show us much, much more of this world than we are shown... In my interpretation, due to the lack of space, we get left with hints. \\n\\n\r\nI for one appreciate what this show tries to do, what it actually achieved in 12 episodes and its aspiration for a possible future. However what it actually achieved fell slighty short on my expectations, thus the story gets the grade of  8/10.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nOutstanding. Steampunk.\\n\r\n10/10\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound: \\n\r\nMade me buy the OST. That good? Yes!\\n\r\n10/10\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nWhen the main \"named\" characters react to certain events along the storyline, they keep their individuality intact, this is something that I greatly value - since they keep a red thread to each characters way of thinking. First I thought that the other non - named characters are not shown as much love from the creators. There where parts where I felt: \"do these noname characters even care if that many people would die?\". ~ But then, I stopped, and questioned why I thought like that...  IN a world where death is commonplace and you have seen it with your own eyes several times too many, how would you react? The fire to protect exists but the aftermath to cope with death is a whole other story. This side however is not emphazised as much as I would like to see and people are majorly shown to \"steel themselves\" or \"not care at all\".\\n\r\nBackstories, where are the backstories?\\n\r\n6/10.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nBingewatched the whole thing, left me wanting for more. Need I say anything else?\\n\r\n9/10.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall: \\n\r\nThis is a really good anime and I can see why people are hating on it - they simply cannot handle animes with similar settings from the same studio. They say \"milk here, milk there\", it is like they didn't even watch the series without prejudice constantly bashing it in their heads. Thus you go into this one and take it for what it is, one - almost deralingly - good helluva ride.\\n\r\n9/10\\n\\n\\n\\n",

The ending could have been a lot better, but the ending is still really complete to the story. One of the best anime i have seen in a long time, this anime has included many points for an \"action/thriller\" anime. Even thogh this might be inthe industrial/samurai era, the overll work of storyline has far exceeded my expectations. Unlike many other anime, the first episode will not be confusing and it will also give you an undestanding to the anime. this anime is a must watch!!",

            "content": "Ok, after seeing all these reviews, I decided to make my own. I'm not a professional in making reviews, however, I will try to do my best!\r\nKoutetsujou in Kabaneri is probably one of the best animes of this year, I planned to see it makes a certain time, because they said that would be the 'successor' of Attack on Titan, but after watching it, I can say that has not nothing to do with Shingeki, and I find no reason to compare them.\r\nWatch out! From now may contain spoilers anime!\r\nHistory: 7/10\r\nThe story of Kabaneri for me was the weakest part of the story is abit '' generic '' is a post apocalyptic world full of zombies, known as Kabane, now comes the '' gap '' that made the reason I interested in the anime: they did kind of 'Seasons'' to protect the kabanes, and each station is moved by trains!\\n\r\nThis was probably the main reason for this negativity anime, many people compare it with Shingeki because of kabanes with titans, but there is no reason the great '' brand '' of Kabaneri are the trains. The end of the anime was great! Could have been better, I believe the anime could have had even 20 episodes, but considering that the manga is still being published, the final although not expected, was the only possible end in my opinion.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9:10\\n\r\n The Art Kabaneri was another point of comparison with Shingeki: even more it is the same studio the Shingeki own, anyway, art is very good, I have no complaint about that.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9/10\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is good too, could have some improvements, but also without any complaints.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 8/10\\n\r\nThe personagems are good,  Mumei is the favorite of the public in my point of view, however, I liked more ikoma, and in my view it with that kind of ' vaccine 'is one of the strongest personagems of the year. It is very overpower and is very intelligent .The  characters have a pretty good variety, but not everything is perfect, many personagems I thought it would be '' difficult '' were easy, like that union kabanes were easily defeated, which I thought was rather dull.\\n\r\nAnother character that I found very cool was the kurusu, he is very strong in the beginning you may find it a little boring, but later in the anime, you'll like it a bit more I guess.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8/10\\n\r\nI followed this anime since launch, but I took a break, and after finishing, I began to review it, because of the rating which fell drastically, i  thought the anime had worsened a lot, but after all, I saw the anime and it is great anyway, and I could entertain myself with it\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9/10\\n\r\nThe anime is very good, and as I said, is one of the best anime of the year in my opinion, and did not deserve to get as much hate as it gets. The anime could have been exploited better? Of course! However, the way it already is already very good <3\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Kabaneri of the Iron Fortress is one of the best anime I've seen in a while, and I don't understand the hate toward it. Wait, I do. It's because people can't stop comparing it to other shows.\r\nWhen I say that something is good, I usually mean two things. First, I liked the visuals. And second, I liked the sound. With Kabaneri, I loved both.\r\nI mean, what is there not to be liked about this show's visuals and sound? You have the OP sung by EGOIST (who is my favourite Japanese artist), and the ED by the collaborative work of both EGOIST and aimer! Oh yeah!Add to that some glorious OST, especially during the battle scenes, and there you have it - AOTY. I don't kid - the OST got me pretty emotional and excited during the action, which means that it was good. I rarely find such good shows, but when I do, I have the most enjoyable of times.\\n\\n\r\nThe other thing that impressed me was the art. Since I got my new 4K monitor, I've become particularly aware of the visuals in the shows I watch. Although I saw Kabaneri in 720p, for the BD version wasn't out yet, the art and animation were quite outstanding throughout the series. I noticed little to no use of CGI, which shows that the creators put a lot of effort into animating each movement of the characters in a proper way. I don't see well-animated shows every day, so this one must be some sort of a jewel in a pile of muddy rocks. But, we already know that and I can understand the hype around this anime in Japan. Because, if you don't know, Kabaneri is pretty popular in Japan at the moment. I'm glad I had the chance to watch it before the end of the year.\\n\\n\r\nAlthough the story didn't impress me with anything particular, for it was predictable, and none of the characters stood out, I loved Kabaneri for what it tried to deliver at first place, since it succeeded. The show introduced me to my new favourite anime songs and gave me new art ideas for my own story (since I'm a writer, you know, and an artist at that).\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, Kabaneri exceeded my expectations, or at least met them, for, you know, when you start watching something with a rating lower than 7.50, you don't expect a lot from it. However, since I was already familiar with the OP and ED songs before I saw the show, it already had a high enjoyment factor. Not only that, but the ending suggests a likely second season, so I'll be looking forward to the announcement of one. :)",

            "content": "As I was wandering (again), I came across 'Koutetsujou no Kabaneri' ('Kabaneri of the Iron Fortress'), wondering how the heck it slipped past me. \r\nWhile looking through the reviews, I saw such low ratings, I couldn't believe my eyes. \r\n\"No way...\" Is what I thought. Almost made me NOT watch it; since I have a firm belief in the reviews on MAL. But after watching it, I decided to create a review that would, hopefully, counter the mean reviews.\r\n~Story~ (7/10):\r\nWhile I sound like a hypocrite, I have a good reason not to give it an '8'. The genres the anime has are: 'Action', 'Horror', 'Drama'and 'Fantasy'. \\n\\n\r\nSo:\\n\r\n-Definitely has the 'Drama' part right.\\n\r\n-When it comes to 'Fantasy', it has to be unrealistic and/or an impossible scenario.\\n\r\nI'd like to think zombies will never walk the Earth, so it's a tick. \\n\r\n-There is 'Action'. The fight scenes are good, not fantastic, but good nevertheless. \\n\\n\r\nNow, 'Horror'. You got a zombie apocalypse, you got red blood (Not pink, like Danganronpa - thank goodness), you have psycho people, you have a dark theme.\\n\r\nBut... it doesn't feel scary, at all. Maybe to a 5 year-old, but not me. \\n\\n\r\nAnd if I tell you it's not scary, it's gotta be true. I am the worst when it comes to Horror, I can't even finish Future Diary (Mirai Nikki). You wanna know something? I even watched this at night, just to get hyper active. Nope, does not work. \\n\\n\r\nIt's not scary, shouldn't really be a 'Horror' anime. It's just... meh.\\n\r\nDespite that, I thought it was really cool, and had a nice storyline.\\n\r\nThe main idea, is 'Justice'. \\n\r\nAbout whether to abandon comrades just because of what and who they are.\\n\r\nWhether it's nice to kill a Kabaneri just because, \"YOU ARE A KABANE!!! DIE, YOU MOTHER----\" Yeah, you get the point.\\n\\n\r\nAnyway... basically, didn't give it an '8' because it wasn't scary enough, consistent enough, and had a lot of plot holes, and because the world-building episode (1 & 2, I believe) wasn't good enough :(\\n\\n\r\n~Art~ (8/10):\\n\r\nI rather found the graphics exceptional. I was excited about the blood. \\n\r\nYou may think me weird, but after having so many censorship, I was ecstatic.\\n\r\nSpeaking of censorship, I have not read the manga so I'm not sure it's all to plan, and stuff. \\n\\n\r\n~Sound~ (8/10):\\n\r\nIt was good, that's all xD\\n\r\nOk, that wasn't descriptive enough, but I've ran out of what to say about 'sound'.\\n\r\nOh, wait, I do have something.\\n\r\nMain character - Ikoma - his V.A is Tasuku Hatanaka. Gonna be honest, never heard of the guy. But damn, it sounded like he had a blocked nose at times. \\n\r\nI thought he was a duck. \\n\r\nLiterally.\\n\r\nIt made me cringe.\\n\\n\r\n~Character~ (7/10):\\n\r\nOk, hardest part, but I'm gonna be brief here. Don't wanna keep you reading until the next day or so. \\n\r\nCharacter development was so-so. You can clearly see why Ikoma is rage-driven to get rid of the Kabane. Buuuuut, there will be times you'll be like \"WHHHHY?! WHY ARE YOU DOING THAT! NO, DON'T DO THA- OH MY GOODNESS YOU DID!\"\\n\\n\r\nThat's what I was screaming in my aching brain. \\n\r\nAnd to reference this, I was mostly screaming at Mumei- yeah, the 'sweet' sensitive girl who... oh yeah, no spoilers, lol. \\n\\n\r\n~Overall~:\\n\r\nI think people got hyped because the anime was made by the same creators of 'Attack on Titans'. That wasn't a very good idea, to be honest. \\n\\n\r\nBut I have to say I did, in fact, enjoyed it.\\n\r\nAnd at some stage, I won't remember it.\\n\r\nBut it was good.\\n\r\nWatch the anime if you need, just something; to waste time. \\n\r\nIt's good.\\n\r\nTrust me.\\n\\n\r\nOr don't :D",

            "content": "Let me start off by saying: this anime is beautiful. It really is. The visuals are so outstanding that it's hard to not want to look at them. All the environments have so much depth and color put into them that you just want to take a still frame from the anime and put it on your wall. And the characters! They obviously put a lot of time and effort into the shading and colors of the characters and it definitely paid off. The art in Kabaneri is some of the best I've ever seen in anime and it madewatching it a visual treat.\\n\r\n     Another wonderful thing about it was the audio. Beautiful music combined with amazing voice actors; it was incredible! All the music fit perfectly with the situations and helped to pull me in. And the voices of the characters were so well suited it made them feel much more real and honest. In the audio department, I couldn't have asked for more.\\n\r\n   The story itself was good, not the most original, but not the least. It was another \"zombie apocalypse\" story, but with a steampunk twist (and I love steampunk, so it worked out great). They also added other unique and unexpected factors that kept the story interesting and (in my opinion) well worth watching.\\n\r\n    Characters usually make or break an anime for me, and luckily the characters in Kabaneri were fun to watch (especially Mumei, she's so cute!). The designs were unique enough and all the characters had decent personalities so it was easy to like them. I had my ups and downs with Ikoma, but ultimately I think he's a great main character. All the characters add something amazing to the anime in my opinion (even Biba, who many people who watch the anime don't understand, and take it out on the anime itself. Sometimes you have to look for deeper meanings and it shows an anime in a whole new light).\\n\r\n    Overall, I very much enjoyed this anime. It may not be \"the most original\" according to some, but it is definitely worth watching in my opinion. Hey, if zombie apocalypse is your thing, this anime is totally for you. Even if it's not, this anime is worth a watch. It has stunning visuals, beautiful audio, and characters who are both fun and have depth. This anime seems to get a bad rep from some people, but I think they may just not understand some of the depth behind it (especially with Biba; if you pay close attention and try to understand him more, the anime will make more sense, and ultimately be more enjoyable for you). In conclusion, give this anime a chance, it truly deserves one.",

            "content": "Normally, original anime tend to be disappointing. You\u2019ll have moments when you have well-created originals like Code Geass, but most of them turn out to be like Mayoiga\u2026 or Endride. But Koutetsujou no Kabaneri has lot of hype around it before it aired, which generally isn\u2019t the case with most of these anime. And why wouldn\u2019t there be hype. The key visuals and PVs were promising, even if it\u2019s too familiar to another survival anime, and it\u2019s got a studio that knows what an anime\u2019s production value should be, a director that directed two of the most well-known anime ever, and the co-creator of CodeGeass. What could possibly go wrong? Well\u2026\\n\\n\r\n~{Story}~\\n\r\nKoutetsujou no Kabaneri feels like an anime that created its set pieces first, then decided how to make a story out of it. When an anime does that, you can\u2019t expect it to give the most top-notch writing. The premise for Kabaneri is quite simple. Monsters called Kabane terrorizes society and they can only by killed if a certain part their body is pierced (their heart). Stations are what protects the people from these monsters. Kabane end up invading their station and they\u2019re forced to move out. Our protagonist and some other girl end up being both human and Kabane (Kabaneri) and they stick with the humans to help them out. Does this sound familiar at all? Well, it should. Oh yeah, and the main character and that other girl can only survive if they consume human blood, which creates fiction between them and the humans. Does that remind you of another series? Anyways, the premise isn\u2019t original, yet they can still manage to evolve from their premise and be something more. Boku no Hero Academia proved that this season, but unfortunately, Kabaneri fails to do so. There\u2019s no major goal in the anime until the second half of the series, you know, by the time you stopped caring about this series. The premise is just an excuse to have some action sequenced and \u201cpolitical problems\u201d. And the series dives into some ridiculous clich\u00e9s once the main antagonist shows up. Without spoiling anything, let\u2019s just say that the series makes itself look like a big joke after that. And the ending couldn\u2019t have been more predictable\\n\r\nStory: 4/10\\n\\n\r\n~{Presentation}~\\n\r\nKoutetsujou no Kabaneri borrows elements from many different anime to make their own. Instead of mixing these elements and making their own compound, Kabaneri feels like a clone of many anime and never feels like an anime of their own. It\u2019s too busy following other anime\u2019s shadows that it doesn\u2019t create a shadow of its own. Its dumb, loud, over-the-top, but not fun. It\u2019s brutal, violent, action-packed, but never intense. Kabaneri fails to be a proper survival anime because the intensity found in watching the characters struggle to survive is never there. Not once did I find the Kabane to be a threat, since the lack the intelligence of being so. And no, a Kabane dual-wielding swords does not make it smart but rather stupid, as it would lack the intelligence of using it efficiently. The stakes always feel low, even when villager #243 dies (spoilers). There\u2019s no sense of intensity whatsoever as it always feels like the main cast will survive no matter what. And even if they were to die, who would care. However, Kabaneri does get some things right. The setting is quite interesting and I always enjoy a steampunk setting. The design of the setting is good too. They could have created a good lore out of this universe, but due to how short the series is, and how much time is spent on mindless action or cringe-worthy dialogues, the series fails to do so.\\n\r\nPresentation: 4.5/10\\n\\n\r\n~{Character}~\\n\r\nOh yeah, this is the part where Koutetsujou no Kabaneri really stumbles. There\u2019s not a single character that I particularly liked from this series. They start of clich\u00e9s and end off as an even bigger one. Our protagonist, Ikoma, despite his unique look, he\u2019s still your typical clich\u00e9 shounen-ish main character. Yelling makes him stronger, he goes through transformations, has a tragic backstory for cheap feels, and can get ridiculously OP if he has enough rage and nakama powers with him. If he sounds generic enough, then I\u2019m doing my job. Despite that, he\u2019s one of the more likable characters of the series. His ideology works and his interactions with certain characters, particularly his buddy, feels real enough. But his backstory is never properly explored, leaving him to be a character that needs more depth. And then we have Mumei\u2026 oh boy, where do I start. She ended up being a fan favorite due to her being a badass chick. Honestly, never becomes anything more than that. The series introduces her by massacring dozens of Kabane in a minute or so, but she never evolves from just being a badass. She\u2019s whiny, irritating and kind of an asshole at times. He likability decreased throughout the series, to a point where I believed the series can only gain a happy ending is she died. Then we have supporting characters like Ayame, who\u2019s there to simply progress the plot, and characters like Kurusu, who there to create more action set pieces. And the main character of this series is terribly introduced and badly handled, and it pulls the series even more down. \\n\r\nCharacter: 3.5/10\\n\\n\r\n~{Art}~, \\n\r\nThe best thing about Koutetsujou no Kabaneri is its production values, as they\u2019re absolutely stunning at times. The art, at times, is so well detailed and so pretty to look at. The amount of details put into the architecture and objects is astonishing. The trains look beautiful and the backgrounds are great too. It\u2019s obvious that Wit Studio put a lot of care and effort into how the anime looks, but it\u2019s unfortunate that the series doesn\u2019t feel the same too. There are some moments when the art style doesn\u2019t work too well, and that\u2019s with its cel-shaded design. The cel-shaded tries to add depth in the character\u2019s facial design, but it ends up looking weird at times. The character designs are a mixed bag too. Some characters look really unique like Ikoma. His hair consisting of two colors and him wearing glasses makes him really cool to look at. Mumei\u2019s character design feels like a mismatch with the setting. It\u2019s hard to believe that someone would wear bright colors in such an apocalyptic setting. And there\u2019s some characters that lack originality in look, like Kurusu for example.\\n\r\nArt: 8/10\\n\\n\r\n~{Animation}~\\n\r\nIt\u2019s hard to complain about Koutetsujou no Kabaneri animations because it provides some of the most well-animated sequences ever. When the animation quality is at its best, it looks fantastic. Some of the action sequences are really well done. The fluidity is the fights are great and the action choreography is fantastic. Some of the fights are just too enthralling. And the cinematography is great too. The camera angles and shots during fights is great and the using the camera to follow a character during fights is exciting. And even the more simpler animations are well done too. Character movements are fluid and clean, and the train animations are great too. The only problem with the animations is that it\u2019s not consistent enough. There are noticeable animation quality drops and they can be distracting at times, especially since it\u2019s animation at its peak is amazing. If the animations were more balanced out instead of looking great at some places and not so great in others, it would have been better. \\n\r\nAnimation: 8/10\\n\\n\r\n~{Voice Acting}~\\n\r\nThe voice acting is Koutetsujou no Kabaneri is okay. The seiyuu cast do what they have to do in the anime, nothing more, nothing less. Hatanaka Tasuku hasn\u2019t done much at all in his career, so it\u2019s surprising that he was able to do a main character in a high profile Noitamina anime. His voice is quite unique too and I\u2019ve never heard something like it before. Though honestly, he sounds like as if there\u2019s something stuck in his throat and lungs. But he makes Ikoma feel different in a way. That being said, he fails to do emotional moments properly, which is surprising considering the fact that he was able to do so in Ushio to Tora. Mumei\u2019s seiyuu, Senbongi Sayaka, is also fairly new to the industry, though she does a decent job in what she had to do. If her script said to make her character more annoying, she succeeded well. Some of the supporting characters are done by well-known seiyuu like Uchida Maaya, Kaji Yuki, Ishikawa Kaito, and Osaka Ryota, and they all do a satisfactory job. Miyano Mamoru does the main antagonist of the series, and his work is rather disappointing. For such a talented seiyuu, he wasn\u2019t able to show his skills in presenting a negative character. And that didn\u2019t help an already weak character script. However, his weak performance is still the best of the series. \\n\r\nVoice Acting: 6/10\\n\\n\r\n~{Music}~\\n\r\nThe music in Koutetsujou no Kabaneri is quite good. The OP, \u201cKABANERI OF THE IRON FORTRESS\u201d is quite good and it matches the tone of the series. The vocals are great and the music is fine. The ED, \u201cninelie\u201d is many people\u2019s of the season, though I found it strictly okay. The vocals are fine, but nothing memorable. The background music of Kabaneri is pretty good. The main theme is pretty good and it works well douring action sequences. The insert song, \u201dThrough My Blood\u201d is quite good and it worked well due to its placement. Overall the OST is fine and it has some standout tracks. It would have been better is more adrenaline-pumping music is used for its action scenes, but its fine the way it is.\\n\r\nMusic: 6/10\\n\\n\r\n~{Enjoyment}~\\n\r\nWell, I wanted to enjoy Koutetsujou no Kabaneri, I really did. But I couldn\u2019t, and that\u2019s a shame. I had the anime in my plan to watch for a year because the staff was enough to get me interested. And once the PVs came out, it got really hard for me to keep my excitement in. The first couple of episodes weren\u2019t up to standard, yet I was hoping for a turnaround. But the series never recovers, but rather only gets worse. The characters are what really ruined the series for me as none of them are particularly good. And watching Mumei act younger than her age was irritating (and she\u2019s already young enough). And the story never feels exciting or interesting, especially with a generic antagonist like that. And the lack of thrills found from the characters struggling to survive is disappointing. At least there\u2019s some good action sequences, right?\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 3/10\\n\\n\r\nIn the end, Koutetsujou no Kabaneri is only recommended to those who are willing to watch excited action sequences and top-notch production values, but don\u2019t care about writing or characters. What could have been a guilty pleasure anime, couldn\u2019t even be that either. It\u2019s dumb, loud, pretentious, and most of all, not fun. Though the animations and action scenes are fantastic and the music is also good, the characters lack depth and proper backstories, and the main antagonist is disappointing to say the least. And the ending, though decent enough, is quite predictable and the stakes felt low. And there\u2019s always a lack of suspense due to how unthreatening the Kabane are and how overpowered characters can be. Overall, Koutetsujou no Kabaneri is probably the biggest disappointment of the season, and should be watched with expectations low. \\n\\n\r\n+ Fantastic art and animations with amazingly choreographed action sequences\\n\r\n+ Steampunk setting is interesting and pretty to look at\\n\r\n+ OP and ED are good and the background music works, particularly during action-packed moments\\n\r\n- Lack of proper character development and backstories prevents the characters from being interesting\\n\r\n- Main plot is lackluster and the main antagonist is disappointingly clich\u00e9\\n\r\n- Unthreatening Kabane makes the series lack suspense and thrills \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 5.3/10",

            "content": "Every season there is atleast one anime almost everyone is excited to watch and then end up to be 'disappointing'. Kabaneri of the Iron Fortress is this season's hype train disappointment. But i'm not here to bash people for being hyped for something (even though hype culture is a problem of its own), I'm here instead to talk about this piece of garbage from a perspective from someone who wasn't even hyped for this anime in the first place.\r\nSo shall we begin?\r\nLet's actually talk about something that I really liked: The artstyle. The artstyle of this anime looks very steampunky (which was essential) and it'sactually an artstyle i've not seen anywhere else. The animation is is also very good. It's one of very few things the staff put actual effort in. The soundtrack is atleast in my opinion good. I mean it's probably the most Sawano Hiroyuki soundtrack of all time, but i liked it (even though the soundtrack is very forgettable especially if you hated this anime).\\n\\n\r\nNow enough praise, let's actually begin talking about the problems of this anime. And there are a loooooooooooooot of problems. Since there are so many problems with this thing I'm just going to focus on what i think are the biggest problems of this garbage.\\n\r\nMy first problem is that this anime is not original at all. This is just an Attack on Titan ripoff (that's maybe the reason why people were so hyped for this). I won't say that this is a complete copy of AoT. But the way the anime began was an exact copy of AoT and the atmosphere in the anime is basically the same as AoT. High energy with a lot screaming with a Sawano Hiroyuki OST in the background and in my opinion that is the wrong atmosphere for a. The only difference is that the main character immediately becomes something between humans and kabane (aka f***ing zombies) without any explanations whatsover. And without main characters dying.\\n\r\nAnother problem is that the writers thought that they could get away with giving no explanations whatsover. Everytime something happens we just have to believe it. This also happens in the first episode. Ikoma (main charactor) turns into a kabaneri and we don't get any explanation how he knows that he would turn into a kabaneri with that machine of his. We just need to believe that he knows what he's doing because he's the main character!\\n\r\nSpeaking of characters, this anime has two types of characters. 1. the annoying supporting characters who may have a mental disorder because the choices they make are unreasonable, unrealistic and just plain f***ing stupid.\\n\r\nThe second type of characters are the 'brave' , 'courageous' and sometimes edgy (*cough* mumei *cough*) main characters who are so painfully clich\u00e9 that everyone atleast have watched a decent amount of anime would cringe.\\n\r\nThat's in my opinion the biggest problem of this anime. The anime is so painfully clich\u00e9. There's almost to none innovation or originality when it comes to the story or the characters. And as an 'original' people are going to expect some sort of originality, but nope. It only makes the tiring zombie genre even more tiring.\\n\\n\r\nI can go on and on for hours why this anime in my opinion doesn't deserve the attention it got. But this review is long enough so i'm going to stop here.\\n\r\nKabaneri of the Iron Fortress isn't really worth anyone's time. And if you enjoyed it, good for you. I'm not going to judge anyone who liked this anime, but i just can't. This is definitely one of the worst anime i have ever watched. The only thing that keeps it away from being the worst anime i have ever watched, is that it isn't as insultingly bad as for example PUPA.\\n\\n\r\nIf you want some good zombie action I highly recommend the manga 'I Am A Hero'. I Am A Hero in comparison to Kabaneri atleast tries to innovate the already tiring zombie genre. And in my opinion it succeeds in a lot of ways.",

            "content": "Where steampunk meets samurai. I clicked on this anime out when it was under the genres of 'sci fi' and 'action' and so the first episode was something of a shocker, especially the uh, hair-tearing part. That's actually why I continued- for the shock factor which I really enjoyed, as well as the gorgeous art and sound.\r\nS T O R Y\r\nIs ok. Nothing groundbreaking, and I guess it gets a little meh and somewhat cringe-worthy at times (or maybe that's the dialogue). That being said, I really liked the pacing of this anime. I liked the whole trains thing, it was a huge plus tothe world building, which was decent, actually. \\n\r\nI think the whole anime was boosted a whole lot by the art and sound effects, tbh, and they are why I've given it such a high score.\\n\\n\r\nA R T  &  S O U N D\\n\r\nI legit fangirled over these aspects of the anime. Character designs are solid, and backgrounds are top notch quality. I literally paused at times just to stare at whatever backdrop was on at the time. Because the art is so beautiful, it adds to the picture of despair of the situation with the kabane. Or something like that.\\n\r\nThe audio really contributes to the atmosphere of this anime. Personally, I didn't care for the OP but everything else is spot on, I actually cried at moments.\\n\\n\r\nC H A R A C T E R\\n\r\nI really liked the whole cast, who have successfully wormed their ways into my heart. However, from an objective point of view, the characters too are just ok- a little flat, tbh.  That isn't to say you won't love them; you totally might. \\n\\n\r\nIn the end, I really enjoyed this anime, and episode 12 made me cry. Putting that out there for no reason. It has its vaaarious ups and downs, but overall it's pretty good, and better than a lot of crap out there. So I'm hovering between a 7 and an 8 for its final score. Ding! 7.5!",

            "content": "(This review has been adapted from my blog/reddit thread. Spoilers ahead!)\r\nKoutetsujou no Kabaneri has, as you may know, a lot of trains.\r\nI\u2019ve always wanted to ride a train myself. Not a subway or one of those speedy bullet ones. A traditional train with coal that fuels the engine and an old-timey design that hearkens back to 1800\u2019s America.\r\nThere\u2019s just something about sitting alone, putting the window up, and taking in the countryside as it rolls on by. Maybe I\u2019m drinking some cocoa from a teacup or clacking away on my laptop. Either way, I hope to someday cross this dream of mine off my bucketlist.\\n\\n\r\nKabaneri is not quite as relaxing \u2013 and not nearly as wishful.\\n\\n\r\nSTORY\\n\\n\r\nKabaneri stars Ikoma, a train engineer whose biggest hobby is investigating better ways to fend off the Kabane, zombie-like monsters that feast on the blood and flesh of humans. One day, a girl by the name of Mumei arrives at the city-state he calls home. And, following an unfortunate invasion of the Kabane, he, her, and many others find themselves traveling for Kongokaku, the main capital, to escape the menacing monsters.\\n\\n\r\nTo Kabaneri\u2019s credit, its first four episodes are very solid in their construction.\\n\\n\r\nThese episodes establish the setting and premise. Individualized habitats, the rules surrounding the Kabane (what getting bitten means, their heart cages, etc.). The importance of transportation, the suicide bags and weapons. The acrobatic fighting easily sets up what the show aims to be: a cool, gritty, and action-packed romp where humans struggle to survive.\\n\\n\r\nThese episodes introduce the steampunk motif. Massive metal trains carry goods and protect people. Pressurized, mechanical guns slow down the Kabane (or, in Ikoma\u2019s case, completely shreds them open). The master key, the cogged machinery, and the winding railroad tracks. While steampunk is not a new concept, its combination with the zombies and the survival-horror makes it all a more complete package.\\n\\n\r\nThese episodes create the necessary dynamics between the characters. Ikoma and Takumi\u2019s friendship. Mumei\u2019s \u201cmentoring\u201d of Ikoma and her dissonance with the humans. Kurusu\u2019s loyalty to Ayame and his distrust of Ikoma. The proper relationships are both created and tested, allowing for Kabaneri to have meaningful developments for them later.\\n\\n\r\nThese episodes start the anime\u2019s most important theme: fear. Yes, it can get pretty heavy-handed \u2013 people way overreacting, anti-logic when Mumei and Ikoma have clearly demonstrated their intent. But fear becomes a staple of the show. Especially when Takumi fears what Ikoma has become in that split second or the pandemonium that ensues when people start to not believe anybody whatsoever.\\n\\n\r\nSee? Solid.\\n\\n\r\nThe rest of the anime is not like a train that moves steadily onwards and reaches its destination in one piece. No. Instead, it turns into a boat at sea, punctured continually and taking on water at a faster and faster rate until the whole ship sinks.\\n\\n\r\nFollowing the first four episodes, the next three episodes focus on a small mini-arc with a crane and a new enemy as well as a stretch of downtime for the wearied heroes.\\n\\n\r\nIn regards to the mini-arc, the show starts to misstep. Despite how much Mumei has helped, and how they would be nowhere without her, the people aboard still view her as a nuisance. Sure, her saying it was nice that the kid\u2019s dog died is pretty mean, but it starts to get old hearing every human view her as vile.\\n\\n\r\nWorse still, a new mega-monster, codenamed the \u201cBlack Shadow,\u201d arrives. It technically acts as a prelude to the Nue (the horse-like, giant Kabane creature with wings) that appear later. But, transitioning from small, individualized enemies to a behemoth that cannot be reliably killed except through turret-fire makes it seem as though the anime ran out of (contextually) coherent ideas for the Kabane. (It also calls into question why the Kabane don\u2019t just always coagulate together.)\\n\\n\r\nThe anime also does not help itself when it mishandles both Enoku\u2019s involvement (the former \u201cear\u201d of Mumei\u2019s infamous \u201cbrother\u201d) and Mumei\u2019s own backstory.\\n\\n\r\nThe seventh episode, where the whole crew reaches Shitori Station and basically takes the day off, turns its tonal crank in the complete opposite direction. To be fair, this episode highlights how not all is lost around the world despite the atrocities seen thus far. Yet the tonal shift from brutal and horrifying to cutesy and lighthearted (and then back to the former for the remainder of the season) does not strike that execution chord.\\n\\n\r\nThe ship\u2019s already starting to go under. But wait. The absolute worst aspect of Kabaneri now arrives (which is easily guessed): Biba.\\n\\n\r\nFor the last five episodes, it is almost nothing else besides Biba this and Biba that. The show may as well have changed its title from Koutetsujou no Kabaneri to Captain Biba Single-Handedly Sinks the Ship.\\n\\n\r\nEven disregarding that the Hunters are a group that come out of nowhere, Biba screams plot problems and writing issues.\\n\\n\r\nBiba kills Enoku (who was, in turn, trying to kill Biba) and smiles? Ikoma now has a personal vendetta against the pink-haired pretty boy that would rival any known nemeses.\\n\\n\r\nThe Kabane got too boring? Here comes Biba with a super-drug that turns Kabaneri into unstable monstrosities.\\n\\n\r\nBiba is a conniving miscreant that always gets away with his plans, even when his own father literally proclaims out loud that he knows his son is up to something? Well, of course, because he\u2019s Biba.\\n\\n\r\nBut the biggest buffoonery that Biba brings? His laughable logic.\\n\\n\r\nWith Biba around, the anime tries to heavily push its other, less nuanced strong-versus-weak theme. Admittedly, it fits Biba\u2019s arrogance, but it makes next to no sense. He claims that the weak are weak because they don\u2019t try to fight back. That killing a bunch of helpless civilians is \u201c\u2026the world of fairness and equality that we\u2019ve been striving for.\u201d That \u201chuman cowardice breeds war.\u201d (Quotes are his words.)\\n\\n\r\nTo achieve his ends, he kills hundreds, thousands of people. But them already surviving, fighting back by creating cities and guns and means of transportation, prove that they are strong. Plus, Biba putting them all in such a vile situation of his own volition goes against his argument. Him forcing the issue proves his words wrong \u2013 it is unfair what he is doing, and he himself, not cowardice, is breeding this war.\\n\\n\r\nAnd it is this combination of Biba and his new theme that is the show\u2019s downfall. Where once the anime was focused on the Kabane and fear, it devolves into the Biba show, featuring his monologues on strength and his various actions that are nothing short of inane.\\n\\n\r\nFear does make the occasional cameo, like when the residents of Kongokaku turn on one another, but it is clear that Kabaneri shifts its focus in an oh-so-wrong way. (Not to mention everybody forgot that Mumei was the catalyst to Shitori Station\u2019s Kabane invasion. And that Takumi died. And that everything is perfectly fine even though all of Kongokaku was decimated.)\\n\\n\r\nThe list of issues that Biba creates, while not infinite, are too many to display. Suffice it to say that, whenever Biba is on-screen (and he is on-screen a lot in these last five episodes), he only brings the show down further.\\n\\n\r\nAnd so, despite how strong the story started, it wavers in the middle, only to have Biba single-handedly puncture more holes into this ship than anything or anyone else did, sending the whole fortress into a watery grave.\\n\\n\r\nANIMATION\\n\\n\r\nWhile Kabaneri\u2019s story more or less devolves into a mess, its art and its animation remain high in quality throughout its run.\\n\\n\r\nSpecifically, the character designs have a throwback aesthetic that reminds the audience of a somewhat older look. Their crisp facial features (eyes, shading) aid in this reminder. The various accessories (both mechanical and traditional), the magma-like ley-lines. The accentuated colors (blues, reds, and pinks contrast with the dreary greys, browns, blacks, and greens). The changing outfits. And don\u2019t forget the bulging back muscles. All give Kabaneri\u2019s character designs further praise.\\n\\n\r\nNot to be outdone, the lighting and backdrops add to the experience. From daylight that dazzles to moonlight that haunts, the anime maximizes its characters and its events through effective light usage. As for the backgrounds, their scale, including wide shots of forested terrains and burning villages, combined with the lighting, create expansive, detailed locations.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of scale, the anime only relies on CG artistry for two notable purposes: the trains and the Black Shadow monster. The former gets the job done in that it looks like a metallic, sturdy locomotive. The latter, while not quite as threatening as the creators were perhaps going for, keeps from being too distracting.\\n\\n\r\nAnd actual animation remains high and consistent throughout its run. Mumei\u2019s segments in particular \u2013 with her flipping, running, and battling \u2013 are the more obvious examples of where the show shines animation-wise. But its eye, hair, and extremity movements, such as when Ikoma chokes himself nearly to death or when Ayame-sama offers up her blood as a contract, highlight Kabaneri\u2019s attention to animated detail.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS\\n\\n\r\nLike the story, the cast of Kabaneri do not start off on the wrong foot. They start to trip over their own feet the further along they walk. Except for Biba. He does not even know how to move his legs properly.\\n\\n\r\nIkoma is driven by a sense of pride. At a young age, he and his sister would often play together, but, when the Kabane came, he left her behind to save himself. He vowed to never run away again, hoping to become a person that his sister could be proud of.\\n\\n\r\nThis motivation of his leads him to the creation of a new weapon to fight the Kabane \u2013 as well as him getting bitten and turning into a Kabaneri. From there, he demonstrates his will, perseverance, and focus, through training by Mumei, taking bite after bite, and declaring his hatred for the Kabane.\\n\\n\r\nHe has some nice moments, like when he used Mumei\u2019s grapple-and-throw technique against the Wazatori or when he remade his persona with drug-injection and body-amplification. Yet most of his time is spent defeating Biba and protecting Mumei, both of which he is not too successful at.\\n\\n\r\nAnd therein lays Ikoma\u2019s biggest problem. Kabaneri doesn\u2019t make enough of an effort to create a bond between Ikoma and his sister and Ikoma and Mumei. Especially when this parallel is the one they were going for when Takumi asks Ikoma about it. Ikoma says it is a voice telling him to help Mumei, or that maybe it is God. Takumi tells him he\u2019s doing it because that\u2019s simply who he is. All a bunch of vague non-answers.\\n\\n\r\nEpisode six, where he fends off the Kabane from a trapped Mumei, is perhaps his strongest scene. Here, he protects Mumei and simultaneously explains his argument about weakness and not accepting fate. Unfortunately, because Biba shows up shortly after, his actions and his words mean nothing to the ignorant Mumei.\\n\\n\r\nThe show tries to go a different route. Namely, Ikoma declares he will turn Mumei back into a human again. Yet the jump in goals holds no prior basis \u2013 it was always about killing the Kabane not saving the Kabaneri. Plus, said goal isn\u2019t even resolved come the end of the season let alone strived for.\\n\\n\r\nSame goes for Ikoma\u2019s \u201crelationship\u201d with Biba. He hates the guy. That\u2019s it. Ikoma may go after Biba for manipulating Mumei, but Ikoma\u2019s anger suddenly bursting into existence is not well-reasoned. One hates the weak and the other hates people who hate the weak. Yeah. (Ikoma and Biba not having their own quarrel does not help either.)\\n\\n\r\nMumei is similar. She\u2019s clearly skilled at dealing with the Kabane given her flippant attitude and acrobatic maneuvers. Boosted further by her Kabaneri characteristic which, expectedly, makes the others wary, scared of her person.\\n\\n\r\nMumei does not particularly mind, though. She simply does what she wants, knowing that nobody can really stop her.\\n\\n\r\nEarly on, Mumei is this stalwart, scary siren. When the show hits the halfway mark, it finally starts to delve into her a bit more. A feeling of isolation that drives her to do everything solo. A past filled with the death of her friends. A fear of turning into one of the Kabane.\\n\\n\r\nOnce Biba arrives, however, her naivete shines. Opening the gates to let the Kabane in and refusing to listen to Ikoma highlight this trait well enough.\\n\\n\r\nKabaneri reveals where it comes from. As a child, her mother died to save her daughter. Luckily, Biba arrived then, but, rather than reaching out a hand, he gave her the means to fight back. Which she did, killing the man that murdered her mother. From then on, she trusted in Biba and his words. To the point that she became a Kabaneri herself.\\n\\n\r\nThese details appear as she sits on the side since Biba effectively steals any spotlight. Similar to Ikoma, her relationship with Biba is not explored beyond this small flashback, leaving her adoration for the man as questionable.\\n\\n\r\nAt this point, the anime attempts to mature her. The deaths of innocents and reminiscing of previous actions (specifically killing the pregnant-woman-turned-Kabane and the mother-daughter-double-suicide) lead her to rebel against Biba.\\n\\n\r\nRebelling fails, and, from then on, she exists to be saved by Ikoma and nothing more. She maintains part of her mind when it\u2019s revealed that she purposely missed stabbing Ikoma in the heart. But she does not fight back on her own. Besides, of course, by dropping Ikoma\u2019s precious stone. An event meant to be meaningful but comes off as silly.\\n\\n\r\nGranted, Ikoma protecting Mumei was his whole character purpose, so Mumei saving herself was out of the question. They get at this path when she lands the ultimate killing blow against Biba. A moving-on move. But when she was defined as a powerful person then devolved into a weak-willed individual, her transformation is less a change for the better and more a breakdown of what made her worthwhile to begin with.\\n\\n\r\nEspecially when her issues are caused by Biba, Kabaneri\u2019s joke of a character.\\n\\n\r\nHe\u2019s alluded to a bit as this grand defender of man and defeater of Kabane. And he demonstrates his reputation during his first small scuffle. Afterwards, fame gives way to villainy as he mercilessly seeks to achieve his one true goal: revenge against his father.\\n\\n\r\nBiba betrays others, kills hundreds, and tosses aside those close to him without remorse. He figures that most people are weak and that a father who feared him and left him to rot are reason enough to see his dream become reality.\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately for Biba, he is just not a captivating enemy. He does not actually do any of the dirty work, letting Horobi and his other lackeys do it instead. His riding-on-a-horse-with-dad flashback is the anime\u2019s extremely meager attempt at trying to make the murder of his father sympathetic. And he can only seem to spout monologues filled with superfluous, eye-rolling words on weakness.\\n\\n\r\nThe show had fear in mind for Biba, like when Horobi almost killed him or when he dueled against Ikoma. Kabaneri\u2019s story relies on a theme of fear, so seeing it briefly in his character created a glimmer of hope.\\n\\n\r\nHope that was quickly dashed. His \u201cacceptance\u201d that Mumei found a \u201ccoward\u201d (his word) and his final gunshot that saves Ikoma end his character on weirdness and frustration. Crushed beneath a bunch of heavy rocks. Exactly where he belongs: flattened and forgotten.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND\\n\\n\r\nKabaneri picks itself up again with the different parts of its music.\\n\\n\r\nThe opening track takes the crown. It starts off charged, then quickly goes reserved, refusing to show its hand right away. It builds and builds until it jumps with the chant, creating a hyped and rocking tune that continues until the ending choir bit.\\n\\n\r\nThe ending track is not as stellar, but its soft singing and subtle vibe contrast well with the brutal content of the show itself. Its latter half does get louder, but the vocalists and the emotion offset the switching tone. Sadly, the ED, unlike its OP counterpart, is not that memorable of a piece.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack from Hiroyuki Sawano has his signature resounding sound. While not his best (that goes to a reminiscent yet stronger anime), and while some of the tracks are off-putting (\u201cJAnoPAN\u201d comes to mind), it still passes. The OST adds to the action and the tension through its loudness, its drops, and its pacing. The heaviness and the hype are there, too (as are the non-Japanese lyrics). Especially the track where the female vocalist hits her notes solo.\\n\\n\r\n(Side note: Not even the OST is safe from Biba\u2019s reign. One of the tracks is literally titled \u201cVIVALABIBA.\u201d Made me laugh out loud when I read it. What an anime.)\\n\\n\r\nSound-effects are also top-notch. The pressurized steam releasing from canisters. Kabane hearts exploding to chimes. Their train barreling down the tracks. In short, the show not only looks the part but sounds the part as well.\\n\\n\r\nAnd while the voice-acting performances are not notable, the Kabane and their ghoulish screams add to the horror that their kind induce.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT\\n\\n\r\nSome of my readers may know that I loathe infallible characters. I cannot stand them.\\n\\n\r\nAs such, Biba shoots right up near the top of the list of dumbest and least liked characters I have ever had to endure. And that\u2019s all I\u2019ll say about him; he doesn\u2019t deserve any more attention.\\n\\n\r\nI did like Mumei in the beginning when she was fun and strong, but, the further the anime progressed, the more she got on my nerves. Yes, not-going-to-name-him manipulated her mind her whole life. But that does not mean I am not allowed to find her actions both questionable and annoying.\\n\\n\r\nIkoma was cool at the start, too, like when he was ticked off at the others onboard for leaving him behind, wanting them to remember who it was that saved their hides. Yet he, too, slowly fell into uncool territory. Especially when his motivations moved away from his sister and fighting the Kabaneri to protecting Mumei.\\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s a shame. The concept \u2013 fighting against zombies with steampunk gear \u2013 is radical. Mumei flipping through the air, shooting her guns and hurling spears, is awesome. The hybrid Kabaneri idea, while not necessarily unique, is interesting.\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately, so much of the show is off-putting \u2013 especially in the last two-thirds of the season \u2013 that it makes it difficult to like it in its entirety.\\n\\n\r\nKoutetsujou no Kabaneri has art that shines and music that glistens, but the rest of it is a dull experience. The story devolves into a one-man rodeo, the characters\u2019 lack purpose, and a lot of its coolness is lost amidst the frustrating turn most of its moving parts take. The show is not exactly a regrettable watch, but it\u2019s not going on any bucket lists anytime soon.\\n\\n\r\nSUMMARY\\n\\n\r\nStory: Bad, a train-like ship that stays afloat for a third of the trip, starts taking on water midway through, and sinks completely thanks to its captain, Biba\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: Great, nice character designs, nice art, and above-average actual animation\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Bad, Ikoma and Mumei start off strong but are led astray by Biba\u2019s incredible penchant for incompetence\\n\\n\r\nSound: Fine, good OP, okay ED, okay OST, good sound-effects, okay VA performances\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Bad, Mumei could be cool, and the Kabane premise is interesting, but Biba\u2019s presence ruins so much of the entertainment\\n\\n\r\nFinal Score: 4/10",

Hell yes.\r\nIn a nutshell : an apocalyptic anime mixing steam and blood, zombies and trains, classic character design, with a serious and realistic mood and much less moe crap, and great atmosphere.\r\nI'm getting 'classic' vibe from this anime (which is a good thing imo), and for some reason it activates nostalgia mode for me, and it also has a weird coloring scheme which would take a little getting used to.\r\nAside from that, I am quite enjoying  it! the soundtrack! the characters! the mix of steam and blood! this animehad me feeling excitement that I didn't feel for a long time watching an anime.\\n\\n\r\nAnd I must say that I love Ikuma's appearance and voice, It's goes damn well with steam punk and medieval style.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation quality is superb! although I'd wished there was little more action for Ikuma instead of Mume.\\n\\n\r\nThe main plot seems weak, but the atmosphere and survival feel compensate greatly, you won't care about a main plot when watching this, you'd care what happens to the characters how will they survive.\\n\\n\r\nI also feel that the first episode was a bit rushed, it could have built more excitement for the viewer, but it was nevertheless exciting at the end.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime is not a masterpiece, but it rises high above your common zombie- fanservice-filled shows, I like how seriously it takes itself, you won't find all that moe crap and expressions here.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

Those who checked it only because of hype are not going in for the reason that they aim for.\r\nThey like to make thriller action that looks and sounds amazing.\r\nOf course, they reused some aspects that can be called out and result in unimpressive and unprogressive, however I waslooking for some visual spice and this was it, done again and pulled off nicer than they did before.\\n\\n\r\nThat's probably the big thing about this show, it's all about the visuals.\\n\\n\r\nThey do a couple of things that I like to run into that clearly others do not like, but I think of it as shaking it up a bit.\\n\\n\r\nToo commonly do we expect to see a villain's good side or their story to justify their action. Instead here, no matter what his motivation, we have a villain of his own chaos.\\n\\n\r\nA villain who did wrong for his own damn selfish wants. Holding a grudge of several years, he acts out his revenge even when humanity is at a very critical point that faces extinction. But what does he care for others? He want's his goals realize. \"Screw the rest, I come first.\"\\n\\n\r\nThe scene where we see a tear come from him, is a tear of sweat.\\n\\n\r\nIt was a tear of fear of his own selfish goals being incomplete. Not because the close ones who loved him had to change or be affected, not because he witnessed something he cared for, no it was just him nervous that he almost died.\\n\\n\r\nIt's one of the reasons why people loved to hate Kefka, that ruler was chaos, never with or for a shred of good.\\n\\n\r\nAnother thing that people didn't like was how vulnerable our main female lead was. The community wants to see shining examples of excellence and perfection. I think its interesting to see someone get played by their own or others human emotions, instincts, and thoughts.\\n\r\nThis young girl looked up to her brother and was betrayed by him. She didn't want to believe it, but she had to learn harshly that he isn't such a godsend as she once thought.\\n\\n\r\nBasically, this show lets itself be  black and white. It's plain and simple what it is doing and what it is. People with hype or expectations wanted something twisted or mind-blowing, but instead we have a solid bar that travels to neither greatness or terribleness, just strictly fine.",

            "content": "I've noticed that a lot of reviews of this anime will likely lead you to believe that Koutetsujou no Kabaneri is some kind of terrible show that isn't worth anyone's time. I'm here to disagree, because I find it overall pretty fun to watch, and I think that's all it needs to be.\r\nBased on the hype for this anime as it was airing, I suppose most people would come in with expectations that it would either be \"the next Attack on Titan\" or else just generally good enough to be anime of the season. Well it's neither of these things, so discard those thoughts nowand approach this with a clearer mind. \\n\\n\r\nI hope you don't mind a shorter review, but I'm just going to list what I think are Koutetsujou no Kabaneri's most basic weaknesses and strengths as quickly as possible. It's honestly a pretty straightforward experience so I don't think it requires much depth to explain.\\n\\n\r\nSo for one thing, the art and animation are pretty spectacular, which is great because OH MY GOD THAT SETTING!!! Seriously, samurai + zombies + steampunk? Sign me the fuck up, that's awesome! I mean sure, it's just a mashup of cool things that anyone could come up with, but it IS really cool and the animation totally does these themes justice. The strongest point of the whole anime is its action scenes, and they are truly well-made and fun to watch. The soundtrack also enhances the experience, and personally I really enjoyed the OP and ED a lot.\\n\\n\r\nWhere the show stops shining is the plot and characters. For the first half of the anime, rather than really following a clear plot, it just sets up the main character's position in the world and gives the audience some really entertaining action scenes. After that though, Biba is introduced. Biba isn't entertaining to watch, and in a way his influence becomes something of a toxin on the rest of the characters which makes everything less exciting and a lot more frustrating. And the actual plot of the show revolves around this more than anything else. Now, I don't think that the direction this show went is necessarily BAD, but I do think I would have preferred if it could have retained some of the initial badassery that the main cast had up until that point. I waver between a 6/10 and a 7/10 for this anime, and the lack of me caring about any of the characters as of the second half is what's kind of keeping it at a 6 right now.\\n\\n\r\nStill, I had a lot of fun watching the beginning parts, and the action was still really great all throughout the anime. It slips up and loses sight of the badass-ness that it could have been partway through, but in the end, I don't think it's fair to write it off as a waste of time. Give it a shot if you haven't seen it, its plot and characters may not live up to the great action scenes, but the action scenes are pretty rad and it makes for an all-around enjoyable experience to watch.",

Story lines can be the same, but there's a big difference in one that's well-made and one that's crappy which is the main issue I had with people calling aspects of this anime \"generic\".

People complain it's not realistic enough? It's a damn steampunk zombie apocalypse where trains are basically castles on rails.\r\nAttack on Titan isn't realistic either so I've got no idea why everyone started to hate on this for not being realistic. The story is decent enough and the action is really cool and well done.\r\nI will say the story is semi similar to that of Tokyo Ghoul andAttack on Titan but it has a lot of originality in it as well which makes it unique from the other 2 I mentioned \\n\\n\r\nDefinitely recommend watching this as there's nothing wrong with it, people just have higher expectations after watching AoT and they compare the 2.",

            "content": "I often see the same kind of long reviews that say too much and nothing I actually wanted to know. I HATE SPOILERS, but I also don't want to waste my time with a story that starts great but decays and ends poorly or one where, after all their trouble, the couple doesn't end up together.. for no reason at all.\r\nSo I thought I should review in a different way, YES or NO answers to the questions:\r\n - IS THE ENDING GOOD?\r\n - DOES THE MAIN COUPLE END TOGETHER?\r\n - IS IT WORTH MY TIME? \r\n***If you don't want to know the answers to these3 questions you should stop reading right now.***\\n\r\nIf you're like me who just want to know if the story is worth your time, go ahead. So with no further ado:\\n\\n\r\nIs the ending good? YES\\n\r\nDoes the main couple end up together? YES\\n\r\nIs it worth my time? YES\\n\\n\\n\r\nBRIEF FULL REVIEW: The story has nothing to do with Attack on Titan, the war survival vibe is similar so if you liked that theme you'll like this too.This story doesn't have explicit romance but nuances of it since the main couple care about each other to a ridiculous extent. For me their relationship is the heart of the story. It's animation is ridiculously well made, so is the soundtrack. The characters are not annoying and do their best and the ending is very fitting regarding their journey, not a sad end at all. The story continues on a movie sequel called \"Koutetsujou no Kabaneri Movie 3: Unato Kessen\" that airs in 2019. \\n\\n\\n\r\nEXTRA:\\n\r\nOf course this is all my opinion, but I'd say I'm a pretty ordinary, sane and romantic person, just so you can have an idea of who wrote this. I absolutely HATE SPOILERS with all my might! But I also don't like to waste my time browsing through LONG OPINIONATED reviews only to be more confused than I was before, not find the answers I was looking for and usually bumping into unwanted spoilers. Because of all this I intend to make my reviews brief, focusing on answering these three questions. If you like this kind of review I try my best to write in all animes and mangas I've experienced, so you can see a complete list of reviews next to my name just above. \\n\\n\r\nThank you, you're welcome and peace out. ^^",

            "content": "\"THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS\"\r\nThis anime sadly is getting much more flack than what its worth for two main reasons, hype(which never works out ever, seriously why do you get hyped it never works instead hate it so that you can be mildly surprised, like me) and the fact that it reminds of Attack on Titan.\r\nI would first like to show the similarities between Aot and kabaneri with my thoughts of if they are similar in the brackets\r\nthere are human eating monsters in both( normally monsters eat humans in all media.)\r\nthere are big walls(well how are you going to keep the threat out without them.)\r\nMc getsthe power of the bad guys but retains sanity(in general it is not that uncommon eg parasyte, tokyo ghoul)\\n\r\nhas epic girl sidekick who saves Main characters ass (cant argue there)\\n\r\nThe steam punk style(why the fuck would they make the style so obviously similar...) \\n\\n\r\nIn general i would say that its story is the weakest part of it since zombie stories have been milked to death and thus nothing original can be made. I like the fact that the people are mobile through trains and kabane do not feel as if they are such a big threat (without human intervention) \\n\r\nLastly i have to admit that the main antagonist is absolutely and completely crap but i will discuss him more in the character's section.Comedic relief is non-existent except of a person with a really bad accent, which is a problem since at times the story takes itself very seriously. For example killing of small kids, dismemberment etc thus the only relief/ happiness you get is literally smiles and people not dying for some time. While swiss cheese has less plot holes truthfully (spoiler)like even the main character surviving at the end was because of a plot hole.  Ikomas plot armour is astounding they literally made him into a Jedi to save him from a train with no clear reason as to why(other than he's special and has black blood).\\n\\n\r\nNow im going to discuss the art style;\\n\r\nI really like the fight scenes especially scene 2 where they first introduce mumei's badassery. It was amazing while some people say it has fan service but all I saw was a very plain white pantsu for three frames. That is it. THE most fanservicy thing are moments where the art style changes ever so slightly when focusing on female characters especially mumei as if they want you to stop and take screenshot eg when she wears ikoma's cape and hold her gun up. Yes that was annoying since its like they where saying \"she is hot, like her\" but it was sparse enough to not be a big problem with like an instance per episode. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 1 words: epic\\n\r\nThe op starts of with the \"are you human or kabane/neither I'm kabaneri\" which instantly becomes the catchphrase and also shows ikomas biggest weakness which will be described in the characters section. The op is made by egoist a fairly big band but is not one of their best, the ed (well there are three of them) the first is the op and only plays on ep 1 the second which is the most common plays in 2-10, 12 and is ninelie by egoist again lastly the ed of ep. 11 is through my blood by aimer. All very nice songs. Lastly the fight scene of episode 2 had a great ost warcry (not sure by who) so even the music within the show itself is not bad. The only gripe i have is the line in the opening is said before we are explained what kabaneri are in the same episode. Thus it gets spoiled ever so slightly.\\n\\n\r\nAs for characters i will discuss only the ones of any importance\\n\r\nIn general the characters where generic except from a few but nowadays coming up with original characters are hard since everything has been done atleast once before and new characters are combinations of ones before.\\n\\n\r\nMumei-  She is your typical badass hothead that believes she can kill everyone by herself but fails causing more trouble. Oh and did i forget to mention she is bipolar. When she thinks of her brother she for some reason instantly gets wet and moody like literally and her next line will be always \"i have to be strong\" until Ikoma snaps her out of it. She is blessed with the largest character development within the show. At first she starts as just one of her brothers hounds, which believes in her brothers wrong ideals but changes thanks to ikoma over time (spoiler) even betraying him in the end.\\n\\n\r\nIkoma- is your typical hero with a good heart and great ideals but is leagues better than eren due to his passion. Whenever he speaks you feel that it is always from his heart, never lies or is skimming but sadly all this passion gets passed to his voice meaning THAT HE ALWAYS FUCKEN SHOUTS FROM OP TO ED. His passion for science can be seen in the air bullets, his gun, when he first became a \\n\r\nkabaneri. His passion for his ideals is seen from when he instantly meets biba and when he snaps mumei out of it. His hate for kabane can be seen in his speech where they where holding the festival. In general unlike eren he has passion for his goals and shouts rather than whine about it. Sadly thats it he never becomes anything more or less, this is a story of a man who is perfect from the get go, he has passion as saitama has strength, they can not be surpassed. That is what biba realises in the end. Lastly i like the difference between Ikomas fighting style and mumeis which even mumei acknowledges that he is her shield. If we take it in gaming terms he is a melee bruiser while she is a quick moving assassin (it was even confirmed by the scientist that he has a raised pain tolerance). While what  is original about it is the fact that he is a buff nerd who became buff because he was a badass sadly most anime main characters either are born bad ass or get lucky few are badass nerds(only badass nerd i can think of who didn't get lucky is the mc from BTOOM!! and no game no life but they are both weak).\\n\\n\r\nAyame- the meaning of best leader she risks her own life many times to save her people and has a great judge of character. She is the contradiction of the shoguns fear showing her fearlessness and is what biba strives to become. She would be the perfect leader if only her own skills in combat where not that bad. She luckily doesnt have to fight because of her bodygaurd kurusu.\\n\\n\r\nkurusu- is one of the most generic characters in this story in general. He is the typical samurai who believes in honour. While his own story is the story of the bodygaurd falling in love with the person he is trying to protect. Most generic character award goes to kurusu.\\n\\n\r\nBiba- (spoilers) is a weird case, normally i can understand a villains motives and it is quite easy most of the time but his motives are weird. We have to take things slowly with him. Firstly he wants to take revenge on his father for making him go to a suicide mission out of fear. We are never explained though why he's father is scared of him (because he is a kabaneri, or did he become one after?) he also does not even do a coup for power instead he goes and literally slaughters EVERYTHING that moves\" he then goes and fights ikoma one on one but somehow ikoma became a jedi and thus obviously won. Ikoma gets weak and falls to the ground biba shoots him with a needle filled with white blood, why?? Some say he finally found a true fearless hero and wanted to save him, others say he wanted the fight to continue with a non jedi ikoma. Anyways. Biba is a massive Plot hole.\\n\\n\r\nThe general population within the train are mostly original with few villager number 2 faces thus you do get sad when they die. Of which this happens continuously also many dislike the people for hating on outsiders but these people who hate the villagers have not seen how racist the world can truly be. Like literally, the kabaneri asked for blood for gods sake out of nowhere its not like the villagers don't have a point.\\n\\n\r\nThis show was really enjoyable especially if you watch it for the action parts where it really does shine maybe i would even give a 10/10 for those parts but do not try to t analyse the story or characters too much or you will be left with the sour taste of lost potential like a 5/10. thus all together an 8/10.\\n\r\nIn general I REALLY want a season two of this since this had potential. While I also believe that while AoT had a better plot it had 25 episodes to describe the story while this had 12. I want a season 2 not because this season was bad, which it was not but to use as a crutch to help the story forward. I believe that a season 2 is required with a better villain/villains and more plot explanations. Since this did better on things that AoT cant fix with a new season like a better MC and cuter badass girl who actually smiles, weaker enemies allowing for more sincere moments within fights, also more badass moments since hordes of enemies look better than just one enemy fighting 50 good guys, there is also a larger skill difference between the average fighter and a main character which emphasises the skill of the main characters.\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "The AoT that was never meant to be\r\nFor the first few episodes, Kabaneri was just your atypical action show. After a quick introduction to the setting \u2013 essentially the same as Attack on Titan but with a trains and zombie\u2019s motif - two of the possibly greatest human inventions combined! Yet unlike Kabaneri\u2019s emo as fuck brother who thinks killing characters every 10 seconds is the equivalent of a good writer masturbating, Kabaneri fortunately hails that so-called \u2018modern masterpiece of narcissistic entropy\u2019 to slit its god damn throat and breaks that shit down to its bare-bones basics. By basics: a switch your brain off actionshow. Just ignore the magic of how a single person can kill a million zombies out of god knows where.\\n\\n\r\nMy first impressions gave me some fate that the damn thing is going to be good up until the very end\u2026 on the other hand, this is modern; you think this shit will stay consistent, but it eventually succumbs into evaporating diarrhea. I suppose Wit wasn\u2019t satisfied enough after Seraph not becoming as big as a hit as it would have meant to be (which was a decent show, wink!). Thus, they wanted Kabaneri to be so akin as possible with AoT. They tried to put sympathetic and emotional weight to the character\u2019s actions, and even abandoning the over powered main character \u2013 as a means to what? Make me sob? Or that people get salty because they are only given a bit of rice for lunch during an apocalyptic setting? Don\u2019t even get me started at the amount of shouting the protagonist does; I swear he spends more energy bitching about how dangerous a situation is and expressing basic status of depression, rather than just killing the damn zombies. Which was all what I wanted to see!\\n\\n\r\nAmusingly there were no character deaths throughout the whole thing. Yeah there were the zero-dimensional civilians but they are almost - literally cannon fodder for the pseudo CGI backgrounds and an excuse to make the zombie apocalyptic setting. If you exclude that hundreds of thousands of people death toll, you realise that no one fucking dies! Not even the support characters, who are just there to make conversations for the protagonist and support development even die. It\u2019s like the opposite of AoT: where a few minutes of screen time is given to certain side characters, and they die without even getting my overly sensitive ex to give a shit. And the characters are one dimensional as hell, so who even cares?\\n\\n\r\nDid I mention that the protagonist, Ikoma, is a more badass version of Eren? At least Ikoma gets shit done, and doesn\u2019t whine nearly as often as that emo kid. They\u2019re pretty similar, so expect archetypal plot armor moments. But I do question: if Ikoma can enhance his bodily performance to a demi-Kabane, would it more convenient to have a few more people with the same augmentations? All what you had to do is cure yourself of a Kabane disease, and simples. How do these zombies even came to be? How does the blood circulation pseudo-science even work?

I don\u2019t know why he reminds me of Shadow the Hedgehog.\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion, Kabane Iron Fortress was first a mindless action show which I would praise it like a gem from all the cancer that is modern anime.

My personal favourite anime and I would recommend it to anyone who is particularly interested in animation or anyone who is just looking for some pure entertainment. (Also probably great for beginners who need something to get them into anime) admittedly not the greatest story however it more than makes up for it in spectacle and atmosphere. Kabaneri of the Iron Fortress is often compared to attack on Titan as they are both from Wit Studio, an unhelpful comparison as they have two completely different goals and creative vision. Kabaneri is it\u2019sown anime and one that you should watch if you haven\u2019t already!",

WIT Studio decide to bring us an anime which has a similar concept but can stand on its own as an anime. \r\nKoutetsujyo no Kabaneri is set in an apocalyptic scenario where the creatures as known as Kabane roam the world. This leads to the creating of trains being a form of transport that allows those who can fight to travel to differentstations that have not been taken over by the Kabane. \\n\\n\r\nThe anime itself is good and I think it personally deserves a bit more love. \\n\\n\r\nThere's no point writing about what the episodes contain as probably a lot of people have watched it. \\n\\n\r\nI'll make this a small review, but in my opinion a lot of the art, sound and enjoyment were up there as I really enjoyed how the anime looked. \\n\\n\r\nStory wise, I have given it a 7 due to the fact that it's not an original concept but at least it kept me hooked to the anime regardless of it going downhill from episode 8 on wards. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters were quite good, but not good enough for me to give it anything higher than a 6, since some characters made dumb decisions and messed up the story a little bit. The character that had the most development were Ayame and Kurusu, from the first episode to the last. \\n\\n\r\nOver all, I enjoyed how the anime turned out to be since it's something we haven't had in a long time and it's kind of cool to have a mixture of steampunk and zombies. \\n\\n\r\nI think the anime needs a little more love, as us from the anime community expect too much from WIT studio. That's just my opinion, and its unfair of how bad the rating is since it isn't that bad.",

            "content": "Zombies have been a staple in all sorts of media throughout the west. When it comes to anime zombies aren't exactly Unheard of but still are fairly prevalent within the medium. An example of this would be High School of the dead or the manga I am a hero. However today I am talking about an anime that comes from a studio that has produced a famous anime you've probably heard of, and that anime is attack on Titan. \r\n Kabaneri of the iron fortress is a twelve episode anime series that debuted in the spring 2016 season. Kabaneri stood out from other titlesdue to its steampunk setting and stunning animation quality. However it was met with widespread criticism as the series progressed into the second half and went from an 8.3 on MAL to about a 7.6. This is a significant drop in such a short timeframe. While I see some people giving it very low scores I weighted my enjoyment and the actual quality of the anime together into one score. \\n\\n\r\nThe story of kabaneri takes place in a island country very similar to Japan that is suffering from a zombie apocalypse. Then there is this basic protagonist who is trying to develop a way to kill the zombies also known as kabane. He than meets several other characters and it follows them as they try to survive.\\n\\n\r\nThe story wasn't that bad at first. It starts out as a pretty linear survival action story with some good entertainment value. However during the second half what happens is, is that a new character gets introduced and than the story becomes much more convoluted and confusing. Than the story ends up losing all of its charm and becomes very confusing for the viewer to experience. It kind of strays away from that fun mindless popcorn flick and just becomes something that's way too complex for its own good. However there is some kick ass action scenes in this anime which is amplified by a great musical score and amazing animation. Another great thing was the actual kabane concept because it was different from other zombies throughout media. Despite this taking place in Japan, there was some great world building present throughout the anime using industrial revolution and the stations.\\n\\n\r\nPeople always say that good characters can save a mediocre story and for the most part I really do agree with  this concept. However what really makes this anime just ok is the characters. With good characters this anime could have merited a much higher score. However all of them were just so bland and lifeless.\\n\\n\r\nIkoma is the standard vengeful angry MC who is looking for revenge. He also has a very cliched back story that we've seen in many other characters. He also suffers from the half breed cliche because the story decided to make him a half zombie( LIKE WE HAVENT SEEN THAT ONE BEFORE.) Mumei is a Loli half zombie who has a cool design but seems to be a generic tsundere. However she had a good relationship with Ikoma and Biba. You have princess Ayama who isn't really developed that well. Kurusu has a cool design but no development or back story. And the list goes on. We needed more characterization to make these characters more relatable. Biba was a decent villain despite being bland, he had good motivation though.\\n\\n\r\nThe three greatest parts of this anime were the art,music, and action. The action in this anime was actually really good with great fluidity and it works with the zombie concept. The art was lovely with some great lighting and polish. There was also some great color thrown in as well. The music was epic with some great voice work and epic tunes that worked in various scenes. \\n\\n\r\n In conclusion Iron fortress was kind of a let down. It serves well as a popcorn flick you can watch with your friends but it soon dissolves into overblown convoluted concepts. This takes the charm away. However this is worth watching if you like zombies and action but don't expect too much out of it.",

Logic can still be used on fictional works as long as the rules stipulated are consistent and the logic is based on those very rules. When something happens that seemingly contradicts what has been established it can be very jarring for many people and at this point the best thing to do is to throw said logic out the window. I love the art-style and animation of this anime. This anime was very funand enjoyable for me and as an action anime it excels, but be warned to fully enjoy this anime you must suspend disbelief.

            "content": "TLDR; Its a fun show, its cheesy and derpy and has some pretty blatant flaws, but if you just want a fun actiony show to watch then its pretty ok.\r\nThis show hooked me. It had a pretty strong opening few episodes in my opinion. Once you get deeper into the show though it becomes a little repetitive and predictable.\r\nOn r/anime they pointed out some really glaring flaws that I thought I should mention. Sometimes the zombies show up out of no where and sometimes people do things completely out of character.\r\nThe story isn't really worth it. Generic apocalypse shit with some weird theme. Instead ofwalls (like in attack on titan) its trains.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is alright and animation isn't bad. It was consistent throughout the season, unlike Tokyo Ghoul Season 2 which had some very clear budget drops at  certain scenes. \\n\\n\r\nThe sound and music are the best part of the show. They had a very satisfying kill noise, and the music was very good in my opinion. I didn't watch very many other shows this season so far so I can't compare, but the OP and ED are very good. The dialogue is also pretty clear and concise. The second to last episode ends on a very cool song too.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters are bland and boring. The MC becomes this badass hybrid human zombie thing, but he doesn't do anything nearly as cool as his female MC counterpart. Nobody develops and some people are annoying. The MC is not a little crybaby though (for the most part) so that is a plus.\\n\\n\r\nI got what I wanted out of this show. It was a cool, weird themed show that kept me wanting to see what happened next, even if it was predictable.\\n\\n\r\nOverall it is NOT a MUST watch, but if you're open and don't know what else to watch this should be able to hold you over and give you little laugh and a smile, and maybe even a little hype.\\n\\n\r\nHope this helped!",

            "content": "Do you like trains, zombie monsters, dastardly evil doers that just want to kill anyone they deem unworthy, and steampunk.  If you answered yes to any or all of these then Koutetsujou no Kabaneri is the anime for you! \r\nStory: \r\nThe story goes as follows: Zombie monsters have over run the world and humanity is on the brink of extinction.... Stop me if you have heard this one before... no?? Ok I will continue. To survive humanity has started to live in giant forts that are actually large train stations. These stations are spread all over what I assume is the world but itcould very well only be Japan (They show a map of Japan in the intro).  To get from train station to train station humanity has created large trains complete with heavy armor and huge guns. \\n\\n\r\nThe story starts off by introducing your to a young fella by the name of Ikoma. Ikoma is a really smart engineer who is constantly looking for new ways to kill the zombies aka Kabane. Through a series of events he runs into a noble girl named Ayame and her crew as they have to make a speedy exit on a train. He also runs into a young girl named Mumei and the story is off and running. \\n\\n\r\nThe story follows the group as they travel around the world looking for other people and fortresses during their adventures. The big bad is eventually revealed (I am not going to spoil the surprise) and the team must find a way to save the day. \\n\\n\r\nAll in all the story is pretty standard but has just enough flavor to keep you wanting more. The ending is a little funky but it does not hurt the over all story. \\n\\n\r\nStory Rating: 7 \\n\\n\r\nArt: \\n\\n\r\nThe art in this anime was actually very pleasant! The world they created is both beautiful and terrifying all at once. You see some great shots of the land as the trains speed across the country side.... right before thousands of zombie creatures come running over that country side to eat everyone (yikes)! The series does a great job of blending gory realism with beauty. There are a few scenes later in the series where you can literally feel the sticky goo that is left on the characters after they transform into some gross monster thing. I really have no complaints about the art in this series and feel it was very well done! \\n\\n\r\nSide Point: I really liked the fighting in this series! The combat is very well done and it is a ton of fun watching Mumei fly around attacking anything that moves! She was a total BA in this series! \\n\\n\r\nArt Rating: 8 \\n\\n\r\n Sound: \\n\\n\r\nThere really isn't much to report on the sound from this series. There was nothing really bad to say or positive to say concerning the sound. It was what it needed to be! The intro and credits music was just so so but the in series sound track was pretty decent. I feel like the voice acting was also pretty strong and I really have no major complaints overall. \\n\\n\r\nSound Rating: 7 \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: \\n\\n\r\nI have to say one of the strong points in this series for me was the characters. I feel like the show had a lot of characters to work with so they had to do a lot of work to keep you interested in each character. They did a decent job of juggling all the main characters and supporting characters while giving you just enough story to care about each of them. It was nice to see the growth in the main character Ikoma. He started off the series as a pretty strong minded character but you could tell he had some doubt right from the start. By the end of the series he still has his doubts but he makes the choice to stand up for the people he cares about  and he makes a big heroic save when it is needed the most. The other character to watch in this series was Mumei. She actually follows the opposite path of Ikoma in a number of ways as t he series progresses.  I will not spoil any surprises here but know that she is another really fun character to focus on while you watch the show. Look for the little changes in her personality as she moves through the series! I can keep listing off little character moments but I will save you the trouble of reading all that and I will just say every character has an opportunity to grow in this series and that is very neat to see. \\n\\n\r\nOne character complaint I do have is with the big bad. I felt he left a lot to be desired when it was all said and done. He was evil and he was a gigantic butt who effortlessly killed people who followed him, loved him and admired him but that was not enough to save his character in the end. I think when all the smoke cleared he ended up being a bit of a weakling who was to scared to do the one thing that would have made him a real nice villain (no vial for this guy).  His plot to seek revenge was also a little too ordinary for me to really get behind as a true threat. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter Rating: 8 \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment and Overall:\\n\\n\r\nOverall I really enjoyed watching this series and I am excited to see what the movie has in store for us later this year or early next year. I found my self wanting to stay in the world for a little bit longer once the end credits rolled for the last time. The series as a whole has a very normal plot but it is presented well and honestly its pretty enjoyable. I absolutely love the fight scenes in this series, watching Mumei fly around and kick everyone's teeth in was really fun to watch! She was a very fun character and a real highly to the show. I would recommend this to anyone who likes Attack on Titan, berserk, or any other people vs monster anime. It was really a fun series to watch. I would probably watch this one again somewhere down the road! \\n\\n\r\nOverall Rating: 7 but really more like a 7.5",

            "content": "Okay to start, I want you to know that I just made an account. All for the sole purpose of giving this anime a review. I mean I have felt strongly about shows before but never like this. \r\nSo... THIS SHOW WAS SHIT.\r\nI know everyone compares it to Attack on Titan, which is expected considering its the same studio, director, sound director, composer, etc. It comes with territory. And its premise is very simliar too. I was expecting something amazing, but still different enough. I was sorely disappointed.  \r\nAnd yes, I will compare it to AoT. It comes with the territory.   \r\nFirstI will start with good stuff. The art and the music. \\n\\n\r\nART: Holy shit the art was beautiful. \\n\\n\r\nThis can be seen in scenes with Mumei. Her fight sequences just flowed. You are never prepared for what she will do next. And she has these scenes were she is just lying down but they look so classic. \\n\\n\r\nAnd those damn trains. Oh my god they look amazing. There are scenes showing cogs turning and it looks like photos of actual metal cogs. The trains look powerful and like they are a source of pride of both the characters and the artists. \\n\\n\r\nThe kabane look pretty cool too. Yes, they remind me of titans in concept, bit not artistically. The red molten irons veins and the glowing heart in a cage were amazing.  \\n\\n\r\nThe whole show has a steampunk look going that I loved. All the outfits and the weapons and the trains looked amazing. That metal look was captured perfectly. \\n\\n\r\nThere are things that look like they are recycled from AoT. Like the walls from AoT appear in kabaneri. And there is a scene where a horde of kabaneri are coming towards the characters and it looks just like one from AoT of titans. It seemed like they were in the same positions and everything. But I can forgive those, considering money issues and it is the same studio. I mean disney has recycled scenes. Its not a major issue for me. It just showed me that I might be too addicted to AoT if I noticed this. At the end it looks nice and that all I cared about.  \\n\\n\r\nMy own complain are the shadow black fog thing. That loooked more funny than scary. I mean the animation for the people in the heart looked cool, but from outside, meh. I couldn't take them seriously.. \\n\\n\r\nMUSIC: And the damn music. It made me feel. It got me pumped when needed and sad when needed. I am considering getting the soundtrack, like how I have for attack on titan and death note. And I hate this show unlike the other two. \\n\\n\r\nNow onto things that suck. \\n\\n\r\nPLOT: What the fuck is happening? And I am supposed to care why? \\n\\n\r\nThere were certain things that bugged me. Like the stupid rock. I might have missed it because I would just mentally peace out, but doesn't Ikoma lose the rock at some point. Then It comes back. Then somehow Mumei has it. For a second I thought it would be more than just a rock. They made a huge fucking deal of if artistically. It looked way to pretty to be so useless. \\n\\n\r\nAnd they have these super weapon-using kabane. That no one has seen before (I think this was episode 4 or something, in the first half for sure), but they have no impact to the story. For a second I was confused. Did I miss the part, where the characters mention knowing about them? No, this is for sure unique. Mumei has seen them but no one else. Why don't they care about it more. You can't introduce something that is that different from the norm and not have your characters talk about it. \\n\\n\r\nHow people become kabane isn't fleshed out either. So apparently if someone has a bite mark they ar ekilled on the spot to prevent them from becoming kabane. Now if it isn't confirmed where the mark came from, they are isolated for three days. If they don't turn, they are released. One problem, from all the flashbacks, it seemed like turning into kabane takes mere minutes. Where did this this three day thing come from? I will recognize that there was that one pregnant lady who took longer and ended up taking a few hours/days. This does not change the fact that it is still inconsistent. Just give a definite explanation for your world.  \\n\\n\r\nAnd my biggest pet peeve, Ikoma becoming a kabaneri. The way he does it is really weird. Viruses don't work like this. Okay fine I will work with it. But it would have been nice for the biology to be explained a bit more. Your show has kabaneri in the title. It would be nice to know how they form better. \\n\\n\r\nBut what I don't get is why no one interested in the procedure. It should be revolutionary. It should save lives. This could have been the source of conflict. Higher up people want to use it to save lives, while general public think it better to die. Stuff like that. Instead on one is remotely interested in this. Ikoma saved himself while in agonizing pain (with what appears to be no knowledge of biology). Imagine how people could be saved if this was made a universally accessible. But nope. There are so many scenes where people get bitten, and I am just wondering if they could have been saved by doing the same procedure as the one done on Ikoma. We will never know.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER: Right... this was definitely the worst bit. \\n\\n\r\nIkoma was actually okay. Not my fave but I didn't hate him. But on the other hand I didn't care about him either. he has the often seen tragic back story. His sister died and Mumei reminds him of her. So he basically gets attached to her. Same old spiel. He is just super cliche.  He was one of the first to be suspicious of the villain, blah blah blah. \\n\\n\r\nThere is this one death at the end, won't mention who, which I think they wanted us to be sad about. I honestly could not care less. This character has been there from the beginning, but they never really fleshed him out. Ikoma cares for him, so I am supposed to? That is not how it works. \\n\\n\r\nAyame could have been so much more than she was.  She could have been made into a real leader. yes she has moments where she shines, but they are not as important as they could have been. She also doesn't seem to really grow either. She doesn't seem like a strategist, which a leader should be. You know like Erwin (sorry). You don't really see her make big mistakes. All she does is is just stand around. I kind of wanted more from her. \\n\\n\r\nMumei is pretty weird. They tried to write a mentally disturbed character and failed. I don't even know how to put it. She was also overpowered. Her one weakness, where she tends to fall asleep after a huge attack, didn't seem that important except for one mediocre scene that was used to give Ikoma a chance to fight. It like the witers realized that she was overpowered and threw in a last minute solution. She sleeps after an attack!\\n\\n\r\nThe worst offender is the villain Biba. What even is he? I don't get his reasons. They never explain it properly. And don't give me the wait for s2 shit. He is dead so I highly doubt that will happen. His reasons never made sense. And his big weapon thing (no spolers) is another technology that isn't explained well. He goes around killing and brainwashing people because reasons. he is also introduced only in the second half. That was a definite weakness. He got too little time. He has all these technologies that need to be explained more. His sidekicks/followers are barely given enough time. do they care for him or not? Apparently some don't because plot reasons. \\n\\n\r\nAnd there is this stupid character who has an american accent, I think. I don't get why? Just why? \\n\\n\r\nOVERALL: So yeah, just don't watch the show. I only did because it has the same director as death not and AoT. I expected better and it didn't deliver. Looked pretty though. But it had no plot. Like porn.",

I thought it was just gonna be humans struggling against kabane but instead at episode 9 stupid pink haired crybaby came in to ruin everything by killing hundreds of innocent people and kabaneri being able to turn into zombies with deadly lazer beams it just really made me struggle to watch the last few episodes. \r\nAnyway i'm not that good at reviews so that wasa short summary of the stuff in the anime that annoyed me but i don't regret watching it",

There is gun play, dagger play, gun ho rushes and a weird item which the protagonist possess.\r\nCharacter Development is done quite well in the anime.

            "content": "\"Attack on titan was THE hit, so let's do another one of that kind\" was probably what the creators of this anime thought. It's an original series by the same producers as attack on titan and seraph of the end. Similar characters, setting and storyline make it almost the same in 12 episodes and shorter arcs. But looking deeper into Koutetsujou no Kabaneri itself and all it's details, we get a show that does a pretty good job at what it is supposed to do.\r\nThe zombie-like monsters called kabane rule the world in a post apocalyptic world. The hometown of our main character gets attackedand he flees with some other former inhabitants on a giant, iron train. With new developed superpowers and a newly developed weapon, he now tries to fight back against the monsters who took everything from him, even his humanity.\\n\r\nOr to say it in short: \"AoT in a zombie world on a train\".\\n\r\nStory: 4/10\\n\\n\r\nAnimation and Sound fit the tone and atmosphere of the show very well and keep your interest and attention in every scene it shines. Sometimes over the top, it is one of the best things about this anime.\\n\r\nArt & Sound: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nAt first the characters in the anime were very well developed and each of them were given equal amount of time to show their own stands in this anime. And after a certain episodes all the characters and their timing were scattered around giving more importance to the surrounding. Pretty basic and nothing new, you still can't hate them and they are often solid.\\n\r\nCharcters: 6/10\\n\\n\r\nDespite the initial expectations on Koutetsujou no Kabaneri and all of the comparisons between this show and Attack on Titan, we think this show proved to be quite decent. Maybe the storyline could have been better, but there is little more we could ask from its characters.\\n\r\nOverall: 7/10",

            "content": "Once upon a time, the producers of Attack on Titan went out for some drinking, during which drinking they began discussing that smashing hit of a series (see what I did there?) and foremost; what they would have changed and made differently. Thus, Kabaneri of the Iron Fortress was born.\r\nThat being said, when I finally managed to sit down to watch this series, I pretty much knew what I was up for. A friend of mine had already finished it with much complaint, I had seen a bit about it here and there, though on the whole, I had managed to avoid any spoilers, evenabout the cast and main characters. And on the whole, I must say that I've been left with vaguely pleasant feelings.\\n\\n\r\nIs this better than Attack on Titan, you might ask? Well, no, I'll say. \\n\\n\r\nThe world and premise is a carbon copy of Shingeki no Kyojin, however, the atmosphere and feel is quite different, and in not that bad a way. But where SnK served us a cold dish of realism, Kabaneri tried going for a roast of blazing emotions.\\n\\n\r\nDid it succeed? Well...\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe World and Story;;\\n\r\n{a poorly pulled-off Attack on Titan copy}\\n\\n\r\nThere has been quite the crop of titan-esque anime/manga this past year- say, like, Owari no Seraphu. And yet in each one of those creations, the inspiration behind the story was far less pathetically, blatantly obvious than in Kabaneri, and nothing can deny that.\\n\\n\r\nSwarms of monsters have made the land uninhabitable? The anime attempts to mangle around with their characteristic traits, but- Check! \\n\r\nHumans stuck in strongholds? Once again, the nature of these strongholds has been a bit changed up, but still- Check! \\n\r\nMale lead who will somehow became halfway between monster and human? Check!\\n\r\nPower female sidekick with a tsundere streak? Well, she's petite and childish here, but- Check!\\n\r\nCorrupt officials? Check!\\n\r\nScout legion equivalent? Check!\\n\\n\r\nThe list could go on, but you get the gist of it. And sadly, Kabaneri does a very poor job of being subtle about it or changing up anything about the story's main storyline- male lead by some great coincidence becomes a half-monster (here it's kabane) and obviously is going to have humanity's fate rest on his shoulders.\\n\\n\r\nI just now rather think that I would've preferred Eren's shoulders having the job.\\n\\n\r\nThe one big difference is how while in SnK, the general feel of the world was European, in Kabaneri, it's undoubtedly Japanese. Katanas, kimonos and oriental architecture prevail. While AoT has it's vague color scheme of pale blue, sandstone and some grim colors, Kabaneri plunges into the darkness filled with glowing reds and the occasional flash of blue. And looking out at sea of red-eyed kabane- well, shiver me timbers.\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt and Music;;\\n\r\n{pretty blimey good, I would suppose}\\n\\n\r\nWhat can I say? Looks like they didn't spare money on the animation. With a striking palate of colors that sets the mood well, especially during the battle scenes, as well as uniquely portrayed characters during special moments- most often Mumei- the art was one thing done well.\\n\\n\r\nAnd as for the sound- well, I'm no good judge of that, but it seemed well done. The opening and ending weren't half-bad, as a whole the voice acting was fine- oh, and yes. The American dude. Damn, I loved the American dude. Felt like home whenever he opened his mouth. Dude saved any moment he appeared in, haha.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters;;\\n\r\n{wonderful, as long as you carefully look around the main ones}\\n\\n\r\nThis. This was what made the whole of my enjoyment for this anime. \\n\r\nTo my personal tastes, there is nothing as delightful as a well-honed cast of background characters. And in Kabaneri, these side characters and their interactions were exactly that- a delight. \\n\\n\r\nThis was were stereotypes and archetypes were well and artfully used, just as they were well and artfully broken. By giving the background characters a breath of life and personality, but keeping them still as background members of the cast, the show did away with the backdrop of faceless figures and created a believable world around the main heroes in a way they can be proud of.\\n\\n\r\nWe have a good dozen faces in our background, half of which do step up to more important roles at times. And I admit to growing to genuinely love these characters we'd see two or three times an episode, sometimes more, sometimes less.\\n\\n\r\nBut when it comes to our main cast...\\n\\n\r\nFor some reason, it's hard to make good main characters. Probably because they are the ones who most often end up victims of plot convenience and such. But while Mumei and Ikoma could quite comfortably slip into the socks of basic main character stereotypes, they had enough to distinguish them to make both into original characters. Ikoma's never-ceasing grim facing can be a little wearing after a while, though.\\n\\n\r\nOh, did I forget something? Feels like there's something important I over-looked..?\\n\\n\r\nAh yes.\\n\r\nOur villain.\\n\\n\r\nProbably the one of the two things that broke this anime for me.\\n\r\nBascially- no motive. No anything, no sense behind any of those oh so shocking monstrosities. All we know is that suddenly, this guy appears, and since Ikoma immediately dislikes him, he is our bad guy. Why? He seems such a decent fellow! Look, he's fixing that leak! \\n\\n\r\nAnyway, that was the thing. Usually, we feel something about villains because they have a very well-rooted desire to do something that ultimately crushes the heroes we've grown to care so much about. But with this guy- I'll call him Abba for laughs- we really don't see why he's the bad guy.\\n\\n\r\nOkay, the anime throws him in the next episode doing some horribly unbelievable monstrosities to convince us. But because there is still no conceivable reason for Abba's actions, we just really end up looking at some senseless scenes of brutal violence like, \"okay then :\\.\" And the anime goes on to desperately attempt to convince us this guy is pure evil by widening its scale of monstrosities everywhere it can. But the shock value is greatly diminished, seeing as we feel that none of this is really Abba's doing, just what the writers jotted down.\\n\\n\r\nAnd the complete lack of humanity shown in this guy doesn't help make him evil, just ends up proving that he's a cutout. Which is why the surprise ending in which it seems he gets some small redemption at the very end was actually a pleasant surprise, mainly for the change of pace. Kind of like the persons behind just sighed and sorta gave up, giving us a character slightly more human and less paper cut out.\\n\\n\r\nBut once you got over that bit, the character cast actually was very well done, and even on the side of evil as well.\\n\\n\r\nAnd that American dude. Got to love the American dude.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSo, What was the Other Thing that Broke Kabaneri?;;\\n\r\n{let me whisper it- lack of realism. very basic realism. such as cause and effect}\\n\\n\r\nKabaneri put everything on the card of \"determination and emotion\" in the way that our main character's ringing battle cry became \"we are weak, but we'll still survive!\" A fine maxim, if only the anime would finally get on with it and show us how exactly the weak still manage to survive.\\n\\n\r\nThe ideological conflict of Kabaneri can be pretty much boiled down to \"the strong survive, the weak die\" and \"f*ck that bullshit, we may be weak, but we still have the right to live, and We Will Live, bogdamnit!\" \\n\\n\r\nWhich would culminate in moments when the writers carefully dropped our main pair into more and more impossibly, hopelessly deadly situations, to the point where there was no other imaginable ending but failure and death, and then additionally destroying whatever ashes of belief in miracles existed- to then have Ikoma rile everyone up with a speech about never stopping till they win and survive and ya, ya, we've heard it before, declaring about how they were weak but they would still live.\\n\r\nOkay, sure! I love things like that! \\n\r\nOnly after that great speech, where you'd usually expect to see the character show us what human spirit is, how to get back up and battle the odds, get a new plan or realize something they weren't aware of before that gives them the possibility of victory, you see everything sort of fuzz out a bit and reappear a few minutes later, all nice and cleaned up, because... the plot decided that okay, now they survived? \\n\\n\r\nIn other words, there wasn't even any whipping out of hidden weapons, or turning to faith, or even level-uping to try excusing the fact that now, since that riveting speech has been done with, we can easily stroll out of this impossible situation.  Which weakened this anime immensely. No explanations. No action and reaction.\\n\\n\r\nIn other words, if this was Attack on Titan, or Tokyo Ghoul, or any work with as much adherence to realism as Kakumeiki Valvrave, it would have to admit that yeah, those main characters were dead. No getting around it.\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment;;\\n\r\n{unexpectedly high}\\n\\n\r\nAt first, it was on and off. One episode I'd be screaming in wordless rage while ripping my hair out, the next I'd be sitting back like 'you know what, I don't even give a f*ck anymore,' and then I'd suddenly jump up squealing and fist pumping like yeah! \\n\\n\r\nBut the characters and their interactions, the well-fashioned atmosphere, the pleasing art, it all helped swallow down the frankly rage-inducing bits. Plus, the action wasn't half-bad either, and I did grow quite attached to the main group of heroes- the ending left me quite satisfied as well, so that was a plus. \\n\\n\r\nThe biggest surprise for me was the evolution of my feelings towards the 'princess' in this anime. A change from the beginning, where after raging at the screen on put on a sweet smile and decided that if this girl died a slow and painful death, this anime would immediately win itself a high ranking for pure satisfaction, to the ending, where I breathed sighs of relief when she appeared on screen and caught myself wanting to hug her once. \\n\\n\\n\r\nSo, to you, fair reader who desires to give this anime a try, I'll say this- if you're looking for an anime with well-produced fighting scenes and art, that is mostly pleasant to watch, and are aware, that is pretty much a heavily edited Attack on Titan set in a vaguely feudal, steampunk Japan, and are okay with raging at the scene sometimes, I'd say go for it.\\n",

            "content": "Before we begin, let me ask you, the reader, these.\r\nDo you like Resident Evil? Hell yeah you do. Or wait, is that kinda thing not up your alley?\r\nWhat about things like The Avengers? Pacific Rim? Planet Terror? Hell, Batman v Superman?\r\nWhy am I asking these things?\r\nIt's because it's important to know one crucial thing about Kabaneri of the Iron Fortress. It is the proverbial Summer Blockbuster deal that we get every now and then stateside. Except this one showed a season earlier than Summer.\r\nBut what is it, that people truly enjoy about the things that I mentioned above? The plot? Deep narrative? When you enteredthe theatre, did you honestly think, \"Am I ready to experience the depths of the human psyche\"? Gods no, I myself knew when I entered the cinema, I wanted to see some damn cool fights and cool robots beating giant monsters.\\n\\n\r\nAnd for Kabaneri of the Iron Fortress, the show delivers all the stuff you've wanted from a Blockbuster. And it delivers like a train. Ramming through steel barricades. Operated by zombies.\\n\\n\r\n--------Story & Character: 5/10-----------\\n\\n\r\nProbably where it's weakest, is its story. However, even then that's debatable. As someone who's watched so many anime lately that attempts to twist and contort their stories so much, and just absolutely bomb themselves with how unnecessarily complex they are, Kabaneri is a breath of fresh air in that regard. It's narrative and characters are simple to understand, easy to follow. No unexpected left or right turn, or some complicated hoop. It's a simple roller coaster ride.\\n\\n\r\nIs this a bad thing? Absolutely not. Simple is good, eight times out of ten. But this is not to say we could've used stellar writing here - Kabaneri could've done better, especially in its latter half - when zombies stop being a threat on their own, and a human threat is introduced. In most zombie stories though, things will almost ALWAYS draw out to this plot point near the end.\\n\\n\r\nAs a tabletop game master who adores running zombie games for his players, as I would say, \"When your players kill your best zombie, it's time to send in the corrupt pharma.\". Speaking of that; similar to running a tabletop RPG for your friends, the narrative of Kabaneri is made for the maximum entertainment and thrill of its audience. It's a non-stop (ahem) train ride for zombieland, where the most likely thing you're looking forward to next is how much more outrageous the situation can get.\\n\\n\r\nBut that's where I find most of the flaws stem from. Had it dedicated itself to becoming maximum B-movie(and it did from the start!), the show wouldn't have wasted so much time meandering around some topics considered \"deep\" - it could've cut 25% of it, and it would've gone better.\\n\\n\r\n--------Art: 10/10-----------\\n\\n\r\nWhat can I say? Kabaneri has absolutely GORGEOUS art. Its art is incredibly(and surely intentionally) reminiscent of the highly detailed 80s anime art. Except this time, we have the gift of digital animation and enhancement to make those frames look even more amazing.\\n\\n\r\nIf there was any reason to watch this for an anime enthusiast, it would be the art. For the past decade or more, I have not seen an anime THIS pretty and pleasing to look at.\\n\\n\r\nLet's play a little game - when you watch an episode, stop at any point in the show. Any point at all. 8 times out of 10, you will stop at a picture that you could potentially print and post on your wall. You can probably screencap half the show's content, print them them into an artbook, and it would SELL. It is that pretty.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the animation quality, it is consistent for most part, characters move smoothly, and cinematography is breathtaking. Again, it's like watching an AAA 80s anime, but better in terms of spectacle. They even have that thing where they show a still picture, and draw speed lines over it and shake the cam to make it look like something's happening. Whoops! Actually, I personally could've done without that.\\n\\n\r\n--------Sound: 10/10-----------\\n\\n\r\nComposer Hiroyuki Sawano is in charge of the soundtrack. This man is known for producing gold out of his hands, and he does not fail to deliver in Kabaneri. His tracks provide excellent mood and atmosphere, and the musical cues and timing of the track is just simply perfect.\\n\\n\r\nVoice acting is good for most part - I especially liked Mumei's and Kurusu's actors.\\n\\n\r\nOpening is a catchy song aptly named \"KABANERI OF THE IRON FORTRESS\" by EGOIST, and does not hesitate to literally say the show's title as part of the song's lyrics. If the show wasn't 80's enough for you yet, this should solidify that idea already.\\n\\n\r\nThe end song, \"ninelie\" by Aimer is a melancholic and dramatic song that I honestly do not get tired of listening on repeat for an hour, sung in Aimer's signature style.\\n\\n\r\n--------Enjoyment + Overall: 7/10-----------\\n\\n\r\nDid I enjoy the show? Hell yeah I did. Do I think its writing is groundbreaking? Not in the slightest, but I did get thrills over it. I play a lot of horror or shooter games, and while I don't think they're well written, they exist for a reason. \\n\\n\r\nIn the same way, Kabaneri exists as a sort of Blockbuster flick you can watch when you invite your friends over for the night. Will this serve as some historical piece for future anime fans? Actually, perhaps, if only for one reason:\\n\\n\r\nWhen they look back, and see that only a few studios actually animate their stuff well, they can look at Kabaneri and say, \"You mean they made anime look like THAT before? Damn!\". I know a few old anime that were not great in story either, but when I look at their art, I think the same thing I mentioned above.\\n\\n\r\n--------Conclusion-----------\\n\\n\r\nSo would I recommend this anime to you, reader? If your answer to every question at the first part is \"No.\", then you may want to turn around and seek another show. If it's a resounding \"Yes.\" to a lot of it, then strap up, grab those snacks, and get ready for one of the prettiest rides you're about to embark - even if the ending isn't as good as you would hope.\\n\\n\r\nReally though, it's when we look for perfection in everything, that we fail to appreciate the smaller things. Kabaneri's existence has a purpose - and that purpose is all that I've said above.",

This was an anime that cared about the whole package rather than just the story or animation.\\n\\n\r\n                                                       Animation & Art\\n\\n\r\nThe character designs by Haruhiko Mikimoto were a mix between modern and retro, nonetheless, they were pretty and cute (the girls, the GIRLS!), of course, the style was great for the whole cast.\\n\\n\r\nFor the most part, the action sequences are fluid, bright, beautiful and drawn with care.\\n\\n\r\nCONS - \\n\\n\r\n                                                            Writing\\n\\n\r\nIt`s exhausting to see the cast constantly being thrown in \"high intense\" situation out of the blue: walking down the street-ZOMBIES!, resting in a village-ZOMBIES!, just talking-ZOMBIES!, haha, of course, I'm exaggerating but still... \\n\\n\r\nMumei is a cliche little girl who is capable of such much power. Our lead protagonist is also the chosen one, for the most part, Cold hearted Samurai, etc, etc.\\n\\n\r\nNot much is explained as these 13 episodes of Iron Fortress worked more as an arc to a larger story than a complete project, which I think is a huge problem in anime, they treat a cour as a part to a bigger story rather than making a fulfilling cour regardless if the series will continue or not and instead we feel a little left out. \\n\\n\r\n                                                              Music\\n\\n\r\nMy favorite composer Ryo (Supercell & Egoist) worked on the opening theme with vocalist Chelly, and Sawano composed the ending theme with vocalist Aimer & Chelly. These two songs work exceptionally well in uplifting the feel of the show but do not work in enjoyment because they are way too large and cinematic. I could not enjoy them alone because they are set-pieces to Iron Fortress, which is great conceptually but not great when picked apart. \\n\\n\r\nA minor con, a random poppy track appears in Mumei`s flashy battle, in the beginning, it was a goofy and threw the atmosphere away. \\n\\n\r\n                                                           Art\\n\\n\r\nMinor Con: A few times deeper into the cour do we see low-quality illustrations and funny movements, but it`s not much to be bothered with.\\n\\n\r\n----\\n\\n\r\nThe effort that went into making Iron Fortress just wasn`t enough but it was beautiful enough to make me not mind viewing another season. \\n\\n\r\nEssential Watching?: No, it`s not. It`s a beautiful thing to look at and just maybe, you want to see what all the hype was about?\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Kabaneri of the Iron Fortress was my 2nd most hyped anime of Spring 2016. Its got a cool setting, its got zombies, and the studio that made Attack on Titan also made this anime. With those reasons, of course this was going to be one of my most hyped anime. Did it live up to the hype though? Ehhh...No. \r\n[Story]: (4/10)\r\nThe show takes place in a steampunk-version Japan set in a middle of the industrial revolution. Monsters called \"Kabane\" ravages this world and people have built a wall around the city to protect themselves from the undead creatures. One day, a station located in thefar east, has been breach by the Kabanes and the characters must do everything to defend their city and themselves against the Kabane. \\n\\n\r\nI'm a big fan of the zombie genre. I've been watching zombie movies/TV shows for as long as I can remember. I've seen my fair share of zombie apocalypse stories to know the difference between a half-assed zombie story and a great zombie story. Unfortunately, there's not even a single ounce of anime in this medium that takes place in a zombie apocalypse setting and is even remotely great. High School of the Dead comes to mind but that shit joke of a zombie apocalypse story was infested with fanservice and it made it very hard for me to take that show seriously. There was also School Live but the ending ruined it for me but it was at least better than High School of the Dead. When I first noticed Kabaneri of the Iron Fortress back in March 2016, I was so excited because I told myself that we're finally getting an anime that takes place in a zombie post-apocalyptic world with no big bouncing boobs and a dark atmosphere. \\n\\n\r\nSince Kabaneri of the Iron Fortress was made by the same studio as Attack on Titan, the similarities between the two shows are plainly obvious. Even the first episode gave me a huge Attack on Titan episode 1 vibe. The story structure is almost the same, the undead creatures here are mysterious and no one knows where they originated from, just like the Titans and the fact that both shows features a walled-in city to protect themselves from the monsters should tell you the similarities between both shows. I think the only difference are the characters. Besides Mumei, which highly resembles Mikasa's fighting technique, the characters are not even comparable to each other. Especially Ikoma. Yea, both Eren and him are the same in terms of both of them having mysterious powers that lets them fight the monsters but their personalities are very different.\\n\\n\r\nMoving on from the comparisons between AoT and Kabaneri, the first 5 episodes of the series was the best episodes the show offered. After that, the show just started to derail itself and eventually suffered a horrible trainwreck at the end but I'll get to that later. For now, I'll only talk about the good parts. The first 5 episodes of the series was pure-adrenaline and exciting zombie action scene that made me want to come back to this show every week. The Kabanes are legit scary and seeing these people trying to survive against the Kabanes was just amazing. Hell, even their paranoia was amazing to watch, albeit at the same time, annoying too. These people literally have no idea what the Kabanes are capable for and that's why I think their paranoia was justified. The fact that these guys are also fighting on a train, which makes you think that they'd be safe there but they're really not, made this series more exciting to watch. Zombies have been done over a million times but fighting zombies while you're on an armored train is something new and fresh for me. \\n\\n\r\nBehind this exciting zombie action scenes is the unfortunate truth that made Kabaneri of the Iron Fortress a complete mess at the end. By the 6th episode, the plot made it clear to me that it didn't know where it wanted to go. After the exciting 1st arc which was pretty much a set up, the 2nd and final arc was very VERY underwhelming. It felt like they just came up with these arcs because they didn't plan ahead. It felt really meaningless and it had me questioning throughout the 2nd half like \"What was their overall goal?\". The 3rd arc, which is the final arc in the series, is something you don't want to put yourselves through because of the badly-written annoying-ass villain with a badly-written past. His view on \"the weak must die and the strong must live\" is just ridiculous and stupid. You might think it's not but just watch the show and you'll see how he stupidly justifies his actions on killing innocent civilians by saying that goddamn quote. \\n\\n\r\nThe inconsistencies and plot holes in Kabaneri is just surreal. Like what's the purpose of doing routine body checks? When these guys are bitten, they eventually turn into a Kabane within a minute or so. They'll know right fucking away if one of the people are bitten by the way they act. What's the point of locking the people you suspect of being a Kabane for 3 days? What the shit?! What is up with Ikoma and Mumei having a special Kabane power-up? Why only them? Why don't the others get a special Kabane power up when they get bitten? Why are the Kabanes so intelligent and how the hell do they form into a giant fucking monster?......And so much more but listing them all here will result in another paragraph or 2 with full of questions. \\n\\n\r\nTo summarize this section of the review, the whole zombie action scenes were nice and the set-up arc was pretty great but the whole show suddenly turned into shit after the Biba (3rd) arc showed up. \\n\r\n______________________________________________________________\\n\r\n[Art/Animation]: (8/10)\\n\r\nI expect no less from Wit Studio in terms of the visuals because it looks amazing. The character designs looks great and the visuals managed to capture that dark post-apocalyptic world. The animation, on the other hand, was a so-and-so. I mean, it was fun watching the characters running around and shooting zombies up but the animation was mostly inconsistent at the same time. 60% of the time, they'd use those still-images that pretty much ruined half of the zombie action scenes. One of the only scenes where they don't use still-images is when Mumei was jumping around and shooting zombies or when the characters are use their guns (not swords) to shoot and kill zombies. The Kabane's design looks like a generic zombie design but I don't really care about that and those giant CGI Kabane monster design looks horrible. \\n\r\n______________________________________________________________\\n\r\n[Sound]: (9/10)\\n\r\nI really..really love the show's soundtrack. The OSTs that plays during the action scenes always gives me goosebumps but the insert songs are what's guaranteed to give me an eargasm. It always plays when the characters are about to do something crazy that will lead them to victory and it just fits so perfectly. Now the OP and ED theme song(s)\\n\\n\r\nThe OP theme song is \"KABANERI OF THE IRON FORTRESS\" by EGOIST. Haha, nice song name. Title creativity is overrated anyways. This OP is one of the best OP I've ever heard for this season. It has that scary/apocalyptic tune that fits with the show's atmosphere and I love Egoist. The ED theme song is \"ninelie\" by Aimer with chelly (EGOIST). Aimer is one of my Top 10 favourite anime singers ever since I heard her OP in UBW. And.....she does it again with her great performance in this ED. \\n\r\n______________________________________________________________\\n\r\n[Characters]: (5/10)\\n\r\nIf you're here for bad-ass female characters accompanied with a bad-ass main heroine who can kick ass and a main protagonist who has a hidden special power like Eren from Attack on Titan then you're in for a treat. If you are, however, looking for character development then you're going to be disappointed as this show is seriously lacking in character depth and character development.  \\n\\n\r\nThe main protagonist of the series, Ikoma, is somewhat similar to Eren from Attack on Titan. Both characters have hidden special powers and they both have one goal in mind; Kill the monsters that's ravaging this land. Ikoma's past is really poorly written and it isn't even expanded nor explored, making it very hard for me to sympathize with what he was going through throughout the series. All I know was his family member (was it his sister? I forgot) died because a Kabane bit her and that's it. I don't know anything more about Ikoma's past and I don't even know anything more about Ikoma's sister other than being bitten by a Kabane. I was left wondering why I should care for her. Besides her being part of Ikoma's family, they didn't give me any reason why I should care for her. There's actually another post-apocalyptic series out there called \"God Eater\" where the protagonist went through the same experience and did a much a better job showing on why we, the audience, should care about the protagonist's dead family member and why he is what he is today. \\n\\n\r\nI feel like the only character with good writing is Mumei. Unlike the protagonist, she actually has a well-written past and it justifies why she is what she is today. It was even explored and later expanded in the final arc. At the end, it made me somewhat sympathize with whatever she was doing but I wasn't fully sympathizing with her character because the way they resolved her issue was rushed. This show definitely needed more than 12 episodes to flesh out Mumei's character. No, this show needed more than 12 episodes to flesh out ALL of the characters because they are either not developed or under-developed as fuck.\\n\\n\r\nBiba, the main antagonist of the series, is now the most hated villian in the series. People hate him not because he's a villian but because he's a stupid-ass villian with a stupid writing to try and justify that whatever he was doing is completely just. Also, the plot twist about him at the end of the episode is way too abrupt and it really came of out of nowhere. It seemed like an asspull to try and shock the viewers. The introduction of Biba is what ruined the final arc for me. I literally couldn't handle the stupidity of this f*cking character and it made it very hard for me to finish the last 2-3 episodes of the series. \\n\r\n______________________________________________________________\\n\r\n[Enjoyment]: (7/10)\\n\r\nBelieve it or not, I actually enjoyed the series, not because of the story or the characters but because of it's setting and the enjoyable zombie action scene. I am a big fan of the zombie genre after all so seeing the characters fight zombies in an armoured train was very thrilling. Kabaneri is one of those \"turn off your brain and you'll enjoy it\" type of anime. \\n\r\n______________________________________________________________\\n\r\n[VERDICT]\\n\r\n\"Kabaneri of the Iron Fortress\" is now the 2nd anime from Wit Studio that is similar to Attack on Titan (First one being Owari no Seraph). If you're looking for thrilling action scenes or if you're the type of person who likes to watch shows that are set in a post-apocalyptic world then this is the show for you. However, if you're looking for a show with a great story or well-written characters with great character development then this ain't the show for you. If you're one of those people who are desperately waiting for the 2nd Season of Attack on Titan then this show will feel the gap for at least a few months while waiting for the 2nd Season. \\n\\n\r\n[OVERALL]: (6.5/10)\\n\\n\\n\r\nPros:\\n\r\n+Dark and Scary Post-Apocalyptic Setting\\n\r\n+Thrilling Zombies Action Scenes\\n\r\n+Nice Visuals\\n\r\n+Epic and Goosebump-Inducing Soundtrack\\n\r\n+Main Heroine of the series is a bad-ass\\n\\n\r\nCons:\\n\r\n-Weak Plot\\n\r\n-The Show felt like it didn't know where to go after the introductory (1st) arc. \\n\r\n-Use of Still-Shots in Action Scenes can be off-putting\\n\r\n-Lack of Character Development for most of the characters\\n\r\n-Horrible and Badly-written Antagonist\\n\r\n-Weak and Rushed Ending\\n\r\n-Plot Holes and Plot Inconsistencies",

            "content": "Kabaneri is an anime where collectively as a whole is a below-average show, but when looking at the components that make it what it is, aspects of the show are simply amazing. When Kabaneri came out, immediately it was compared to Wit Studios (the studio that made Kabaneri) hit, Attack on Titan. Do not go into Kabaneri looking for Attack on Titan. In fact, the two shows are nothing alike except for the world structure of humanity hiding behind walls for human-eating beings, in Kabaneri's case, this was zombies. The feel between these two shows are completely different, and each show focuses on one componentof the show more than the other. \\n\\n\r\nStory: 3\\n\\n\r\nKabaneri has a weak story. It has a weak plot. This is what turned off many viewers, such as myself. The thing is that from the beginning, it is clear to see that this show wasn't really going to go anywhere with a rich plot and storyline. This show was going to focus on one aspect and one aspect only--action. I like to think of Kabaneri and compare to the American movie, Mad Max (2016), in that both are action heavy with stunning fighting scenes. Don't go into this show looking for plot. This show is a thrill ride that is only going for making the viewers hyped. For someone like me, who definietly values plot more than action, Kabaneri was not exactly my cup of tea and I didn't enjoy it as much. The first half was full of action and thrill, and at that point, I accepted this show as a mindless show that was just there to look pretty and be hype. It wasn't until the second half of the show when a lackluster plot was introduced that I was turned off immediately. It was clear that the only purpose of this plot introduction of the main antagonist, Biba, was to provide a conflict that will in turn give closure to the end of the 12 episode when our protagonist, Ikoma saves the day. This conflict and plot point was so rushed and unbelievable that when the ending came it was so anti-climatic that I checked every two mintues to see how much longer I had to watch this trainwreck. The main problem with Kabaneri from it becoming an enjoyable, mindless show that it's supposed to be, is that it took itself way too seriously than it should have. All the components were there for it to be a great show, even with the terrible plot, if it didn't take itself too seriously than this would've been a show that I would've enjoyed. I watch plenty of anime that have no plot and enjoy them, and that's because the show is what it's supposed to be. In all, the plot was one of the biggest \\n\r\ndownfalls of this show. \\n\\n\r\nAnimation: 9\\n\\n\r\nNow if Kabaneri does one thing amazing, it's its animation. It has this old throwback look that is pleasing to the eye. Everything about the visuals is done right. The animation is simply gorgeous especially during the fighting scenes and the scenes fill with thrill and action. The characters are also gorgeous to look at as well (for the exception of Ikoma's hair, which I absolutely hated until he finally cut it). The eyes were my favorite part to look at during this show because it was just so beautiful to look at. The scenery has great detail and brings the setting to life. The zombies look creepy  and also animated well. The animation of Kabaneri is a huge plus. If you are someone who loves to see the occasional show for the art, scenery and animation such as Rolling Girls (also done by Wit Studios, what a coincedence??) then this is a show that you should watch. This show is gorgeous to look at. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 8\\n\\n\r\nThe sound is the last redeemable factor of Kabaneri. It is also very nice and all the tracks are used at the right time such as during high action scenes or when there was a slow moment. The opening and ending are great. I'm a big fan of Egoist and Aimer, so that earned extra points for me. The voice actors did a fine job as well. It was personally entertaining to Yuki Kaji play a side character of the show that is influenced by Attack on Titan where he voiced Eren. And of course Mamoru Miyano can do no wrong in my eyes so he was the only thing I actually like about the terrible antagonist, Biba.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 2\\n\\n\r\nIn my opinion, the characters trump the rushed plot in how terrible it was. The characters were bland and stuck to one identifying cliche. I hated Ikoma as a main character (that hair, that hair!!!), I just found him to be boring. Of course, everyone compares him to Eren as a main character continuing the Attack on Titan vs. Kabaneri comparisons. Ikoma is a smart character, but he just seemed to be another cliched protagonist among a cast of bland characters. The only character that I remotely liked had to be Mumei, and even then, her character was pretty boring to me. She was the only character who went through character development, albeit how terrible the development was excuted. Even character deaths weren't impactful to me because I couldn't connect to any of the characters. To me, they were just gorgeous looking dolls with no personality. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 1\\n\\n\r\nIf someone asked me how much I enjoyed Kabaneri, I would say it was a complete waste of my time and was just garbage in my opinion. Personally, it wasn't my type of show. Or rather, it would be my type of show if excuted well. The execution was so poor that I wanted to gouge my eyes out. Scratch that, if I gouged my eyes out I wouldn't be able to see the fabulous animation. Kabaneri is a perfect example of a show that will fail to test time and will quickly be as forgotten as Wakako-Zake (if you don't get the reference, my point exactly). When reviewing something, I try to look at it objectively and while I'll personally feel a certain way, if a show does something good then I'll admit its merits instead of focusing on what it did wrong. However, when talking about enjoyment, this is where I will be as subjective and biased, because this is all about my own personal enjoyment. \\n\\n\r\nSo in final words, Kabaneri is a gorgeously animated trainwreck that just took itself way too seriously than needed. Along with a terrible plot, anti-climatic ending, and a bland cast, this show just was not up to par with some other shows airing during the Spring 2016 season. Should you watch it? Not really. Unless you like gorgeous animation and mindless action, then you might want to pass on this. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 5/10",

Okay, most mangakas don't do much research, or don't really care, and this is quite a common problem that makes a lot of anime lessenjoyable for me. In most cases, I will ignore the lack of logic for the sake of a cool story, but kabaneri distorts and misuses so many basic concepts in a way that doesn't match at all the tone they're trying to set for the story.\\n\r\nThe story might have got better from the point I dropped, for sure, but I would never be able to enjoy it.",

            "content": "This anime does not deserve the \"hate\" it is getting. I would not dare say that it is original, that it is superbly extraordinary, that it is anything new, because we all know that this anime looks like Shingeki no Kyojin and even the Walking Dead and most of everything we can watch these days. The story is already known to us all, and hey, maybe most of us have watched something like this. But you know what? The execution of this anime is still great nonetheless. I would not be judging it based on comparison to other animes, because this one, for me, stilldoes its job and what it's supposed to do. \\n\\n\r\nThe art is not your generic art style--nothing trying to be \"moe\" or ecchi. Nothing was sexualized, nothing was made to be cuter than reality is supposed to be. And though I am not a fan of these \"classic\" art style, I still did love it. It was a serious anime, and it is made to be just that (with a little touch of comedy now and then).\\n\\n\r\nThe characters had great and reasonable character developments. I loved Ikoma though he gets a lot of hate. Ikoma was not supposed to be strong, but he is trying to be. And I love how they progress his character not quite quickly, but reasonably for someone who is in his position. Same goes for the other characters. They were all not made to be perfect. There would be times that you would hate some of them, but that is the point. That is what your are supposed to feel. That is what the writers want you to feel. Characters aren't meant to cater to your needs, and not all characters are made to be liked or loved. They are meant to be flawed just like humans, and they also want to show us that you learn that way. I will emphasize yet again: THEY ARE MEANT TO BE THEMSELVES. NOT EVERY CHARACTER NEEDS TO CATER TO YOUR NEEDS. (There were animes that characters don't even have characters--the characters are just there to cater to audiences and character fluctuations are all over the place, and for me, that is too shallow--liking characters that are just that. AND PEOPLE ACTUALLY LIKE THAT?) This anime brings you characters that are reasonable no matter how small that reason is. \\n\\n\r\nI definitely enjoyed this anime. The action is there and it is amazing. And as I've mentioned earlier, though it is not original or anything new, it is not bad. It is still enjoyable, with all the adventure they faced and the trials they had along the way. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, try to enjoy the anime instead of complaining here and there. The problem with people nowadays is that they shit on everything and fail to see the good in every anime. Animes are meant to be enjoyed! And for me who is a fanatic of adventures and intense action, this one does it.",

Does it live up to expectations? tl;dr NO.\r\nThanks to your overly-generous budget - you seem to have please the eyes and ears of the viewer (myself at least).\r\nEGOIST and Aimer are great - considering the setting and theme of the anime - their OP and ED sets a good scene, and lends supposed credibility that this will be an epic. The BGM throughout is generally on point and really bring the scenes to life.\r\nThe MC's Voice Actor really bring the character to life -in fact at times it made the animation and idealized character feel inconsistent to the voice. Also, what's the point of Suzuki (?) a gaijin-ed speaker. Was it to mock ? Or comedic relief? It felt unnecessary. However, the rest of the characters were also so-so at best, with linear personalities - and really missed opportunities to utilize the good visuals. \\n\\n\r\nThe story - started good. Ended like shit. Actually it ended like bad rice. It had good pacing initially - but it soon 'derailed'.\\n\\n\r\nAh right, <SPOILER> the Rice. It's the fucking center of another MC. Jeez, are you kidding me? Is this Sasha the Potato Lover from AoT? Gosh, give me a break - you spent more than half the anime trying to set up a sad and pitiable character then you tell me it's for rice. <SPOILER END>\\n\\n\r\nConcluding my rant, this anime seems to be a well-started, badly completed attempt at contending the Attack on Titan fame. I'm sorely disappointed. You can watch it for yourself and find small bits to save this. I'll give you that hope.",

            "content": "Zombies, Steampunk and Trainwrecks...literal trainwrecks.\r\nProbably one of the most hypest anime LA had for Spring 2016 and for the first 8 episodes it was great!, yet come episode 9, BOOM~!!! it just pardon the pun went off the rails and crashed and burned. So what went wrong???..well let's see what went right before seeing what went wrong.\r\nWell for one, the majority of the premise to the characters and of course the threat to humanity were all great. Character wise, Ikoma the \"main protagonist\" voiced by Tasuku Hatanaka is actually a unique character although he's something of a supporting character to his own anime, as eventhough he has this \"smart, yet want to protect everyone mantra on him\", LA's favourite character actually goes to Mumei voiced by Sayaka Senbongi the extremely capable Kabaneri fighter. The rets of the train cast consists of the Ayame Yomogawa voiced by Maaya Uchida, the daughter and heir to her family who governs the Koutestujou, Takumi voiced by Yuki Kaji, Ikoma's best friend and Kurusu voiced by Toshiki Masuda, Ayame's bodyguard.\\n\\n\r\nThe battles in this anime is exceptional and even more props to the animation studio Wit in making zombie killing through steampunk badassery all the more awesome with the animation styling that's reminiscent of early 90's anime but in a more crisper style to add in how badass some of the battles against the zombies can be.\\n\\n\r\nFinally, LA would like to point out that LA earlier said that Ikoma felt like a supporting character to his own anime and LA says this as it feels more like that Mumei is the central character with all the character development towards her, from her duties to her being a Kabaneri and just knowing more about the world than Ikoma does, now this isn't the horrible thing but it's just something LA would like to point out.\\n\\n\r\nSo what's wrong with this anime come episode 9?...well\\n\\n\r\n*****SPOILERS AHEAD (If your still interested in watching this anime, WATCH the anime first all the way then come back and continue reading) ****** \\n\\n\r\nWhat's wrong with this anime come episode 9 that made this anime into an utter trainwreck comes in two points, one is another character that appears to be Mumei's \"older brother\" Biba Amatori voiced by Mamoru Miyano, as not only is his motivations of \"being the evil dude\" utterly stupid but his \"means don't outweigh the actions he did\". Biba utterly ruins both the tension of zombies but his motivations in making him the \"human villain\" is utterly pathetic in comparison to...ohh LA doesn't know \"wanting to keep humanity save in order to kill them\"...yes you read that right, Biba is just that stupid. the other point?...concerns LA's favourite character, Mumei, sure her character development before Biba's appearance was getting somewhere but come Biba, she too becomes stupid and blind to what she is doing. LA utterly hated episode 9 because of this and systematically ruined the concept of zombies killing humans AND ruining LA's faovurite character all in one fell swoop. Way to go Koutetsujou no Kabaneri.\\n\\n\r\nBut that was only episode 9, it could redeem itself right???...well for the final episode yes it oddly did (for LA anyways), they still kinda rushed it for the build up of this ending with some deus ex machina's that goes unexplained as such it's writing for the characters, especially with Ikoma though his powerup and \"we can save Mumei cure\" was a rushed deus ex machina, it got kinda worse when Mumei was turned into a damsel in distress, however the finale still gave an awesome finale to the point LA could \"forgive\" some of the stupid writing that lead up to this awesome ending.\\n\\n\r\n******SPOILERS DONE*********\\n\\n\r\nKoutetsujou no Kabaneri maybe LA's most hyped anime LA had this Spring 2016, but at best LA would say that Koutetsujou no Kabaneri was an enjoyable trainwreck and LA just liked to see it's smouldering remains of fire just keep growing and growing to the point LA saw a bright spark from the ashen wreck, sure it's a trainwreck, but in all honesty it was still entertaining and that ending save itself and no LA will say here and here, it wasn't the worse anime this Spring 2016, LA will emphasis that about this anime. Koutetsujou no Kabaneri you had high hopes this Spring 2016 but before hitting the finish line you went off the rails and crashed and burned a nice flavour of bullshit crazy then recovered from the wreck like a Kabane. *cough*",

It all sounded really great. Starting from the second episode, it slipped... It slipped into an extremely well known pattern. That of the Hero who will save the world.\r\nYou'll be able to pretty much guess the end starting from the 3rd or 4th episode.\r\nArt: 7/10 - I'm not a specialist, it looked good. Except for the \"No-Name\" and Ayame-Sama characters designs which i found really basic.\r\nSound: 4/10 - Nothing shocked me but i didn't find the music very remarkable, truthis i didn't even pay attention to the ost...\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 2/10 - This is one of the main failures of this anime. Some characters are really bland, while others have inconsistant personalities. \"No-Name\" is the worst, changing her personality numerous time during the show. Ikoma is pretty bad too.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyement: 5/10 - I watched it to the end, but i almost stopped midway. Mediocre is a good word.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 4-10 - This show had all the ingredients to make a great seinen with characters having real personnalities, a good story behind (even tho the story idea in itself isn't original) but instead the failure is total we get a bad shounen and the more you watch it, the worst it goes, up to the very end which could have maybe redeemed a bit this show, but completly fails...\\n\r\nWTB a good steampunk anime :(",

            "content": "What should I say? It's happening again. Packing a really good potential into short rushing 12 episodes and they have done that really... really... bad. So many things left unanswered, messy character building, and a very good story wasted just like that. I don't say that Koutetsujou no Kabaneri is bad but I would say this anime is not that very good either.\r\nThey started this anime with a good (and I think) perfect flow, an outstanding animation and music (thumbs up for Sawano Hiroyuki, EGOIST, and Aimer), and last, interesting characters. They got Ikoma, a Kabaneri nerd who creates a piercing gun that could pierceKabane's heart but has some sister complex issue, then they got a perfectly characterized Mumei, a super OP badass Kabaneri who has a fear of being weak. It was all perfect until they threw a huge bomb into Biba's character and made Biba's character messy as hell. Yup, I said it.\\n\\n\r\nThe biggest problem in this anime problably in Biba's character development. I think if they give more information about Biba's background and not throwing Biba into some quick bizzare yet very evil scheme that destroys his character completely (and problably the rest of the series). Biba needs some time to be shympatized by the audience and made into a good character. Then again I want to blame that Koutetsujou no Kabaneri was too short and learning from past animes, a huge universe like this anime should have more episodes than 12 to explain whatever happened to the universe, character developments, and resolving whatever the problem is.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, this anime isn't bad but it's not that very good because of the story that felt rushed and a character (Biba) being undeveloped even he is the main antagonist. But still, I would recommend this series for you who loves a mindblowing animation or eargasming music and soundtrack. The animation is so great yet the music is really... really... great. Lastly, it would be great that if this series has a sequel to resolve whatever they have done to this great potential.",

This is a review for Koutetsujou no Kabaneri or better yet, wit studio's half-assed attempt to imitate Attack on Titan...[sigh] i'm gonna keep this as short as possible cause i really don't want to waste much more of my time on this garbage than I already have ...\r\nStory: 4\r\nKeywords guys: Zombie steampunk survival, eg. AOT with Zombies and trains that's also way stupider.\r\nArt: 9\r\nIf there is any consolation for this anime, it's that the art and animation is beautiful. \r\nSound: 10\r\nThe soundtrack is outstanding. Easily sets the tonefor each and every scene.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 1\\n\r\nThe characters are completely devoid of logic, and critical thinking. Made me feel like they should just all die tbh. Not to mention our annoying female lead Mumei who became the first multi-archetype character in existence xD. She has got to be one of the most inconsistent characters i have seen in a long time. And don't get me started on Ikoma...Going from somewhat logical (take that with a grain of salt) to completely illogical is heartbreaking. He turns into an irrational, and overly self-righteous idiot that somehow gets his happy ending regardless of what the plot may have said. See I already wasted too much time on this -_-\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:  6\\n\r\nYou can definitely find enjoyment in this. The action scenes and great soundtrack can help mask the loss of brain cells you lose from this series. I mean it's not everyday you get to see a zom- oops i mean \"half-zombie\" (kabaneri) fire a laser from their mouths, or even use the force when plot requires them to...OR BETTER YET, a character survives through unexplained bullshit plot armor...smh i'm done, let's wrap this up \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 3\\n\r\nKabaneri doesn't seem to make it to my garbage can, it gets to join the rest of the pile of shit anime that just didn't clear the stage of mediocrity. I will legit give this the shit emoji as I set it along with many other titles from this season on fire...\\n",

This show is beautifully animated. Some of the characters are a little cliche from anime troupes. \r\nBut i'll pull back here from reacting to lower reviews. I watched this show over about 3 days when i could get some free time. \r\nThe sound in this show is very good the way you can almost feel your on this train. Its just so well done. \r\nThe story i found to be good it hassome eh moments or when characters become all power ful. There are a few characters we're suppose to be killed off that we dont really care about because they just seem to be there for that purpose. \\n\\n\r\nNow is this an Evangelion, Cow Boy beebop or Akira? No its not reinventing the wheel but it is giving a new take on a concept that is really hot today vampires/zombies. I think it does pull off the desperate fight story the hopelessness very well. And the main two characters are well developed and so are some of the supporting cast. \\n\\n\r\nthe fight scenes and action scenes are where this show shines there are some spectacular visuals and some really well thought out creative fights. That kept me on the edge of my seat. \\n\\n\r\nI am a big fan of serious anime that avoid the goofy faces while chars are angry or sad cause it looks lazy and unappealing and takes me out of the story. So this not having that is good for me. This really is a good show and if you are looking for a good action or horror expence you should check it out. As there are some great fights and it really is a visual treat.",

And these same gentlemen created Koutetsujou no Kabaneri. I decided to take a chance and did not regret it. Anime turned out to be worthy of \"titans\" although their style is felt all the way. Especially in the scenes of fights and battles. Visually, everything is very good. Simple but tasteful. Very pleased with me as oldfaga close-ups of faces. They painted a very old school. The eyes of the characters are less thannow accepted. The style is more like old good macros. Thanks to this, the characters are very cute. (as for me it's better) Close-ups are always very nice to watch. In the series usually save on everything, make less detail in clothing and painting. Everything is very good here. This is not a masterpiece, but it looks very dignified. Close plans very competently support this balance of economy and quality. Contractions are beautiful. They have a problem with the fact that the characters in their pirouettes are knocked out of the general plan. Like the scale of health in games. It is as if outside the image. But these are trifles. The heroes are standard, but they do not irritate. And they look very good. Especially near)). The plot may seem crumpled and chaotic, but it's better so than tyagomotina * with useless spree. The modern spectator brought up by Vainas and clips will not feel any discomfort. Characters are not fully disclosed in 12 episodes. There is not enough time. But maybe it's good. The viewer must think up something himself. Music supports action. I'm not 100% sure (maybe I just did not notice), but I think there's not one slap in there.))\\n\\n\r\ntyagomotina * - something very slow and tedious\\n\\n\r\ngoogle translation from Russian",

Art is no less than that of AoT either. The studio did a fabulous job setting the tone for the anime that you can actually feel the fear and despair. Characters are rather bland but the plot alone is enough to keep your attention. \r\nThen it turned into Guilty Crown (which I really disliked). While the characters remain undeveloped, the plot starts to fall apart. The story becomes harder to follow by theepisode, and nearly no exposition was given. The MC's plot armor becomes so thick he can overcome any threats no matter how ridiculous it seems.\\n\\n\r\nSo take the average of your score for AoT and GC, and that is what you should expect going into it.",

The art was good but not life changing and I cannot complain about the sound quality or the unforgettable opening song. The part it is most lacking in is character development, sure the main characters got developed a tiny bit but the supporting characters did not get developed at all (I was really hoping there would be some romance). Since it was made by the same people who created Shingeki No Kyoujin it bears a lot of similarities in story and art style but the story is alsoa lot more rushed than AOT.",

            "content": "What is with the negative reviews!? \r\nI think the reason why everyone is so disappointed is because it wasn't like Attack on Titan. However, everyone fails to realize that it's NOT Attack on Titan. It is true that is gets its inspiration from the show, but it is completely different. \r\nHonestly, I think it's MUCH BETTER than Attack on Titan, especially for the characters.  \r\nIkoma is smarter and more tactical (more than Eren ever was). All the characters have their reasons for what they do and what motivates them. One thing I particularly enjoyed was the character development. AND YES THERE WAS MORE DEVELOPMENTIN 12 EPISODES THAN THERE EVER WAS IN 25 OF ATTACK ON TITAN. The side characters learned from their own mistakes and became better, not just the main ones. Ayame became a better leader. Mumei realized what she was doing and began to trust the right people. All the people on the train started to realize that Kabaneri were nothing to fear. Even Takumi grew some balls and saved his friend. \\n\\n\r\nThe art style was amazing as expected from the same team. \\n\\n\r\nThe music was brilliant because of Sawano Hiroyuki. I'm already a fan of his music. He's amazing at what he does.\\n\\n\r\nThe storyline was great. I don't think it was generic at all. You guys want to talk generic shounen? Look at Fairy Tale and Bleach? Oh yes I did go there. \\n\\n\r\nHonestly, I think it was one of the better shows from the spring season this year. You should give this anime a chance. It was one hell of ride. XD\\n\\n\r\n~~SPOILER WARNING~~\\n\\n\r\nSide Note: Everyone seems to hate Mumei. Mumei was not a bad character and nor was she annoying. I'd like to think she was brainwashed from her \"brother.\" However, she DID redeem herself in the last 2 episodes when she finally realized what she had done. She tried to stop her brother, but before she could, she was already forced into submission. She developed as well as a character. People hate her for her mistakes and faults, but I think that's what makes her truly a good character. The fact that she has faults, but tries to fix herself. That's what makes her human. \\n",

I know, we're all sick of the cliche's like:\r\nThey all live in a protected area that the monster supposedly can't enter.\r\nOne of the main characters is half, part, or has powers of the monsters they are fighting.\r\nMC lookslike he will die, DOESN'T <-But hey that's like a lot of anime.\\n\\n\r\nBut anyway, if we didn't have those cliche's it would just be a boring bloodbath.\\n\\n\r\nBut Kabaneri....how do I say it? It had potential, but with only 12 episodes, of course it was rushed.\\n\r\nSo first of all, I want to talk about the characters. The MC, Ikoma, seems interesting, but then he really doesn't get much development, pretty much all the characters get of their backstories, is of their families or people important to them getting killed by Kabane.\\n\\n\r\nThe other character is Mumei, dear god she is annoying. She comes off as this badass chick that has no fear or something..but.\\n\r\nOne moment, she's protecting people and playing with children, the next minute she's freakin sassin off to to Ikoma for no reason and just being a retard. She makes no sense and I really didn't care for her.\\n\\n\r\nSecond thing I need to rant on is the antagonist, sure he might have a grudge on his dad, but that doesn't give him a reason to KILL EVERYONE. I mean seriously!?\\n\\n\r\nBut anyway, enough of the ranting, let me talk about Kabaneri's good points.\\n\r\nFirst off, animation and sound, both really good, especially the OSTs, which is no surprise since they were composed by Sawano Hiroyuki. Animation, I liked it. It's sort of old, but new, it's hard to explain it, but if you look at their eyes (Especially the girls) it has a old style, but it's new? But yeah anyway. \\n\\n\r\nThe anime does keep me interested, and was more gory than I thought. Before I watched the anime, one of my MAL friends Avalnych, he gave me a heads up saying \\n\r\n\"That anime needed more episodes\"\\n\\n\r\nAnd yes, he was right, if this anime had had 24 eps, and good development, I probably would've given it an 8, but unfortunately with it not fulfilling it's potential, it gets a 6. But don't skip this anime just because people say it's a ripoff of all those other post-apocalyptic anime, it really depends on the person and what you've seen. If you've seen Attack on Titan, Black Bullet, God Eater, Sidonia no Kishi and all those other anime, you'll probably just hate on it and say it's a ripoff.\\n\\n\r\nHowever if you have not watched those anime, this one isn't a particularly bad one to start with.\\n\\n\\n\r\nThank you for reading my review.",

            "content": "This is my first review so bear with me. After reading many criticisms about Kabaneri, I felt I should defend it with some of my opinions on the show. I will avoid spoilers as much as possible, but some may slip out to exemplify a strength or weakness; you've been warned. \r\n1. Story (5-Mediocre)\r\nObviously, the story is where many people begin the bashing. It is Attack on Titan: Zombie Edition for most people watching, and I can see it as well. Despite this fact, we have to look at the person who directed the show: Tetsurou Araki. Araki has directed another show, would you liketo guess what it is? He directed Attack on Titan as well, so obviously some of his story elements might have carried over from his other work. I've also seen comparisons to Wit Studio's other work Owari no Seraph which is, like Kabaneri, Attack on Titan: Vampire Edition. I'm not trying to label this as an Attack on Titan knock off, but it is so hard to avoid the comparison. I can rationalize it with the director and studio both working with similar content, but the story is most certainly not original. This applies to the manga as well, coming out after Owari no Seraph and Attack on Titan. \\n\\n\r\n2. Art (8-very good)\\n\r\nIf this show was entirely hand-drawn, this could've been a 9 or 10 easy. The show's strengths are most certainly in the animation and sound and at times I was distracted by these over the shoddy writing making the show enjoyable. The animation definitely emphasizes the hard work of Kabaneri's animators and the quality should not go overlooked. My favorite scene, which exemplifies Kabaneri's strengths in animation and sound, is probably the transformation of Ikoma which has Aimer played over the sequence making it more emotional and dramatic. The combination of the music and art is what really carries the weight of the show. \\n\\n\r\n3. Sound (9-great)\\n\r\nI covered this in art since the art looks nice and there isn't much else to say about it. The sound's combination with the art is what balances the great qualities of the show. With Masafumi Mima (Attack on Titan, Fullmetal Alchemist) in the sound direction position, the show would, no doubt, have great sound and music. The opening and ending tracks are handled by EGOIST and Aimer, two of my favorite Japanese singers who work on anime. Many people say ufotable's Fate Stay/Night had the best opening ever because of the beautiful track by Aimer \"Brave Shine\". Aimer once again does great work with the ending track and the song that plays at the end of episode 11 and the Kabaneri theme by EGOIST is also outstanding. The suspenseful background music is implemented effectively and helps raise the emotions of the show. \\n\\n\r\n4. Character (4-decent)\\n\r\nIf you've read my bio, you know anything under a 7 is not a good thing. I'm saying this because \"decent\" is probably still too generous of a word. It's funny since I gave story a 5 and the word for that rating sounds worse: mediocre. All the characters are stock (stereotypical, for those who don't know) and carry tropes seen many times before. The development of characters is also non-existent or foreseeable if a change is necessary to drive the plot. Many of the characters also don't seem to be very intelligent in assessing situations and it normally turns bad because of this poor decision making. Biba, the antagonist, is also bland and poorly developed; seeking revenge on his father while sacrificing most of the remaining Japanese population - what a great plan. \\n\\n\r\n5. Enjoyment (7-good)\\n\r\nDespite the story and character being another rendition of generic storytelling, the way it is animated and orchestrated overpowers its weaknesses. Sure, if you  want to be critical of the work, it is not something noteworthy but if you want to watch beautiful animation with great action sequences backed by a great score, this show will most certainly be enjoyable despite the writing.\\n\\n\r\n6. Overall (7-good)\\n\r\nMaybe this is being too generous since when you average all of these you get a 6.6, but I'm still not convinced that this show is garbage due to its story and characters. If we criticized shows for being mundane in storytelling, every show would be rated horribly outside of maybe 1 each season. Now, my grading scale does not excuse 7's or lower since a 7 is meant, in my opinion, to express a show with quality in some areas and flaws in others. Kabaneri is most certainly a flawed show in more ways than one, but if we ignore the hard work of the animators and sound director we would be shaming not only this show but other shows that are fun to watch. I'm normally very critical of shows with bad writing but I've become more docile in grading since some people watch shows to see action and adventure - something Kabaneri does effectively - and many good shows could be arguably the same monster of strengths and flaws (I'm looking at you Attack on Titan; yes, I grade Attack on Titan the same as this since I don't believe that shows was written well but the animation and sound carried most of the burden). So saying the show is good seems adequate, especially since it is too similar to Attack on Titan with almost the same people working on Kabaneri. I see people's criticisms and I agree, don't get me wrong, but the show isn't horrible. I want to continue, but it is repetitive to continue saying what is good and what is bad in relation to other reviews (which the guidelines say NOT to do).\\n\\n\r\nWould I recommend this show? For someone who wants a gritty action, steampunk-fueled, adventure, most certainly!",

            "content": "Frankly, I think people mistaken the flashy animation for potential because it never had much even once the premise was set.\r\nEssentially, these monsters that isolated mankind were Zombies with gold hearts. Such an enemy for me is too one dimensional but I was hoping for a narrative that would add a new layer to this. Unfortunately, this one didn't. There was no hint at how these came to be and their killing technique failed instill any fear in the audience unless a victim screamed loud enough. Yes, over dramatic.\r\nThe protagonist was the typical mouthy, ambitious shounen protagonist who wanted to prove a point. I'm ratherused to this common troupe, and was ready to put up with this having realised that he was quite intelligent. For example, he made a very cool gun that killed Kabane more easily proving his  expertise as an engineer. Unfortunately this is as far as his intellect goes.\\n\\n\r\nThere was definitely a political undertone to this that developed as the story went on. At first, it seemed too cryptic for the sake of mystery but once it came to light, it still didn't make sense or hint to something groundbreaking. This brings me to my next point. The motivation of the villain. I didn't understand the liberation he was referring to on episode 9 for example. His reasoning didn't make an ounce of sense nor did Ikoma's reason for being suspicious of him. Regardless of whether he was right, how he came to it didn't make sense.\\n\\n\r\nThis is a short anime series, so I didn't expect in an in-depth story. But there's rushing and skipping story elements and then, there's leaving huge plot holes. These plot holes couldn't be ignored, sorry. But okay, the story could have been marginally poor but forgiven if the anime possessed good amount of \"epicness\". Annndddd it failed at this too.\\n\\n\r\nThe fight scenes was basic. You had steampunk guns, half zombies, samurais and the fight scenes were so mediocre. Overall, things were more bright than visually satisfying. Please do not let the unnecessary lights fool you, there was little substance in any of the action. The soundtrack which may have been overlooked by others didn't fool me either. It was the biggest give away that this was put together in a formulaic way to mirror AoT's success. The music fitted the tone rather than the show itself. I personally felt it was very unauthentic. \\n\\n\r\nFrankly I could literally smell the lack of soul in this anime.\\n\r\nHaving watched a short show like Dimension W that showed how to cut huge chunks of plot satisfactorily, this was inexcusable. And having watched another AoT \"wannabe\" in the form of Black Bullet, that actually provided a story that's unique enough to stand on its own. This was a shameless copycat. I have come to realise this didn't do much of anything well. I feel duped by how it was positioned because it never found its own identity but tried to extract different elements to form a winning formula that still produced a poor result.\\n\\n\r\nIn summary:\\n\r\nStory 3/10 - It didn't make sense nor did the character's motivations.\\n\r\nSoundtrack 3/10 - Felt forced and overkill.\\n\r\nArt - 6/10 It was ok.\\n\r\nCharacter - 4/10 - Squandered potential.\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 4/10 -When I realised this was going nowhere, I just wanted to be done with it.\\n",

            "content": "It is of no wonder that people often compare Koutetsujou no Kabaneri (Kabaneri of the Iron Fortress) and Shingeki no Kyojin (Attack on Titan) - produced by the same studio, WIT studio, and having a similar plot line. But I am here to write a review of Koutetsujou, and not writing a comparison essay.\r\nKotetsujou is interesting to a degree, but its charming points have been used in other anime (aka SnK/AoT) that it was somewhat compared to. In a steampunk-old Japan setting, the story revolves around MC Ikoma who is a steam smith as he fight against the zombies, whose heart was almost impossible topenetrate due to some sort of iron cage. You have an iron train and hordes of zombies as you follow him and the other minor characters into a journey! The plot isn't quite there, sadly. It was lost a few episodes in. It has an interesting start, then it touched upon the ugliness of human's soul, and a deus ex machina good ending - as far as the anime ends. I've only seen three plot holes so far, which happens towards the end, and how it happens is by God's commands. There may be more but I have failed to see it, or have been forgotten through the weeks.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters of Kotetsujou aren't too bad, but they lack of fleshing out the characters. There are only three characters in the whole series is given the opportunity to show their pasts through flashbacks. Their characters remain the same from start to finish, though second MC Mumei have slightly grown in terms of thoughts. Apart of the two MC (Ikoma and Mumei), the others are just there to foil a little of the MC's behaviors. The antagonist have a rather silly motivation, though I could see his point, but his actions was somewhat retarded. \"Human population is declining, but I must take revenge and so they need to die.\" I have failed to understand this logic. Sometimes, the normal humans would achieve bad ass moments, and those are the only times I would remember them. Unfortunately.\\n\\n\r\nKotetsujou's saving point is its art. It uses dark colors to enhance its normal, grim setting and I could remember a scene full of light to portray the mood - it was excellent. There is a contrast of appearance between royalty and peasants that I really like. It's action scenes merged with 3D animation is eye candy. I am a sucker for good art, and this is one of them. The character designs are not bad - you could easily spot the main characters and the \"main\" characters. What I didn't quite like is Ikoma's character design. His hair after Episode 1 is weird.\\n\\n\r\nThe sounds are not bad. The OP and ED does portray the mood they want to show in the anime. I don't have much to say about this as I don't quite notice or have anything to pinpoint about.\\n\\n\r\nFor enjoyment it was alright. Sure, the plot may have been used before in other big works, but I'd say that it's worth to check it out. Kotetsujou will be in my list of great art, but all other parts are moderate at best. Perhaps it has too many characters and too many things to explore that they didn't quite tap into its potential that led it derail from its original motive. Rewatching wouldn't be necessary, for there was nothing left to explore when they have given you almost everything you need to know apart of the plot holes.\\n\\n\r\nOverall it's a little above average because I like the art and fluid animation, and it has, at the very least, an antagonist with motivation that you can hate and portrays the humans being extremely easy to brain wash (which is true if you have the correct ingredients to do so). Many people were disappointed from its hype, but I didn't join the hype train beforehand and have successfully avoided the disappointment wreck. It is worth checking out, even if it was just for the art.",

And that was exactly what this anime accomplished when we snuck in to peek at the mind blowing heat steaming trailer. The first few episodes were a breath of fresh air. Super action packed scenes that were constantly visually stimulating. You were literally on the edge of your seat, as the epitome of coolness exploded right at your face. What a train ride this show turned out to be. If you are all about STEAMPUNK, IRON FORTRESSES, STEEL STRUCTURE, EXPLOSIONS, USIANBOLT ZOMBIES! then buckle up before your steam engine burns out. \\n\\n\r\nNow unfortunately first impressions can always be overridden if the substance of an idea cannot sustain itself. And subjectively being someone more interested in a \"good story\" that was when the asmtha kicked in. The smoke of polluted air drained the life out of me. There was too many missed opportunities, rushed moments and I strangely expected more..... But you have to give credit where credit is due. The intentions were very clear. This was nothing but a sit back and enjoy the ride kinda flick. Now that the show is over at least you get to watch it in one go. Waiting every week really did kill the engine.\\n\\n\r\np.s ( post scriptum ) \\n\r\nthis was a very light review......\\n",

And of course the music was gonna be good, they had fucking Hiroyuki Sawano AND Aimer, that\u2019s like getting the musical equivalent of a second Christmas with dragons.\\n\r\nif you\u2019re wondering why I didn\u2019t include Egoist above it\u2019s probably because I didn\u2019t really like the OP much, and before you say I\u2019m just some weeby elitist douche with no taste in music I\u2019m only half of that, and I actually really like Egoist, which is why this opening felt so disappointing, I know she can do way better, at least two of the three theme songs for the project Itoh movies are in my phone worn out from replaying them so often. But I guess this is just the best you can get when you force her to work with such lousy material.\\n\r\nRemember how I said this was supposed to be the good section, HA, neither do I.\\n\\n\r\nthe bad:\\n\r\nif this series was an adaption everything wrong with it could basically be blamed on the source material. \\n\r\nSO in no particular order here are the issues I had:\\n\r\n-Bad Characterization: the characters are just so...average at best, in episode 2 or 3 glasses-so-i-look- smart, i.e. ikoma tells his \"tragic backstory\" ignoring the fact that the question he was asked didn\u2019t justify dumping his entire life story out of nowhere his story is generic, clich\u00e9 and can be told basically through a 3 second animation of his sister getting bitten and him turning around dramatically, And you know what I find most obnoxious about it? the fact that the characters and indeed the writers seem aware of just how clich\u00e9 it is since the character he talks to predicts this and flat out CALLS it clich\u00e9, and yet still are we meant to care?\\n\r\nanother bad aspect of the characters is that everyone besides the main cast seem to have about 3 brain cells between them, they yell, make wild accusations and just generally behave like dipshits, its actually funny how they constantly dis and distrust ikoma and mumei and call them kabane when I\u2019d say the kabane are smarter than they are, please explain to me how these supposedly trained soldiers who've lived their entire lives around kabane can\u2019t seem to tell the difference between a gray malformed lumbering creature incapable of dialogue and a regular dude screaming \u201cDONT KILL ME\u201d. at times they even say shit like: \"that\u2019s what a kabane would do\" or \"in the end, she\u2019s just a kabane\"\\n\\n\r\n:|\\n\\n\r\nare you for real you bunch morons?! a kabane is, once again, very clearly visually distinguishable and D-O-E-S-N-T SPEEEEAK, shouldn\u2019t just the fact that they\u2019re telling you to fuck off show that their NOT kabane? I purposefully avoided saying \u201ccan't think\u201d because that'd describe 80% of the people in this show pretty well, and at least the kabane can learn sword fighting and boxing, bizarrely.\\n\r\nLet's harp on the characters some more I quite enjoy it, the sheer level of idiocy on display here sometimes borders on self-extinction, honestly these people don\u2019t need the kabane to get wiped out, seems like just five minutes with a sharp object will suffice and I\u2019m not even exaggerating, in one episode one of moss-head's friends pisses of a soldier, and what does that soldier do? he doesn\u2019t let him off with a warning or just arrest him, ya know cause he\u2019s supposed to be an adult and disciplined soldier, no, he literally pulls out his sword and plans to KILL him, and he would\u2019ve done it too if protag didn\u2019t step in, I don\u2019t know who\u2019s dumber, the soldier or the kid who pissed him off cause apparently his plan was to guard against his sword with his bare hands! What\u2019d you think was gonna happen mate? He\u2019d just cut through the fat and get stuck? then you\u2019d have him right where you want him? Mind you this still doesn\u2019t seem as bizarre to me as the fact that he can even be fat when all throughout the show a point is made that food is pretty scarce and you have to ration it.\\n\r\noh boy I\u2019ve been wailing on the characters for quite a while, and I\u2019m not even DONE. but since I\u2019ve dragged this out long enough I\u2019ll try to summarize the main antagonist as quickly as I can - a huge twat. that should do but if you want a more in-depth description of the scale of his twatiness he\u2019s just so comically evil its obnoxious, if this guy were a video game villain he'd be one of the billionaire morons from the resident evil series who keep investing in zombies and monsters as a brilliant way to take over the world.\\n\\n\r\n-dialogue: mediocre at best, so much so i don\u2019t feel like there\u2019s much to add here really, if that whole \"fill belly with rice\" line didn\u2019t make your body do a little involuntary \u201cblegh\u201d sound you may want to see your doctor cause apparently your gag reflex stopped working. all its attempts at character's ideologies and philosophies just comes across as generic at best, and just plain bullshit at worst usually whenever stupidly villainous villain guy attempts to justify setting babies on fire and feeding them to their dog, and then him eating that dog.\\n\\n\r\n-kabane: and finally perhaps the most important aspect the show failed at (depending on who you ask) as you may have gathered from the beginning of this review, initially at least, there was quite a comparison drawn between attack on titan and this show, and while many things helped erase that discussion(mostly things like attack on titan not being total shit) the one difference most important between the two is that the titans, while not always, at least at times came across as these truly unnerving, scary fucked up creatures that really helped give a sense of urgency to the show, the kabane on the other hand are basically faster, shoot-in-the-heart-not-the-brain zombies except they\u2019re not even that! cause several times just lobbing their heads off seems to do the trick quite well.\\n\\n\r\nSo let\u2019s summarize, at the beginning of this review I said that before its release kabaneri seemed like: \"attack on titan: trains edition\" but now it can be seen for what it was meant to be and what it ended up being, it was meant to be \"Attack on titan-ish: hope you didn\u2019t forget attack on titan exists, here\u2019s something to hold you over till then\" and what it ended up being is \"Not even really attack on titan-ish: we probably should have just taken the time and effort put into this and released attack on titan sooner huh...\" and now that I ranted all over you(and even if you didn\u2019t agree thanks for reading this) i guess I\u2019ll just make like kabaneri and have a shit conclusion, bye.\\n",

            "content": "I myself rated this anime a 6/10 but doing the calculation overall it was a 7. The story reminded me of attack on titan with monster trying to kill people with a main character who wanted to kill all of these said monsters. I like the whole idea of people coming together to fight a common enemy, but the story kinda lacked what i was hoping for in the story. I will come back to why I didn't like the story and where it went later on. The Art of the anime was really go especially in close up shots of character where it hada paint like look to the characters. Some of the animation wasn't great or they looked like they cut corner with close up so they didn't have to animate certain parts but it was ok overall other than those parts. The sound track I cannot say much about but it was the made by same composer of attack on titan's sound track Hiroyuki Sawano. I liked the soundtrack for this anime but I will have to listen to it by itself to say how much I truly enjoyed it. The characters of this anime were not really all fleshed out and their back story's were rather lack luster. I did not really care for many of the characters. The only one I liked were those that looked cool and not many really did. But than again what can you do for character development in a 12 episode anime. The only characters that were developed were the main characters Ikomu and Mumei. Everyone else was just kind of there just to be there. Ikomu was really just very linear and had little change to his character and Mumei was an annoying cocky brat for the most part but than again she was only 12 so ir is within reason. Back to the story... Without spoiling anything the story could have had more potential. They could have tried to figure out the origin of the monsters, find a cure, explore without the use of the trains, maybe even had a war between opposing factions or cities ( rather then the short one they kinda had), and many more. The story deiced to go along a rather boring plot and the \"superpowers\" the characters got near the end of the series was kinda disappointing. After the mid way point of the anime the plot went downhill and I had no idea where they were going to go with the story. I was not a huge fan of what they did with Mumei \"brother\" to make him the main plot point in the ending.  The series was not bad but it wasn't good. It was a decent anime that could have been better. If it does have a second season I hope they go for more of a exploration type anime. Trying to figure out the origin of the Kabane, find a cure, find survivors, etc.",

            "content": "Ever since I was in my early teens I have been a fan of the zombie genre which started out as me playing all the Resident Evil games to reading all The Walking Dead comics. When I became a fan of anime one of my first thoughts was were there any good or decent zombie genre anime out there. There was really none out there other than ecchi girls vs zombies (High School of the Dead) or moe girls vs zombies (Gakkougurashi!) or as a theme for a single episode. I think Kabaneri is probably one of the only takes on the zombie genre inanime that can be taken as if you watching a proper zombie genre story unfold. However The story is not perfect its probably the best we got for a serious zombie anime for a wall. \\n\\n\r\nWith all the negativity about the show people will probably think my current score is too positive however I don't factor in petty stuff like hype or rip-off accusations when I review something. I go into anime a lot with low expectations and I literally only heard of this show when it was coming out. Also I am pretty tired of Attack on Titan comparisons and this show is not the first I have seen with such accusations and I bet it won't be the last. If I where to be honest I would say it does have some elements when it comes to steam punk weapons and contraptions but that is pretty much it. \\n\\n\r\nThe story takes place in an industrial revolution apocalyptic world where humanity resides in these places called stations.  The main story focuses on some humans trying to get from one of these stations to another while fending off these super zombies known as Kabane. Zombie genre stories go one of two ways. one being a story that focuses on what makes someone human where you have a group of weak or moderlately strong survivors trying to survive in best way available to them. The second you have an action series where a group of badasses kill zombies each day. Kabaneri is more of the latter when it comes to a zombie series.\\n\\n\r\nThe story has its high points and epic moments of pure Badassery that make the story fun. However the story is what is flawed with this series and is where it loses its points from me. I feel like the story was a bit rushed in the last few episodes. I feel like the series should have been twenty four episode since the pacing near the end seemed too fast. If the story did not feel as rushed in the end as it did I would have scored the series higher might have even given it a ten. \\n\\n\r\nThe art in this series is absolutely amazing as WIT studio use similar high budget animation techniques like the ones they used in AOT to animate this series. The character designs are unique and makes them easily recognizable and not blend with the crowd of extras on the train and stations. The fights with the zombies known as the kabane are pretty epic when the fight look like a camera is paning around are characters as they take out the Kabane. There is some CGI used but it ain't horrible as it is really subtle making it hard to notice. If there was anything that truly carried this series it would be the art.\\n\\n\r\nThe only other thing that would be truly carrying this series is the music. The music in this series is absolutely amazing. The opening and ending themes are beautiful. In scenes such as fights or epic moments the music is like a gloss that makes those scenes shine better.  The japanese voices don't really pack much emotion other than Ikoma or Mumei in their worst moments. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters in this series do feel shallow apart from Ikoma and Mumei who get the most development. I do like them but I felt the series could of developed the supporting cast a bit better. I really liked Ikoma as he pretty much was a rebellious badass throughout the series. My only problem was I think he might be a bit deaf as he shouted \"MUMEI\" alot.  Mumei who was a really badass character in the beginning did a bunch of 180s later on. We also had a villain but like other characters they too were shallow. \\n\\n\r\nDespite its problems I enjoyed Kabaneri. It was thrill ride but due to a few road bumps it lost its chance at being the perfect zombie genre anime.",

            "content": "Ok, before I get pitch forks out vying for my head, let me explain a little why my score is a 6. There are two reasons why: The music and the art. The amount of stills did bring the number down a bit but it was fluid for the most part and the music....I can't complain about it. It brought the mood up or down depending on what it was suppose to do in the situation. The voice acting was...pretty good for some of the characters. Others (especially the one who tried to sound American or British), didn't work at all. Now the two bigthings: the story and the characters. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Ikoma was a strong MC for the most part with the exception with whining (especially in the beginning), and was an inventor with a reason to hate the Karabane. Mumei was amazing...for the first half and then she fell off the band wagon for pretty much the rest of the season which annoyed me to pieces.  Ayame was the biggest suprise to me ad who had, in my opinion, the most character development. She went from being an heiress with a carefree life without responsibility to being thrust into the leadership role. Sure, she had a couple of slips here and there but that's to be expected and the last couple episodes for her were amazing with how long she's come. Kurusu I didn't think I would like. In fact I hated him for the first few episodes. But then he grew on me and was terrified for him some episodes later. That normally doesn't happen. Biba for me was aggravating. He was just another typical villain which drove me nuts and wanted something different from him. Anything! The rest of the characters were pretty good. Takumi and Yukina were two that stood out. The twist with Takumi's character was surprising and was defiantly not expecting that. Yukina I just loved because of how bad ass she is. The rest were medicore and not very interesting (with a few more exceptions to the fellow steam smiths).  \\n\\n\r\nStory: It's because of how medicore some of these characters are really hurt the story. And then there's the story itself. I'll be honest and say that the first couple episodes were amazing. It was a different concept with some elements of AoT (even that dreaded one arm joke by the end), but there were some deviations. But by the end the story was a slight train wreak and the finale was just rushed which ruined it a bit with how everything was set up. Not to mention there are plot holes that weren't properly addressed in the show. \\n\\n\r\nAll in all, a half descent show if you want some mind numbing action and amazing music with pretty art.",

            "content": "Kabaneri of the Iron Fortress - Review\r\nCharacters - 7\r\nAlthough not really anything we haven't seen, the central characters don't fail to impress. Due to their usually clear and singular motives they are easily understandable and thus drive the story forward; one knows what they want, but not how those intentions will play against each other.\r\nThe side characters lack meaning though, making them pretty uninteresting and generic. But if they are brushed off as side characters the main cast seems even more interesting.\r\nStory - 8\r\nThis was rather interesting. Although seeming like a pretty generic adventure story at first, the plot twists with the introduction of Biba.His lack of logic or even madness makes it seem like he has further plans than the obvious. \\n\r\nAt the end of episode 10 he has completely succeeded with anything so far, making big drama, or a new twist necessary for the hero to be able to win. This is achieved with the black blood, a big risk the hero has to take in order to win.\\n\r\nThe last few scenes are also striking in that they bring a new twist to two characters; to Mumei, who ends Biba but doesn\u2019t hate him for his actions, and thus differentiates herself from most generic characters; and to Biba, who\u2019s last glimpse of humanity allows Ikoma to survive, not just achieve his goal.\\n\\n\r\nVisuals - 9\\n\r\nHigh production quality and a fitting style make this show very visually appealing. Animation is smooth, and the character designs are interesting.\\n\\n\r\nSound Design - 9\\n\r\nAlso a strong point of this series is the combination of situationally and emotionally fitting score as well as detail-rich ambience, which really ties the show together. The intro and credits song are also quite memorable.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 9\\n\r\nThis show has kept me interested with its unclear result. I didn't get invested in the characters, which made the idea of a complete failure after episode 10 so much more delightful. But even though it set itself considerably difficult goals as it moved on, it succeeded at resolving brilliantly. Thus it neither falls into the category 'boring', nor into 'interesting concept, horrible execution', which isn\u2019t an easy feat.\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 8\\n\r\nThis has been a strong show and was definitely worth my time. Although starting off moderately generic, it started to get more interesting, and thus more complex to write. While watching this series I got scared more and more about it, because the chance for it\u2019s failure continuously rose. So I was very relieved to see it turn out so brilliantly. This marvelous story, set of interesting character twists, and the production quality make this show a strong 8, maybe even more.",

You need more range to do expositions, but given the way they executed it, you'll be sucked into a post-apocalyptic Japan where steam trains are the main point of transportation, zombies roam freely, and there are unique individuals who are both human and zombie, all packed into an enjoyable steampunk adventure.\r\nNot yet sold?

They combined CG and 2D very well whenever you see a train. There's nothing wrong with the audio, but I don't exactly know what great audio is supposed to sound like. These things pull it up from a 1 to a 2, because I don't want to insult the art team, who most likely had nothing to do with the many issues with this series. Prepare for gore as well. Hair pulling gore, which for me is a plus.\r\nCons: Ifyou want bad writing, an unoriginal concept, trope filled, and often cookie cutter characters, on top of literally being a re-skinned version of attack on titan in almost every conceivable way: THIS IS THE SHOW FOR YOU!!\\n\\n\r\nNow replacing the genuinely refreshing idea of giants with the most extremely abused enemy of all time: Zombies. Not just any zombies, but inconsistent ones, we're talking slow as a snail one second, to (not kidding) 100MPH full sprint, with no excuse. They never acknowledge this, they simply change speeds depending on plot convenience. It's extremely ridiculous and blatant.\\n\\n\r\nBasically, if you *REALLY* like the attack on titan formula, this is for you. But you won't be getting anything new, no original characters, nothing you won't expect. If you haven't scene attack on titan, I think I'd recommend that over this. But that might be because I hadn't seen literally this exact story already, so it was actually original to me. As well as giants being more interesting than the hundredth zombie rendition.\\n\\n\r\nWe have the main character, dude who is sick of not being able to fight the force that trapping humanity behind walls, just like AOT. We have the extremely over powered female character, just like AOT. We have the guy that is always a dick to the main character, but of course is just trying to do the right thing, and of course is really a good guy, just like AOT (you get the idea, it's all like AOT). We also have the useless best friend character, who's special ability is yelling about how he's his friend.\\n\\n\r\nI won't get into the spoilery reasons why this show is exactly like AOT, but take my damn word. I can't even... They *tried* to make this the same thing, they didn't even want to hide it.\\n\\n\r\nAlso, the token super powered girl wasn't as annoying in AOT, so there's that. That being said, in this show there's actually half a reason why she's so strong (even though she's still inexplicably stronger than someone else with this excuse), in AOT it's just a female power fantasy, with no excuse. So choose your poison.",

            "content": "As much as these types of shows inevitably gain popularity for obvious reasons, for me, Kabaneri of the Iron Fortress is one of those cases where I can't side with those that have enjoyed it.\r\nThe premise, in simpler terms, is basically \"zombies with steampunk\", but there definitely is more to it. For the most part, I like the world that has been set up. I should point out that I'm not big on the zombie genre. Despite that, I gave Kabaneri a chance, and unfortunately, I was a bit disappointed. It's not necessarily the plot, but I felt like there could have been more. Wecould have gotten more development with the world that's been created, however we get familiar plot elements and action sequences in favor of that.\\n\\n\r\nWith this type of story, characters are important. Survivors band together and get to know each other. We see that in Kabaneri, but not to the effect where I really care about them. They seem to be lacking something that makes me lose interest. There's hardly any chemistry that can be considered passable. The most story we get from a character is from the main heroine, and even then it feels like she's only there to be the cute girl that appears in most of the promotional stuff for the series.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is the only great thing Kabaneri has to offer. Wit Studio always does a good job with their productions. The visuals alone made me want to know more about the universe. Despite what I said before, I still found the action sequences to be entertaining. The character designs are really interesting, and it turns out the original designer is also the original character designs for Gunbuster, which I thought was awesome.\\n\\n\r\nIn the end, the story Kabaneri of the Iron Fortress was a bit lackluster, but the animation and concept were just fine. Ever since the series premiered, many have been comparing this to Attack on Titan, another Wit Studio production. While showing similarities, I couldn't care either way. From the start, I knew there was going to be comparing, which is why I strayed from saying so. Kabaneri is an original concept, but there just might be some Attack on Titan influences in there. At any rate, I judged it as it's own thing, and even then, it's not that great.",

Koutetsujou no Kabaneri is definitely average in most ways. and very similar to Shingeki no Kyojin in every way especially the story, apocalypse level crisis with creatures out to destroy all of humanity, our only hope being a dude with a special ability to make him like the monsters we're fighting, and in the end it turns outthat we are still our own worst enemy, and there are a lot of walls. If you enjoyed Shingeki no Kyojin, like cool fight scenes, good artwork, a very nice soundtrack, and you aren't like these dummies asking for scientific realism in a steam punk zombie anime, you will probably like this. Cons are a couple annoying plot holes, average shonen characters, and the forced ignorance throughout the show may annoy the hell out of some people (it did me).",

That is my first issue, I am fine with people dying but the way people die in this show has the pointlessly randomly ding. In other shows there is normally some building up to the death and you don't just have random character deaths. You may say this makes them more human, which I think I valid but it just makes me angry and constantly strained from fear of a random character death. If I had to compare this toanother anime it would be attack on titans, but slightly to slot worse (the main character is better, but that's just because the MC in AOT is the worst). Another thing is the main villain is kind of the worst as in he has no real strong motivation besides \"screw you I'm angry\". This makes me just hate him and makes me think he had to much screen time. He is also very shallow in everything he does and he also is a scumbag, which you might say is the point, but when I physically want to punch this man it is too effective. The MC probably doesn't have enough screen time or the screen time without him isn't well written enough for him not to be there. He makes a drastic 180 in his character at one point in the show for little to no reason and that made me mad. It started to get boring. The villain and his actions were cool if it wasn't taking place in this story and it had a different villain, same thing with the hero. It's as if the randomly took a villain and a hero and mixed them together expecting a good result. On there own they could be pretty strong but when mixed it just weakens them. This is one of the shows that makes me fear other shows will be similar because I kind of hate it. The main female character in the beginning seems strong and smart, but then you immediately learn she is actually just a toddler. The coolest part of this anime is the first 4 episodes. I would recommend watching those and then stopping in all honesty. The first 4 episodes are great then it just takes a turn for the worst. I am writing everything while watching episode 11 right now, so I can remember my feelings fresh. If my feeling change at all after finishing the last episode it will be written under this. On I think I get it now this anime has 2 to 3 arcs in my opinion. Those should have lasted 8-9 episodes the extra 3 dragged it out and made it very painful. If they added the ending of episode 11 in like episode 6 or 7 it would have been much better. This is why I wrote the part earlier before finishing it because the power of the last w episodes can swing a review, but I felt everything leading up to now has been so painful that i needed to talk about it from a raw point of view. It often pushes to narratives at once such as humans are dumb but then someone else preaches that humans are smart. Later in the episode you see someone doing something dumb but then later you see someone do something smart. Everything they do directly contradicts the morals being built or the ones that already exist. I figured out that the dialogue is lack luster but the actions scenes are very good and can actually manage to tell the story almost all on there own and the endless amounts of talking and silent staring and walking can basically all be skipped if you wanted to do that. The main character just verbatim said \"what should I destroy next\" this shows that he has no motivation except that he's board and want to destroy for no reason. That's not even elaborated on because the show keeps trying to show his \"reason\" down your throat. Everything that was a cool action movie like scene is now happening in one episode which is great but they should have spread it out instead of having nothing going on for about 6 episodes. Another note the soundtrack of this show saved it if it had no or a bad soundtrack I would have stopped episode 3. Just finished my opinions are all the same the ending was decent and that's about all.\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "\"Wait, it's just Attack on Titan with zombies and steampunk trains. C'MON THAT'S JUST LAZY WRITING\"\r\nIf I hadn't seen Attack on Titan, I'd probably think this show was more interesting and original, but since I have, it just seems like self-plagiarism. This review is basically going to cover why they're basically ripping of AoT.\r\n=== STORY/CHARACTERS ===\r\nThe story and characters are exactly the same as the ones in AoT. You've got monsters (zombies, rather than titans in this case), that keep people boxed into small, walled in towns. Only 3 characters in the entire show can kill them, and everyone else just runs away in fear.\r\nYou'vegot your determined MC, who doesn't do much except yell about how he's going to kill all the Titans - wait, I mean zombies. He's half zombie himself, so everybody (except his friends) are afraid of him (and this fact is stated in the first episode, so there's not build up like Eren's titan reveal, after assuming he's dead).\\n\\n\r\nYou've got the MCs best friend, who's a geek, can't fight, and doesn't add a whole lot to the story (although, I do like this guy better than Armin. Armin's more of a whiny baby - even though he's a bit more developed).\\n\\n\r\nThe main female heroine isn't exactly Mikasa, but she's similar enough. Both are badasses that easily kill more monsters than everyone else in the show combined. Both have some dark past that explains their aforementioned baddassery. The only major difference, is Mikasa gives a crap about Eren, and this girl doesn't care about the MC (not that it's especially bad, it's just a difference).\\n\\n\r\nAnd you've got everyone else who's too afraid to fight the monsters, and afraid of the MC because he's \"one of them\" and an \"enemy of humanity\", despite him saving everyone else a few dozen times.\\n\\n\r\nOh, and we've got a bit of Tokyo Ghoul in here as well, since the Kabaneri drink other peoples blood and can't function as regular members of society. So there's that.\\n\\n\r\nLook man, I'm OK with a similar premise (post-apocalyptic survival in a world full of monsters), but you have to go somewhere interesting with it and have unique characters. These characters have less development (and less traits to begin with) than those in AoT. The backstory for any character can be summed up in a single sentence, the interesting side characters like Jean are non-existent. People's complete and utter fear of the Kabaneri's makes less sense (since they're not giant outta control Titans), and there doesn't seem to be a real end goal at the moment (other than to survive). Again, the writing is just lazy.\\n\\n\r\n=== ART ===\\n\r\nI gotta give the art a high rating. The style is really cool, and all the scenes look great. I personally prefer the simpler art style in AoT, but dang, I'm impressed with the work that went into the art for this show. The only gripe I have is AoT's zipping around with hookshots led to *way* cooler looking fight scenes, that are yet to be reviled by anything else\\n\\n\r\n=== SOUND ===\\n\r\nSound is good: the opening and ending songs are catchy, and the soundtrack isn't distracting.\\n\\n\r\n===========\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I can't really rate this show higher than a 6 (maybe even a 5). If the characters or plot were different, I would probably bump this to an 8, but they just aren't, and there just isn't a lot of originality other than the world it takes place in. I'll watch it still, but I've just been a bit disappointed.",

            "content": "EdIt: After finishing this series, I feel the need to add on to this review.\r\nFirst, let me establish that a score lower than a 5 in my book is something where I hated most of the characters with a passion, the story made me absolutely infuriated, I hated the art and sound, and the overall fun value I felt throughout was very very low, all ranging from 5 with to 1. I've never actually watched an anime I hated to that extend all of the way through because I don't like self torture, and I don't review anime I don't watch all of the waythrough because I'm not terrible. I don't really see why people bother with reviews that low, but I suppose I applaud those who take bullets for the rest of us by watching awful anime without getting paid for it or something. \\n\\n\r\nAnyway, looking back at the other reviewers it seems to me that a lot of people (especially those rated helpful) seem to be criticizing this series for trying to be too much like AOT, which is why I mentioned it in my original review. Looking back at the series I feel like this is unfair, as it puts a set of expectations onto Kabaneri that one really shouldn't go into watching it with. In reality, Kabaneri is similar to AOT only in basic premise. As far as writing and overall quality, this anime is nothing like AOT. By episode 4, it becomes apparent that the story is not very well written, but it is enjoyable due to the action and overall good fun vibes of it. Better than many, worse than a lot, and with enough modern touches to earn my respect. In short, it was good if you like that kind of thing, but still not something you would really remember even a year down the line and it's definitely not going to win awards for its writing. That being said, if you go in expecting it to be AOT (and you liked AOT), you're just going to be disappointed and probably infuriated. \\n\\n\r\nBy the middle of the series, it becomes a bit of a frustrating mess as the show falls back into very overdone melodrama and stereotypes. It loses a lot of the qualities that made it enjoyable as annoying characters start to show up, and my opinion of Kabaneri suffered as a result. I dropped my story rating from a 7 (which was admittedly generous of me, but my rating in this category does tend to vary widely from genre to genre) to a 4, and the characters from an 8 (in respect of strong female presence) to a 4. \\n\\n\r\nThat being said, I don't believe the unfortunate direction of the anime warrants a 3 or anything lower than a 5, really. The anime was an okay watch and progressively got worse, but never really hit a point where I came away absolutely hating it. In the end, as long as you like the premise of the show, go in without expecting high quality storytelling and characters, and just want to watch something for good fun, then this is a decent choice. If you hate absolutely anything without a good story or great characters, then you won't like Kabaneri and I don't recommend watching it/suggest dropping it. \\n\\n\r\nOriginal review follows:\\n\\n\r\nA lot of people say this is basically the walking dead meets attack on titan. Which is true. But let me ask you this: why is that a bad thing? Why do people generally act like there is something inherently wrong about taking an idea and putting a new twist on it? I have news for you folks: anything is rarely new. If you think it is, you're probably just not old enough to remember what it ripped off. Ie, attack on titan is basically any given mecha mixed with battle star Galactica, with the admittedly pretty original twist of titans instead of battle suits. And the walking dead is literally just any zombie film, tv show, game, etc written by people who read The Road. And don't get me started about literally any given shonen anime. \\n\\n\r\nWhat should really matter is whether or not you like what they did with the idea. In this case, I do! I like the concept of the heroes becoming hybrids of the enemy. Call me pretentious, but I like to see writers handle the dichotomy between two warring factions with tricksteresque characters. It's why I love the Tokyo ghoul manga and Parasyte. \\n\\n\r\nThe action in Kabaneri is enjoyable, and the characters are surprisingly refreshing. I especially appreciate the female representation. The main female lead is respectably bad ass, and she isn't just blatant fan service. Basically, she's mikasa. And I'm fine with that. We don't have enough women in anime for me to try and be picky about original character creation. And yes, there are cut outs, but even they have unexpected moments of pretty good writing. They also sometimes sprinkle in females in the background and into otherwise typically male roles, which is nice.\\n\\n\r\nBasically, Kabaneri is an okay ride with decent characters and some very refreshing touches. The story seems fine to me, but I'm only 6 episodes in so that could quickly change. It's a solid 7-8 for me right now.",

            "content": "This show is such a blatant & shallow bandwagon-riding money-grab that I would have respected the creators more if they just acknowledged it and titled the show \"Attack on Kabane -the maxim\" or named the main character \"Izumi Jaeger\" or something.\r\nIf you're like me, you will find the \"similarities\" beyond stale by this point, but it's safe to say that those who enjoyed the tone and premise of those other shows (AoT and Parasyte [not to mention the many others with the same trope of humanity vs monster/oppressor where the MC somehow becomes infected or otherwise attains the monster's power but retains his humanity/sanity]) willenjoy this one. The show's pacing is satisfactory. The visuals are engaging and the tone is dark and suspenseful. Despite feeling like I've seen it all before, I still watched this show to completion. That said, the writing that serves as the show's foundation is lazy and derivative, and therefore I was not surprised to find the same absence of originality in every major plot development, every challenge/struggle/obstacle the characters faced (introspective and external), and every solution they chose to overcome them.\\n\\n\\n\r\nIf you are the type to scrutinize the decision-making of characters, or simply the physical possibility of events in a show, and judge them by any realistic/logical standards, then this is not the show for you. If you can easily suspend your disbelief, and don't think much about the merits of characters' actions/decisions, then you at least satisfy what I would consider the prerequisite (in disposition) to enjoy a show like this.\\n\\n\r\nMILD SPOILERS (from first episode of comparison shows Parasyte and Kabaneri)\\n\\n\r\nOne major thing that seemed just silly/ridiculous to me was how he stopped the spread of the infection. First of all he just straps some red-hot metal to his arm and then nails some bolts/strap into his chest. Not only does none of this make any goddamn sense in terms of stopping an infection from spreading, but how did he not black out from shock and pain? Assuming he's an insane badass and could stay coherent through the red hot metal alone, he would still just be curled up in the fetal position screaming bloody murder. Instead he takes it in stride \"okay, just burned my arm down to the bone and that did nothing; time to fuckin' choke myself out.\" The only reason it works in parasyte is because it's a physical entity (the parasite/worm) that he is blocking with a tourniquet.\\n\\n\r\nUnless this show somehow explains that the Kabane virus is actually a small parasitic organism that needs to reach the brain to survive past like 20 seconds, this scene will remain utter nonsense. How would choking yourself do anything? He doesn't even lose consciousness so it's not like it was even a strong/thorough choking. That also doesn't make sense... Sure is convenient how whatever industrial equipment it was that he used to choke himself showed restraint and choked him juuust right, rather than summarily squeezing the life out of him or--more likely--popping his head off like a grape. I'm pretty sure that when it comes to \"tug of war,\" industrial metalworking machinery wins against flesh every time.\\n\\n\r\nBut hey since he bolted/nailed/burned/strapped all that arbitrary shit to himself, now the main character looks super kakkoii and unique. I like how nobody says anything about it either, apart from the Kabaneri girl addressing his choker. \"Hey why does that guy have a bunch of shit bolted to himself?\" \"Umm do you not see how cool it looks?\"\\n\\n\r\n---------------------------\\n\\n\r\nBeyond that, be prepared for a main (human) antagonist who seems completely level-headed and rational when the story needs him to be, and then tosses reason out the window and murders hundreds if not thousands of innocent people over a grudge he held against one person from a decade ago. Never mind that humanity is at risk of extinction, he and all of his soldiers are apparently fine with slaughtering innocent women and children in droves because the shogun deserted them on the battlefield. If you watched the show you know what part I'm referring to, and it was also necessary for them to turn Mumei into an unthinking sap for this plot point as well. Not one of the soldiers or Mumei is like \"hey wait maybe this dude is a bad guy after all, I mean he's constantly spouting shit about how the weak don't deserve to live but he was a child at one point too right? Naah never mind it's best if we just don't think about anything and continue following the lead of an absolutely insane person hypocrite.\\n\\n\r\nShow is weak.",

            "content": "\"We will aim rice fields to eat rice in the future\" - mumei\r\nI start this review with one of the most retarded reasons that a character can have in an anime, not only the reason, but the anime as a whole is retarded. Okay, okay, they can not grow rice anymore, but they survive very well without them, so the only reason the protagonists have that goal is for them to have a reason to fight the kabanes, except to try to find the cure So I mumei back to being human, which they did not do and I do not think there is goingto be 2nd season (I hope so).\\n\\n\r\nStory 4/10: Kabaneri is basically Shingeki no Kyojin on a train, the story tells the journey of our \"great\" main protagonist Ikoma, he is an engineer who takes care of trains arriving from other cities, on business trips or expeditions, Ikoma also tries to create a weapon Able to pierce the hard body of the enemies called kabanes, of course this is not allowed so he makes the experiments hidden, at that time appeared the good for nothing princess called Ayame, after a good time the train called Koutetsujou arrives at the scene, Just after this appears two more characters, the faithful guardian of Ayame Kurusu and her father. On this train they bring two other characters: Mumei and Shimon. They are the ones not to be inspected by the samurai, guardians of the city, basically to him, they inspect each of the members of the train to see if they were not bitten by Kabaneris, they are like zombies but much more resistant. The samurai suspect one of the members of the train and try to kill him, but Ikoma is sure that he is not a kabane and with this everyone begins to suspect him, which results in his arrest, meanwhile, Mumei escapes from the castle To see Ikoma and talk to him, at that time a train totally dominated by Kabanes breaks the bridge and invades the city, which causes a killing and Mumei realizes it tries to espace of the city, Ikoma took advantage of that moment and fled from the \"prison\", He decides to go back to his house and picks up his personalized pressure weapon, a Kabane invades the house and at that moment Ikoma uses his weapon and kills the Kabane, but is bitten, after that comes the most impossible way to try to heal a bite, He tries to hold his arm with metal to stop the blood from circulating that which is not right and then Ikoma hangs himself to hold the blood and succeeds, because for some reason Kabane's blood simply stopped mixing with him and ended up transforming Ikoma In a Kabaneri, Half-Human, Half-Kabane. This was the 1st episode of the anime, I will not prophesy so much the rest, just tell more impressions about what happened in each one, from here would have many spoilers, so I do not recommend that you continue reading this review unless you have finished The anime.\\n\\n\\n\r\nIkoma is \"killed\" by Kurusu because he suspects that Ikoma is a Kabane, but Mumei saves Ikoma and reveals that the Two are Kabaneris, after the two are locked in a room alone by the fear that the other refugees of the train feel for them, Ikoma tells his past that is very simple, sister bitten, he can not do anything, hatred for the Kabanes and promise that it never More will happen (Eren 2.0), the train refugees demand a funeral in respect to the dead and Ayame gives the permission, at that time Ikoma went mad and tries to bite Ayame to extract her blood, but is interrupted by Kurusu, he and Mumei are locked Again, soon after an invasion of Kabanes takes place and a different enemy appears called Wazatori, that Ikoma defeats with only half and a half of training with Mumei. The next episode Ikoma and the refugees aims to take out a surveillance tower that fell on the rails, making it impossible for the train to pass, they mount a plane and tries to execute it, but Mumei spoils everything because ... I do not know, she Changes personality in each episode, the writers did not know how to define her personality which caused a huge mess in the character, Mumei tries to solve everything alone that not very sure and she ends up falling into an abyss and Ikoma tries to rescue her, meanwhile Comes a new enemy, the black cloud that is nothing more, nothing less than a lot of Kabanes that formed a single being, how they did it I do not do the least idea, it's serious had to create something random to try to leave history interesting? Only made the plot more messy, more messy than it already was. They open the core of the monster for Mumei to destroy it, also shows a bit of Mumei's past, which is Mikasa 2.0, dead family, orfam adopted by another family. In Episode 07 there is nothing beyond the stupid promise and revelation of a new character: Biba. In the next episode also did not have much, it was only Ikoma trying to discover the real intentions of Biba, who proves to be Badass, cruel and how he influences Mumei, in addition to revealing that Mumei turned Kabaneri because of experiences, as she did not turn anyone Kabane You know, not even the screenwriter himself. In the following episode he shows the real intentions of Biba, to spread the Kabanes by the city where one of the subordinates of his father lived, besides him to inflict blood of Kabane in Horobi, \\n\r\nWho loses control and Biba kills her, In the 10th episode Ikoma and the others were made of refens and forced to give blood to be used in experiments, Ikoma plans a rebellion, steal the keys of the guard and go to Biba and his plan was A success, meanwhile, Biba tries to convince Mumei to kill Ikomi and her friends, but Mumei refuses, which Biba has already expected and forces Mumei using more blood Kabane on her, Ikoma is confused by his key not open the door, but Biba He thought of that as well and changed the key, Biba shoots Ikoma, but Takumi jumps ahead, takes the bullet and saves his seemingly immortal friend, GENIUS ... and then Mumei attacks Ikoma on Biba's orders, with that Ikoma loses his arm and \"die\".\\n\r\nIn the 11th episode nothing happens except Biba's coup d'etat that kills his father and successively took control of the family, his father even died with the virus of a dagger he gave his son as a gift, and also the \"Suicide\" of Ikoma who bets everything to save Mumei, including his humanity, having the possibility to become a Kabane. The last episode shows Ikoma exploding a train with the power of the king-gun, only pointed finger, and the epic final battle between Ikoma and Biba that ends quickly without climax or any of that, the Ikoma uses a dirty switch and ends, it saves I mumbled and fainted in the process, after that, Biba returns to die a second later and who killed him this time went to Mumei. Kurusu meets with the 2 and they leave the city and meet with the others to escape, after that Ikoma that should die, simply come back and who saved him was BIBA THE FACE WHO DID NOT HAVE HUMANITY IN THE LAST MINUTE CREATED BECAUSE THE WRITER DID NOT HAVE IDEA OF WHAT TO DO.\\n\\n\r\nArt 7/10: The animation is done by wit studio, so it's very beautiful and well made, fluid in both combat and in the simplest moments, always above average, the scenery is beautiful and very well done, the character design also lacks comments, but for me Is wit's weakest production, not that it has gone bad, but the wit studio made it better for sure.\\n\\n\r\nSoundtrack 8/10: And OP is cool, but ED is very good and beautiful, the songs that play in the anime too, the emotion, the problem that the sad songs will not bring good things since the characters are horrible.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters 3/10: Horrible ... No personalities, No charisma, No nothing to make you call what they are fighting or protecting, characters poorly written, no characters practically, because they all fit I said here.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 4/10: Is fucking bad, The only good things about Kabaneri are the Animation and the Soundtrack, the rest is horrible.\\n\\n\r\nPositive Points:\\n\\n\r\n-Great Soundtrack\\n\\n\r\n-Good Animation\\n\\n\r\nNegative Points:\\n\\n\r\n-Did not explain where the kabanes came from and did not try.\\n\\n\r\n-Weak and totally meaningless story, many plot holes.\\n\\n\r\n-Stupid characters who do not do anything in the whole anime besides depend on the main ones that are a shit too, lack of explanation of how Mumei managed to be Kabane, could at least try to show I know it ... HOW KABANE BLOOD STOPPED TO MIX WITH HUMAN BLOOD AND CREATE A MUTATION?\\n\\n\r\nKabaneri is horrible, simply that As I value more story and characters so the low note.",

            "content": "So kabaneri is one of those animus where you watch the first episode and think \"wow this is going to be a great anime\".\r\nThe first episode was well-done. Had elements of action, suspense and even a bit of comedy. And it introduced the characters as cool.\r\nUnfortunately... that did not stick. Now I did not watch the whole series but got at least halfway through trying to see if it would salvage itself and it did not for me.\r\nWarning some spoilers ish? below. Tried to keep to minimum.\r\nThe main girl in the first episode is shown to be a cool and collected character who is likelyOP and knows what she is doing. Unfortunately, she turns out to be a big whiner with a bro-complex. \\n\\n\r\nThe main guy is shown to be a hard working guy who is weak but was able to engineer this cool weapon to combat the kabane. Unfortunately, that weapon is still pretty flawed and requires a lot of up-close combat and they don't really build on his smarts too much more after that.\\n\\n\r\nThe story becomes pretty generic trying to save self from zombie like stuff.\\n\r\nArt and action scenes are not bad, fitting.\\n\r\nSound is okay. OP was pretty cool at first.\\n\r\nCharacters like I said earlier, kinda flop for me.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment... first episode. Pretty much that's where it was.\\n\\n\r\nOverall. Like I said, good first episode. Not really worth it afterwards. Disappointed.\\n",

            "content": "Where to start? \r\nLet's beginn with with the Art and Sound. If this anime has something to go for it are this two things. Sound is amazing. Maybe I am a bit biased because I just love those EGOIST songs. Anyway. I did enjoy it. \r\nArt as well. Lot of details and it fits the this steam punk style. What I don't like is the look of the characters. I don't know but they don't really seem to fit in. Don't get me wrong, they still look good but they don't go with the background. \r\nHow should I put it? Do you know this oldcartoons from the 80-90s? You could always tell which rock etc was the rock something is going to happen with in the next shot. It just stand out. Here I do have the same feeling. Maybe make them less shiny next time.  \\n\\n\r\nThen story. Well I do like the idea of it. I mean if you can go with the background story of Attack on Titans you can go with this. Instead of Titans you have some kind of Zombies and people are also living behind walls. So far so good. \\n\r\nNow some parts which could include some SPOILERS but I try to keep it spoiler free. \\n\r\nThe first episodes I did enjoy. Especially Miumei's first fight. It was indeed rly cool and reminded me to the 3D gear action of AoT. Also the actions the characters did, seemed reasonable. \\n\r\nBut with episode 5/6 this changed. Here the authors probably thought normal zombies are not enough, we need something bigger. And so the black smoke is introduced. \\n\r\nFrom this point on it gets stupid and made up. It just does not feel right. In episode 5 a short glimpse at something what could be a tank turret. But it doesn't get further attention. In e6 when the crew is rescuing Miumei and Ikoma. They found this turret and somehow put it on the train off screen. Hey the train has a gun now and it is useful to destroy the shadow. How could they just cruise around with the train and install the turret when before everything was filled with Zombies? Who cares!\\n\r\nAnd stuff like this keeps happening till the end. It just feels stupid. Miumies actions kill thousands in the last episodes. But noone really cares. Oh hi Miumie, glad you are back. Your actions killed thousands? Doesn't matter you are still the cute girl. \\n\r\nIt just feels mehhh.\\n\\n\r\nAnd so do the characters. I gave a damn about them and I did not like them. Ok, I did somehow liked one character, but he dies. But even here I didn't really felt sad. \\n\\n\r\nAll in all I am giving this a 6. If it would be possible I would giving it a 6,5 but it isn't. Therefore 6 it is. \\n\r\nIt is an OK anime to watch, but if you expect an Attack on Titan Killer like some did when this anime was introduced you will get disappointed.",

The character designs were great, every design was distinct from one another. the show had recurring background characters that you could recognise even if they weren't important, which i thought was a nice touch to the show. The story was very predictable, there was no twists or surprises, everything you thinkwill happen will probably happen. The character interactions for the earlier half of the show are enjoyable to watch. The only character that gets any sort of arc or development is the main character. The villain also got some backstory but it really did nothing to really explain or justify his actions, he was poorly written and obviously just there because the show needed a final villain for the end. The show is enjoyable but for the most part it's only because of the art/animation, and the action. I would give it a 6.5 overall, but since i can only give scores with round numbers i'll be generous and give it a 7 because I did enjoy the show when i watched it.",

            "content": "REVIEW WITH NO SPOILERS!!\r\nFirst of all, this was an anime I was not expecting much. Just watched it because, I hadn\u00b4t really anything more to watch :p\r\nBut It chocked me how awesome it can be. You will need to love Drama ( a lot), zombies (kabanes) and something more, which cannot be told because of spoilers! I can relate It with The Walking Dead, but with a little diference, zombies here are nuts!!! Obviously, it isnt as awesome as TWD, but It can really give you a good time.\r\n--STORY-- (9)\r\nStory is great! You are brought in the middle of the industrial revolution, Japan is filledwith kabanes (probably the whole world, but thats not told in the anime). The only way to kill this kabanes is by destroying their hard heart. But if you get bitten, you are basicaly gonna turn! The story is arround a crew compoused by some samurais, a women that commands the crew, our protagonist and a girl, who is basicaly the pair of our man!\\n\r\nOur protagonist is a blacksmith, and he as the ability to build weapons, that can destroy those kabane's hearts.\\n\r\nFinally, the ending is awesome, I can guarantee, a little bit cliche, but it gets what we want in the end!!\\n\\n\r\n--Art-- (8)\\n\\n\r\nWell, I know nothing about Art and Graphic Desing, really, but I enjoyed the Steam Theme where the anime is built on, because of the industrial revolution. Nothing that fascinate me, but oh well, it was Very Good.\\n\\n\r\n--Sound-- (7)\\n\\n\r\nSound is a taste thing. Either you love it, or you just hate it.\\n\\n\r\nThe oppening is acceptable, not the best thing of the world, but yeah, not bad.\\n\r\nThrough out the anime, it really blends in with the anime theme, the last scene really give the feelings!!!!\\n\\n\r\n--Character-- (9)\\n\\n\r\nThis is best of that anime. The characters. Oh man, I Love every single on of them, even the villains.\\n\\n\r\nOur protagonist is a very cliche one, but, he really grows through out the anime. We watch him being a coward in the beggining, really not messing with anyone. And then he starts to change, because of an event on his life (which I cannot tell, or it would be a spoiler :p). He ends up being a complete badass, and taking the \"prize\" home!!\\n\\n\r\nOur villain, oh man, our villain. His name is Biba, I can compare him with Negan from TWD. He loves hurting people, and has a statement in his life: Weak must die, the strong live on. I can't say it, but he impacts the last episodes as hell, he was really who made the story to me.\\n\\n\r\n--Overall-- (9)\\n\\n\r\nI give it a 9. Not perfect, it would be perfect if It had a awesome soundtrack, but apart from that, it really was a good anime.\\n\\n\r\nHope you enjoyed this fast review!\\n\\n\r\nFirst review by the way!!! :p\\n\\n",

To summer it up real quick: this anime is your everyday action with pretty lollies, baddas MC, great flashy fight scenes and overall a lot of prettiness. Story is accordingly simple and shaped way so it can show off the animation(it occasionally doesn't bother to make sense).\r\nYou simply watch this anime with eyes only. Brain is not really needed.\r\nStory:3\r\n-Special boy to be MC? check\r\n-Special pretty girl to be MC's waifu? check (got both lolly and normalgirl!!)\\n\r\n-Constant threat of danger from a special virus? check\\n\r\nRandom thought: This is where I began to think that I'm writing about Black Bullet.\\n\r\n-Vicious, vicious villain? -check and set we are!\\n\r\nArt:9\\n\r\nLike, it's like sooo pretttttyyyyy! Seriously though, the art is amazing. When shit goes down color tone gets darker, when everyone is happy the screen smiles at you. It simply tells the tale better than the tale does.\\n\r\nSound:5\\n\r\nI didn't really feel any thrill and I didn't ahte it neither.\\n\r\nCharacter:5\\n\r\nIt just sticks with those \"Yosh! Gambare!\" types of personalities. Just sticks with the ordinary everyday anime characters BUT it doesn't pretend not to(not like re:zero)! Which is huge, huge plus.\\n\r\nEnjoyment:5\\n\r\nSkip the talking parts and go straight for the flashy scenes. You prevent getting bored this way.\\n\r\nOverall:6\\n\r\nYep. Seen better, seen worse. It is straight mediocre anime, but gets one bonus point for not pretending not to be.\\n",

Mumei went from being a pretty awesome and mysterious character to the cause of almost literally every single problem in the entire series. To top it off, no one seems to even acknowledge that what they are going through is because of her consistently making stupid choices. The main character seems to always talk by yelling, and it is hard to find scenes were he isn't talking in a raised voice, it was just something that irritatedme personally. The one thing I did like about this show was how well animated it was, there's a lot to see in the character animations. It is not a terrible show and I did enjoy parts of it, most of my issues lie with the characters themselves, and if you don't mind shallow characters this show can be great.",

The music is, in my opinion, the best aspect of this show and it did wonders for setting the mood and building tension where appropriate. The story itself was fine, a bit reminiscent of other popular anime (Attack on Titan) but with enough of its own originality to hold my interest. It had a large cast of incredibly diverse characters with compelling relationships and interactions, all done in a unique art style. It was enjoyable, to say the least, although not mind-blowing. I wished some of the action scenes were a bit flashier. WhenMumei fought with her bladed sandals in the first episode I loved it, and I wished those unusual weapons were used in more episodes.",

            "content": "When you begin Kabaneri of the Iron Fortress it quickly becomes evident that a lot of ideas were borrowed from Attack of Titan. The best form of flattery is imitation, no? Look at how many series in the late 90s and early 2000s borrowed from Neon Genesis Evangelion (i.e. Rahxephon, Fafner, or Bokurano).\r\nThe above being said, Kabaneri of the Iron Fortress is a competent anime. I don't think the story is nearly as developed as say Attack on Titan, but remember Attack on Titan has a manga to pull source material from and Kabaneri is an original anime series. Also in the twelve episodes Kabaneriwas given there was only so much time to tell a full story. I do hope that the second season announced will do more to develop an intriguing plot.\\n\r\nAs for the show's design though, wow. The details in the scenery and backgrounds are way impressive, and as a personal preference I really dig the mashup of steampunk, post-apocalyptic, and traditional Japanese aesthetic. I just find it cool. The character design and animation by Wit Studio are very pleasing to the eye. The characters are just interesting enough to keep watching from episode to episode, but I'd really like to see more development of them in the future season. I love good character development and I don't think we were really able to see substantial growth and change in our characters.\\n\r\nAll my criticisms aside, I watched through the twelve episodes quickly because this show was very entertaining. Great animation, world design, and action kept me engaged. Personally I think a good analogy for this series is that it's like a popcorn action flick. It's just fun entertainment and nothing too serious. That being said, I think the premise that has been established has a lot of potential and I am excited to see what happens with the second season.",

The feudal Japan mixed in with the threat of the kabanes was very interesting. \r\n- The Animation. Very nice to watch and every frame had something going on in it: good on the eyes. \r\n- The story was good as well, with a mostly unexpected twist at the end.\r\n- The ending was satisfying although i do have my gripes with it. \r\n- I loved some of the less important characters. I really liked the relationship between kurusu and ayame asit ended up giving a comedic touch to the series. I wish they had given more development to the rest of the crew, especially the english-japanese speaking mechanic who i don't even remember the name of due to lack of character development. But whatever  I understand they only had 12 episodes.\\n\r\nHere is what i disliked:\\n\r\n- Ikoma's voice got on my nerves especially when he's screaming and it cracks up. I get that it is fitting but this being my review and all.... goddamn. \\n\r\n- I felt like the characters were cliche, mumei in particular. The relationship between mumei and ikoma and how it unfolded was quite predictable and nothing new which is a big no no from me considering it is a focal point in the whole series. \\n\r\n- SPOLIER ALERT\\n\r\nI know i said this was a spoiler-free review but I have to in order to get my point across here.\\n\r\nSo I KNEW Ikoma wasnt going to die the moment he was thrown off the train and I KNEW he wasnt going to die at the end the moment he went through his whole transformation thing. Therefore, the fact that, despite what he was sure of, Ikoma survived after all was not surprising to me. However, the fact that Biba saved him was an interesting and unexpected twist so I'll give them that.\\n",

            "content": "Given the plethora of negative reviews, it's fairly easy to dismiss this anime as one of the worst animes of all time. Scroll after scroll, I see countless reviews giving 2s and 3s, ripping the show into pieces. What many of the other reviews do a fantastic job is diving deep into the root of the problems of this show and most of their complaints and concerns are justified. The characters are quite undeveloped and their actions seem unexplainable. The plot turned into quite the shitshow by the end and the amount of random asspulls started looking like naruto for a moment. But looking beyondthose negatives, I still feel like the show does a couple things well that warrant at least the 3 episode rule. \\n\\n\r\nInstead of typing deep analysis on why this show fails (you can just read the other reviews), I want to first explain why this show is getting such unwarranted negative press and then hopefully convince you that this show is still worth watching.\\n\\n\r\n------ ------------------------Why the negative press -----------------------------\\n\\n\r\n1. Overhype: Koutetsujou no Kabaneri was probably one of the most hyped up animes of all time. The directors and creators of both Attack on Titan and Code Geass teamed up to make a an anime original. With such a large cast and multiple infamous studios behind the show, it seemed like a recipe for success. Once the show aired the first episode, the hype only continued. The golden 4 episodes (something I will touch upon later) aka the first 4 episodes established a story and cast of characters that were unique. People had expectations of a Attack on Titan remix but were quickly dispelled as the story had enough nuances to establish a ground for itself. Once the plot started to deteriorate so did the hype. By not living up to the viewers' expectations of what could have been the next biggest anime of all time, people began trashing it and dismissing it. Everything that wasn't perfect was picked on and simply hung out to dry. The disappointment of having so much potential and throwing it away, angered many viewers which prompted them to tarnish the show's whole reputation. Had the anime not gotten as much hype as it did, I believe that most people would have simply given it quite an average or good rating and not such a low one. \\n\\n\r\n2. Band Wagoning: As more and more people began disliking it and expressing those sentiments, more people followed. Koutetsujou no Kabaneri became the laughing stock of the anime community. In fact, if you continued to openly like it, other users would eagerly jump at the chance to attack your opinions. Granted, the anime did deteriorate in pretty much all of the literary elements that create a cohesive story. However, many people failed in making an unbiased review. Furthermore, the band wagoning effect straight up hyperboled many of the flaws. Every show has its flaws and there are plenty, and I mean PLENTY of worse shows than Koutetsujou. If we were to simply compare this show to another show on an equal myanimelist level and rating, this show would be disproportionately more hated. \\n\\n\r\n------ -------------------------Why watch this show -------------------------------\\n\\n\r\n1. The music: Sawano is a god. I'm not sure what else there is to say. Created by the same composer as Attack on Titan, Nanatsu no Taizai, Owari no Seraph, the music is quite simply amazing. I've listened to the main theme countless of times and of course it has the Sawano drop. Probably one of the few aspects this anime truly excels at, the music is definitely worth exploring even if you dislike the anime\\n\\n\r\n2. The golden 4 episodes: As I said earlier, the golden 4 episodes or the first 4 episodes are probably one of the strongest starts in a show I've seen to this day. In fact, I think if you really wanted to leave on a good note, I would just watch to episode 4 and stop there (the end of episode 4 is actually somewhat conclusive). Why is this the case? Given the concerns about a copycat of Attack on Titan, Koutetsujou needed to establish its uniqueness and what it had to offer. It did a fantastic job creating a plot and world different from AoT despite having a very similar premise (humans going extinct from unknown species). Although there were clearly some homages to Attack on Titan especially in the directing and scenes, each episode delivered something new which furthered the hype and intensity. The quick pace and tone the anime immediately captured the viewer's attention. In fact, I would go so far as to argue that the first episode of Koutetsujou no Kabaneri is one of the best pilot episodes of all time. Not only did it hook me with the premise and intriguing characters, the directing, art/animation and sound were absolutely spot on. Just watch it and see if you like it. I can guarantee you will. \\n\\n\r\n3. Enjoyment: I think one of the biggest thing the anime community fails occasionally and especially in this case is looking at  anime too critically. For me, one of the ways I can enjoy various animes is simply by turning off my brain and taking it at face value. I know there are huge gaping flaws but I can still dismiss them and enjoy the show for what it is. And that's not to say that looking at it critically is wrong at all. In fact, it is vital for a successful show to have good plot and character development as well as the sheer enjoyment factor. However, when you look at the show in only that analytical lense, you fall into the trap of thinking that everything it does is horrible. If you can kick back and watch the show without thinking too much about it, I think you can find some sort of enjoyment.\\n\\n\r\nOverall I think this show has something unique to offer enough to warrant a watch. The superb soundtrack coupled with the extremely strong first 4 episodes and interesting premise was enough to keep me hooked. Yes there are flaws and yes they are noticeable. But, if you can look past it and simply enjoy it for what it is, I think the 7.5 user base rating is pretty accurate despite the plentiful 2s and 3s.",

And I don't blame the viewers,because I thought the same too.And it was my motivation to continue to watch it in the first place. But...\r\nStory:\r\nThe was decent.And I mean flat-out decent.It's a overly \"simple\" straight linear progression.It introduced to the problem,gave a gradual slope rise,introduced the villain,jumps to the climax where the entire beginner plot turned upside down(maybe tried to create a \"holy shit!\" type of failed excitement),then it progresses down the slope very fast and ends up with the villain dead and everyone lives \"happily ever after.\"Hey don't get me wrong,I have no problem with positive endings.But...you know...this is too common,lol. And it is nowhere close to the twist and turns and mystery of Shingeki no Kyoujin.Please don't compare them anymore.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nThe art style was pretty unique.It was not anywhere close to Shingeki no Kyoujin.It was not overly detailed.But the scenes are fluent the visual effects are exciting to look at.It did give off a apocalyptic theme with dark colors.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nThe music and soundtrack were fair and it blended in with the scenes.They were quite noticeable.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nThe character info and development was a disappointment to me.They overly summarized the character's personality,mentality and history.There were many characters who are left unknown even though they were connected to the main characters. They just picked out the most notable characteristics of the characters and only spent time on that,which made the story too simple to watch and confusing regarding how or why the characters got involved with the main  story.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment and overall:\\n\r\nI tried to keep the review short,but I know it's still a bit long.But I had a lot to say about this series.Honestly,when Biba was introduced and the entire story turned to \"I want to kill my father because REVENGE!\" plot,I totally started to hate it.I even wanted to quit it if it wasn't for only 12 episodes.I enjoyed the story in the beginning and had high hopes for it.But toward the end,I didn't like it as much.It was too common,too simple,too strightforward and not at all like Shingeki no Kyoujin.I wish they made the story more like that.But this anime is just like that - really pretty outer look, but dumb inside.",

You might not be wrong in thinking that but Koutetsujou no Kanbaneri is a very tasty sandwich.\r\nThe visuals and soundtrack are excellent. They hype you up for the key moments and scenes. They make you feel downward spiral when the characters are suffering. The characters are well projected with good writing with distinct personalities although lacking sophistication. \r\nThe main characters of the show are Ikoma and Mumei. Both characters are interesting in their own rights and satisfying to watch as you follow through their own story-lines. The story progression isnatural as they blend the overarching plot with character development almost seamlessly. \\n\\n\r\nThe story follows a group of refugees that lost their home to the Kabane, As the plot develops, the story shows the conflicts and struggles that one might face when a community is evicted from their land. Both leadership and conflict inciters appears while Ikoma and Mumei tries to find their roles in the group as outsiders (and Kabaneri). \\n\\n\r\nBut don\u2019t expect deep conversations or revelations from the show, like you might expect from a complex seinen anime. Because at it\u2019s core, this is an action eye feast for those who enjoy good combat animation and sequences. \\n\\n\r\nBut lacking depth does not mean it lacks elegance. The show often takes a moment to show you the land/cityscapes,  Showcasing the scale of the enormous beautiful world that they have build for these characters.  \\n\\n\r\nAnd beneath all the limbs and guts flying,the show tackles many uncomfortable questions we do not face commonly as a society. Like one of which is, when face with a threat that might come from within, do we let fear us break apart or do we fight together in unity?\\n\\n\r\nOverall, despite it\u2019s overly used theme, the show is most definitely worth the watch for all it\u2019s beautiful aesthetics and decapitating zombie glory.",

            "content": "READ FIRST: This anime is by the same director and studio that made Attack on Titan. If you loved AOT, and HAVE NOT seen much anime besides this, you will likely really enjoy Kabaneri of the Iron Fortress. \r\nIf, like me, Attack on Titan was the crossover you needed to branch East to West and you have since seen piles of anime with each subsequent show raising the bar of what you thought was \"good\", then read on.  \r\nKabaneri of the Iron Fortress is a very particular kind of bad. Its not unlike what happens in the U.S. whenever Michael Bay touches something: astory that almost forces its audience into stupidity in order to accept it. Interestingly, the anime history of director Tetsur\u014d Araki features some of my most disliked and heavily criticized pieces. An astounding amount of anime I personally dislike for being \"too Western\" in its writing and directing fall under this directors scope. \\n\\n\r\nAttack on Titan, as mentioned, was one of the first anime that really sucked me in, particularly because it was so unlike most other anime. I have now come to see this as a mostly bad and aggravating thing, something of a Western/Shakespearean tinge on writing that I wish to escape. This kind of writing has four essential elements: 1. unnatural or forced tragedy for tragedy's sake 2. plots that advance strictly due to a lack of communication or \"if only he/she would listen\" cliche's and 3. stories written around scenes/images/characters. 4. A belief that media should portray \"reality\" (i.e. directors idea of reality) which is usually gritty, gut-wrenching, and \"realistic\" (versus noble, virtuous, or portraying characters and the world in an idealistic way = almost all other anime) \\n\\n\r\nSpoilers ahead (tried to keep them minima/vague):\\n\\n\r\nKabaneri is rife with all of these Western downfalls. I thought, at one point, that if the author had been 14 and American this show would have been much more acceptable; but no, not the case. The amount of forced, ex machina tragedy is offensive to the viewer because it demands them to be stupid; it is utterly unbelievable and ham-fisted. Next, a significant amount of the plot happens because of miscommunication and people not believing or listening to obviously critical information. Third, after finishing this show, its hard not to think that the author simply had a drawing of Ikoma and decided to build an lazy story for the character that would let the author gush all his chunibyo out; cool but completely ambiguous fight scenes, an mc transformation, superpower and bandages, steam-punk crap, a cape for some reason, hair changing color to represent upgrade, a power that threatens to overcome the character/must be unleashed, etc. etc. etc. Its all here. Lastly, the unnecessarily gut-wrenching awfulness of the villain where terrible things happen just so that the author, somewhere, can look an go \"haha, see how horrified they are!? Yeah, nice!!\". \\n\\n\r\nLets not discard the technical squabbles either (it should be noted, I think this show would have benefitted greatly from 24 episodes). Right off the bat, Ikoma becomes the cliche-est of cliche main characters in a sequence so non-sensical and laughable that I could hardly understand it. Nothing about what he does in the first episode makes any sense, and when he starts stapling steam-punk crap to himself for no reason, its pretty hard to take seriously. Almost no backstory is given at all for the Kabane or why anything is the way it is. Lets look at some questions right off the top:\\n\\n\r\n1. What are the Kabane's actual abilities? Are they slow or fast? In one scene they are your classic zombie and can be easily slowed down with limb or head damage. In the next scene they are all but invincible, can run at superhuman speed, and can throw themselves so hard they can break through steel armor plating. Are they intelligent? Why can some fight and others cant? Why is it that any time a horde of them appears in the tens of thousands, the mc's only have to kill about 20 for everyone to be fine? What is the virus? Are the humans trapped inside still alive somehow? The existence of the Kabaneri would lead one to believe so, in which case they really are killing people still (not to mention what is learned at the end about the different \"serums\"). \\n\\n\r\n2. What are the Kabane? Where did they come from? Is it some dumb T-Virus kind of thing? Why do they attack humans? How, on earth, do their hearts become like steel or coated with steel or whatever? Why does this happen? I'm pretty sure it takes highly advanced steel to stop a bullet, the body has a minimal amount of iron in it, but even if all the body's metals were concentrated, I have a hard time believing it would form anything close to a bullet proof barrier around the heart. \\n\\n\r\n3. What are the Kabaneri's actual abilities? In one scene Ikoma can destroy everything and everyone and take almost unlimited damage, much more-so with Mumei. In the next scene a few punches from some guy (along with Mr. Plot ex Machina) renders him completely useless. Is he strong or not? Is he fast or not? Mumei seems to be able to jump hundreds of feet and land from any height without damage - how does physical contact or impact from a person hurt them at all? Additionally, does Ikoma's gun only work up close? It seems like it can also work from a distance, so why does he never use it at a distance when it would literally solve everything? Why does he only become weak when having literally any of his previously seen abilities would change everything? (Bad writing being the elephant in the room here) \\n\\n\r\n3. What on earth is Biba's plan? Get revenge by killing everyone? Where is he going to go afterward? What people does he intend to live with? Did he really not have the firepower to get revenge without 'scorching the earth'? His plan makes no sense. \\n\\n\r\n4. By the end I was wishing Kaneki from Tokyou Ghoul would just show up and kill everyone. Given the amount of 'sharing' happening regarding the Kabaneri and ghouls, it would be more believable that Kaneki existed in this world than the story we are left with. \\n\\n\r\n5. Where is anyone getting any of their resources for everything??? And how do any of their weapons work? Why is the steel of the Kabane's heart stronger than other steel? How on earth can it be forged into the human's weapons. That would require removing its strength, using tools strong enough to shape the still strong (but weakened/annealed) steel, then the knowledge and skill to re-forge it!!!!!!!!!! If Ikoma could do all of that in an instant, then he could have also determined what the composition of the steel was and how to make it. Of course, its probably made from some kind of magical-asteroid steel - which, again, somehow is special but also found in the body. You can see how quickly it all becomes ridiculous, and not in the fun, over-the-top way. There was an idea here, and the laziest possible story was created to meet all the requirements of the idea so it could happen. \\n\\n\r\nI'll stop here for now, there is so, so much left that could be ripped up (hardly touched on the characters). A main point is this, AoT had a certain charm because the author worked with an friend in engineering to make his mechanisms as believable as possible; It's very clear this author didn't, and it really, really shows. In fact, one of the few reasons I found AoT's tragedy and drama acceptable at all was because of the attention to detail and believability of it; despite its Western tendencies for annoying writing, it pulled something interesting off. This show is a classic example of \"less than the sum of its parts\", a sort of anti-gestalt. It needs to be picked apart, it needs to be chided, and it needs a lot of it; directors and authors like this need to know when their work is lazy and dumb. Otherwise, it becomes popular and sells well because its pretty or has tons of hype and the directors & authors think people want more. Otherwise, we get Michael Bay's all over the place and the director/writer-kabane start to swarm, seeking to feed of the wallets of consumers drawn in by hype and shiny things.\\n\\n",

            "content": "Are you familiar with something related to human eater? I bet you are. As anime lovers, people will not be surprised to hear something like that. Tokyo Ghoul and Attack on Titan as the examples of man eater. So does the Kabaneri. The differences are, Kabaneri\u2019s series man eater is not humanoid species, Kabane is another species. Those humans who got infected mysterious virus become Kabane. And also, Kabaneri\u2019s series is about survival. Survival of mankind who left in the world from Kabane\u2019s attacks (quite different from Tokyo Ghoul). To this state of storyline, I declare, from my opinion, it\u2019s not something new even ifthe source of story is stated original. It\u2019s post-apocalypse anime caused by Kabane\u2019s  attacks.\\n\\n\r\nIkoma, is a normal human before he is bitten by Kabane. He successfully stops the spread of the virus from his infected arm on himself. Later on he finds out that the success to stop the virus in his body doesn't mean he is negative (from being a Kabane). Yeah, this is where our hero begins his story, he is a half-human and half-Kabane, a Kabaneri. His first obstacle is to make others believe that he won't going insane like Kabanes. But, a hybrid still a hybrid, he has genes of a Kabane, makes him half of it. His journey starts off. He and the people in his area, is on survival train to reach a safe shelter far away. Along the way, they will find many Kabanes head off.\\n\\n\r\n\u200b\\n\r\nI mentioned above, this series was reassuring for me, and even made me curious which is not often for me to get attached to something-like Kabaneri\u2019s series (because the CGI animation). Yep! The graphics there mostly 2D, but got CGI animation in it. Not too much, sadly, not appealing either. Nicely, they can bring the terrible fact of countless deaths and horror vibes with the visualization aside from CGI animation. I don\u2019t know whether the animation being lack of colours intensity or lack of sharpness that made the characters somehow look ungraceful. Back to the \u2018reassuring issue\u2019, indeed it was convincing \u201cat first.\u201d The story progress for the halfway of whole show was exciting, far from dull improvement. After few episodes in which the Kabane apocalypse isn\u2019t the real threat, that was when I wanted to drop this series for sure. The political spice stirs the whole purpose of me watching the show, of being so engaging by its survival and journey to get to safe place, into a show of a noble madman makes use of Kabane into political/personal grudge thingy. This turn-over can\u2019t be worse.\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe characters development had slow improvement, feels like nothing at all even if so many occurrences and feelings there; the frightfulness, will to survive, optimism, friendship, desire to help, guide the main characters to be more adaptable and dependable to fight the Kabane. Not only their strength, but also kindness in their hearts. The relaxing moments tuck as the characters take their rest for fighting Kabane. I think its purpose to show that even in hard time there must be time to relax awhile, and to deepen their relationship which is not interfered by Kabanes. Unfortunately, I think it didn\u2019t fit well. Maybe if they put it into different way, it will work better.\\n\\n\r\nThe OP and ED have done by EGOIST and Aimer with chelly (EGOIST), these names aren't new to you.  \"KABANERI OF THE IRON FORTRESS\" by EGOIST is the OP theme for Kabaneri series. Personally, EGOIST's works do not fit my taste but I do have several works from them that I keep on my playlist. But this one, absolutely no for me. The OP sounds like it tries to give you something dreadful about the show, about how frustrating fighting never-ending Kabanes and survive in a shelter. So dark and full of sadness. Not because of its terror vibe, but the music itself I can't barely enjoy. Aimer with chelly (EGOIST) \"ninelie\" is the ED theme. Better than OP a bit. The insert songs are quite good along the show.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSuch a turn-over brought down my excitement to watch this. Well, 6.5 for its anti-climax ending.\\n\r\nPros: Entertaining anime (at first), it successfuly got the tension and horror.\\n\r\nCons: It's unlikely to be original because I can feel it is so similar with some other series, and damn minus for its turn-over. So bye.",

No, it's about steampunk zombies. Does it have some really cool action scenes? Yes. If you're looking for a mindless action show, something like Attack on Titan (because the two shows have only been compared like, a million times), you might want to give Kabaneri a try.\r\nThe characters aren't even remotely interesting, and neither is the story. I did like that it had a happy ending, though. To me, there wasn't too much missing from the finale,and I wouldn't mind if it never got a second season. \\n\r\nThe art is fantastic, I expect no less from 2016 yet I was pretty impressed. The voice acting, for the most part, isn't really worth mentioning but I think Hatanaka Tasuku did a pretty good job as Ikoma. He has an interesting voice, it's slightly different from the typical shounen hero so it caught my attention.\\n\r\nOverall, KnK isn't entirely terrible, but it's definitely not worth any more than the few hours it takes to watch 12 episodes.",

Outside the walls are monsters called Kabane, former humans who were infected with a virus that turns them into man/eating zombies with a stee-like mutation that guard their hearts. Amongst the people in his settlement, Ikoma is the only one who seems to realize that the Kabane are infectees, while the rest of the people believe it to be a curse of some sort. When the kabane attack and Ikoma is bitten, he managesto halt his change into a Kabane, turning into a Kabaneri: Abeing inbetween huan and Kabane. Along with another Kabaneri, Mumei, he guards the koutetsujou ( a train ) on it's way to the capital where the people of his hometown look for shelter.     \\n\r\nSo far the synopsis\\n\\n\r\nSTORY 4\\n\r\nAs far as the story goes, Koutetsujou disappoints heavily. The zombie-theme is not especially new to begin with ( albeit anime has not yet sen much zombie-oriented series ), and Attack on Titan explored it in a new light, so studio Wit must have felt like they needed to exceed themselves and fail in the process.      \\n\r\nThe world-building in this show hardly makes sense: We are in middle-ages Japan, where people live behind big walls to guard themselves against humanoid monsters. Of course, the threat of the kabane would lead humans to develop techniques and technology that works against that threat, but please explain how being attacked by the kabane leads to  building railways all across Japan.  To begin with, Japan is not known for having a lot of easily accessible ore, so how did the people gather it and forg the metal for the walls, railways and trains?   It seems that the storywriters just tossed in whatever would be convenient for them so they could get the \"from a to b plot\" that is so typical for zombie-movies/series, totally ignoring the fact that the threat by the kabane would have had different effects than what is portrayed in the anime.\\n\r\nA lot of melodramatic flash-backs are inserted to make the viewers care about what is happening to the characters, but in all honesty, that is a cheap trick, much like killing off side-characters with little to no personality and screen-time just for shock-value. \\n\r\nAnother problem with this show is that the main antagonis is introduced way past the halfway point. This gives little chance for proper character-development of all the antagonizing characters\\n\\n\r\nART 8\\n\r\nThe art of Koutetsujou no Kabaneri was nice to look at. Steampunk is almost always nice to look at, after all. The character designs have a vibe that is similar to mature anime from the early 2000's which is a nice change of pace since the VN style has taken the lead in modern anime The colors are vibrant most of the time and the surfaces often have a paint-ish look, much like in Seraph of the End, which was also produced by Studio Wit.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND 5\\n\r\nThere were a few instrumental versions and reinterpretations of the ending-song, but other than those, no particular OST stood out amongst them. Again, this remixing of Soundtracks in order to create a wider array of OST's is something that also happened with AoT, but at least that show had epic soundtracks, such as E.M.A and The Reluctant Heroes, that are immediately recognisable from the first beat onwards.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER 3\\n\r\nOther than Ikoma and Mumei, the only character whose Personality is fleshed out to some extent is the main-antagonist, whom I shall not mention anymore to avoid major spoilers.\\n\r\nBoth maincharacters have similar circumsrtances: They lost their family to the kabane when they were kids, and had to kill them to prevent their transformation into monsters. So, rather than coming to identify themselves with the human qualities of the characters, viewers were supposed to care about the characters becaus of shock-value. A lazy way out for the creators\\n\\n\r\nIkoma is the I-want-to-protect-everyone kind of MC who does not have any other significant features other than his motivation and his tragic past\\n\r\nMumei is the same as Ikoma, but with an extra dish of snobby attitude and spreading her legs for onii-sama ( in a figurative sense )\\n\\n\r\nThe othr companions are hardly fleshed out, personality-wise. Takumi can simply be described as the useless best friend of the MC. There's nothing more to him than that.\\n\r\nThe same thing goes for the female side-characters: Ayame acts like a typical well-raised Japanese Ojou-sama, the red-head is the standard stilent type, and the other girl is the caretaker character. Kind of like an onee-sama.\\n\\n\r\nThe antagonsists are equally on-dimensional. All of the less important antagonists follow the Main Antagonist for unclear reaons, much like in Guilty Crown, while the MA does have reasons for his what he does, even though the actions he takes are way too crass, considering his motives. \\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT 5 \\n\r\nAs it is a typical zombie-flick, the show has a certain amount of tension and nice action scenes. No doubt, but for me, the incoherent developments throughout the story and the bland characters killed most the show fpr me. I'm just glad I don't get myself all too hyped up for shows without having seen source material, otherwise this show might have made me hate anime, considering the hype this show got from some parts of the community.\\n\\n\r\nOverall a 5/10",

            "content": "Kabaneri of the Iron Fortress is an amazing anime to watch. Yes it doesn't have a lot of originality to it, but who cares as long as it's awesome. This anime, unlike a few other anime originals, knows not to tell a complicated plot. It keeps things relatively simple so people can be more easily invested. The Kabane are actually somewhat interesting, as it shows throughout the series that experienced Kabane can actually learn to a point.\r\nI extremely enjoyed the cast, as likable characters. True some don't start out that great, but get better as the series progresses. The story can seem like it's tryingtoo hard to be dark sometimes though. The show was tense and kept me at the edge of my seat for a good part of the time.\\n\\n\r\nThere is also a realistic paranoia to the citizens. As people would be a bit paranoid in cases like these. I honestly don't understand the hate, yeah it has a lot of comparisons to attack on Titan, but in this day and Age originality is extremely difficult to find. So I prefer not to think about it. Also the soundtrack is amazing, and though the last episode didn't quite live up to expectations. I fully enjoyed and recommend this anime to any everywhere, though it's not for the faint of heart let me tell you",

            "content": "This anime gave me high hopes and then butchered those hopes while laughing maniacally. Many people complain that this is a Shingeki no Kyojin clone. I do not dispute that. However, in my view, this factor is not necessarily negative. When I entered this anime, I hoped for great art, and even greater action. At first, there was promise. But as I watched more and more, their initial potential disappeared faster than France during World War II. \r\nKoutetsujou no Kabaneri decided that within 12 episodes, they will be able to fully develop characters, and plot at the same time. The result is a steaming dumpof utter garbage on both ends. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters are barely given any reasoning for their motive. For those that are given reasoning for their actions, the backstory is flimsy at best, and completely stupid at worst. Not only do the backstories not generate sympathy, they somehow managed to make me despise all of the characters. Somehow, they also managed to screw up unimportant characters. Characters with no backstories, ones who don't even matter, ones who we shouldn't even necessarily care too much about. This anime managed to make these characters act so irrationally, Scientologists would be shocked. As a result, my disgust is equally distributed among both the main characters and the filler characters.\\n\\n\r\n On the other hand, Koutetsujou no Kabaneri also managed to make their plot an utter clusterfuck. Not only does the plot move forward due to some of the crappiest motives possible, the plot itself is fraught with plot holes. Kabaneri manages to ignore its very rules, and discard their previous statements in order to continue their story. Not much can be said about the plot, but just understand that an eight year old can probably come up with a more elaborate, or exciting plot than the one which was written. \\n\\n\r\nArt and music are probably the only saving graces of the anime. However, it should be noted that the anime has a habit of taking still frames and shaking it in order to imply excitement or something. I don't know. \\n\\n\r\nOk, now there will be spoilers ahead. Its kind of a personal rant, but also a review on why everything is as stupid as it is, with specific examples. \\n\\n\r\nLets begin with episode one. In episode one we are introduced to Ikoma, the MC. He also happens to have a permanent scowl, be angry at everyone and everything, and also seems to believe that other people are assholes. He is not wrong on that at least. The people in this world are assholes, but more on that later. So Ikoma is hell bent on creating this badass new weapon which will allow him to destroy these uber zombies, that have super strong heart cages. These cages, it seems, can not be destroyed with normal means, which is why he needs extremely high penetration power. Remember this statement, its important later. Anyhow, his good friend, Takumi gives him an idea on fixing up his gun by adding more gunpowder. More gunpowder=bigger explosion. Who could have fucking guessed. So on this day, a train suddenly appears, after some delay. People are concerned, but for some reason, decide to open the gates. Ok. Lets talk about this. They are in a post apocalyptic world. Super zombies roam everywhere. Does it not occur to them to confirm the train is working and not zombie filled before letting it in? How were the train tracks built anyway? But lets just say they were hungover or something, and just opened the gates. The zombies come in, fuck things up. Ikoma remembers he has his super gun, and goes to get it. He shoots a zombie and it works. Yay. But he's bitten. Oh no. But then he remembers its a fucking virus which infects him, and he decides that he needs to prevent it from reaching his brain, so he starts choking himself. He does not realize that choking himself slows down the blood but does not stop it, but because of plot armor, the virus realizes its dealing with a badass, and shouldn't touch this dude, so it stops, turning him into a fake zombie. Once again. This dude just figured out how to stop the virus. It might be vital information and all, but maybe it just slipped from his mind during the attack. Ya know. One of the ways to save humanity. Moving on. We are also introduced to Mumei, a badass fighting half-loli. Kabane are meant to be scary ass motherfuckers that humanity doesnt know how to deal with, which is why they are stuck behind walls. Yet Mumei manages to mow down a ton using bladed shoes(apparently cutting off their head works now, whereas we were told that it needed to be heart cage), and shooting their heart cages with regular pistols. Seriously, what the fuck. Remember being told that regular guns don't work? Lol they work now, jk about that. Ikoma is a loser after all. She also manages to shove sharp stuff into their heart cages. To do so should be near impossible if most guns require multiple shots, but hey, plot armor amiright? I do have to say, Mumei remurdering zombies was interesting. If they just had her do that all anime, it would have been watchable without extreme pain coursing through me. Anyway, they get on a train to run away, but people become scared of Ikoma and Mumei, because they are kabaneri. They decide to go full retard, because having effective zombie killing machines as body guards isnt nice, and its better to just kill them off. Confining them makes sense perhaps, to ensure they're not bloodthirsty(which they are, but in a literal sense), but straight out getting rid of your only weapons? A pretty bad idea. Within the next few episodes, they decide to expand upon character. Mumei it turns out, had her parents killed when she was young, and then got turned into a person who believes the strong survive and the weak should die. She then goes through a mental breakdown, which nobody cares about, because all it does is take away from the action. Moreso, the flashback is so dry, and shown in such a disjointed way, that really, nobody cares by the time its finished. So soon, we meet our main antagonist, a dude named Justin Biba. He has pink hair, and he seems nice. However, he actually has a nefarious plan. His dad at one point left him to die after sending him to attack the kabane. Because of this one incident, Justin decides that he needs to destroy all of humanity, and all the innocent. His logic is so coherent he is able to convince creationists that evolution is true. So using this super logic. he manages to get a bunch of followers. His followers literally have no motive. Nothing went wrong to them(Biba's original band of men were all annihilated), they just decided that Justin Biba's pink hairstyle is too kool to not follow. So it should also be noted that kabane are able to become big black monsters. No specific explanation, we're just told that if you inject them with magic water, they somehow deny physics, and suck other kabane towards them. On the other hand, kabaneri are also able to use kamehamehas and emit energy from their body. No explanation here either, except plot told you so. If the anime bothered to allocate a tiny bit of their resources to explaining the abilities, perhaps it would not be an utter failure. We also find out that Justin Biba had the cure to being kabane. Just let it be ya know, the cure and nobody but Biba's people are able to find it. Oh. And Justin, after trying to kill Ikoma, decides that it is in his best interest to cure him. Lol no reason why. Jesus. \\n\\n\r\nYea, I am so done with this anime. Many might ask why I watched all 12 episodes. It was out of morbid curiosity. I regret every single second now. I had more fun writing this review than watching the anime. And this review is damn boring. So cheers.",

The only difference here is the creatures are called kabane and if they bite you. You turn into one too. \r\nArt and Animation 10/10\r\nThe art and the animation is just beautiful. its a visual treat. The fight scenes look amazing. You can expect Attack on titan season 2 to have the same quality.\r\nMusic 8/10\r\nThis first thingi did when i found out about this series was check who the music composer was, it is none other than Hiroyuki Sawano of whom i am a big fan of. The man behind the OST of AOT,Guilty Crown, Mobile suit gundam Unicorn.\\n\\n\r\nThe music is damn amazing. Mixing orchestral elements with rock and electronic elements. Typical sawano style. Some of my favourite tracks are \"Through My Blood\" , \"88\u57ce\" , \"\u514bJOU\u6c17MACHINE\u7532\" ,\"Vivalabiba\". \"KGK\" reminds me of XL-TT from AOT.\\n\\n\r\nSound 10/10\\n\r\nVoice acting is perfect. No complains.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 7/10 \\n\r\nonce again a lot of similarities to AOT. Ikoma Is similar to Eren but more than killing all of the kabane his aim is to save everyone. \\n\r\nMumei, being the female lead is one of my favourite characters of the show. she cool, badass. Her backstory is also quite similar to that of Mikasa's.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 7/10\\n\r\npersonally It isn't as good as AOT but there are some epic moments which are awesome. It serves as a good supplement for AOT fans.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 6/10\\n\r\n after you finish watching the series your left with mixed feelings like something was missing. It had great potential to become one of best anime this season but i feel that 12 episodes just wasn't enough to tell the entire story. either it should have been 24 episodes or they should make a second season because there are a lot of unanswered questions. Anyhow it's an ok series, If you enjoyed AOT , you'll enjoy this. But watch it without any expectations, because if you do. You'll be disappointed.     \\n\\n",

Kabaneri is the same as that stupid Lexus - it gave us so many high hopes - the setting, the art style and animation quality, all the potential for an interesting world, characters and development. But instead of telling us anything about the world, giving us some kind of solid story or likeable characters, we were presented with no real content. They didn't even need to build a strong history, Attack on Titan is prettymuch \"100 years ago, things went bad and we built walls, nobody knows what exactly happened\". But they didn't bother doing even this much. No info, how, when or why the kabane appeared, how the people are actually living in the world, if this is a national plague or has the whole world gone to hell?\\n\\n\r\nThe characters were written by a 14-year old. They are paper cut-outs of archetypal cliches. It's just teenage angst piled on more teenage angst.\\n\\n\r\nIf this had been produced on a limited animation budget and couldn't ride the Attack on Titan hype train, it would have been instantly regarded as a generic 5/10 zombie flick with angsty teenagers.

            "content": "*Spoilers below, though I have not given away the villain's identity or the ending*\r\nThe supernatural has captivated our imagination for generations. For all the horror that usually abounds these tropes, many storytellers use supernatural elements to comment on human nature. In the many titles focusing on zombie apocalypses, this is especially true. Rick and his merry band fight humanity at its worst throughout much of The Walking Dead. Joel and Ellie battle hunters and cannibals as they try to find the cure for the fungal zombie virus in The Last of Us. It fascinates us and horrifies us when we see what humanity is capableof to survive in a world that turns against them. Kabaneri tries to comment on the human condition, it really really tries. It\u2019s too bad that it doesn\u2019t get to that point until halfway through the season. \\n\\n\r\nStory: For at least ten years, humanity has been plagued by the unrelenting appetite of the Kabane, Kabaneri\u2019s version of zombies. Kabane are portrayed as strong, mindless undead humans who can only be killed by piercing their glowing heart, a feat near impossible by normal methods. Most humans have found shelter in walled cities connected by railroads, though many of these \u201cstations\u201d have fallen to the Kabane over the years. The mysterious Prince Biba roams the countryside in his armed train killing many Kabane and the country\u2019s elite find protection in the capital. Kabaneri begins at a peaceful station that is quickly overrun when a train carrying a hoard of Kabane breaches the gates. Ikoma, our green haired protagonist, is bitten in the ensuing chaos, but is able to stave off the infection by choking himself. The survivors flee in a train named the Koutetsujou, with Ikoma and Mumei allowed on with huge trepidation.  \\n\\n\r\nAnd thus the title of the show is explained. Ikoma and Mumei are both Kabaneri, or people who have been bitten by Kabane but whose brains are still human. Kabaneri are inhumanly strong, but with that strength comes a price: they need blood to survive. The first few episodes are sprinkled with prejudice and distrust towards both Kabaneri despite their repeated help. This whole plot point quickly becomes tired and boring, with people welcoming Mumei one minute and decrying her the next. Ikoma is kept locked away for the most part, but many fear him. They are not fully accepted by the people until they save everyone again in episode four, and by then it\u2019s been at least three solid episodes of distrust, prejudice. and even a coup on the train. \\n\\n\r\nThe writers for this series take many liberties in the face of advancing the plot, usually coming up with idiotic ways for humanity to fuck itself over. In episode one, for instance, the guards for the gate into the city decide to lower the drawbridge for a fast moving, oncoming train (later revealed to have many Kabane on board) instead of waiting for the train to come to a complete stop. This of course jumpstarts the plot, but it puts into question how humanity has survived for so long when the guardians of the city can\u2019t even perform basic checks on a train before letting it into the city proper. \\n\\n\r\nIn spite of all this, as a survival story Kabaneri was fairly enjoyable. The battle against the black shadow was a marvel to look at visually and the music only added to the fight. But the shows\u2019 hubris catches up with it and inexplicably the story tries to focus on the human condition instead. It is a badly done critique though, because the main villain is one dimensional and ridiculous and the whole thing spirals into a terribly done revenge plot instead. The villain's motivations are thin at best and the loyalty of his soldiers is laughable. The story tries to pin the emergence of the Kabane on the elites in the capital but even this is barely explored. The direction the plot decides to go is completely terrible. Remember what I said earlier about how the writers come up with bullshit reasons to advance the plot? It\u2019s not a good critique on humanity when a crazy person is the one bringing all of the misery in the last few episodes. Tearing apart the rest of Kabaneri\u2019s flimsy story means tearing apart the characters, so on we go. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: I\u2019ll be blunt: I don\u2019t like Mumei. Or Ikoma really. But Mumei\u2019s character really irks me. She\u2019s incredibly na\u00efve and idiotic at the best of times. Her personality is constantly shifting: one minute she\u2019s cute and smiley and the next she\u2019s intense and frowning. She says or does something that doesn\u2019t sit right with the people around her and doesn\u2019t offer a logical explanation. She doesn\u2019t listen to what the leader of the group tells her to do when they are on missions. She\u2019s constantly thinking about how only the strong can survive, weak people should die, etc. etc. It\u2019s amazing that these people actually like her. She doesn\u2019t think badly of the villain ever, and even when he betrays her trust she still goes back to him. She knows he lied to her but she goes back. She trusts him to not do anything to her when she just witnessed a friend get fucked over by him. Yes, she\u2019s only a girl, but it\u2019s insane that she still trusts him after she saw him do. The rest of her plot is predictable, boring, and contrived. The villain proves that her badass characterization is moot, manipulates her, and eventually turns her against her friends. The fact that she\u2019s responsible for the deaths of thousands of people doesn\u2019t help my opinion of her. \\n\\n\r\nIkoma is also frustrating at times, but not on the level of Mumei. He is the typical shounen protagonist: young, na\u00efve, and mostly weak. His contribution to this world is a steel piecing projectile weapon. Most of the time he\u2019s tagging after Mumei trying to make her a decent human being, which is almost impossible. His naivety is frustrating and as a character he really doesn\u2019t add much to the story. He isn\u2019t really necessary. He is only Mumei\u2019s link to humanity and since I don\u2019t care for Mumei at all, I really can\u2019t care about Ikoma either. In the last few episodes her gets an appearance change (arguably to indicate that he is a badass now) and his character arc seemed to be going a a good direction. It's too bad the writers didn't have the balls to follow through with it. \\n\\n\r\nAnd then there\u2019s The Villain. Until episode 7, the only thing the audience knows about him is that he is Mumei\u2019s \u201colder brother\u201d and that he is the one that has told her that only the strong should survive. This person is our antagonist and until episode 7 we have not seen him ever. This is terrible writing. At this point in the story I was convinced that the Kabane would continue to be the antagonists because who else could it possibly be? That guy Mumei talks about occasionally? No goddamn way. How could I get invested in an antagonist\u2019s motives with only five episodes left of the series? How could I possibly care about this dude? Right from the beginning when he was introduced I knew he was an asshole. He kills people with a smile on his face. He\u2019s cruel, manipulative, and callous. He treats his servants like expendable objects. He throws away a kabaneri like it\u2019s nothing. He lies to Mumei and destroys an entire station, killing thousands, just to send a message to his father. And why? Why is he doing this? Because his father was mean to him when he was younger. Because his father didn\u2019t care about him enough to try to save him. And so now, he has to go around and kill thousands of people just because he has daddy issues. It\u2019s a ridiculous, tired motivation and the fact that this is the antagonist a zombie anime is going with is ridiculous. This guy manipulated a young impressionable girl who had just lost her mother and turned her into a kabaneri because he was angry with his dad. The fact that he has people that are still loyal to him is baffling. He\u2019s throwing a humongous temper tantrum, but it\u2019s not cute because he\u2019s killing everyone instead of yelling at them.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation and Sound: The animation is great. The composer is the same one that did Attack on Titan, so the soundtrack is wonderful. I could say that it sounds a little too much like AoT, but composers have their own style, so I can\u2019t fault him for that. The voice acting is good for the most part. Yuki Kaji is distinctive as he always is for me, but it\u2019s not distracting. Tasuku Hatanaka\u2019s voice work for Ikoma is painful to listen to. He did good work on Ushio to Tora, but because his voice is so distinctive it felt like I was listening to Ushio talk about zombies for the entire show. It didn\u2019t help that the second season of Ushio was airing at the same time. \\n\\n\r\nKabaneri looked like a promising anime at the beginning, with a decent survival plot unfurling nicely. However, the story suddenly does a huge 180 into a story that has no relevance to the one previously set up. In the end, all that\u2019s left are the shambles of a promising story and a garbage pile of shitty characterization, contrived plot points, and terrible writing. It was good as a survival story, but it\u2019s terrible as a revenge story. I\u2019ll just play The Last of Us again next time. \\n\\n",

(As i saidthe action does a great job at carrying the show.)\\n\\n\r\nStory and pacing were excellent, never did it feel like the show was moving to fast for it own good.

            "content": "Every so often, there would be a certain hype train that blows out of the tunnels yelling out \u201cAnime of The Year\u201d before it have even has a little chance of promoting itself. Let alone actually premiering a single episode. For that is how the anime community has become. But what are the chances of finding an anime of such a grand scale and setting such as this with high production value? Though of course as we are a demanding bunch we're just sitting at our computers still scratching our heads wondering \"Where's SnK Season 2?\".\r\nThat being said. How does Kabaneri of The Iron Fortressreally hold up to the hype of what was meant to be Attack on Titan Season 2 or it a steamed roll of disappointment?  \\n\\n\r\nPlot: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nAs it stands, the story of a steampunk, samurai age zombie dramatic thriller story was a nice sparkle of something refreshing from your typical harems or action anime that\u2019s shown seasonally. It's not often you find a decent zombie anime of sorts in current times. Though of course being the studio that animated Attack on Titan, it borrows a few tropes from the series and makes it their own here. Settings and character wise. Unfortunately despite the high value to presentation doesn\u2019t stop the show being filled with the old plot hole and plot device convenience. The show is just riddled with them it somewhat ruins the atmosphere and feel like the show is just stuck on rails to become what it is. How did humanity make railways and walls overtime with kabaneri roaming everywhere? Where did the kabaneri even come from?  \\n\\n\r\nWas the plot entertaining? By all means it sure was, if not being generic at some points. The little plot twists we\u2019re few but enough to keep me intrigued. Sweet animated fight scenarios and heavy amounts of drama between characters kept the atmosphere peaked within scenes.\\n\\n\r\nThough the characters back stories still have left much to mystery and assumptions as they we're minor scenes that left even more plot holes than I'd like.\\n\\n\r\nArt/Animation: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nDefinitely getting high marks was if not is the biggest highlight to the entire anime series. Animation was top notch as it was switching between 3D and 2D animation with such streamlined quality. As you can expect of course after working on Season 1 of SnK. However as an original series with no source content, the world is beautiful, vivid and rich with so much detail it leaves you times of shock and awe. It had the quality of an hour long movie yet stretched across 12 episodes of epicness. Of course there are more eye boggling works out there, but I\u2019m a simple man.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nAs a big fan of Egoist it isn\u2019t a surprise that I was largely impressed with the fantastic opening that it had. As well as having Aimer for the ED, I couldn\u2019t have been happier with their choices of artists here. The soundtrack and BGM we\u2019re composed by the one and only Hiroyuki Sawano, whom composed the background music for highly renowned anime such as  Guilty Crown and Attack On Titan. It was amazing to watch the battle scenes with such intense music. Sound effects for the steam guns, trains, zombies and etc. we\u2019re great. The voicing of the characters was on point as well. No one felt out of place for neither their characters nor their designs.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nNow this is where things seem very similar to Attack on Titan in like every way possible. Not to say that\u2019s a bad thing of course. We have The Main duo protagonists Ikoma and Mumei. Ikoma being your typical shounen character ripped straight out of a manga. His got the willpower, confidence and a leader like feel about him. He is also a very noble to the cause guy who wouldn\u2019t give a rat\u2019s ass of getting bit for his comrade\u2019s sake. However what he does lack is any character development. Sure he may be a keen bad-ass guy from episode 1. But after completing the series I feel like he hasn\u2019t changed much whatsoever. For better or worse I\u2019m not completely sure. But he felt kind of disappointing Mumei on the other hand (#Best-girl) is a mix bag of cuteness and bad-ass wrapped up into a package. She\u2019s a lovely girl who\u2019s been through hell and back to achieve her goals. Some could say she\u2019s naive and childish with some of her choices throughout the series and I can agree as it gave me times of questioning it myself. That being said she\u2019s only like 15 or 16 (assumingly). So her decisions do reflect her age and I respect that they decided to follow that rather than being a generic female main.  \\n\\n\r\nSide characters we\u2019re a solid addition to the cast other than the \u201clet\u2019s kick these guys off the train\u201d people of course. But it wouldn\u2019t be a zombie apocalypse setting if there wasn\u2019t these people aren\u2019t scared to do what they think is right themselves despite the circumstances. As such a large majority of the supporting cast is as such. However to find  these characters as controversial is one thing, but to first emphasise with their choices and see why is a whole other thing which I wish more people take into consideration before judging the characters indiscriminately. Moving on the other main supports we\u2019re a necessary bunch to keep the series bumped up with their own personalities and traits to have the characters feel more varied.\\n\\n\r\nThe antagonists of the story we\u2019re probably as evil as they come. Fuelled by the desires of revenge and survival of the fittest ideals, they really brought the anime plot more alive. I really liked the antagonist this time around. Oddly enough he had an aura of being beyond human nature that enticed me to continuously be curious to what he may plot next. It\u2019s a rare response I ever have for any antagonist, so here\u2019s to say he was a pretty good one. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment/Overall: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nDespite the many plot holes and small flaws I could further list, I thoroughly enjoyed the series as a whole. And I do admit that I too was on the hype train starting from the first PV. It was a great series that I would recommend to people looking for the steampunk, zombie or action genre. Though it isn\u2019t Attack on Titan Season 2 it\u2019s still something to watch while we wait for its release sometime later this year.\\n\\n",

I'd probably get down to it eventualy (talking about my rating system)\r\nBut anyway, I bet you're wondering why I even bothered making a review given that I judge a series based on my personal enjoyment of the series for the most part\r\nIt's because this series had my hopes up. It had the best art style since the fate series, I liked it's themes and the main characters were not cookie cutter\"where's my momma, I'm so scared\" type of characters.... For the first 4 episodes\\n\\n\r\nThe first four episodes of this series were just absolutely brilliant. The dynamic between Ikoma and Mumei was also great\\n\\n\r\nThe background music was fantastic and fit every scene perfectly and the credits were absolutely amazing, specially the ending song Ninelie\\n\\n\r\nBut.... everything changed after the fire natio- nevermind, everything changed after the first 4 episodes. Thinking back, they could've just ended it after the first four episodes, it did feel like an ending and a lot of people said so when episode 4 came out. I was one of the people who were first to say that there are a lot more left to be explored, this great show has to continue. Little did I know that the continuation of this series is going to be well, shit\\n\\n\r\nIt started going off track, ironically. Choosing that track resulted into the once great train that was able to protect the people inside it and make them feel safe be reduced to nothing but a trainwreck which will most likely be used by homeless people as their shelter from the rain. Only a shadow of what it once was\\n\\n\r\nOverall, this series starts off really strong but then went downhill from there until they reached a point where the tracks were cut off and a cliff was right ahead, this series tried to step on the brakes as hard as it could trying to save itself but it still crashed and fell into oblivion. They had all the time in the world to realize that there's a cliff ahead but the people on this train's control room were too busy looking back on what the train has done so far and the places it has taken them to notice thus leading to their own demise",

            "content": "Alright kabaneri of the iron fortress's first season is finally finished and so we can have a more balanced and complete impression on the anime.It started in a great way showing hints of a great anime in progress,which actually explains all the hype around the show.\r\nThe first 4 episodes or so were really interesting and pretty enjoyable keeping the viewers intrigued and wanting more.However, after that a huge downfall began in almost every aspect of the anime.From what we had seen in the first episodes it didn't seem like this show actually cares about character development that much but it seemed to be concentrating onthe action part.However that isn't an excuse of the worst character development that i 've seen in any anime.I do not want to spoil anything so I m just gonna say that at some point of the anime the whole situation gets unrealistic and rather ridiculous(i am refering to ikoma's resolve,suddenly becoming more strong and  mature without anything triggering him).\\n\r\nWhat I also noticed is that there were some plot holes.Maybe that was because they didn't want to reveal any further information  for some reason,but it rather made the story a bit complex and at some points,allow me to say,ridiculous.It is too bad that an anime with great such potential and support,even though it was a mix of copied ideas from series,movies and other animes,commited suicide.The fact that it changes its whole course from surving against the kabane to defeating the human enemies,while lowering the threat of the kabane at a overwhelmimg rate seems just a child's mistake.It is like the threat,the danger and the way to deal with kabane was no problem for anyone when the conflict between humans began.Don't get me wrong I understand the creator's intention not to mess things up a lot and confuse and exhaust the audience,but it seems more like everything was being rushed.Perhaps it would be better if it consisted of more episodes and it was slow paced.\\n\r\nAnyway in the end it is not a bad anime,but a rather acceptable one.The impressive action scenes and the animation was great which make up for the rest.So in case you wanna see a anime with plenty of action and blood spilling and you don't care about the story at all then it is a pretty good recommendation from me.",

            "content": "Kabaneri has a reputation as an AOT clone which is very justified given the plot,director,composer and studio. While some people say Kabaneri is better than AOT they are an extremely small minority while most proclaim it as a version that does basically everything wrong. I'm in a relatively grey area. I do think Kabaneri is worse than AOT but I think it does SOME things better. Let's talk about what it does wrong.Firstly is the horror aspect of the show or even if you wouldn't call it that the tension or sense of dread that is needed for any action drama.AOT despite its flaws isgreat at creating tension at least in the first season. Firstly is the setting. The idea of being enclosed in a wall surrounded by giants driven by the sole motive of murdering you with no way out immediately strikes you with a sense of claustrophobia and oppression,an idea explored frequently in the show itself.Kabaneri has a world where multiple stations exist removing much of the crushing feeling of being trapped. Also the show kind of treats a station being destroyed as no-biggy while AOT always treats even a breach as groundbreaking development with devastating effects.There also aren't any unpredictable chaos factors like the Armoured or Colossal Titan and most of the breaches either happen because humanity is completely retarded or (spoilers from this point on) someone wants it to. The Kabane also just aren't as effective monsters as the Titans lacking the uncanny valley effect the Titans have,nor the ginormous retard strength the Titans always display and also lacking a commanding presence.The Kabaneri this show's version of Titan shifters have about three main problems.One is that the method their created begs the question of why everyone doesn't become one.Two is they are much much stonger than the Kabane with the Kabane only posing a threat when they make stupid decisions or when they're that weird fused colony thing. Three is that they're powers get really out there as the show progresses with the aforementioned colonies,a goddamn laser beam and even better superhuman strength with very few established limitations.Then is the whole Kabaneri are evil conflict that goes on for far too long instead of like how it went for one scene in AOT.\\n\r\nNow what does it do better than AOT. Well I liked the characters more. They certainly have more I can say about them unlike that one Marco dude.However,unlike the AOT characters(at least the suppporting characters) who will probably develop down the line I can't see that happening for the characters of this show. It all feels more processed and like they're just there to fill roles. I like Ikoma and Mumei for the first seven episodes. Ikoma unlike Eren who pretty much just screams is a lot more settled and optimistic which is refreshing to say the least. Mumei starts of as bootleg Mikasa but I like how the power dynamic between the mains begins to tilt and they aren't afraid to show her as vulnerable.\\n\r\nHowever, some pink haired twink comes along and ruins everything. Mumei becomes a damsel in distress in one of the most trite ways possible, Ikoma loses his likability and his motives are muddier than the river I find 4 slippers in every day.And that final episode is one of the biggest clusterfucks(pardon my language) I've ever seen.\\n\\n\r\nAbout the production I can't say much most don't already know. The show looks gorgeous with a semi retro aesthetic and beautiful character and world design and that Sawano soundtrack is just MMMMMMMMHHH.\\n\\n\r\nAlthough I like Kabaneri it has a lot of wasted potential and while I like it I'm afraid I can only give it a 5/10.Its a fun action romp that becomes less fun after episode 8. Make sure you keep your brain turned off all the way though",

            "content": "More likely than not, you have without a doubt heard of the anime series Attack On Titan.  The idea of giant humanoid looking giants eating people for no reason other than impulse sounds both terrifying and exciting at the same time.  Well imagine the entire idea of attack on titan but with zombies.  Kabaneri Of The Iron Fortress is about the human race on the verge of extinction due to the zombie like creatures known as Kabane.  The only way to kill these dreadful monsters is to literally pierce their iron heart.  \r\nStory wise, at first, I found it tobe a nice idea and a great concept.  As I watched more of the series I realized that so many details and aspects seemed like a direct rip off of the Attack On Titan anime.  Everything from the main characters drive and desire to eliminate the kabane, down to the way people have protected themselves from the outside world for so many years due to the outrageous number of zombie like creatures that inhabit the land outside.  I'm not saying in anyway that the story was bad.  I just think that their could have been a little bit more originality behind it.  \\n\\n\r\nRemember how I said that a lot of things in this anime seem directly related to Shingeki no Kyojin?  Well even the characters share direct similarities.  Most likely when you think of the phrase \"fight fire with fire\" you have an idea of what has to be done to eliminate an an enemy threat by either asking the enemy for help or literally becoming one with those that you hate.  That's exactly what happens in Attack On Titan and this show.  Even the secondary character share similarities with Mikasa.       \\n\\n\r\nAside from its flaws, Kabaneri of The Iron Fortress did a good job with making me wait with anticipation with what will happen next.  Everything seems almost impossible to accomplish in the world of the Kabane, but their was always a gleam of hope when you take the time to look for it.  It was definitely suspenseful and mysterious.  Two things I absolutely love.  I felt relatively satisfied after my run through with the anime.\\n\\n\r\nIf you want a short anime that will make you feel dread wonder what events occurred to make the primary and secondary characters take the paths that they chose, then take the time out watch the Kabane fight what is known as the Kabaneri and see how what little faith they have is restored.",

            "content": "- English Review (Translated version)\r\nI'll be honest, my first impression with \"Koutetsujou no Kabaneri\" was very, very poor. And when I say first impression I'm not talking about the first few minutes, not even the first chapter, I'm talking about practically half of the series. Yes, until about 6th, the series is a clash of clich\u00e9s (more than usual) and a style... \"based\" on others animes like \"Shingeki no Kyojin\".\r\nAbout this idea, it is coherent that when sharing production and study (Wit Studio) you see certain similarities between both anime. It's logical, do you think? But that's a bit too much for me to swallow...what we can see here is not \"inspiration\", it is not \"a tribute\", this is something that surpasses those fine lines to become a fucking plagiarism: argument (mankind cornered before a threat in the form of creatures), protagonist (half between the human race and those creatures, and he is used as a key weapon), musical style (abuse of epic music and choral melodies)... so written does not seem to be so much, but believe me, it is so excessive.\\n\\n\r\nAnyway, when I talk about that the first part of \"Koutetsujou no Kabaneri\" is quite improveable, I do not say it just because they act like a Ditto with another anime. The main fault I saw is the insistence on an epic that does not exist. In an exaggerated number of scenes, simple as they are, put the epics songs and melodies and try to force memorable scenes when it is neither necessary nor can be achieved that way. Of course, after seeing these attempts over and over again, after each chapter has (or they want to have) at least two-three scenes like that, what is produced is the opposite effect, no one believes them.\\n\\n\r\nThen there are certain argumentative inconsistencies, although they are minor failures. For example, mankind have spent years fighting with the Kabane with weapons that do not conform to them, but the protagonist without being disheartened is able to devise a firearm, a weapon and a way to avoid transformation. Or that it is so complicated to kill them (theoretically the only way is to pierce the heart with much power) and suddenly you see kabane dying because they cut off their heads.\\n\\n\r\nBut then comes episode 7 (very quiet, \"filler\" for the tiresome) and from there the series is completely transformed as to how you develop and present the story. The epic is finished with shoehorn in each scene, the stigma of brazen plagiarism is finished. It is at this moment that \"Koutetsujou no Kabaneri\" detaches itself from that elongated shadow and begins to offer us things by itself.\\n\\n\r\nNor is it any wonder, do not misunderstand me, but at least it's much better than those first few episodes because you skip many of your failures until then. It is true that the story is somewhat run over and confused, not given much data and this makes the end is also somewhat precipitated in my point of view. Although it is something expected when only consists of 12 episodes and half of them are mediocre to the extreme.\\n\\n\r\nFinally I wanted to mention the soundtrack, which is very good. The melodies on stage (no matter how often their use is forced) have a tremendous charisma. The opening is not bad, it complies, but it lacks something. At all times it seems like it goes half-gas, it does not finish booting nor stands out at all. In contrast, the ending is of enormous quality and makes its role much better. This comes to be like a kind of analogy with the anime itself. It starts without a definite site, without being anything special, lacking spark, but ends up much better executed and leaving a good taste. That is \"Koutetsujou no Kabaneri\".\\n\\n\\n\r\n- Spanish Review (Original and faithful version)\\n\\n\r\nVoy a ser sincero, mi primera impresi\u00f3n con \"Koutetsujou no Kabaneri\" fue muy, pero que muy deficiente. Y cuando digo primera impresi\u00f3n no estoy hablando de los primeros minutos, ni siquiera del primer cap\u00edtulo, estoy hablando de pr\u00e1cticamente la mitad de la serie. S\u00ed, hasta m\u00e1s o menos el cap\u00edtulo 6 la serie es un batiburrillo de clich\u00e9s (m\u00e1s de lo normal) y un estilo calcado a otros anime como \"Shingeki no Kyojin\".\\n\\n\r\nEn cuanto a esto \u00faltimo, me parece muy bien que al compartir producci\u00f3n y estudio (Wit Studio) se vean ciertas similitudes entre ambos anime. Es algo l\u00f3gico, \u00bfno? Pero que nadie quiera hacerme comulgar con ruedas de molino... lo que podemos ver aqu\u00ed no es \"inspiraci\u00f3n\", no es \"un homenaje\", esto es algo que sobrepasa esas finas l\u00edneas para convertirse en un jodido plagio: argumento (humanidad acorralada ante una amenaza en forma de criaturas), protagonista (a medias entre la raza humana y esas criaturas, se le usa de arma clave), estilo musical (abuso de m\u00fasica \u00e9pica y melod\u00edas corales)... as\u00ed escrito igual no parece para tanto, pero creedme, lo es.\\n\\n\r\nDe todas formas, cuando hablo de que la primera parte de \"Koutetsujou no Kabaneri\" es bastante mejorable, no lo digo solamente porque se hayan marcado un Ditto con otro anime. El fallo principal que le veo es la insistencia en una \u00e9pica que no existe. En un n\u00famero exagerado de escenas, por simples que sean, por poca chicha que se les pueda sacar, meten las canciones y melod\u00edas de corte \u00e9pico e intentan forzar unas escenas memorables cuando ni es necesario ni se puede conseguir de esa manera. Como es l\u00f3gico, despu\u00e9s de ver estos intentos una y otra vez, despu\u00e9s de que en cada cap\u00edtulo haya (o quieren que haya) m\u00ednimo dos-tres escenas as\u00ed, lo que se produce es el efecto contrario, nadie se las cree.\\n\\n\r\nLuego hay ciertas inconsistencias argumentales, aunque son fallos menores. Por ejemplo que la humanidad lleve a\u00f1os luchando con los kabane con armas no acordes a ellos, pero el protagonista sin despeinarse sea capaz de idear un arma de fuego, un arma blanca y una forma de evitar la transformaci\u00f3n. O que sea tan complicado matarlos (te\u00f3ricamente la \u00fanica forma es atravesarles el coraz\u00f3n con mucha potencia) y de pronto te veas kabane muriendo porque les cortan la cabeza.\\n\\n\r\nPero entonces llega el cap\u00edtulo 7 (muy tranquilo, \"de relleno\" para los pesados) y a partir de ah\u00ed la serie se transforma completamente en cuanto a su forma de desarrollar y presentar la historia. Se acaba la \u00e9pica metida con calzador en cada escena, se acaba el sambenito de plagio descarado. Es en este momento en el que \"Koutetsujou no Kabaneri\" se desprende de esa sombra alargada y empieza a ofrecernos cosas por s\u00ed misma.\\n\\n\r\nTampoco ninguna maravilla, no me entend\u00e1is mal, pero al menos es mucho mejor que esos primeros cap\u00edtulos porque pule muchos de sus fallos hasta entonces. Cierto es que la historia es algo atropellada y confusa, no se dan muchos datos y esto hace que el final sea tambi\u00e9n algo precipitado bajo mi punto de vista. Aunque es algo esperable cuando solo consta de 12 episodios y la mitad de ellos son mediocres hasta el extremo.\\n\\n\r\nPor \u00faltimo quer\u00eda hacer menci\u00f3n a la banda sonora, que es muy buena. Las melod\u00edas en escena (por mucho que en bastantes ocasiones su uso sea forzado) tienen un carisma tremendo. El opening no es malo, cumple, pero le falta algo. En todo momento parece que como que va a medio gas, que no termina de arrancar ni destaca en nada. En contraposici\u00f3n, el ending es de una calidad enorme y hace su papel mucho mejor. Esto viene a ser como una especie de analog\u00eda con el anime en s\u00ed. Empieza sin un sitio definido, sin ser nada especial, falt\u00e1ndole chispa, pero termina de forma mucho mejor ejecutada y dejando un buen sabor de boca. Eso es \"Koutetsujou no Kabaneri\".",

I am 100% serious, you will not regret this choice. The timing had us howling with laughter.\r\nOh, right, the anime. You guys remember Attack On Titan, right? Did you ever want to see that but with trains and zombies? Maybe?\r\nNah.\r\nI don't even know where to start, this was such a.........\r\nMass of train cars derailed in a ditch forming a flaming pile of wreckage.\r\nThe show is utterly beautiful. Its soundtrack is amazing. It's a shame that the writing was worse than mine. Characters areshallow or pointless, motivations have the depth of a drying puddle, and really cool imagery is wasted at every opportunity. If this was just a portfolio filler, everyone involved should have gotten a pat on the back. The art and sound teams did their damnedest, and they did a fine job! But it's not, it's trying to be a story. In the end, it was a story about nothing with cool moments that left you feeling empty due to how little you cared about anything going on and the nonsensical ways the characters got to where they were.\\n\\n\r\nBut if you want to watch a show for 'so bad it's good' value, go no further! You will find boundless enjoyment from Kabaneri! Come one come all, laugh at our protagonist's constant yelling of names! Cry at the beautiful parallels in timing to Thomas the Tank Engine! Shout at your screen from the characters' senseless decisions! It's a good time.\\n\\n\r\nReview over.",

Although the two anime have some similar aspects like fighting for their survival, etc., the anime is also very unique and interesting. It isn't corny or cheesy, and unlike a lot of anime that is really similar, Kabaneri is very different in a good way. The art is very clean and i love the characters (their looks/style and personality). Although the ending seemed a bit rushed, there was news that there will be a season 2 in 2018. I cant wait for the character relationship developments, especially with Mumei and Ikoma",

            "content": "Kabaneri of the Iron Fortress starts off in a steam punk world dominated by trains and stations in order for humanity to survive against 'kabane' (basically zombies). Which sounds amazing! Despite this opportunity, it is widely criticized for being an Attack on Titan clone and it can't be denied that the whole production is almost entirely the same (studio WIT, composer Sawano Hiroyuki, Aimer). However I think for the most part they aren't as similar as one should think and in some areas there's a little more maturity, but that doesn't stop WIT from trying to applying its same hit formula to this series disappointingly.\\n\\n\r\nSTORY: 5\\n\r\nSomewhere along the way Kabaneri starts to contradict itself in motivations and direction.. possibly due to perhaps over indulgence of a certain antagonist which gave rise to weak tension and climatic moments. Flaws are established and then somehow the story ends up with 10x the amount of flaws that it started with. Particularly in the first quarter of the show, I believe that many viewers were drawn to how the world building was set up, and our introduction to what kabaneri are, and how humanity has adapted with the circumstances. But the truth is that we continue to get bits more about the world and wonder, and even those are never given answers for! The story never truly utilizes these aspects of the world to the extent that it could and seems to prefer only using it as a surface finish. Which in particular leads to problems with establishing the characters in the setting well and gives way to very generic circumstances and plots. Kabaneri tries really hard to push meaning in a overused manner and might have done well had it just maybe stopped trying to give something like it's successor or just give more cool visuals. \\n\\n\r\nART: 7\\n\r\nIt's got a unique style that was absolutely gorgeous when it needed to be. If the plot wasn't so bad, then the climatic emotional moments drawn would have had immense impact as a viewer. But it so very falls flat because of poor developments. If anything, they should've attempted more fight scenes because they were clearly the highlight of the show. \\n\\n\r\nThe color palette also starts out very dark and edgy but then slowly starts to gradually become the more generic bright tone unfortunately. However, character designs and sets are absolutely fabulous. \\n\\n\r\nSOUND: 10\\n\r\nThis soundtrack is so fucking incredible. Hiroyuki Sawano as the composer, Egoist for the OP, AND CHELLY (EGOIST) AND AIMER FOR THE ED COMPOSED BY HIROYUKI. This is like top, top, talent. How did Kabaneri fall so flat with this genius soundscape is the most puzzling thing. I would not have been able to continue without it. Sadly again, although the mix provides great crucial timing and atmosphere for its scenes, emotionally these are disconnected from the viewer because of poor storyline context.\\n\\n\r\nAnd to note voice acting, the voice actors performed well in conveying dialogues filled with emotional stresses, especially the main character's. \\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER: 6\\n\r\nThe cast had a lot of potential in the direction they could've been taken in. And perhaps the only one who truly shown out and developed in a substantial manner is Akame who by the end displays a firm grasp of the leadership she wants to pursue. But otherwise, everyone is setup interestingly and likeable (after some rough starts) with unique quirks. Sadly, no one but 3 characters are explored, 2 of which were poorly focused on even then. The main character Ikoma for the most part has some well written unique, dialogue that shows his growth in perspective but for some wrong reasons as well. However, due to lack of time, it could be acceptable. Could. As for the antagonists, his motivations were so poorly framed and constructed that for the most part it didn't justify his grand schemes. The secondary character Mumei also falls to a weirdly approached cliche type of redemption that is unfitting for her defined character. \\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT: 7\\n\r\nIt's probably more at like a 6.5 and only because the setting, soundtrack, and character highlight moments drove it up for me. In the end, it is quite a large disappointment only redeemed by how badass some of the characters look. And a cute Ayame x Kurusu reunion moment. (Shit I had lost all hope but that was way too precious). \\n\\n\r\n*SPOILERS* \\n\r\nBut I'm dying to know, why are male kabaneri's rare?? WHAT AND HOW IS A KABANERI MADE. \\n\r\n*END SPOILERS*\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL: 6\\n\r\nWithout my extreme bias and worship of the soundtrack, I truly think it rates as a 6. Not good enough to be great and dying to watch, but not horribly bad like most of the reviews say. However if you are truly invested in its initial premise, a word of caution because you might end up disappointed. Especially if you like to invest in world building.",

            "content": "Kabaneri of the Iron Fortress.\r\nKabaneri is an average show with an outstanding setting and world concept of a steampunk fuedal Japan, has fantastic top-notch animation, but suffers from cliche and stupid characters, a cliche and weak plot and an average musical score. Don't watch it.\r\nUnfortunately, I don't think a second season, if it even gets one, will save this show. It needs to cut out the superpowers and cliche moe crap (i.e. Mumei) and develop its characters more.\r\nIts setting is fantastic, but suffers from the same problem as Attack on Titan: trying to be a survival horror series showcasing the vulnerability of humanity against monstrous(literally) odds, but then chucks superpowers at the hero and devolves into a shounen fist-fight.\\n\\n\r\nThis show pains me because of its POTENTIAL. We need more original shows and concepts in anime, and I can't stress enough how much I loved the \"steampunk samurai\" setting: I want to see more. But the characters and story killed it, and while at times the soundtrack did evoke emotions, other times it just didn't fit with the tone of some scenes at all and really detracts from the scene.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation, however is top-notch and beautifully done. I will praise one aspect of the characters: the voice actor for Ikoma, the main character. It's nice to see a protagonist with a deeper and more mature voice rather than the usual whiny protagonist, albeit he still has his angst moments as well, but I definitely want to see more of his VA Tasuku Hatanaka: it's great to have more variety in character voice over actors.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, some great concepts, but the end result was less than stellar. Nevertheless, it kept me entertained enough to finish the series to the end in two days, so that's something I guess. \\n\\n\r\nI know this is bad for me to do, but the only reason it doesn't get a lower score is for its potential and the hope I still cling to for original series to be successful.\\n\\n\r\nI don't dislike Kabaneri because it was bad. I'm disappointed in Kabaneri because it could have been the best.\\n\\n\\n",

Kabaneri of the Iron Fortress is sub par at best with the most likable character being the deuteragonist mumie and not the annoying cabbage whose instinctual  to sniff out the antagonist with no true suspicion against him (Its only because he wasn't a good enough brother to his own kin that he despises biba off the start). He has more personality then Eren but fails to be better than him(WTF? how is that possible). The action was fine; I wished the series was moreserious though. The only part I did enjoy was Biba and his retribution/revenge plan, he almost reminded me of a non refined version of Makishima; with his responses to murdering and how disposable everyone was to him. Biba like makishima only functioned for his self and his personal agenda, any who opposed died. Its awesome that Biba carries around a Reiterpallasch with human pine resign coated over it, there is speculation his bloodtinge was over 9000 :3 (TRUE THAT MATE) But regardless the anime was no greater than a 6,(It would have been a 10 if : Biba after losing his arm and restoring his embers wrecked that bitch boy cabbage to Lordran and back) .\ufeff",

            "content": "I watched this series because of hype from my friends by the time it was still airing.. so I decided to step a foot tentatively into this series. I already don't expect something original (well, what is original in this world anyway? Everything is just copy-paste with some improvements or some lacking points..). However, first episode managed to steal my interest with the awesome animation. So I stayed.. hoping the story will get better and become something awesome.. only to be met with disappointment :( \r\nI feel the story is really poorly written. It is a mesh of Attack on Titan with Guilty Crown inold Japanese industrial setting. Maybe because the studio did AOT before and the scriptwriter is the writer of Guilty Crown.. Although GC boasts good animation but the story is a mess.. and unfortunately that's the fate of Kabaneri as well.\\n\\n\r\n****CONTAIN SPOILERS****\\n\r\nIkoma really felt like Shu (from GC). He received a power (in this case, being half kabane that gives him superhuman strength) and accompanied with badass chick Mumei.. whom towards the end of the show lost her badass-ness, trapped, became so weak, someone who needs to be saved. Ikoma's design also kinda reminds me of Shu.. both have strange white streaks on their hair.. and had ultra transformation towards the end. \\n\\n\r\nKabaneri also borrows ideas from AOT.. being an apocalypse anime, titans turned into kabanes in this anime (except that -- borrowing ideas from GC -- humans can turn into kabanes with infection, just like the apocalypse virus) and instead of Walls, there are stations in Kabaneri where the humans protect themselves inside. 3D manoeuvre gear becomes the steam guns -- which I consider very ineffective. With physics logic it is quite impractical to be used, since steam engines which is used to power the guns are extremely hot and producing hot steams. But well, screw logic, the human bushis in Kabaneri managed to either not burn themselves when using the steam guns, or somehow managed to store steams without it being condensed back into water to propel the bullets. And I don't understand how they design the thing. It seems like the canister is just fastened on a U-shaped frame on the back, without any clasps, safety hooks or whatsoever. It seems like it will drop if you do a flip.. but again, screw logic, even Mumei managed to do somersault without dropping the steam canister =___=\\n\\n\r\nThere are a lot of stupid things happening in the anime.. Like the adults who still insist to kick out our two MCs because they are half kabane despite they took action to save the civillian' lives.. the attempt to disconnect the freaking boiler room from the train because Ikoma and Mumei are in it (WTF PEOPLE, IF YOU DETACH THE BOILER FROM THE TRAIN, THERE IS NO STEAM TO POWER THE TRAIN AND IT CANNOT RUN, YOU IDIOTS) then our Biba, another antagonist with screws loose in his head.. so many things I can rant about this anime but oh well, *ehm* I need to continue the review..\\n\\n\r\n****END OF SPOILERS****\\n\\n\r\nThe good thing is.. despite using the already tired theme of apocalypse, they introduced something new that people are instantly hooked with.. the steampunk theme. I honestly don't think there's any apocalypse anime with steampunk element yet.. so yeah. Machines, trains, boilers.. this are the interesting elements and thankfully, being utilised well. \\n\\n\r\nAnd at least the MC is not some pussy who suddenly have OP power up.. Ikoma is actually pretty badass and he has brain at least, unlike some idiots in this anime. Mumei is actually decent lead as well. She is small but she can fight.. shows her childish side at times but can be badass when needed.. if only Mumei retains her badassness and strength as it was in the beginning of the show and if she's not as gullible and easily swayed emotionally.. a positive development instead of regression.. The side characters are interesting actually.. like Ayame, Kurusu, Takumi, Kajika and others.. if only they have more depth.. if only there's more time to explore them.. The character designs are pretty good in my opinion. Not usual and still have uniqueness, easy-to-spot. \\n\\n\r\nKabaneri has some potential to be a great anime but... without solid and non-idiotic story, it cannot and will never be. Although... I did stay to watch until the end because the animation is above average. If you like the semi 2D-3D style like in AOT, you will appreciate Kabaneri. It is something similar, with touch of Japanese style.. To be honest, I like the art style of Kabaneri. The colors are mostly warm - in relation with the fire of the people who keeps burning, the steam machines and the train.. but it turned towards the cooler ambient towards the ending when they no longer on the train. Animations are mostly smooth and consistent, not choppy. The fight scenes are pretty with efficient use of 3D to spice things up and make fights more exciting. Effects like fire sparks, propulsion of the steams and smokes are utilised and blended well without being out of place to boost the mood. The opening video is really well-made. I also like how they used interesting angles, make the best use of composition and direct the anime so it is still enjoyable and not going all over the place. At least it has a start and solved some of the issue (Biba), although it has a lot of holes in between.\\n\\n\r\nAside from the gorgeous art style, Kabaneri is saved from being total trash thanks to the sound. Opening from EGOIST which gives you goosebumps, beautiful ending from Aimer ft Chelly.. epic soundtrack from Hiroyuki Sawano.. which is so effective in building the mood.\\n\\n\r\nDespite its flaws and shortcomings (and stupidity), I will be lying if I say I don't enjoy Kabaneri at all. It is good to pass time.. but not what you are looking for if you want solid story with good character development.  \\n",

            "content": "Okay. Avoiding the spoiler, here`s what I thought after watch complete series.\r\nBack then, I defended the whole series, from Episode 1 until 4. And now how the thing goes?\r\nThis what we called \"Culture Shock\". This is like a spin-off of Attack of Titan, an apology or filler to their ridiculous production time of producing AoT series. Until decided to delay more until it goes 2017.\r\n\"Culture Shock\" is what we called, different ideology but similar meaning. Titans replaced to Kabane or Zombies. 3D Manuever Gear replaced to Air gun and Trains, and don`t get me wrong since their Idea of bringing train is really great idea.\r\nThemain problem lies when the arc of Biba and that is the falldown of the whole series. I repeat. The whole series. The powerful character, what is it.... Mumei, she strong and more powerful than Ikoma, but she treated like a simple minded idiot character. Ikoma in other hand, simple but reminding Mumei as her sister. Yeah? Brother and Sisters? Is this the best \"Kabane Story\" they can come up with?\\n\\n\r\nArt design and sound was the only thing that nails it, and reminds me how great the animation was since Attack on Titan was.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter? Yes you will remember Ikoma and Mumei, but not others. Ikoma as i mention back then, he was \"Simple Minded\", like what Takumi said so. Mumei in other hand, Strong but Idiot. Other character like Kurisu, a \"Simple Minded\" also, act as bodyguard Ayame. And lastly, Ayame \"Fine Lady\". Who controls the key of the Iron Fortress. The main issues of character is because they are skipped and underutilized. Like Ayame knows Archery skills back in Episode 1 only.\\n\\n\r\nOverall. I'm very disappointing to see the most hyped Anime gone rogue.\\n\r\nAnd from series 24 minutes to 22 minutes in Ep 11 and 12 also remains unknown.\\n\\n\r\nIs it bad to watch? No. Its a Mixed bag ride. This is Michael Bay Japanese version, but extremely weak executions, that begs the question : since when did this happen?\\n\\n\r\n(4 / 10)",
