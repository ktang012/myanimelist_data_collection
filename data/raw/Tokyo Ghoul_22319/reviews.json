            "content": "Remember when you were little and you tried to bake that really awesome cake following the instructions on a cooking-book and ended up forgetting half the ingredients or using the wrong ones and the cake looked like complete shit and shit was all over the kitchen and then your mother walked in and slapped you across the face? Whether or not you remember, if you can picture that scenario then you can picture how Studio Pierrot's attempt at adapting Tokyo Ghoul into an anime unfolded. \r\nLets actually start off with the \"good\" in Tokyo Ghoul. Why? Because it's one sentence long so lets get itout of the way shall we.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is decent. The opening theme is good, and the ending theme is pretty catchy. Ok so that was two sentences. \\n\\n\r\nI'm going to fess up now and admit that I have not read the manga although I'm aware that it's a lot better and that they crammed 60 chapters into 12 episodes. This review will be based on the anime alone, which I believe is more correct then the people giving this adaption a break solely for their admiration of the manga. \\n\\n\r\nThe worst aspect of Tokyo Ghoul are the characters and their development. Frankly I'm not going to talk about any of the characters aside from Kaneki because there is nothing to say about them after 12 episodes.\\n\r\nKaneki is worth talking about because he is a boy born with a vagina..oh and he is a also a half-ghoul, almost forgot about that. As the MC of Tokyo Ghoul, Kaneki's main role is to disappoint us to death, cry a lot, and bitch a lot about how much he sucks.\\n\\n\r\nWith the characters being so dreadful, the anime relied heavily on the plot and the violence. The plot is very broad in the anime: Humans vs Ghouls and Ghouls vs Ghouls. At least that's what I got from 12 episodes adapted from 60 chapters. The violence is censored so that sucks, but apparently the DVD versions will be uncensored..cool, anyways moving on. The most pretentious thing about Tokyo Ghoul are the attempts at emotionally moving the audience by having some characters we know nothing about die and seeing other characters feel sad while the soundtrack playing assures us that this is indeed meant to be an emotional scene...awkward.\\n\\n\r\n So about right now you're probably thinking to yourself that I don't have much to say about this anime. I just felt like reviewing this anime cause I wanted to write down that whole baking a cake comparison after which my passion ran out. This is much like the folks at Studio Pierrot. They had no passion whatsoever in the making of this anime, taking advantage of the fact that the manga is extremely popular and doing the most minimalist job possible. \\n\\n\r\nWith all this I thought I would take joy in witnessing how badly this train-wreck could end, and to my surprise they actually took that pleasure from me as well. The last 10 minutes of the last episode were legitimately entertaining. Right at the end, the show introduced moral ideas worthy of involving the audience and I found myself enjoying Tokyo Ghoul for the first time. What a bunch of trolls eh. \\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "1) This is a rewriting of one of the first reviews I ever made, I deleted it because I did not know what the hell I was talking about.\r\n2) There will be some minor spoilers, you've been warned ye little b-\r\nYou know those stories that have these special entities that live in a world and pretty much kind of like x-men? Well recently that idea has been done a lot, out of most of the things that have done this idea recently, Parasyte is the only one that succeeds in doing it well, Beside it is this mess. Tokyo Ghoul, when I saw this showI thought it was gonna be some generic mystery show and when I started watching it......it was a generic x-men idea show, how wonderful? And guess what?It became popular and people praised it, now I'm currently taking my time reading the manga (which is better than this) so I won't be mentioning it. \\n\\n\r\nStory: 3.7/10\\n\r\nSo in this world there are entities known as 'Ghouls' who feed off human corpses and drink coffee. Yes, coffee. So one day a freshman college student goes out with some girl and it turns out, SHE'S A GHOUL! DUN DUN DUN DUUUUUUUUN!!!! So after an accident before getting eaten, doctors thought it was such a smart idea (not) to take the ghoul's organs and stuff them into our MC. What happens? The MC is know a half ghoul, half human and struggles to maintain each side.\\n\\n\r\nCool idea right? Well you're wrong, the show fails to make the plot understandable, its such a mess, the reason why is that it never explains jackshit. For example, how do people turn into ghouls? What the hell is a ward? How do ghouls drink coffee but nothing else except water? What is this world? and so on. The show does the thing were it tries to solve everything in just 12 episodes, and this show fails it miserably, this show needs 24 episodes to space everything out, everything feels so rushed, cause of this it leads to the plotholes and cause of the plotholes its more confusing. I'll give it points for its idea but thats it.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 4/10\\n\r\nOur MC  is Kaneki, I talked about him in my story segment, here I'll say whats good about him and whats bad. Now the good is we find out his life is pretty tragic, his mom dies as a kid, he can't eat normal anymore, it really makes you feel for him. The way he tries to keep his humanity and ghoulness is so well done and I give prontos to that. The bad side, the show hardly focuses on him, it tries to focus more on the world around him, this is really the main sector of why everything is messy. Cause of this Kaneki feels more like a plot-device more than anything.\\n\\n\r\nNow the other characters, there isn't really much to say about them, there's Touka, there is meant to be some development between her and Kaneki but there isn't, its like the show is saying, hey look developme- NOPE FUCK YOU! As soon as the development can happen its just vanishes. This leads to so much under-development.\\n\\n\r\nThe other characters, there isn't really much to them and usually don't matter to the plot at all, there's so many chances for some good development and the show fucks that up too.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9/10\\n\r\nOk now the music, is just....epic. Its really well done and is so memroble. The OP, I don't know what to say. It is amazing and it looks at how ghouls and humans are equal and makes you question yourself and humanity? Are monsters really created by humans? The ED, is pretty meh. And thats really it for sound.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 6/10\\n\r\nThe art is pretty OK with some really well done backgrounds that shine, I'd give it a 7, but I won't cause of something in the animation which actually made me want to drop the show and its.....Censoring. There's a lot of blood in this show and it tries to censor it, but it does it so poorly, it uses black bars to censor things, it literally blackens nearly the whole screen and you wonder what the fuck is going on?\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 5/10\\n\r\nWelp really, the only reason I didn't drop this was cause of its action scenes and litlle cliffhangers at the end of each episode. The action scenes are really well done and put you on the edge of your seat. The cliffhangers, man these cliffhangers are a reason to continue the show, they usually leave big ones making you what to see what happens next. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 4.5/10\\n\r\nThis show is a mess, it has some well done music and thats the best thing it has to offer, the rest is just either poorly done or rushed. This show could have been something really good but it falls on its ass everytime it has a chance. The ending is a cliffhanger which is just a cheap move and a reason to watch Season 2. I don't really reccomend this, shows that have done a better job of this are Parasyte which is STILL ONGOING (by the time this review is posted) and Tokyo Esp which is an OK show, its more light-hearted but it does a much better job than this. Tokyo Ghoul is meh. I'm out.",

            "content": "Horror movies are amusing at times to watch. Sure, their intent is to strike fear into viewers but most times, they are so predictable and saturated with tropes that it almost seems like a cruel joke. Tokyo Ghoul doesn\u2019t derive far from that. Despite being much longer than a typical horror movie, the series plays around with itself so much that it almost becomes a laughter stock. Don\u2019t get me wrong though. The intriguing idea of supernatural creatures known as \u2018ghouls\u2019 living among human communities is quite well-built when it comes with premise. However, the show ultimately kills itself with its execution. Based off ofthe manga of the same name, I can say that they are almost like two different worlds.\\n\\n\r\nThe brainchild of Tokyo Ghoul is Sui Ishida as his first original work. Like the title implies, the series follows the idea of ghouls living among human population in Tokyo. They are regarded as savages and killers of injustice. News reports often sends the message that all ghouls must be eradicated in order for the world to be at peace. It becomes a near totalitarian-like state as the ghouls finds themselves at constant struggle for survival. If you don\u2019t believe me, just ask Ken Kaneki. The young boy has a dark secret after one day as he comes face to face with the horror of reality.\\n\\n\r\nAsk yourself first though: is Tokyo Ghoul a good adaptation of a horror story? At first, it does seem so with the premise. The first episode crafts the image well with the innocent Kaneki and his puppy crush on another woman named Rize. What comes next is a big surprise for him as his life spins out of control. This might be a surprise for him but is far too predictable for the viewers\u2019 eyes to see. The beautiful girl with the mysterious aura, dark alley, and morbid news near Kaneki\u2019s community should have all been hints that something terrible would happen to the boy soon. And exactly like that, Kaneki\u2019s life is no longer human as he becomes part ghoul in Tokyo. \\n\\n\r\nDespite being part ghoul, the show sends the message that Kaneki wishes to live as a human instead. His love for literature and struggle to contain his appetite are proof of this. Emphasizing on his human traits, Kaneki fights against his gluttonous desire to consume human flesh. No matter how great the temptation is, we see how determined the kid to retain his humanity. This conventional idea isn\u2019t uncommon at all though. Other series such as Claymore and Shiki also have similar ideas. Unfortunately, Tokyo Ghoul doesn\u2019t develop this idea all too well. For instance, can we really sympathize with Kaneki? While he is a good role model for others, some of his roles in this adaptation are questionable. Furthermore, we don\u2019t really know much about the young boy such as his backstory. Taking a closer glance at his character, Kaneki is more like a plot device himself to steer the engine of the premise. In retrospect, Kaneki is an underdeveloped character with minimal characterization and lack of focus. The mask he wear is a motif to his character but the anime adaptation neglects its value. \\n\\n\r\nSome focus are put together with the other characters throughout the show such as Toka Kirishima, a young girl and also a ghoul dubbed as \u201cThe Rabbit\u201d. Other ghouls entering the story includes Nishiki NIshio, Hinami Fuegushi, Yoshimura, Gourmet, and among others. The funny thing about them is that despite being the ghouls, most of them are presented as protagonists while fighting for survival. It\u2019s clear that society misunderstands them because of their gluttonous appetite for meat. Then, there\u2019s also the Aogiri Tree that fits the profile that society that describes them as \u2013 brutal, violent, and craving to satisfy themselves. On the other hand, there\u2019s the CCG, a Ghoul Investigation agency dedicated to battle against ghouls. I wouldn\u2019t necessarily call them antagonists since their purpose is to secure the safety of the public. However, they do come head and head against Kaneki and the others. The consequence includes grief on both sides as they lose important people. It pinpoints the fact that lives are very fragile that can be taken away so easily whether you are a human or a ghoul.\\n\\n\r\nA prominent character in CCG is Amon. Despite not being the main focus of the show, we find out about him more than almost any other character. These include his partnership with professional ghoul hunter Mado, his past, and how he became who he is today. Serving as a determined man, he has some similarities and differences with Kaneki. They both fight for what they believe in but with very different motivations.  But taking for granted, Amon can be considered a breakout character compared to others. The sad part is that he is perhaps one of the only character that some of us can relate to. Others such as Touka just lacks any distinctive traits or characterization for us to get to know well. Oh and don\u2019t bother asking about Rize. Despite her being the main reason of Kaneki\u2019s change, the show neglects to focus on her as a character at all and only shows her influence through the show in ridiculous diehard ways.\\n\\n\r\nSeveral consideration should also be considered as the show explores prejudice, morality, and identity. Apparently, the public shows fear of the ghouls so the show wastes no time to label them as pure monsters. But ask yourself this: should all ghouls be considered as monsters? This can be controversial as some ghouls truly are unredeemable while others such as Kaneki and Nishiki have human values. Then, there\u2019s the identity issue with various characters. Kaneki struggles to battle this the hardest out of any other character as he adapts to his new life. He must hide his ghoul tendencies from his neighbors, teachers, and even his best friend Hide. While all this seems to strike keen interest, it just feels repetitive and quickly grows old. The show just tries far too had when attempting to get viewers to realize what Kaneki strives to be.\\n\\n\r\nNow comes perhaps the worst part of the show: the adaptation of the story. The craftsmanship had the right source material but it didn\u2019t know what to do with it. Studio Pierrot failed to deliver a faithful adaptation with both the characters and the story. There\u2019s little development with any of the characters and fails to achieve adequate accuracy with the main story. The main story cuts off important parts that were hugely influential to certain outcomes. It lacks credible built-up, has a poor execution, and is ultimately beyond salvage at a certain point. For the characters, most of them suffer from development and characterization. While we can feel sympathetic at times, it\u2019s hard to relate to them at all. Most of them aren\u2019t good role models besides Kaneki. Furthermore, the relationship he builds with others is vaguely expressed. Touka often gets into arguments with Kaneki while Nishiki picks on him as a weakling. Hinami\u2019s relationship with Kaneki has some innocence to it but really lacks compatibility. There\u2019s also a sense of hate between some ghouls but most of this is degenerated to weak expression because of its pacing. In retrospect, this adaptation lies in the ruins.\\n\\n\r\nDespite all this, Tokyo Ghoul is a horror fest when it comes to action. The artwork of the series is done well visually to capture the gruesome moments in the ghoul world. Speaking of which, the ghouls themselves are designed with monstrous traits such as their razor sharp teeth, scarlet eyes, and body structure. The ghoul\u2019s predatory organ known as the Kagune is designed to look artistically endearing with blood-like muscles. Although the show doesn\u2019t focus too much on the mechanics, it\u2019s easy to tell that they are a race to be feared. Likewise, most of the other character designs are designed with accuracy. I say this because of their ability to blend in with human society despite being ghouls. Just take a good look at Nishiki. The background and dark chilling atmosphere also has noir-like feeling to provoke power. Overall action coordination remains top notch with cinematic battles scenes from start to finish. I just hope the BDs will remove the horrid censorship from the TV series.\\n\\n\r\nOn the soundtrack front, the show\u2019s delivery is effective. It shows enough ways to get most of the job done. In fact, the very first minutes of the series wastes little time with its high volume of violence. The haunting tones strikes fear with both wish-fulfillment brutality and chaos. Voice expressions too crafts the imagery of our characters\u2019 struggles. I also give credit to Kana Hanazawa who is able to play the character Rize. She was able to convey the character as a graceful beauty until her true visage is revealed. Others such as Toka and Gourmet have distinctive ways of speaking similar to those of a tomboy and aristocrat respectfully. Finally, the OP and ED songs are beautiful and well decorated. \\n\\n\r\nTo say the least, Tokyo Ghoul is an adaptation gone wrong when it comes to story and characters. The way it is adapted is a degeneration of its original source. But if you\u2019re coming in as an anime original viewer, then this show might be something to take a keen interest on especially when it comes to the cinematic battles. The first episode will hook you in but the rest of them lacks that sort of development. Although there are some occasional comedy, the majority of the show takes itself seriously, perhaps sometimes for its own good. I wouldn\u2019t call Tokyo Ghoul a hollow shell of what it should be though. Rather, it\u2019s more of an adaptation that should have been handled differently. VERY differently.\\n",

            "content": "Prior knowledge\r\nManga: None\r\nTokyo Ghoul is one of the more hyped up anime this season for a number of reasons. Mainly because it was, as I have heard, a very popular manga. The premise itself is easy to follow. The world is inhabited by two types of people: regular people and ghouls who eat people as a source of food. The main character, Kaneki Ken, after almost being killed by a ghoul is turned into a half ghoul-half human hybrid. By this time, I, who has not read the manga, assumed the show would explore the morality of and question the prejudice between the two groupsusing the MC as a focal perspective. While at the same time having some kickass fight sequences.\\n\\n\r\nBoy was I wrong.\\n\\n\r\nStory \u2013 6/10\\n\\n\r\nFor the most part, Tokyo Ghoul\u2019s storytelling was decent. It explored the different aspects of the ghoul community and made its point simple and concise. Although that\u2019s about it. There isn\u2019t anything too fancy or well done with its storytelling. Tokyo Ghoul is quick to establish the lore with the Wards (sectors), the Doves (anti ghoul police), and different types of ghouls. This last point emphasized by Anteiku and it\u2019s here that Kaneki spends most of his time deliberating between his new and unique situation. The plot itself didn\u2019t seem to be headed in any clear direction, but splits itself into different \u2018mini-plots\u2019 (similar to different story arcs in the manga) as Kaneki observes the different ghouls coming in and out of the cafe, and learns their own perspective of being a ghoul. While this in itself is fine, it creates other problems for character development and overall pacing. This is clear at the show\u2019s 9th episode when there is a ghoul invasion in one of the other wards. It\u2019s clear that this is the climax of the show, yet it feels blatantly out of place from the \u2018mini-arc\u2019 format the show was using so far. There was hardly any buildup leading up to the massive invasion and the last 4 episodes seemed to compress as much content as possible by amping up the pace, shown by the sudden high stakes and side characters being quickly introduced. It\u2019s clear the ending was very rushed. Simply put, the show\u2019s plot lacked focus. It did not take advantage of the interesting premise they had to work with. \\n\\n\r\nArt \u2013 8/10\\n\\n\r\nI don\u2019t have any complaints here. The animation is slick and smooth. The (very few) fights and battles are nice to watch. The weapons, qunique and kagune, were an interesting concept for the show and there were enough different types to show off. The show tended to lean toward more vivid colours in its art style and wasn\u2019t afraid to use its full range of colours which I thought was a good decision for the show to make. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters themselves are distinct from one another in their art design and colour and I particularly liked how a character\u2019s colour was associated with their personality. It\u2019s a welcome change from other anime where characters look way too similar to one another. The OP and ED sequences were great to watch and is one of the few shows where I don\u2019t skip its sequences. I especially like theme of contrast and reflection used in the OP.\\n\\n\r\nSound \u2013 8/10\\n\\n\r\nThere wasn\u2019t anything wrong with Tokyo Ghoul\u2019s sound direction. Overall effects in fight scenes were synced well and so was background noise. Each character had their own defined voice and the voice acting complimented well with the art and colour style. That is to say, their voices were a little more on the melodramatic side. But it was used to good effect in presenting their own personalities and character. The OP and ED are both fantastic and fit well into the tone of the show, or rather the tone the show was trying to show.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter \u2013 5/10\\n\\n\r\nHere is where Tokyo Ghoul suffers from the most and ultimately hinders enjoyment of the show. The show has a lot of side characters. A new character is introduced maybe every 1 to 2 episodes and none of these characters get enough screentime and character development. The fault of this is partly due to its 1-cour situation, but it\u2019s also because of the mini-plot format of the show. A new character is introduced who interacts with Kaneki in some way before being pushed to the sidelines a couple of episodes later and a new character takes the stage. There is barely any exposition for the side characters and the way they were simply dumped to the side until the climax arc in the 9th episode was simply lazy.\\n\\n\r\nThe main characters themselves are regrettably 2-dimensional. Kaneki\u2019s initial panic with his newfound situation was acceptable at first but he never grew out of his timidness despite the abundant characters and small setting he was confined to. Unfortunately, the lack of development for the side characters also meant Kaneki\u2019s character development also suffered as a result. Kaneki himself always seems to be in helpless situations which he can\u2019t get out of. The only ounce of character development is during Hinami\u2019s arc in Episode 3 where he sees that there are ghouls who don\u2019t wish to kill people. His entire character is just a tease to the final episode when he goes all badass. And even that in itself is a disappointment. That wasn\u2019t what I wanted to see from the show at all. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment \u2013 6/10\\n\\n\r\nI can tell you this. If you switch off your brain you\u2019ll most likely enjoy this show. It doesn\u2019t do anything new or unique within its own genre. Battles are cool. Characters are predictable and the setting is interesting enough. But if you\u2019re looking for something of a higher quality caliber, then this show isn\u2019t it. I was strung along the entire show thinking \u2018this next episode is going to have more action\u2019 or \u2018this time Kaneki is going to do something\u2019. The entire time the show left me with blue balls just waiting for the moment the show would present some sort of meaningful sequence or a badass fight scene. I was sorely disappointed. The final episode had some element of the exploration of morality and choice and it was at a level I was satisfied with, and something I expected to see from the first episode. Yet this wasn\u2019t the case.\\n\\n\r\nBut hey, if anything else it was a decent Thursday night filler show. Better than Glasslip that\u2019s for sure. The final episode did have me on edge, even if the characters are 2-dimensional, the execution and presentation of the final episode was able to convey a suspenseful tone which regrettably did not appear in any of the other episodes. I suppose its simply another typical shounen anime.\\n\\n\r\nOverall \u2013 6/10\\n\\n\r\nI\u2019ll admit to enjoying it enough. It wasn\u2019t anything special in the end but it\u2019s a decent show to watch if you\u2019re looking for something to pass the time. If you were expecting any level of depth then you definitely won\u2019t find it here. As explained before, the show had a lot of potential in presenting the different aspects and perspective between ghouls and humans and failed to capitalize. Unfortunately, in the end the show is average at best. It wasn\u2019t the fault of the staff entirely as it could have benefited from more episodes, but the adaptation of the source material was mismanaged. For all its visual style it could not save the show from its muddled storytelling.\\n\\n\r\nThis is my first review. Feedback is welcome. A more detailed review can be viewed at my blog!",

Tokyo Ghoul is one of the best anime this season and it is sure to keep you on your toes. Withits darkness and gore most likely to attract gore fans but it can be equally enjoyed by anyone.\\n\r\n Although the concept of getting new powers and meeting a whole different kind of people is not new to anime, but Tokyo Ghoul executes it in a very efficient manner. It focuses on the point that there is no clear distinction between good and evil and it all depends on perspectives. In a deeper sense, it reminds us that we should not jump to conclusions without considering the circumstances and difficulties faced by the others.\\n\\n\r\nThe only disappointment is some censoring in a few scenes but it is overshadowed by the awesomeness of this show.Overall a very enjoyable anime, Art is crisp and up-to-date, sound effects and OP/Ending are amazing, characters are unique and interesting.\\n\\n\r\nA must watch for gore and thriller fans.",

            "content": "First review on MAL:\r\nTokyo Ghoul is a dark fantasy and seinen anime adaptation of the manga made by Ishida Sui, and the TV anime was produced by Studio Pierrot containing 12 episodes. There are also some horror elements, but they aren't that present on the animation.\r\nThe main character of the story is Kaneki Ken, an ordinary college student, and his life changes when he meets Rize at the caf\u00e9 he frequents with his college friend Hide. Little did he know that she is actually a Ghoul, a carnivorous species only able to feed on humans and even other ghouls too, and during the night, heis attacked and almost got killed and eaten by her. He got saved by an emergency operation, when he got ghouls organs transplanted into his body. \\n\\n\r\nBasically he became a half-ghoul half-human, or, like many people say, one eyed Ghoul.. then the struggle and the tragedies start for him since he is now inserted into the ghoul world. \\n\\n\r\nAnyway, how is it? Well, the anime has a promising start in the first episode (usually I would be complaining about the censorship, which is indeed weird, but there are the uncensored episodes available already since a long time already) and at first, as an anime-only watcher or not, you will be looking forward to the storyline, although... Pierrot simply rushed the anime A LOT, skipped so many things and they even changed the order of some events (manga readers know what I mean), which is... really disappointing. \\n\\n\r\nAlso, the studio tried TOO HARD when they made Kaneki expressing his emotions and his struggle while he became a half-ghoul, even though he did some work there, the anime made him look like someone who mostly cries and keeps whining a lot until a certain point, so yeah, he looked like a wimp unfortunately, and there wasn't much development along with the evolution and progress on Kaneki unlike on the manga where these were strong points of his character... his characterization had many problems too. Yes, he suffered a lot with the anime changes on his character.\\n\\n\r\nNot to mention other scenes that they did some weird changes especially on some fights and some censored scenes during the time that the anime was airing, some scenes were so hard to understand to guess what was happening. \\n\r\nThankfully the Blu-ray came out on Japan and you can check out the uncensored episodes already since they are available on the internet. \\n\\n\r\nNow, talking about the animation, you will probably enjoy the quality on it during some fights, even if there are some awkward and sloppy moments on the animation quality like it happens on other animes from studio Pierrot. The kagunes and the quinques were well made though, especially the first one... to be honest, some kagunes (including mainly the Ukaku from Touka) were even beautiful to watch. The animation during the episodes isn't particularly that amazing and the exception happens mostly on the fights or important scenes, so they actually did well on the animation there. \\n\\n\r\nThe story itself is actually pretty interesting and there is a lot of potential on it, and it's nice to see how it shows the perspective from both sides, Ghouls and the humans too, especially on the investigators from the CCG (Commission of Counter Ghoul), it explores characters from both of these sides, which is really interesting, it makes you wonder which side was like the right one and who are the monsters, it makes you wonder a lot about those details, since you will eventually see that not every single Ghoul is evil, and also that the human side also got some bad people, and it gives many possibilities on the storyline but there aren't enough episodes to explore it pretty well, and the studio didn't focus so much on these concepts and ideals involving humans and ghouls, they just jumped into the violent scenes and the action. \\n\r\nAnd unfortunately, 12 episodes means that you won't really see a developed plot and character development wasn't the best thing since the story was sooo fast paced and rushed by the studio, and you couldn't really know much about the characters or get attached to them, except for a few ones who got more screen time. \\n\r\nAlso, after the first episode, the events there felt like all over the place sometimes. However, the 2nd half of the first season was more entertaining, especially the last episode.\\n\\n\r\nThe original soundtrack and the voices of the characters on the anime are great though (especially on Kaneki, his voice actor did an amazing job, and other characters like Touka, and Tsukiyama too, which made his scene even more hilarious... and weird too). I must admit, they did a pretty good job at the soundtrack aspect of the anime. And yes, the opening song of Tokyo Ghoul, Unravel is so addictive and it fitted perfectly on every aspect with the anime... just like the ending, Seijatachi. Anyway, the music was a good thing on the anime, it did fit pretty well, and OP and ED are pretty catchy. \\n\\n\r\nAs you can see, I made some complaints regarding the anime and its studio ruining some aspects of the adaptation while I tried to not compare too much with the manga (it was inevitable though), but... I must say, it was kind of enjoyable for me when I was new to the series, it had potential like I said, but the feeling that you will get after finishing the first season is that it could have been sooo much better, and there could have been more explanations with many elements of the series like the Kagunes and the RC Cells who were skipped, along with the development of the storyline and the characters... it's like throwing the whole potential away. \\n\\n\r\nYou can clearly notice in the anime that Pierrot didn't pull out so much effort and their budget wasn't really the best (there is a reason why many people had bigger enjoyment with the first and episode 12, since it looked like they invested a lot more on these two episodes) while they made that first season. \\n\r\nSometimes even I imagine that Pierrot just wanted to do that shounen treatment at Tokyo Ghoul's anime since they didn't have the best idea in how to make an adaptation. It even felt like an insult or a disrespect towards most of the manga fans/manga readers, since that first season felt like a prototype version of the manga storyline. I do hope that the anime will be remade in the future and do justice to be as great as the manga.\\n\\n\r\nIs the anime enjoyable after all? Well, if you are new to the series, give it a try... you can either love, or see its potential and wonder how it could have been then watch season 2, and check out the manga to see that potential being developed to something amazing, or then hate it due to what the studio did on that adaptation.",

            "content": "**SPOILER FREE REVIEW**\r\nTokyo Ghoul can be summed up using the same three points that just about every other overhyped adaptation of an unfinished manga series ends up falling under:\r\n1.\tIncomplete (ends dissatisfyingly with almost nothing resolved)\r\n2.\tUndeveloped characters (because they were written to have nearly 100x the screen/page time as they ended up having)\r\n3.\tMediocre plot (because it was written to be nearly 100x as long)\r\nIn other words, Tokyo Ghoul is a commercial for its manga. Watching it as an anime is almost entirely devoid of purpose (and no, I haven\u2019t read the manga).\r\nSynopsis: In a world where mysterious beings called \u201cghouls\u201d, people who can eat nothing excepthuman meat, must live along side humans, there is a fierce ongoing war between the two groups. Ken Kaneki, our protagonist, finds himself experiencing ghoul-like urges shortly after an accident, leading him to eventually discover that he has become a half-human half-ghoul.\\n\\n\r\nThe premise of Toyko Ghoul is very, very straightforward, and that is not necessarily a bad thing. It\u2019s easy to understand and easy to follow, so therefore it should be able to deliver entertainment easily, right? Well, not so much, and that can be chalked up something I already touched on; incomplete manga adaptations don\u2019t go anywhere. From the beginning to the end, Tokyo Ghoul comically tries to cram an entire manga\u2019s worth of subplots, side characters, and blood/gore into their show all the while attempting to have a coherent plot. Unsurprisingly, this fails. To its credit though, the anime has a great stretch of episodes where it focuses on the similarities between the ghouls and ghoul hunters, demonstrating that they are really quite similar. This makes the show morally grey and adds a significant layer of intrigue to both the plot and the characters. However, it manages to completely contradict and ultimately ruin itself by creating completely one-dimensional, obviously evil, totally unrealistic antagonists. One in particular, a man who calls himself \u201ca gourmet\u201d, is so stupidly over the top and exaggerated that it becomes impossible to take the conflict of the show seriously. It clashes with the stronger aspects of the story and ultimately hurts the narrative. The plot can be suspenseful at times, but it is also a combination of melodrama and a serious lack of direction. The clich\u00e9 \u201clast second save\u201d plot convenience is nearly an every-other episode occurrence, for example, making the plot even harder to take seriously. Occasionally, it comes across as just cheap violence that\u2019s only edgy for the sake of being edgy. In short, the plot is just overall unrewarding.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters, as previously mentioned, show great potential for development. There is a lot of framework set up for most cast members to become tremendously written, dynamic characters. Unfortunately, this is a 12 episode adaptation of an incomplete manga, so none of that development is ever seen. Really, I don\u2019t think anything else needs to be said. There is an undeniable disconnect between the adaptation and the source material due to the incomplete nature of the narrative. At least one entire dimension is missing entirely, and that greatly prevents Tokyo Ghoul from being an enjoyable show. Top that off with the bad written and laughably stupid villains and you get a severely underwhelming group of characters.\\n\\n\r\nTo complete circle of disappointment that is Tokyo Ghoul, I give you the animation. Don\u2019t get me wrong; it looks pretty damn good, y\u2019know, when I can actually tell what the hell is going on. There is an absolutely ludicrous amount of the least subtle censorship I\u2019ve ever seen in an anime and it is unbelievably aggravating. Few things grind my gears as much as unnecessary censorship, and it left me with an amazingly sour taste in my mouth. FUCK censorship. Luckily, the music is executed quite nicely and serves to significantly enhance some of the more dramatic scenes, so at least there\u2019s that.\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion, Tokyo Ghoul is the framework of a good story, but it\u2019s just that: a framework. We are never going to see the character development put to animation, we are never going to see the plot lead anywhere noteworthy in animated form, and we are never to going get anything worthwhile out of this series (unless, of course, you read the manga). For that reason, Tokyo Ghoul is a failure of an adaptation. It is a commercial and nothing more. I do not recommend watching it, despite its moments.",

Good action sequences withsuperpowers\\n\r\n2. Blood and gore + screaming\\n\r\n3. Emotional scenes that make you cry T.T\\n\r\n4. Cute tsundere main female protagonist :3\\n\\n\r\nStory: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nThe story starts off with Kaneki, a young high school student who chances upon an encounter with a girl, who turns out to be a ghoul. Both are nearly killed in an accident, that was not really an accident, and Kaneki inherits the girl's internal organs, effectively transforming him into a half-ghoul half-human being. Throughout the anime, Kaneki exemplifies both sides, the ghoul and the human side, and starts to realize how similar they actually are and explore how they can co-exist peacefully.\\n\\n\r\nBut not everyone thinks that way. Other ghouls like the gourmets and binge eaters feast on human flesh waay beyond their expected calorie intake, whilst a mysterious group called the Aogiri, led by a one-eyed ghoul, is taking over 11th Ward. The humans, in the form of CCG, are fighting back against the ghouls, using weapons made from ghouls themselves, which they call \"quinque\". Their job is to drive out the ghoul scum from Tokyo.\\n\\n\r\nThe plot itself is split into 3 main arcs. The introductory arc focusing on Kaneki's transformation and from human to ghoul and then to a realization that he is half-of-each, the Hinami arc, where both her parents are brutally killed by \"doves\", members of CCG who are hunting the ghouls in 20th ward, as well as the final but incomplete Aogiri arc, where all-out war is imminent between ghouls and humans. All three of such arcs are gripping and have excellent development. (+3)\\n\\n\r\nAs far as coherence goes, I can't say much, because the anime ended in a cliffhanger, and it's not entirely fair to point out things that haven't been explained. However, there are a few things that have been explained in a rather unsatisfactory fashion.\\n\\n\r\nGhouls can't eat human food and puke when they eat food, but can drink coffee, which is perfectly fine. Alright, they also forget to mention that ghouls apparently also can drink water. So the question is this - what's so special about coffee/water - that makes it different from other poisonous human foods? None of this is ever touched on, it's just been assumed for sake of a more touching story of Tohka and her friend giving her food to eat. Next, if Tohka really couldn't eat all that stuff, why didn't she just pretend she was on a diet. Even if her friend would be disappointed, at least as a FRIEND she should understand and respect other people's dietary choices, right?\\n\\n\r\nNext point, Ghouls unleash their powers in a pretty cool fashion, but nowhere does the anime ever touch on where these special powers come from, and why are they so varied? We can see from Hinami that because she inherited her powers from her parents, she has BOTH of their abilities, but what about the others? Wouldn't they have inherited multiple powers as well? Why are so many of them only using one power - since, by assumption, most of them have parents and none of them are \"1st Generation Ghouls\".\\n\\n\r\nThat brings me to my next point - the story misses out a key plot line, which I think can really be developed on, the origin of ghouls in the first place. Although this is not so much a problem but an opportunity for further plot development.\\n\\n\r\nLastly, if ghouls are running rampant everywhere, and could be anyone you know, and the public knows of the existence and general workings of the ghoul (nowhere in the show is it stated or even implicitly shown that the existing of ghouls is a secret), it makes absolutely no sense for the rest of the human public to live life as if nothing is wrong - even with CCG supposedly \"controlling the problem\", because as long as one life has been taken - it would be all over the news and would spread MASSIVE panic and havoc (which is not seen, as of yet). But okay, I contend that the anime did make \"most of the public evacuate from the area\", but that was only in the Aogiri incident, what about all the killings before that in 20th ward? Kids can still go to school and feel safe? No way, man.\\n\\n\r\nThe anime still has lots of explaining to do, and has no resolution yet, so I'm hoping the sequel addresses these problems and ties everything up nicely. Still, most of the story is fairly coherent, and inconsistencies don't lie on key plot premises. Characters act naturally based on situations and so do the organisations (except maybe CCG might want to use tanks/aircraft against the ghouls instead of just soldiers) (+1)\\n\\n\r\nAs for plot depth, it is definitely quite substantial, because the anime doesn't stick to one main character, Kaneki, and just leave you the whole anime from his perspective. It jumps from the point of view of the CCG, to the people at Anteiku, to the people at Aogiri. All the perspectives are different, but all of them are essentially fighting for their lives or to protect their population/species. The central theme to this anime is basically \"What defines being a human?\" And that question is up to you to decide for yourself. The author hints that being human is essentially just a way of life, and it is our moral compass, conscience and actions that we take that make us human, or not human. (+3)\\n\\n\r\nLike I said, there was no resolution, so I'm rating the story fairly as if I have only watched half the series.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nThe art for this anime is quite good. I love how the powers of the ghouls are fleshed out, all the blood and gore is a bit disturbing, but I guess it suits the anime well. The different character art styles and hair styles are also pretty unique and interesting.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 6/10\\n\\n\r\nThe anime has some quite poor OP and ED themes, but the background music never seems out of place, it was generally alright and kept the excitement going. The voice acting, really top notch here - must've been difficult doing all that screaming. Music was really good for all the touching scenes as well as the action scenes - job well done!\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 6/10\\n\\n\r\nThe characters in the story are many, but of course, in this 11-episode anime, not all of them can be fleshed out and fully developed. Character development-wise, we got to know the backstories of most of the main cast, Tohka, Kaneki, Nishiki, as the plot progresses, and their pasts tell a lot about why their personalities are the way they are now. There's also quite a lot of dialogue and interaction that goes on between the main characters, and it adds a lot to the identity of the characters. Even Mado and Amon's past and interactions are clearly portrayed throughout the anime, which I thought was a good thing (+2).\\n\\n\r\nThe main character in the story is actually quite cliched, but there's still reason to love him because it's the \"good\" kind of cliched, and he doesn't really get that annoying until the last arc where he keeps screaming and starts getting multiple hallucinations. Other than that, you can really feel for Kaneki every time he tried to fight his urge of becoming a ghoul. The character's struggle completely grips you each time. Some people might be slightly annoyed at how useless he is most of the time though, and always needs saving, but this is only present in the first arc, by the second arc his involvement, while still weak, manages to help Tohka defeat Mado, which is a statement to the increasing trend of his usefulness as the anime progresses. (+1)\\n\\n\r\nMy favourite character definitely has to be Tohka, even if she is the cliche tsundere in the story. She still ends up kicking ass and has some really beautiful wings, even for tomboy, which she uses to slay people in battle with a rain of red crystals. She's also kind, and slowly opens up to Kaneki, and ends up liking him, as she reciprocates the kindness that Kaneki always shows her, in spite of her cold exterior. She also protects Hinami like her younger sister and has strong affection for her. I also find her really cute, especially the way she blushes and the fact that she wears a rabbit mask. :3 (+1)\\n\\n\r\nThe final character who bears some interest is Rize, whom we still know nothing much about (except for the fact that she is a well-read bookworm who shares a similar taste with Kaneki), other than the fact that she is basically the \"ghoul-side\" of Kaneki after merging with his humanity. She haunts him about how it was \"all his fault\" and about how he has to \"suffer\" because he refuses to hurt other people, and about how his \"inability/powerlessness in making decisions/taking action\" result in the various tragedies surrounding him. She eventually convinces him that in order to \"protect something\" he must \"sacrifice something else in return\", which Kaneki eventually concludes that he has to sacrifice his own sense of \"humanity\" and become a monster to attain the power he needs to protect the people whom he cherishes. (+1)\\n\\n\r\nRize's character continues to be mysterious, but her influence in the anime seems much greater than many of the other supporting cast that the anime introduced and then totally left them out of any form of development.\\n\\n\r\nNone of the other characters actually stand out much because they aren't focused on too much. Yamori is one of the evil bad guys who goes crazy for no apparent reason and begins torturing Kaneki, for no other reason than, \"Hey guys I got tortured, so I think I should torture him too.\" Which is like...uhh bad reason yo. Also known as \"Jason\", he is the main antagonist in this 12-episode run, but he doesn't get much a back story and gets even less of development despite his central role in the anime, so that was disappointing.\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of character growth, Kaneki shows outstanding growth throughout this anime - from being a wimpy kid at first, to growing slightly stronger but still being generally weak, to end up going crazy because of Rize that is in him and accepting his ghoul-ness despite his best efforts in being human, because he realizes being human ain't gonna help him save his ghoul friends anymore, and he is too powerless as a human. (+1)\\n\\n\r\nTohka also shows a bit of growth, slowly opening out of her shell. While Hinami goes from simply crying and whining about her tragic life, which is truly sad, to growing stronger than she is expected to, and volunteering to fight to get Kaneki back at Anteiku. The other one who shows growth is Amon, who starts to wonder about whether ghouls are all that bad at all when he meets Kaneki, who spares his life and does something only humans would do. Amon also gives into the desire for revenge against the \"Rabbit\" Tohka-chan, for taking away his boss, Mado, whom he respected and looked up to a whole lot. But none of these are actually portrayed well enough, we can see the change in the characters but the progression to that state, not so.\\n\\n\r\nTohka's growth came while \"sitting idly by\" and \"reflecting about stuff that happened\", all of which was essentially skipped, and we only know this because Kaneki bothered to see her in her room. Hinami's growth came in the midst of her crying... it really does solve everything doesn't it? Amon's growth came from visiting Mado's grave. But the anime showed little or none about what led him to any of these characters' conclusion.\\n\\n\r\nThe anime also left me with some characters whom I'd really be interested to know about, like the old dude who leads Anteiku, Yomo, and of course the girl at the bar, Itori, because their character exudes some sort of special aura about them. Too bad they weren't fleshed out in this series.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nI really enjoyed most of this anime, from beginning all the way until the final arc. The scenes are action-packed, and when they are not full of heart-racing action, they are full of touching scenes of people crying, screaming, and talking to each other in meaningful moral dialogue. This anime I didn't want to put down from the time I started, till the time I ended, so good job for that. I did think that the entire of episodes 11 and 12 focused too much on the torture that Kaneki was going through. Firstly because the torture made no sense whatsoever anyway, and secondly because it just felt soooo long. Too long, in fact, and while it first gripped me, I slowly lost interest because it was the same screaming over and over again, and it was the same blood over and over again.\\n\\n\r\nSo, I can't give full points for enjoyment but it's still a very exciting anime to watch.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7.25/10",

            "content": "I REALLY almost desperately wanted to like this anime, but it failed me and went off the rails like a possessed train.\r\nI\u2019m sorry, to all Tokyo Ghoul fans, I really am. I had such high hopes for this show, but, it had so, so many issues. So, lets get down to it.\r\nThis post is spoiler free! :D \r\nCharacters: 3/10\r\nThe show started with a bang. In the first two episodes, I was ready to adopt Kaneki as one of \u201cmy precious babies\u201d. Then show unraveled like cheap sweater.  While Kaneki remained interesting, his emotional development got lost in the rather vast world of ghouls.Kaneki became background noise battered like a pin-pong ball between the too-fast plot and integration into the ghoul society. It's a shame too. Kaneki could\u2019ve become one of my favorite characters (I still plan on reading the manga despite the anime so it could happen!).\\n\\n\r\nKaneki aside, I (in all honesty) can\u2019t recall the name of a single character (I looked them up for this review) aside from Hide, who barely appears. I had a difficult time caring about anyone, especially the ghouls. Let me explain why the ghouls mostly sucked (for me). \\n\\n\r\nFirst, I\u2019m supposed to believe the characters live in a dystopian society, yet none of them (excluding Renji and Yoshimura) behave as if they do. Most characters have angst oozing out their pores, but, if ghouls live in such a crappy culture, how come none of the characters seem to realize it before the anime? For example, one character (who will remain nameless for spoilers sake), literally sits in [his/her] room for THREE days (or longer, not sure) because someone called [his/her] \u201cghoul power\u201d beautiful. Seriously? If I\u2019m supposed to believe [he/she]\u2019s is someone who grew up in a world this grating, why does something so small make [him/her] mope for three days? [He/she] is allowed to be upset, but honestly. If this character lived in such a war-torn and desperate society, a compliment shouldn't shatter [he/she]. \\n\\n\r\nIf you\u2019re thinking I missed the point and that [he/she]\u2019s reaction to a compliment should help me understand how hard the world is, I disagree. Watch Berserk, Attack on Titan, or Akira. Those characters live in a terrible world and act like it (note: I\u2019m not saying every character in a dystopian society or situation needs to be angry and miserable, take Allen Walker, for example).\\n\\n\r\nI have another beef with this compliment drama\u2014a human complimented the ghoul. This character\u2019s relation to humans befuddled me. First, [he/she] acts as if humans are beneath [him/her]. Then, suddenly, the character has a valued human friend and a compliment from a human that [he/she] had such contempt for before make [him/her] pout for three days. I did not understand that whiplash.  \\n\\n\r\nThis character isn\u2019t the only one filled with hypocrisy. Another character (for the sake of spoilers I\u2019ll have to be vague here) acts badly towards a human and shows [him/herself] to consider humans nothing but a food source and then\u2014suddenly\u2014is in love with one! It made no sense whatsoever to me. \\n\\n\r\nSeveral characters did some bewilderingly stupid things. Instead of feeling sorry for them, I could only blink at the sheer stupidity of their actions. \\n\\n\r\nLastly, many characters have rapidly changing opinions. They\u2019ll yell and berate or even attack in each other in one episode and--bam! They are desperate to save and protect each other for no real reason in the next. Again emotional development is sacrificed for plot. \\n\\n\r\nStory: 4/10\\n\\n\r\nThe story moved too fast, plain and simple. I understood it, but I just didn\u2019t give a two figs. Every other episode spent the first five minutes (after intro and recap) telling the viewer what happened since the last episode ended and the first began (in other words, most episode have huge plot developments and time jumps between each one). This made it extremely difficult to invest myself in the story.\\n\\n\r\nAs I said before, new aspects of the world kept cropping up like jack-in-the-boxes. Unfortunately, most of those elements vanished. The world didn\u2019t feel well-rounded, more like someone puked out a bunch of interesting ideas without considering how it all meshed together (I kid you not, someone ends up having a brother the viewer knew almost nothing (if anything, I can\u2019t remember) about that shows up around episode 10 or so. And I was supposed to care about this new sibling relationship (hint: I didn\u2019t)). Most of the world\u2019s elements fit the story\u2019s tone, but there was one bizarre arc that felt like it belonged in Pandora Hearts, Black Butler, or D.Gray-man. I enjoy all three of those, but such a tone certainly didn\u2019t fit Tokyo Ghoul.\\n\\n\r\nThe show is also chuck full of clich\u00e9s. I know some people will give me heat for saying this, but it\u2019s just true. I\u2019ve seen all of those plot elements numerous times. \\n\\n\r\nAnother big problem of this story: I was supposed to care about the ghouls. Um, how? None of the ghouls seemed to like humans; most of them seemed to hate humans, have contempt for them, or blame them for how tough I\u2019m supposed to believe their life is.  But I didn\u2019t pity the ghouls. They eat people without much remorse, for the most part anyways. I can sympathize with a bad guy; I can sympathize with non-human characters; but I found myself struggling to even view the ghouls as the good guys. \\n\\n\r\nAnother problem: I\u2019m supposed to believe (minor spoiler) that one of the reasons this world is so tough and rough is because ghouls and humans can\u2019t co-exist. But the only thing standing in their way was anger. No one seemed willing to give an inch and even try to understand each other (say Kaneki, for obvious reasons). In the end, I found them all stupid.\\n\\n\r\nThe plot moved faster than the Shinkansen, which through pacing, investing me in the story, and developing characters out the window. It seemed the anime aimed for big and shocking moments to show people how awesome and fast-paced it was. While it obviously worked--the show is popular, after all--it didn\u2019t work for me. I didn\u2019t care about the \u201cshocking\u201d moments because I couldn\u2019t care less about what was happening. \\n\\n\r\nArt (and cinematography in general): 10/10\\n\\n\r\nHere the show shined. Beautiful animation that made fights look like brutal yet elegant. Total eye candy.  \\n\\n\r\n(music): It added to the show but wasn\u2019t particularly amazing. \\n\\n\r\n(angles): They did a fairly standard job here. \\n\\n\r\n(intro/outro): I loved both, and the intro\u2019s animation was creative and stunning.\\n\\n\r\nFan service: 1/10\\n\\n\r\nThe show did not have up-skirt shots or laughably big-chested girls. Someone did fight mini skirt, but the female lead usually wore pants (shock). Here, the show did a pretty fantastic job.\\n\\n\r\nSub vs Dub: \\n\\n\r\nWatched it in sub and thought it was pretty good. It hasn't been dubbed. \\n\r\nWarnings: \\n\\n\r\nThe show has a few plot holes. No matter how I racked my brain, I simply could not figure out the problem\u2019s resolution. \\n\\n\r\nThat being said, Tokyo Ghoul is beloved. My opinion isn\u2019t a popular one. In fact, I think its reputation set my expectations too high (so did those first two episodes). Anyways, I plan on reading the manga, which could change my opinion on the anime. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 5/10",

            "content": "Please tell me, what is the monster inside of me?\r\nTokyo Ghoul is a dark action supernatural manga adaptation of the same name. It was one of the more hyped anime for the 2014 Summer season, due to the success of the manga and the proposed themes. It is an another take on the survival sub-genre, one that is really popular nowadays in the West, however fails to have a clear direction of where it wants to go with it.\r\nPlot: \r\nAfter a ghoul - monster that has superpowers and devour humans for living - attack, Ken Kaneki overgoes a surgery that makes him a half-ghoul, half-humancreature with one red eye. He must become accustomed to the new world he's thrown in, as the tensions in 20th Ward arise with increased ghoul and dove - ghoul investigator - activity.\\n\\n\r\nThe plot is pretty basic and simple but the premise looks really promising and you expect it would deliver a thrilling experience on what it takes to be a ghoul and how to survive in the cruel world. And that's where it ends. Soon enough it turns out to be a ghoul gang turf beef anime where the \"good\" and the \"bad\" ghouls fight each other for territory while the \"police\", the doves, try to eliminate them, and it starts playing out as a shonen.\\n\\n\r\nThe psychological aspect of the show, after the first three episodes, quickly becomes forgotten. Kaneki's demised encounter is made to be just an excuse to introduce us to the ghoul world, so much that he almost acts as a plot device. The anime tries waaay too much at the same time, introducing plot devices and characters that hardly get any explanation at all. They desperately wanted to include everything in the show, focusing on nothing specifically and ending incomplete. There's no direction, hardly any foreshadowing, and everything is just a big mess. There are a couple of distinguishable arcs but but they overlap each other and don't seem to have any significant importance. The ghouls are made to be either \"good\" or \"bad\", the good ones being ones that don't kill people but instead eat the already dead ones, and bad ones being those who kill for fun, and are just made to be bad so the characters could disagree and hate them and spark up conflicts. It could have been an interesting ideology and morality clash between sides but yet again, the series fail to flesh out the aspect.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\\n\r\nTokyo Ghoul is one of the rare anime that I would safely tell that the main character is the best one. Ken Kaneki, the protagonist, is just your everyday student, and then everything changes when the ghoul nation attacks. He is dubbed a half-human, half-ghoul creature, and acts sort of a bridge between two worlds. Sadly, that aspect is not focused on, and he doesn't seem to have much importance in the story as he's just a throw-in piece to get the audience accustomed to what is going on. What is good about him though is that he develops a pseudo-double personality, with Rize, the eccentric ghoul that tried to kill him but died instead and got her organs replaced with Ken's, acting as the ghoul part of him, and Ken acting as the human part. The double-personality part is really well done, but didn't receive enough time.\\n\\n\r\nThen we have your obligatory cliched characters that you'll quickly forget: Touka, the female interest and a pseudo-tsundere that has the most development out of the rest of the cast, but otherwise unimportant; Amon, a dove that acts as a representative for the rest of the investigator squad and is the only other character that receives significant development, when his motives for killing ghouls and the view on ghouls are questioned; Mado, a one dimensional villain dove that kills ghouls because he thinks they must be eliminated; and a ton of other insignificant one-dimensional characters or villains that are just there to catalyze the story forward.\\n\\n\r\nIn all honesty, the side cast of Tokyo Ghoul is the worst part of the show. There are maybe 2-3 characters that are important to the story at most, the rest are completely irrelevant, in addition to being one dimensional. The bad ghouls are all made to be sadists: there's absolutely no variety between them, and no backdrop as to why they are like that. Meanwhile, the good guys only show up to infodump you or to save the protagonists, and have no personalities of their own. Tragedy is an important part of the themes and the story and it is quite frequent in the anime but it is really hard to care for characters you barely know about.\\n\\n\r\nWriting:\\n\\n\r\nI wouldn't say that Tokyo Ghoul has bad writing but it's certainly below average. There are plenty of inconsistencies and jumps in story telling, and quite a few things that don't make sense at all. For the first couple of episodes where the anime was still slow, writing was decent, but they dropped the ball the moment the gladiator show was introduced. There is no ground level perspective presented: even though the main character is a representative of both human and ghoul societies, we are not given any idea on how ordinary humans feel about being killed everyday by superior species. It plays out as just a normal and obvious thing and no one seems to worry much about ghouls' existence.\\n\\n\r\nSince the story is focused on so much and yet on nothing, lots of interesting plot devices left unexplained and you only know about how they work based on assumptions. For example, Quinques, the weapons that ghoul investigators use, are supposedly from Kagune, a ghoul's organ that acts as a superpower, but it's not explained on how they are able to use them, how exactly do they get them or why. The ghoul's nature is hardly explained as well, resorting to a simple \"they need human flesh to survive\" explanation, even though their Kagune is a very cool and interesting superpower. The limits to said superpowers and varieties are not mentioned.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the genres and atmosphere, Tokyo Ghoul manages to create tension rather successfully - it doesn't have shameless fanservice or stupid comedy just for the sake of it, and tries its best to deliver the message (again problem being that there's just far too many messages to be delivered). There's not so much of a mystery though, since there is no foreshadowing and lots of things are introduced on the bat that you have to care about or you won't be able to understand what's going on, therefore there's not many expectations that some big revelations are about to show up later on.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation and sound:\\n\\n\r\nThere was a huge hiatus going on when the show aired regarding its massive censors on gore. Yes, that was actually a big thing. The censors killed a lot of fun, and it was a mandatory for a dark, almost horror anime to have excessive gore, because there were more than enough reasons to have them. It's not like the gore happened off screen - it was blurred out with black or even worse - changing the color palette to full green whenever a gruesome fight scene occured when it was impossible to just blur our the gore. I thought a lot about how much gore was needed for this anime and how much should we care that it was presented this way, but from a storytelling point of view it's not too much of a worry since you definitely know that gory stuff is going on, you just don't see them.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation itself during fights is well done, especially in the final episode. Character designs are made to look really emo, which coincidentally plays out to the advantage of the dark atmosphere. The voice acting is decent, with Miyano Mamoru pulling off an exceptional performance voicing the gourmet ghoul. The music is pretty okay, no stand out pieces but they do fit in the situation. All in all, apart from the censors, art and sound don't have anything wrong in them.\\n\\n\r\nAbout the opening and ending, the ED is very basic and generic with a couple of still-frames of the characters changing while the song plays. However, the OP is currently the best of the year - it has AMAZING animation and exceptional music, and does everything that a good OP should do - mirror the atmosphere of the anime and foreshadow the characters. It is more emotional than the anime itself, and I definitely recommend to check it out.\\n\\n\r\nSummary: \\n\\n\r\nTokyo Ghoul draws many comparisons to Deadman Wonderland, but it's much better in execution (that's not saying much though). It has a lot of interesting ideas but there's none that are given enough focus. The manga fans are screaming that the adaptation ruined the franchise, as the original material is actually very slow compared to the \"too fast\" anime version. It should have had atleast a dozen episodes more to avoid being so rushed. This again proves why 2 cour anime are usually superior to 1 cour.\\n\\n\r\nEven so, it still was one of my favourite anime of the season, because tastes, and not because it was objectively good (because it was not). If you like survival genre, or dark settings in general, you could check this out, although don't expect much.\\n\\n\r\nFinal Verdict - 4.6/10",

            "content": "First of all, just so you know, I have not written many reviews. Ever. Of anything. Also, I realise that in comparison to many other reviewers I'm like a newbie, seeing as I have only watched about 20 animes and have just (since a few months) started reading manga. \r\nAlso, while scrolling down numerous reviews I noticed a very distinct pattern: the reviewers who first read the manga and those who either haven't, or just started reading it. Those who read the manga seem to give the show a very low score while those who haven't seem to give it an absurd high score.\r\nNow, I'veread the manga after watching the anime so I guess my score will be something inbetween.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nI would like to give it a 7,5 but since that not possible I'll stick with 8. The story itself is very interesting, while at first glance it looks like your typical horror/supernatural anime with 'bad guys', ghouls who eat humans and the humans themselves, who are obviously the \"good guys\". However the story shows both sides, the human side, firstly via Kaneki but later on via Amon, and the Ghoul side via numerous ghouls that Kaneki meets. It explores grey areas of both species and forces you to ask the question: \"Who are the monsters?\" A very interesting story with so many possibilities had it not been so rushed and jumbled up. In the first few episodes it follow the manga fairly well but then it starts to diverge. Now everyone should probably realise by now that an anime that follows its manga to the letter is rare if not inexistent. However I think the anime made a mistake by not following the manga more closely, it made everything seem too rushed. Not fully recovered from the previous arc it throws you into another one without warning. Also something, that apperantly many reviwers dislike, is the ending. To me, personally it seems like a good ending, be it a bit rushed and sudden it definetly makes you yearn for more. which is after all, it's purpose I think.\\n\\n\r\nArt 7/10\\n\\n\r\nAs someone who values the art as something that must be either perfect or close to it Tokyo Ghoul wasn't a total disappointment but doesn't fit the criteria either. I do love the fact that they coloured the kagune differently than it's done in the manga, mostly because its colour reflects its user very well. Red would have done it too ofcourse but the change of colour is a nice touch. But then they added the censoring: piece of advice: please watch the uncensored verison (unless you really can't stand blood). The censoring was bothersome and unnecessary, maybe even plain on ridiculous.\\n\\n\r\nSound 8/10\\n\\n\r\nDuring the episodes I did not really pay cose attention to the sound or music on the background, mostly because I was too busy following the story (so technically, that's a good thing) but what I can say is that the OS could not have been better or more fitting.\\n\\n\r\nThen there is also the voice casting. Personally I think they did a very good job, the voice casting really matches the characters and the voice actors did a really good job.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 6/10\\n\\n\r\nThe characters themselves are very interesting and very promising, none of them are boring and for once there was not one character that I wished would just die (very rare for me). However, because of the rushing and the fact that they sqeezed, like 60 chapters into 12 episodes they do not get the attention or development they truly deserve and desperately need. They are easily seen as unimportant and merely stepping stones for the plotline or the development of other characters. Especially Kaneki Ken who only gets his develompent (or personality description) in the last few episodes and remains weak until the final episode, which was actually quite bothersome, even more so because he is the protagonist. And knowing that even the protagonist gets close to no development at all you can probably guess how much development the side characters get.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 9/10\\n\\n\r\nThe reason I enjoyed it so much must be because I hadn't read the manga at the time seeing as everyone who did seems to either dislike it or plain on hate it. Besides a few issues here and there the anime did a good job and attracted quite a lot of attention as one of the most popular anime's in it's season. And seeing as after I watched I could not get enough of Tokyo Ghoul and started reading the manga and it's sequel and spin-offs etc. I think it's fair to say: job well done!\\n\\n\r\nOverall 7/10\\n\\n\r\nIt's a good anime and that's that, I understand that there are a lot of people who've read the manga first that are disatisfied but I am not one of them. I look forward to the next season but I do hope that they will stick closer to the manga than they did in its first. I would recommend you try watching the anime because it's definitely worth your time and I also recommend reading the manga which is really amazing and feels less rushed. Also the manga is not censored (thank god)\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "\"Some things are better left unsaid\"\r\nI dont' know why, but this quote is implemented into the story of Tokyo Ghoul, literally and practically. I will go in-depth towards this perspective throughout the review but keep in mind I will keep this review short and precise so that you readers can make a choice of either to prioritize this anime over others or to not..\r\nI also will not include a synopsis in this review, because the description of this anime is written on the anime page.\r\nOpinion:\r\nTokyo Ghoul is far more superior than other anime in that it has a solid story and presented it well withinthe two episodes. We get the feeling as if, the main character (Kaneki) is going to turn out like the typical bad ass character. I feel that Kaneki didn't have enough background information and who his mother is. As to the quote I have mentioned above; the quote is said throughout the anime couple of times and you get the image that Tokyo Ghouls creator has lived life that way. I may sound kiddish hear but wait until you watch the anime. \\n\r\nSo let's get into the specifics here shall we?\\n\\n\r\n[\"What are ghouls?\"\\n\r\n\"Why can't ghouls taste human food the same as humans do?\"\\n\r\n\"What is CCG?\"\\n\r\n\"What the hell is a Quinque\"\\n\r\n\"What is with all the wards and fight between Humans and Ghouls?\"]\\n\\n\r\nTokyo Ghoul fails to answer these questions and seems to think the audience will just pick up the answer throughout the show. Nothing important gets background information. The whole concept of Ghouls and their nature and society hasn't been given any screen time and I feel that is what Tokyo Ghoul needed in order to properly build up the climax and plot in order for us audiences to completely be satisfied with the ending. What Tokyo Ghoul needs is a proper background detail of what each and everything is so that we can understand and build emotions to characters. Throughout watching the anime, I didn't get to feel a emotional attachment throughout the characters or even Ghouls; who are supposed to be badass and cool. They didn't have the character development in order to feel that way, and this is what Tokyo Ghoul did wrong. Now I understand, its a 12 ep anime. But I believe they haven't used that 12 ep wisely and just quickly proceeded through the story without having and logic. Now all of this doesn't make this show necessarily a \"bad\" show.  It does have very intriguing action fights which appear from time to time though are very small due to lack of time.\\n\\n\r\nI will now go into the real review containing:\\n\r\nStory|Character|Setting|Animation|Sound|Personal Enjoyment|\\n\\n\\n\r\n~Story~\\n\r\nThe story of Tokyo Ghoul was similar to Parasyte the Maxim who some of you may call Kiseijuu. A protagonist human being invaded by a non-human creature. But in Tokyo Ghoul, it was more of a decision in order to keep Kaneki alive. The story line does pick up well through the end of the anime where all characters are revealed and shown. I think Tokyo Ghoul is far advantageous because the story it has is of it's own kind other than the one similarity of Kiseijuu.  The only problem is that it wasn't delivered quite precisely.\\n\\n\r\n~Character~\\n\r\nWhere the show really doesn't shine is Characters. Not even a tiny bit of screen time for any side characters except if the main character is in the setting. None of the characters have any background details of them and there was no emotional attachment to the characters if one of them end up dying.\\n\\n\r\n~Setting~\\n\r\nNot much to say in this field, except that everything in the setting perspective what though out well. All ghouls in one area (Anteiku) and humans were seperated. It was managed well and there wasn't any problems with switching settings.\\n\\n\r\n~Animation~\\n\r\nReally well done. I loved how they made the uncensored version of this  \\n\r\nanime because it really does give more feelings to this anime. This section is for sure where Tokyo Ghoul excels. Blood and Gore were a part of this anime so if you're a fan of that, you should check this out.\\n\\n\r\n~Sound~\\n\r\nThe opening of this Anime is one of the better ones and believe it or not, I still get goosebumps when Kaneki's hair is flying in the beginning. The ending wasn't too great but that may be because I didn't take time out to actually hear it. The overall sound in this anime isn't something I critiqued often but as far as I remember, it was suitable to the situation and setting so you could say it was well done.\\n\\n\r\n~Personal Enjoyment~\\n\r\nI liked this anime, and some of you may think I don't; but to make reviews, you must look at the anime from a different perspective and pinpoint small flaws and details that could have altered the anime from being different than how it is. I feel Tokyo Ghoul had great potential if they had used their time thinking out each character and took more time to build up the process of Kaneki being a stronger hybrid.\\n\\n\r\nI know this review may have seemed like a rant at the beginning, but I had to let out how I felt after watching this anime, and hopefully you can make a decision to watch this anime or not, or to agree with what I have just said.\\n\\n\r\nThanks for reading!\\n",

            "content": "WTF kind of anime that I just watched?\r\nThat's my reaction after watching the last episode and according to the forum commentators, it was pretty much rushed and they were certainly right. I guess you might said that some manga would have better be left as mangas than be adapted as an anime...that is, if studios such as studio Pierrot won't do it right, so I'm gonna keep my review of this anime simple as I present my ratings for each of this anime's category:\r\nPathetic 1. \r\nStory- it was basically another one of those plot where the protagonist become somewhat of a........let's just say being ableto get intertwine in the middle of two worlds in this case Kaneki being a half ghoul and a half human. What makes it pathetic was how he get to be one, where he almost becomes a monster's snack if not for some weird accident that befalls the monster where she get's killed (where the scenario for the lady ghoul was too stupid to say the least) and the victim (Kaneki) become a victim of the doctor's malpractice where he get's organ transplant from his attacker. Now, this is the part where I would ask as to wtf was this series writer thinking Sui Ishida for coming up with such dorky concept as how Kaneki become a half human/ half ghoul kind of thing? If I were Sui Ishida I probably make Kaneki as some sort of lab experiment that got away, that would have have been cool than some scenario that is too stupid.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall- because it was rushed, it was pretty obvious that studio Pierrot should have extended it up to 20 episode, also we should have seen as to how Amon's rematch with Toka had transpired. Since the anime ended in a sour note, I wouldn't be surprise if the manga only run for about 13 volumes, pretty obvious that the whole series whether it's a manga or anime was more like gore porn than anything else.   \\n\\n\\n\r\nGood 7.\\n\\n\r\nArt- what can I say I love the blood and gore that see in this anime and that's that.\\n\\n\\n\r\nPoor 3.\\n\\n\r\nI don't like the opening and the closing theme, I don't like Kaneki's pussy voice, expect of course for Mado, I like the way that he voice out his pleasure of killing ghouls.\\n\\n\\n\r\nDreadful 2.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter- the reason why I gave it such rating was basically the way on how they were double standardize, now Nishiki Nishio and  Sh\u016b Tsukiyama where suppose to be dead and yet we still see them alive and kicking. Now, if them ghouls can't be killed then Rize Kamishiro should still be alive and them Doves would have been exterminated easily by them ghouls, also how the fuck did a half ghoul like Kaneki become a super ghoul after being tortured by Yakumo? Now he's a half ghoul right? So he should have some form of limitation, so how come he doesn't? I'm guessing that since he is the main protagonist he should come on top which it would be such a pathetic idea coming from series writer Sui Ishida. Now, the only characters that I see whose roles were right are Toka, Mado, Amon and Hinami.\\n\\n\\n\r\nDecent 4.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment- Well it was a bit enjoyable from episode 1 to 11, but the last one was shit all the way, I didn't even get to see Amon's duel with Toka which was a bit disappointing.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

Tbh I wasn't expecting that much from it but entertainment. Didn't think it would be the anime of the season but still a cool thing to watch !\r\nStory: It starts off with that guy getting mixed blood with a ghoul & becoming some kind of half human / half ghoul dude. That part was ok I guess, you kinda think ghouls are gonna be scary etc since they eat humans. But like every ghoul issome kind of emoteen... almost feels like the author thought only gothics could fit the role. \\n\r\nTo be fair I really didn't pay much attention to the story since it was so confusing. Not like complicated or anything but just borrinnnnggg as hell.. \\n\\n\r\nArt: I guess it well animated, I just don't really like the design it's so shonen & basic.. I guess the manga is like that too but it can be fine in animes with an actual PLOT. The art is the best part of the anime though\\n\\n\r\nSound: Wow! Not gonna hate but you really gotta be into that anime opening J-HARD ROCK/METAL kinda music which I really don't feel. It really deserves the DREADFUL 2 I gave it\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: I guess some are bearable, the MC is a whining bitch, dude can't get over being a ghoul. PFFF... I hate that kinda character, just slowing the pace of the story/action bc he keeps whining. If they actually put content every time he was crying the anime would've been a lot better.\\n\r\nMost the bad guys are crazy dudes on LSD / good guys are emos or just regular people.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Can't hate on the action scenes & the art which are the only things making this anime somewhat relevant & watchable.\\n\r\nThe story made no sense, the characters had no depth, the sound was terrible.\\n\\n\r\nBoring show overall, I don't recommend",

            "content": "overview:\r\nEveryone has been saying how Tokyo Ghoul: 2 was a piece of shit, but the first Tokyo Ghoul was a masterpiece. I have a revelation to share with the denizens of MAL. The first Tokyo Ghoul...actually wasn't very good. I'm going to depart from my normal format in order to try something new for me. I will divide the review largely into positives vs. negatives.\r\nSome Spoilers!\r\nBackground: \r\nSometimes a popular trend can go completely out of control and the media becomes hyper-saturated with a particular style or genre. For most people on MAL and 4chan, that evil that must be stomped out is \"Moe\" anime andslice of life shows. For me, it is fucking zombie and vampire media. I feel it has degenerated to a pathetic level that is tiresome, redundant, and as brainless as a zombie itself. I also feel that vampires have been absolutely raped by the likes of Twilight and other bullshit copycats. Tokyo Ghoul isn't Twilight caliber bad, but it IS absurdly overhyped simply because it followed a popular fad. Although ghoul is usually synonymous with zombie, the ghouls in Tokyo Ghoul actually share far more in common with traditional vampires. They are a completely different species that have a human appearance and human intelligence, but can only feed on human flesh and are sickened by other types of food. However, the \"Ghouls\" don't have typical vampire weaknesses and lack most of the powers associated with vampires. Tokyo Ghoul at its core, is a show about the struggle between humanity and the Ghouls, with the main character Ken being a ghoul that fights other ghouls.\\n\\n\r\nPositives: \\n\\n\r\n1. The art is actually quite good. The character designs, animation, and gore are all genuinely well done.\\n\\n\r\n2. The music is not bad, considering it was the composer's first soundtrack and the guy is younger than I am. Even though I'm beginning to grow tired of ominous Latin chanting for EVERY ACTION SCENE EVER! Too bad Carl Orff is dead. I would like to see his reaction to today's soundtracks and ask him if he regrets ever writing Carmina Burana.\\n\\n\r\n3. While it could have done more to build up its world and try re-invent rather than copy other vampire/zombie media, it does offer a few interesting, relatively fresh elements. The main character himself being a badass anti-hero ghoul that fights other ghouls is...sort of interesting. Although considering the ghouls are basically vampires and not zombies, we have seen this before in: Hellsing, Blade, Skyrim, Vampire Hunter D, etc. The ghouls have powers that aren't typically associated with zombies or vampires, which gives us something new to look at. The fact that the vampires fully eat their victims and 1 vampire can eat 11 people or just over 1,000 pounds of flesh in a couple days is...interesting I guess. In most media the undead don't typically have a really high metabolism since they don't generate body heat and lack heartbeats. Cold blooded animals typically need to eat WAY less often than warm blooded animals. At least the show didn't make us watch purple hair moe vampire chick take a several hundred pound dump! That would make this show suck even more than it already does.\\n\\n\r\n4. LOTS of nudity and blood. For some people, that could be a positive.\\n\\n\\n\r\nNegatives:\\n\\n\\n\r\n1. This series is tagged as horror, yet it completely fails as a horror series. It doesn't have ANY concept of how to build tension or create a creepy atmosphere. It just throws gore in your face. The music isn't suitably creepy. Even 11 year olds wouldn't be afraid of this shit!\\n\\n\r\n2. The plot and characters really aren't that good. It is a cheesy, poorly written drama that gets away with the same stuff other series get crucified for, because vampires and zombies are \"Cool\"! Weak characterization, plot convenient amnesia, and poor dialogue are just a sample of the things that Tokyo Ghoul has basically gotten a \"free pass\" on. While it offers a few elements that haven't been done to death, it falls FAR short of the works that actually made a massive impact on the undead horror genre. For example, \"Let the Right One In\" was able to keep vampires as vicious predators, but actually attempted to make the audience feel sympathy for them. It also contained a rather immoral and delightfully dark romance that was basically the anti-Twilight. Attack on Titan took the concept of brainless, stumbling creatures that were once human and live off human flesh, overrunning the human population and driving mankind to the brink of extinction along with all the other zombie apocalypse survival elements, but changed it just enough that most fans don't even realize it IS just another zombie apocalypse show. I don't actually like Attack on Titan, but changing the zombies into retarded giants was kind of a masterstroke of popular fiction writing. It didn't really change anything, but changed the surface texture just enough to trick people into thinking it was something new. By contrast, I don't really have any strong compliments I can give Tokyo Ghoul for its writing.\\n\\n\r\n3. Entertainment is of course a highly subjective category, but I really didn't derive any pleasure at all out of this one. The bloody action didn't really move me, the plot was garbage, the characters are garbage, and it didn't offer anything I really wanted to see. Half the time this series was like reading an old 4chan \"green text\" fanfiction before all the really nasty motherfuckers left to form 4chan's bastard offspring Gurochan. I laughed at horrible fanfiction about hot chicks eating hundreds of pounds of human flesh back in the early 2000s! I don't need to spend 6 hours of my life watching it on the big screen! \\n\\n\r\nTLDR:\\n\\n\r\nTokyo Ghoul wasn't really much better than its shitty sequel. It was an over-hyped, mediocre at best series that largely escaped negative criticism by riding the popularity of undead horror media. This series was a complete and utter waste of time and animation budget.\\n\\n",

            "content": "Oh god this show is impossibly difficult.\r\nOn one hand, it was actually pretty badass. I mean the concept itself is something very appealing to many fans in general, and the manga was already quite well received. But then, once you actually watch the show, all the hype turns into...confusion. Well here it goes, Tokyo Ghoul:\r\nThe show revolves around Kaneki Ken, an introvert who spends all his free time engrossed in literature. By the miraculous hands of the anime gods, he ends up on a date with Kana Hanaz- I mean Kamishiro Rize, a purple haired beauty with the same tastes as him regarding novels andbooks. A few plot points later, and our friend Kaneki turns into a ghoul. Now, ghouls are a huge problem in Japan. They essentially live off of eating humans, and they are hunted by various police investigators, known as \u201cDoves,\u201d who aim to end the ghoul threat once and for all. Now this sounds pretty interesting, and at some points during the show, it genuinely is. For a majority of the show, the issue between the ghouls and doves is a point of high contention, as well as the moral boundaries of the ghouls themselves. Other characters include Kirishima Touka, the other purple haired beauty (ha) that acts as Kaneki's superior in a way, and a varied secondary cast that is really not worth mentioning. This leads me into the main issue with the show.\\n\\n\r\nThe characterization and characters themselves are what drive this show to the ground. Honestly, nobody really gets fleshed out during the period of the show. 12 episodes is generally enough time for this to happen, but Tokyo Ghoul could not accomplish this at all. It force feeds emotional situations down our throats, expecting viewers to sympathize with whomever is having an issue during any particular episode. The problem is, no character is developed to the point where I'd care about them in the first place. Speaking on Kaneki a bit, his characterization is not particularly weak, however, the way the creators went about it was quite counter productive for a show of this type and length- it was not until very later on in the show did we see some real development for him, and by that point, its effectiveness was little at best.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are not the only seemingly lost aspects of the show, as the direction the show wanted to head in was quite skewed. This is a common problem in anime: the show does not know where it wants to go. At one point it will focus on the Ghouls vs. Doves, then it will jump to deep character relations, etc. The problem is none of these individual parts are fleshed out enough for viewers to really understand motivations and enjoy anything. And the ending. It certainly came as a surprise. I have not read a lick of the manga, (which ironically ended the same day as the anime.) therefore, I have no basis of comparison. However, the ending of Tokyo Ghoul is the largest example the skewed directions I just mentioned. It came out of nowhere. Literally nowhere. Everything about the show changed instantly. To be honest, it would have been enjoyable if the show gave itself time to get to the point. However, it fails in this regard as well.\\n\\n\r\nAs a positive, the show for the most part, looks great. Ghoul forms are  uniquely designed, and overall quality is medium-high. The show is not consistently good looking however, as many have pointed out. Animation can also be a bit wonky, but for the most part, is solid. This may deter a bit visually, however compared to the story flop, it is quite minimal. Sound wise, the show performs quite well. The OP and ED are simply superb, the OP being one of my favorites for the Summer 2014 season. The BGM did its job well, especially during the final episodes of the show. The sound, and to a lesser extend, animation and art, are strong points for this show.\\n\\n\r\nFinishing Tokyo Ghoul, I really didn't know how to react. Honestly, I liken this show to Evangelion in many ways, for those of you who have seen it. However, this show fails on so many basic levels, that it simply does not deserve a solid score. However, if you do choose to watch regardless, it is highly recommended to wait for the BDS, as the show is quite censored in the visual department for blood and gore. I don't necessarily regret watching this show, but could it have been done better? Hell yes.\\n\\n\r\nHave fun.\\n",

            "content": "What do you get when you have X men meet Resident Evil? That would be Tokyo Ghoul.\r\nTokyo Ghoul is an anime that contained a large amount of hype stemming from those who have read the manga, and for good reasons too. The premise would sound very enthralling and interesting to those who are in love with the supernatural and psychological genres of fiction, like myself. Since the show also throws in a high dosage of fast-paced graphic violence here and there along with a good soundtrack, you pretty much have the most entertaining show of this season, right!? Wrong. What makes Tokyo Ghoul a below-averageshow at best comes from its mediocre job of the most vital components that a show must have: the story, the pacing, and its themes. Instead, Tokyo Ghoul feels like a rushed adaptation of what seems to be a promising and worthwhile story. While its music and most of its characters are well-developed, the show suffers from an incredibly poor direction. \\n\\n\r\nWhat Tokyo Ghoul fails to do with its story is provide a coherent focus on what it wants to show you. Essentially, the story is about a college student named Ken Kaneki who tries to find his place in a world that is full of violence and hate. The cause of this violence and hate come from those known as ghouls, who are biologically-evolved humans that feed off of other humans. Long story short, Kaneki, due to a horrific accident, becomes a half human, half ghoul and must learn to live in a society that offers tranquility to humans but hatred and oppression towards ghouls. While the synopsis and exposition for the show are delivered very well, experiencing the bulk of the story will make you feel as though it is ultimately unorganized and messy. The reason for this comes from the extremely awkward pacing and the overbearing focus on subplots that feel completely unnecessary and very rushed, causing you to question the choice of direction for the show. \\n\\n\r\nWhat also makes the story of this show mediocre comes not from the main character Kaneki, but rather from the supporting cast of characters and the been-there-done-that tropes connected with them. I honestly don't think that I'm lying when I say that Tokyo Ghoul probably has one of the most boring and predictable cast supporting of characters you can view in an anime today. The presentation of the many different characters isn't the problem I had with them. The central problem came from the fact that each and every one of the supporting characters' actions are completely predictable along with their personalities. For example, the character Nishiki is the obvious hotheaded male who will always react to an insult that you can find in many different anime's. The character known as Hide represents the all-to-familiar obnoxiously loud friend of the protagonist of an anime. Kaneki, while being a pretty decent protagonist, also shows many tropes that many should already be accustomed to in other shows, the most notable being the frightened and soft-spoken character who always needs to get pushed around in order to do something, which is what the majority of his scenes in the anime involve. However, like I said, Kaneki is still much more enjoyable and developed than the show's various characters that seem unique at a first glance, but quickly become easy to read.\\n\\n\r\nWhat's also disappointing about Tokyo Ghoul is not only its disjointed pacing and focus of characters, but also its focus on the different genres it tries to become. While researching Tokyo Ghoul for the first time, one would notice that it is described as a psychological action mystery with horror elements thrown in it. The problem is that the show lies many times about the genres it delves into, with the exception of action and drama. In terms of the psychological aspects of the show, the first and last episodes are literally the only episodes that contain a well done manner of psychological elements, while the other episodes of the show completely forget about the psychological aspects that were being shown previously in favor of flashy action and very cheesy comedy that will sometimes appear in various episodes. Because of these irritations, the show has a hard time figuring out its identity for a genre for it to fall under. \\n\\n\r\nAlthough I said that the flashy action takes away the psychological/suspense aspects of the show, I must admit that I would be lying if I said that the action is mediocre. What makes the action in Tokyo Ghoul so damn good is not just the fact that it is both thrilling and fast, but it's also because of the music and art that make it even more exciting. The soundtrack of the show is incredibly addicting and perfectly fuses in with the action on screen. The visuals are also breathtaking to look at, especially from the many transformations and horrific, yet beautiful, mutations of the characters who are ghouls. The one annoyance that you shall find with the show's action, however, is undoubtedly its heavy censoring. I can understand that Tokyo Ghoul is a story that involves a plethora of gore, but the show is censored to the point of it looking like as though it's rated PG. \\n\\n\r\nTokyo Ghoul is an anime that ultimately does not feel as though it is has a clear pathway for what it's trying to show you. The pacing is disgruntled and suffers from focusing on too many different plot points in only a total of twelve episodes. Majority of the characters in the show are predictable and boring with their actions and how their personality is presented to you. The question is, is Tokyo Ghoul worth the watch? To this I would answer, yes it is. While aspects such as the pacing and censoring can be annoying, Tokyo Ghoul still manages to offer up some very impressive world-building and exposition while trying its best to stay focused on its story. The action and music in the show is also some of the best that you can find in an anime this year. Overall, Tokyo Ghoul is a show that shows much potential for improvements, but still proves to be a fun ride for those who love aesthetically directed action and minor psychological elements, all under twelve episodes.  \\n",

But behind the fact, Tokyo Ghoul have a various lack in their performance.\r\nThe story told us about Kaneki Ken, a boy who accidentally turned into a Ghoul. Ghoul is a man-eating monster that founded in Islamic Folklore. At first, Tokyo Ghoul seems so promising many things, but in the reality, it failed. The story has a relatively slow pacing, for example in one episode only happened a few events only. And sometimesa dull feeling occurs in the story. The other problem that occurs is the is the individual elements of the story is not going so well, the mystery is relatively predictable, the battle scenes is decent and over-simplistic.  The plot seems not focusing on the main story, it spews out everywhere like a juice. The anime have a decent and fair enjoyment.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation seems decent, with a combination of typical battle scenes and common battle effect.  Also, there are some \u2018gore\u2019 scenes that been censored, it really reduce the horror feeling of the story. While the sound settings are good, Opening Songs is good and tolerated and the seiyuu did a fairly good job.\\n\\n\r\nThe character of Tokyo Ghoul done their roles pretty well. There is some scene that conducts some development, but despite that, the main problem that occurs is the lack of the main character development. Why? Because it feels very forced and far-fetched.  The characters have developed but not relate the development with the story itself. Also, the motive of the villain is very notional and still abstract.   \\n\\n\r\nTokyo Ghoul maybe breaks the watching list of 2014, the anime have a relatively rare settings but have many flaw and mistakes. Is it good\u2026\u2026..? or bad\u2026\u2026?. The answer lies in the center\u2026",

            "content": "Remember when you were little and you tried to bake that really awesome cake following the instructions on a cooking-book and ended up forgetting half the ingredients or using the wrong ones and the cake looked like complete shit and shit was all over the kitchen and then your mother walked in and slapped you across the face? Whether or not you remember, if you can picture that scenario then you can picture how Studio Pierrot's attempt at adapting Tokyo Ghoul into an anime unfolded. \r\nLets actually start off with the \"good\" in Tokyo Ghoul. Why? Because it's one sentence long so lets get itout of the way shall we.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is decent. The opening theme is good, and the ending theme is pretty catchy. Ok so that was two sentences. \\n\\n\r\nI'm going to fess up now and admit that I have not read the manga although I'm aware that it's a lot better and that they crammed 60 chapters into 12 episodes. This review will be based on the anime alone, which I believe is more correct then the people giving this adaption a break solely for their admiration of the manga. \\n\\n\r\nThe worst aspect of Tokyo Ghoul are the characters and their development. Frankly I'm not going to talk about any of the characters aside from Kaneki because there is nothing to say about them after 12 episodes.\\n\r\nKaneki is worth talking about because he is a boy born with a vagina..oh and he is a also a half-ghoul, almost forgot about that. As the MC of Tokyo Ghoul, Kaneki's main role is to disappoint us to death, cry a lot, and bitch a lot about how much he sucks.\\n\\n\r\nWith the characters being so dreadful, the anime relied heavily on the plot and the violence. The plot is very broad in the anime: Humans vs Ghouls and Ghouls vs Ghouls. At least that's what I got from 12 episodes adapted from 60 chapters. The violence is censored so that sucks, but apparently the DVD versions will be uncensored..cool, anyways moving on. The most pretentious thing about Tokyo Ghoul are the attempts at emotionally moving the audience by having some characters we know nothing about die and seeing other characters feel sad while the soundtrack playing assures us that this is indeed meant to be an emotional scene...awkward.\\n\\n\r\n So about right now you're probably thinking to yourself that I don't have much to say about this anime. I just felt like reviewing this anime cause I wanted to write down that whole baking a cake comparison after which my passion ran out. This is much like the folks at Studio Pierrot. They had no passion whatsoever in the making of this anime, taking advantage of the fact that the manga is extremely popular and doing the most minimalist job possible. \\n\\n\r\nWith all this I thought I would take joy in witnessing how badly this train-wreck could end, and to my surprise they actually took that pleasure from me as well. The last 10 minutes of the last episode were legitimately entertaining. Right at the end, the show introduced moral ideas worthy of involving the audience and I found myself enjoying Tokyo Ghoul for the first time. What a bunch of trolls eh. \\n\\n\\n",

Well recently that idea has been done a lot, out of most of the things that have done this idea recently, Parasyte is the only one that succeeds in doing it well, Beside it is this mess. Tokyo Ghoul, when I saw this showI thought it was gonna be some generic mystery show and when I started watching it......it was a generic x-men idea show, how wonderful? And guess what?It became popular and people praised it, now I'm currently taking my time reading the manga (which is better than this) so I won't be mentioning it. \\n\\n\r\nStory: 3.7/10\\n\r\nSo in this world there are entities known as 'Ghouls' who feed off human corpses and drink coffee. Yes, coffee. So one day a freshman college student goes out with some girl and it turns out, SHE'S A GHOUL! DUN DUN DUN DUUUUUUUUN!!!! So after an accident before getting eaten, doctors thought it was such a smart idea (not) to take the ghoul's organs and stuff them into our MC. What happens? The MC is know a half ghoul, half human and struggles to maintain each side.\\n\\n\r\nCool idea right? Well you're wrong, the show fails to make the plot understandable, its such a mess, the reason why is that it never explains jackshit. For example, how do people turn into ghouls? What the hell is a ward? How do ghouls drink coffee but nothing else except water? What is this world? and so on. The show does the thing were it tries to solve everything in just 12 episodes, and this show fails it miserably, this show needs 24 episodes to space everything out, everything feels so rushed, cause of this it leads to the plotholes and cause of the plotholes its more confusing. I'll give it points for its idea but thats it.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 4/10\\n\r\nOur MC  is Kaneki, I talked about him in my story segment, here I'll say whats good about him and whats bad. Now the good is we find out his life is pretty tragic, his mom dies as a kid, he can't eat normal anymore, it really makes you feel for him. The way he tries to keep his humanity and ghoulness is so well done and I give prontos to that. The bad side, the show hardly focuses on him, it tries to focus more on the world around him, this is really the main sector of why everything is messy. Cause of this Kaneki feels more like a plot-device more than anything.\\n\\n\r\nNow the other characters, there isn't really much to say about them, there's Touka, there is meant to be some development between her and Kaneki but there isn't, its like the show is saying, hey look developme- NOPE FUCK YOU! As soon as the development can happen its just vanishes. This leads to so much under-development.\\n\\n\r\nThe other characters, there isn't really much to them and usually don't matter to the plot at all, there's so many chances for some good development and the show fucks that up too.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9/10\\n\r\nOk now the music, is just....epic. Its really well done and is so memroble. The OP, I don't know what to say. It is amazing and it looks at how ghouls and humans are equal and makes you question yourself and humanity? Are monsters really created by humans? The ED, is pretty meh. And thats really it for sound.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 6/10\\n\r\nThe art is pretty OK with some really well done backgrounds that shine, I'd give it a 7, but I won't cause of something in the animation which actually made me want to drop the show and its.....Censoring. There's a lot of blood in this show and it tries to censor it, but it does it so poorly, it uses black bars to censor things, it literally blackens nearly the whole screen and you wonder what the fuck is going on?\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 5/10\\n\r\nWelp really, the only reason I didn't drop this was cause of its action scenes and litlle cliffhangers at the end of each episode. The action scenes are really well done and put you on the edge of your seat. The cliffhangers, man these cliffhangers are a reason to continue the show, they usually leave big ones making you what to see what happens next. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 4.5/10\\n\r\nThis show is a mess, it has some well done music and thats the best thing it has to offer, the rest is just either poorly done or rushed. This show could have been something really good but it falls on its ass everytime it has a chance. The ending is a cliffhanger which is just a cheap move and a reason to watch Season 2. I don't really reccomend this, shows that have done a better job of this are Parasyte which is STILL ONGOING (by the time this review is posted) and Tokyo Esp which is an OK show, its more light-hearted but it does a much better job than this. Tokyo Ghoul is meh. I'm out.",

            "content": "Horror movies are amusing at times to watch. Sure, their intent is to strike fear into viewers but most times, they are so predictable and saturated with tropes that it almost seems like a cruel joke. Tokyo Ghoul doesn\u2019t derive far from that. Despite being much longer than a typical horror movie, the series plays around with itself so much that it almost becomes a laughter stock. Don\u2019t get me wrong though. The intriguing idea of supernatural creatures known as \u2018ghouls\u2019 living among human communities is quite well-built when it comes with premise. However, the show ultimately kills itself with its execution. Based off ofthe manga of the same name, I can say that they are almost like two different worlds.\\n\\n\r\nThe brainchild of Tokyo Ghoul is Sui Ishida as his first original work. Like the title implies, the series follows the idea of ghouls living among human population in Tokyo. They are regarded as savages and killers of injustice. News reports often sends the message that all ghouls must be eradicated in order for the world to be at peace. It becomes a near totalitarian-like state as the ghouls finds themselves at constant struggle for survival. If you don\u2019t believe me, just ask Ken Kaneki. The young boy has a dark secret after one day as he comes face to face with the horror of reality.\\n\\n\r\nAsk yourself first though: is Tokyo Ghoul a good adaptation of a horror story? At first, it does seem so with the premise. The first episode crafts the image well with the innocent Kaneki and his puppy crush on another woman named Rize. What comes next is a big surprise for him as his life spins out of control. This might be a surprise for him but is far too predictable for the viewers\u2019 eyes to see. The beautiful girl with the mysterious aura, dark alley, and morbid news near Kaneki\u2019s community should have all been hints that something terrible would happen to the boy soon. And exactly like that, Kaneki\u2019s life is no longer human as he becomes part ghoul in Tokyo. \\n\\n\r\nDespite being part ghoul, the show sends the message that Kaneki wishes to live as a human instead. His love for literature and struggle to contain his appetite are proof of this. Emphasizing on his human traits, Kaneki fights against his gluttonous desire to consume human flesh. No matter how great the temptation is, we see how determined the kid to retain his humanity. This conventional idea isn\u2019t uncommon at all though. Other series such as Claymore and Shiki also have similar ideas. Unfortunately, Tokyo Ghoul doesn\u2019t develop this idea all too well. For instance, can we really sympathize with Kaneki? While he is a good role model for others, some of his roles in this adaptation are questionable. Furthermore, we don\u2019t really know much about the young boy such as his backstory. Taking a closer glance at his character, Kaneki is more like a plot device himself to steer the engine of the premise. In retrospect, Kaneki is an underdeveloped character with minimal characterization and lack of focus. The mask he wear is a motif to his character but the anime adaptation neglects its value. \\n\\n\r\nSome focus are put together with the other characters throughout the show such as Toka Kirishima, a young girl and also a ghoul dubbed as \u201cThe Rabbit\u201d. Other ghouls entering the story includes Nishiki NIshio, Hinami Fuegushi, Yoshimura, Gourmet, and among others. The funny thing about them is that despite being the ghouls, most of them are presented as protagonists while fighting for survival. It\u2019s clear that society misunderstands them because of their gluttonous appetite for meat. Then, there\u2019s also the Aogiri Tree that fits the profile that society that describes them as \u2013 brutal, violent, and craving to satisfy themselves. On the other hand, there\u2019s the CCG, a Ghoul Investigation agency dedicated to battle against ghouls. I wouldn\u2019t necessarily call them antagonists since their purpose is to secure the safety of the public. However, they do come head and head against Kaneki and the others. The consequence includes grief on both sides as they lose important people. It pinpoints the fact that lives are very fragile that can be taken away so easily whether you are a human or a ghoul.\\n\\n\r\nA prominent character in CCG is Amon. Despite not being the main focus of the show, we find out about him more than almost any other character. These include his partnership with professional ghoul hunter Mado, his past, and how he became who he is today. Serving as a determined man, he has some similarities and differences with Kaneki. They both fight for what they believe in but with very different motivations.  But taking for granted, Amon can be considered a breakout character compared to others. The sad part is that he is perhaps one of the only character that some of us can relate to. Others such as Touka just lacks any distinctive traits or characterization for us to get to know well. Oh and don\u2019t bother asking about Rize. Despite her being the main reason of Kaneki\u2019s change, the show neglects to focus on her as a character at all and only shows her influence through the show in ridiculous diehard ways.\\n\\n\r\nSeveral consideration should also be considered as the show explores prejudice, morality, and identity. Apparently, the public shows fear of the ghouls so the show wastes no time to label them as pure monsters. But ask yourself this: should all ghouls be considered as monsters? This can be controversial as some ghouls truly are unredeemable while others such as Kaneki and Nishiki have human values. Then, there\u2019s the identity issue with various characters. Kaneki struggles to battle this the hardest out of any other character as he adapts to his new life. He must hide his ghoul tendencies from his neighbors, teachers, and even his best friend Hide. While all this seems to strike keen interest, it just feels repetitive and quickly grows old. The show just tries far too had when attempting to get viewers to realize what Kaneki strives to be.\\n\\n\r\nNow comes perhaps the worst part of the show: the adaptation of the story. The craftsmanship had the right source material but it didn\u2019t know what to do with it. Studio Pierrot failed to deliver a faithful adaptation with both the characters and the story. There\u2019s little development with any of the characters and fails to achieve adequate accuracy with the main story. The main story cuts off important parts that were hugely influential to certain outcomes. It lacks credible built-up, has a poor execution, and is ultimately beyond salvage at a certain point. For the characters, most of them suffer from development and characterization. While we can feel sympathetic at times, it\u2019s hard to relate to them at all. Most of them aren\u2019t good role models besides Kaneki. Furthermore, the relationship he builds with others is vaguely expressed. Touka often gets into arguments with Kaneki while Nishiki picks on him as a weakling. Hinami\u2019s relationship with Kaneki has some innocence to it but really lacks compatibility. There\u2019s also a sense of hate between some ghouls but most of this is degenerated to weak expression because of its pacing. In retrospect, this adaptation lies in the ruins.\\n\\n\r\nDespite all this, Tokyo Ghoul is a horror fest when it comes to action. The artwork of the series is done well visually to capture the gruesome moments in the ghoul world. Speaking of which, the ghouls themselves are designed with monstrous traits such as their razor sharp teeth, scarlet eyes, and body structure. The ghoul\u2019s predatory organ known as the Kagune is designed to look artistically endearing with blood-like muscles. Although the show doesn\u2019t focus too much on the mechanics, it\u2019s easy to tell that they are a race to be feared. Likewise, most of the other character designs are designed with accuracy. I say this because of their ability to blend in with human society despite being ghouls. Just take a good look at Nishiki. The background and dark chilling atmosphere also has noir-like feeling to provoke power. Overall action coordination remains top notch with cinematic battles scenes from start to finish. I just hope the BDs will remove the horrid censorship from the TV series.\\n\\n\r\nOn the soundtrack front, the show\u2019s delivery is effective. It shows enough ways to get most of the job done. In fact, the very first minutes of the series wastes little time with its high volume of violence. The haunting tones strikes fear with both wish-fulfillment brutality and chaos. Voice expressions too crafts the imagery of our characters\u2019 struggles. I also give credit to Kana Hanazawa who is able to play the character Rize. She was able to convey the character as a graceful beauty until her true visage is revealed. Others such as Toka and Gourmet have distinctive ways of speaking similar to those of a tomboy and aristocrat respectfully. Finally, the OP and ED songs are beautiful and well decorated. \\n\\n\r\nTo say the least, Tokyo Ghoul is an adaptation gone wrong when it comes to story and characters. The way it is adapted is a degeneration of its original source. But if you\u2019re coming in as an anime original viewer, then this show might be something to take a keen interest on especially when it comes to the cinematic battles. The first episode will hook you in but the rest of them lacks that sort of development. Although there are some occasional comedy, the majority of the show takes itself seriously, perhaps sometimes for its own good. I wouldn\u2019t call Tokyo Ghoul a hollow shell of what it should be though. Rather, it\u2019s more of an adaptation that should have been handled differently. VERY differently.\\n",

            "content": "Prior knowledge\r\nManga: None\r\nTokyo Ghoul is one of the more hyped up anime this season for a number of reasons. Mainly because it was, as I have heard, a very popular manga. The premise itself is easy to follow. The world is inhabited by two types of people: regular people and ghouls who eat people as a source of food. The main character, Kaneki Ken, after almost being killed by a ghoul is turned into a half ghoul-half human hybrid. By this time, I, who has not read the manga, assumed the show would explore the morality of and question the prejudice between the two groupsusing the MC as a focal perspective. While at the same time having some kickass fight sequences.\\n\\n\r\nBoy was I wrong.\\n\\n\r\nStory \u2013 6/10\\n\\n\r\nFor the most part, Tokyo Ghoul\u2019s storytelling was decent. It explored the different aspects of the ghoul community and made its point simple and concise. Although that\u2019s about it. There isn\u2019t anything too fancy or well done with its storytelling. Tokyo Ghoul is quick to establish the lore with the Wards (sectors), the Doves (anti ghoul police), and different types of ghouls. This last point emphasized by Anteiku and it\u2019s here that Kaneki spends most of his time deliberating between his new and unique situation. The plot itself didn\u2019t seem to be headed in any clear direction, but splits itself into different \u2018mini-plots\u2019 (similar to different story arcs in the manga) as Kaneki observes the different ghouls coming in and out of the cafe, and learns their own perspective of being a ghoul. While this in itself is fine, it creates other problems for character development and overall pacing. This is clear at the show\u2019s 9th episode when there is a ghoul invasion in one of the other wards. It\u2019s clear that this is the climax of the show, yet it feels blatantly out of place from the \u2018mini-arc\u2019 format the show was using so far. There was hardly any buildup leading up to the massive invasion and the last 4 episodes seemed to compress as much content as possible by amping up the pace, shown by the sudden high stakes and side characters being quickly introduced. It\u2019s clear the ending was very rushed. Simply put, the show\u2019s plot lacked focus. It did not take advantage of the interesting premise they had to work with. \\n\\n\r\nArt \u2013 8/10\\n\\n\r\nI don\u2019t have any complaints here. The animation is slick and smooth. The (very few) fights and battles are nice to watch. The weapons, qunique and kagune, were an interesting concept for the show and there were enough different types to show off. The show tended to lean toward more vivid colours in its art style and wasn\u2019t afraid to use its full range of colours which I thought was a good decision for the show to make. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters themselves are distinct from one another in their art design and colour and I particularly liked how a character\u2019s colour was associated with their personality. It\u2019s a welcome change from other anime where characters look way too similar to one another. The OP and ED sequences were great to watch and is one of the few shows where I don\u2019t skip its sequences. I especially like theme of contrast and reflection used in the OP.\\n\\n\r\nSound \u2013 8/10\\n\\n\r\nThere wasn\u2019t anything wrong with Tokyo Ghoul\u2019s sound direction. Overall effects in fight scenes were synced well and so was background noise. Each character had their own defined voice and the voice acting complimented well with the art and colour style. That is to say, their voices were a little more on the melodramatic side. But it was used to good effect in presenting their own personalities and character. The OP and ED are both fantastic and fit well into the tone of the show, or rather the tone the show was trying to show.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter \u2013 5/10\\n\\n\r\nHere is where Tokyo Ghoul suffers from the most and ultimately hinders enjoyment of the show. The show has a lot of side characters. A new character is introduced maybe every 1 to 2 episodes and none of these characters get enough screentime and character development. The fault of this is partly due to its 1-cour situation, but it\u2019s also because of the mini-plot format of the show. A new character is introduced who interacts with Kaneki in some way before being pushed to the sidelines a couple of episodes later and a new character takes the stage. There is barely any exposition for the side characters and the way they were simply dumped to the side until the climax arc in the 9th episode was simply lazy.\\n\\n\r\nThe main characters themselves are regrettably 2-dimensional. Kaneki\u2019s initial panic with his newfound situation was acceptable at first but he never grew out of his timidness despite the abundant characters and small setting he was confined to. Unfortunately, the lack of development for the side characters also meant Kaneki\u2019s character development also suffered as a result. Kaneki himself always seems to be in helpless situations which he can\u2019t get out of. The only ounce of character development is during Hinami\u2019s arc in Episode 3 where he sees that there are ghouls who don\u2019t wish to kill people. His entire character is just a tease to the final episode when he goes all badass. And even that in itself is a disappointment. That wasn\u2019t what I wanted to see from the show at all. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment \u2013 6/10\\n\\n\r\nI can tell you this. If you switch off your brain you\u2019ll most likely enjoy this show. It doesn\u2019t do anything new or unique within its own genre. Battles are cool. Characters are predictable and the setting is interesting enough. But if you\u2019re looking for something of a higher quality caliber, then this show isn\u2019t it. I was strung along the entire show thinking \u2018this next episode is going to have more action\u2019 or \u2018this time Kaneki is going to do something\u2019. The entire time the show left me with blue balls just waiting for the moment the show would present some sort of meaningful sequence or a badass fight scene. I was sorely disappointed. The final episode had some element of the exploration of morality and choice and it was at a level I was satisfied with, and something I expected to see from the first episode. Yet this wasn\u2019t the case.\\n\\n\r\nBut hey, if anything else it was a decent Thursday night filler show. Better than Glasslip that\u2019s for sure. The final episode did have me on edge, even if the characters are 2-dimensional, the execution and presentation of the final episode was able to convey a suspenseful tone which regrettably did not appear in any of the other episodes. I suppose its simply another typical shounen anime.\\n\\n\r\nOverall \u2013 6/10\\n\\n\r\nI\u2019ll admit to enjoying it enough. It wasn\u2019t anything special in the end but it\u2019s a decent show to watch if you\u2019re looking for something to pass the time. If you were expecting any level of depth then you definitely won\u2019t find it here. As explained before, the show had a lot of potential in presenting the different aspects and perspective between ghouls and humans and failed to capitalize. Unfortunately, in the end the show is average at best. It wasn\u2019t the fault of the staff entirely as it could have benefited from more episodes, but the adaptation of the source material was mismanaged. For all its visual style it could not save the show from its muddled storytelling.\\n\\n\r\nThis is my first review. Feedback is welcome. A more detailed review can be viewed at my blog!",

Tokyo Ghoul is one of the best anime this season and it is sure to keep you on your toes. Withits darkness and gore most likely to attract gore fans but it can be equally enjoyed by anyone.\\n\r\n Although the concept of getting new powers and meeting a whole different kind of people is not new to anime, but Tokyo Ghoul executes it in a very efficient manner. It focuses on the point that there is no clear distinction between good and evil and it all depends on perspectives. In a deeper sense, it reminds us that we should not jump to conclusions without considering the circumstances and difficulties faced by the others.\\n\\n\r\nThe only disappointment is some censoring in a few scenes but it is overshadowed by the awesomeness of this show.Overall a very enjoyable anime, Art is crisp and up-to-date, sound effects and OP/Ending are amazing, characters are unique and interesting.\\n\\n\r\nA must watch for gore and thriller fans.",

            "content": "First review on MAL:\r\nTokyo Ghoul is a dark fantasy and seinen anime adaptation of the manga made by Ishida Sui, and the TV anime was produced by Studio Pierrot containing 12 episodes. There are also some horror elements, but they aren't that present on the animation.\r\nThe main character of the story is Kaneki Ken, an ordinary college student, and his life changes when he meets Rize at the caf\u00e9 he frequents with his college friend Hide. Little did he know that she is actually a Ghoul, a carnivorous species only able to feed on humans and even other ghouls too, and during the night, heis attacked and almost got killed and eaten by her. He got saved by an emergency operation, when he got ghouls organs transplanted into his body. \\n\\n\r\nBasically he became a half-ghoul half-human, or, like many people say, one eyed Ghoul.. then the struggle and the tragedies start for him since he is now inserted into the ghoul world. \\n\\n\r\nAnyway, how is it? Well, the anime has a promising start in the first episode (usually I would be complaining about the censorship, which is indeed weird, but there are the uncensored episodes available already since a long time already) and at first, as an anime-only watcher or not, you will be looking forward to the storyline, although... Pierrot simply rushed the anime A LOT, skipped so many things and they even changed the order of some events (manga readers know what I mean), which is... really disappointing. \\n\\n\r\nAlso, the studio tried TOO HARD when they made Kaneki expressing his emotions and his struggle while he became a half-ghoul, even though he did some work there, the anime made him look like someone who mostly cries and keeps whining a lot until a certain point, so yeah, he looked like a wimp unfortunately, and there wasn't much development along with the evolution and progress on Kaneki unlike on the manga where these were strong points of his character... his characterization had many problems too. Yes, he suffered a lot with the anime changes on his character.\\n\\n\r\nNot to mention other scenes that they did some weird changes especially on some fights and some censored scenes during the time that the anime was airing, some scenes were so hard to understand to guess what was happening. \\n\r\nThankfully the Blu-ray came out on Japan and you can check out the uncensored episodes already since they are available on the internet. \\n\\n\r\nNow, talking about the animation, you will probably enjoy the quality on it during some fights, even if there are some awkward and sloppy moments on the animation quality like it happens on other animes from studio Pierrot. The kagunes and the quinques were well made though, especially the first one... to be honest, some kagunes (including mainly the Ukaku from Touka) were even beautiful to watch. The animation during the episodes isn't particularly that amazing and the exception happens mostly on the fights or important scenes, so they actually did well on the animation there. \\n\\n\r\nThe story itself is actually pretty interesting and there is a lot of potential on it, and it's nice to see how it shows the perspective from both sides, Ghouls and the humans too, especially on the investigators from the CCG (Commission of Counter Ghoul), it explores characters from both of these sides, which is really interesting, it makes you wonder which side was like the right one and who are the monsters, it makes you wonder a lot about those details, since you will eventually see that not every single Ghoul is evil, and also that the human side also got some bad people, and it gives many possibilities on the storyline but there aren't enough episodes to explore it pretty well, and the studio didn't focus so much on these concepts and ideals involving humans and ghouls, they just jumped into the violent scenes and the action. \\n\r\nAnd unfortunately, 12 episodes means that you won't really see a developed plot and character development wasn't the best thing since the story was sooo fast paced and rushed by the studio, and you couldn't really know much about the characters or get attached to them, except for a few ones who got more screen time. \\n\r\nAlso, after the first episode, the events there felt like all over the place sometimes. However, the 2nd half of the first season was more entertaining, especially the last episode.\\n\\n\r\nThe original soundtrack and the voices of the characters on the anime are great though (especially on Kaneki, his voice actor did an amazing job, and other characters like Touka, and Tsukiyama too, which made his scene even more hilarious... and weird too). I must admit, they did a pretty good job at the soundtrack aspect of the anime. And yes, the opening song of Tokyo Ghoul, Unravel is so addictive and it fitted perfectly on every aspect with the anime... just like the ending, Seijatachi. Anyway, the music was a good thing on the anime, it did fit pretty well, and OP and ED are pretty catchy. \\n\\n\r\nAs you can see, I made some complaints regarding the anime and its studio ruining some aspects of the adaptation while I tried to not compare too much with the manga (it was inevitable though), but... I must say, it was kind of enjoyable for me when I was new to the series, it had potential like I said, but the feeling that you will get after finishing the first season is that it could have been sooo much better, and there could have been more explanations with many elements of the series like the Kagunes and the RC Cells who were skipped, along with the development of the storyline and the characters... it's like throwing the whole potential away. \\n\\n\r\nYou can clearly notice in the anime that Pierrot didn't pull out so much effort and their budget wasn't really the best (there is a reason why many people had bigger enjoyment with the first and episode 12, since it looked like they invested a lot more on these two episodes) while they made that first season. \\n\r\nSometimes even I imagine that Pierrot just wanted to do that shounen treatment at Tokyo Ghoul's anime since they didn't have the best idea in how to make an adaptation. It even felt like an insult or a disrespect towards most of the manga fans/manga readers, since that first season felt like a prototype version of the manga storyline. I do hope that the anime will be remade in the future and do justice to be as great as the manga.\\n\\n\r\nIs the anime enjoyable after all? Well, if you are new to the series, give it a try... you can either love, or see its potential and wonder how it could have been then watch season 2, and check out the manga to see that potential being developed to something amazing, or then hate it due to what the studio did on that adaptation.",

            "content": "**SPOILER FREE REVIEW**\r\nTokyo Ghoul can be summed up using the same three points that just about every other overhyped adaptation of an unfinished manga series ends up falling under:\r\n1.\tIncomplete (ends dissatisfyingly with almost nothing resolved)\r\n2.\tUndeveloped characters (because they were written to have nearly 100x the screen/page time as they ended up having)\r\n3.\tMediocre plot (because it was written to be nearly 100x as long)\r\nIn other words, Tokyo Ghoul is a commercial for its manga. Watching it as an anime is almost entirely devoid of purpose (and no, I haven\u2019t read the manga).\r\nSynopsis: In a world where mysterious beings called \u201cghouls\u201d, people who can eat nothing excepthuman meat, must live along side humans, there is a fierce ongoing war between the two groups. Ken Kaneki, our protagonist, finds himself experiencing ghoul-like urges shortly after an accident, leading him to eventually discover that he has become a half-human half-ghoul.\\n\\n\r\nThe premise of Toyko Ghoul is very, very straightforward, and that is not necessarily a bad thing. It\u2019s easy to understand and easy to follow, so therefore it should be able to deliver entertainment easily, right? Well, not so much, and that can be chalked up something I already touched on; incomplete manga adaptations don\u2019t go anywhere. From the beginning to the end, Tokyo Ghoul comically tries to cram an entire manga\u2019s worth of subplots, side characters, and blood/gore into their show all the while attempting to have a coherent plot. Unsurprisingly, this fails. To its credit though, the anime has a great stretch of episodes where it focuses on the similarities between the ghouls and ghoul hunters, demonstrating that they are really quite similar. This makes the show morally grey and adds a significant layer of intrigue to both the plot and the characters. However, it manages to completely contradict and ultimately ruin itself by creating completely one-dimensional, obviously evil, totally unrealistic antagonists. One in particular, a man who calls himself \u201ca gourmet\u201d, is so stupidly over the top and exaggerated that it becomes impossible to take the conflict of the show seriously. It clashes with the stronger aspects of the story and ultimately hurts the narrative. The plot can be suspenseful at times, but it is also a combination of melodrama and a serious lack of direction. The clich\u00e9 \u201clast second save\u201d plot convenience is nearly an every-other episode occurrence, for example, making the plot even harder to take seriously. Occasionally, it comes across as just cheap violence that\u2019s only edgy for the sake of being edgy. In short, the plot is just overall unrewarding.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters, as previously mentioned, show great potential for development. There is a lot of framework set up for most cast members to become tremendously written, dynamic characters. Unfortunately, this is a 12 episode adaptation of an incomplete manga, so none of that development is ever seen. Really, I don\u2019t think anything else needs to be said. There is an undeniable disconnect between the adaptation and the source material due to the incomplete nature of the narrative. At least one entire dimension is missing entirely, and that greatly prevents Tokyo Ghoul from being an enjoyable show. Top that off with the bad written and laughably stupid villains and you get a severely underwhelming group of characters.\\n\\n\r\nTo complete circle of disappointment that is Tokyo Ghoul, I give you the animation. Don\u2019t get me wrong; it looks pretty damn good, y\u2019know, when I can actually tell what the hell is going on. There is an absolutely ludicrous amount of the least subtle censorship I\u2019ve ever seen in an anime and it is unbelievably aggravating. Few things grind my gears as much as unnecessary censorship, and it left me with an amazingly sour taste in my mouth. FUCK censorship. Luckily, the music is executed quite nicely and serves to significantly enhance some of the more dramatic scenes, so at least there\u2019s that.\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion, Tokyo Ghoul is the framework of a good story, but it\u2019s just that: a framework. We are never going to see the character development put to animation, we are never going to see the plot lead anywhere noteworthy in animated form, and we are never to going get anything worthwhile out of this series (unless, of course, you read the manga). For that reason, Tokyo Ghoul is a failure of an adaptation. It is a commercial and nothing more. I do not recommend watching it, despite its moments.",

            "content": "Tokyo Ghoul, a classic human vs \"species that eats humans\" cliche, that was pulled off in a dramatic, action-packed manner, that ultimately ended in a disappointing cliffhanger.\r\nTL;DR\r\nStory: 7/10\r\nArt: 8/10\r\nSound: 6/10\r\nCharacter: 6/10\r\nEnjoyment: 9/10\r\nOverall: 7/10 (rounded down from 7.25)\r\nGood Points:\r\n+ Gripping and exciting story line\r\n+ Excellent animation and character design\r\n+ Excellent BGM\r\n+ Cool and varied cast of characters with powers\r\n+ Good main character development\r\nBad points:\r\n- Ends in a cliffhanger (wait for the sequel!)\r\n- Poor OP and ED themes\r\n- Many underdeveloped supporting characters\r\n- Underdeveloped main antagonist\r\n- Underwhelming final two episodes due to lack of resolution (yet)\r\nOther comments\r\nYou will love this show if you like:\r\n1. Good action sequences withsuperpowers\\n\r\n2. Blood and gore + screaming\\n\r\n3. Emotional scenes that make you cry T.T\\n\r\n4. Cute tsundere main female protagonist :3\\n\\n\r\nStory: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nThe story starts off with Kaneki, a young high school student who chances upon an encounter with a girl, who turns out to be a ghoul. Both are nearly killed in an accident, that was not really an accident, and Kaneki inherits the girl's internal organs, effectively transforming him into a half-ghoul half-human being. Throughout the anime, Kaneki exemplifies both sides, the ghoul and the human side, and starts to realize how similar they actually are and explore how they can co-exist peacefully.\\n\\n\r\nBut not everyone thinks that way. Other ghouls like the gourmets and binge eaters feast on human flesh waay beyond their expected calorie intake, whilst a mysterious group called the Aogiri, led by a one-eyed ghoul, is taking over 11th Ward. The humans, in the form of CCG, are fighting back against the ghouls, using weapons made from ghouls themselves, which they call \"quinque\". Their job is to drive out the ghoul scum from Tokyo.\\n\\n\r\nThe plot itself is split into 3 main arcs. The introductory arc focusing on Kaneki's transformation and from human to ghoul and then to a realization that he is half-of-each, the Hinami arc, where both her parents are brutally killed by \"doves\", members of CCG who are hunting the ghouls in 20th ward, as well as the final but incomplete Aogiri arc, where all-out war is imminent between ghouls and humans. All three of such arcs are gripping and have excellent development. (+3)\\n\\n\r\nAs far as coherence goes, I can't say much, because the anime ended in a cliffhanger, and it's not entirely fair to point out things that haven't been explained. However, there are a few things that have been explained in a rather unsatisfactory fashion.\\n\\n\r\nGhouls can't eat human food and puke when they eat food, but can drink coffee, which is perfectly fine. Alright, they also forget to mention that ghouls apparently also can drink water. So the question is this - what's so special about coffee/water - that makes it different from other poisonous human foods? None of this is ever touched on, it's just been assumed for sake of a more touching story of Tohka and her friend giving her food to eat. Next, if Tohka really couldn't eat all that stuff, why didn't she just pretend she was on a diet. Even if her friend would be disappointed, at least as a FRIEND she should understand and respect other people's dietary choices, right?\\n\\n\r\nNext point, Ghouls unleash their powers in a pretty cool fashion, but nowhere does the anime ever touch on where these special powers come from, and why are they so varied? We can see from Hinami that because she inherited her powers from her parents, she has BOTH of their abilities, but what about the others? Wouldn't they have inherited multiple powers as well? Why are so many of them only using one power - since, by assumption, most of them have parents and none of them are \"1st Generation Ghouls\".\\n\\n\r\nThat brings me to my next point - the story misses out a key plot line, which I think can really be developed on, the origin of ghouls in the first place. Although this is not so much a problem but an opportunity for further plot development.\\n\\n\r\nLastly, if ghouls are running rampant everywhere, and could be anyone you know, and the public knows of the existence and general workings of the ghoul (nowhere in the show is it stated or even implicitly shown that the existing of ghouls is a secret), it makes absolutely no sense for the rest of the human public to live life as if nothing is wrong - even with CCG supposedly \"controlling the problem\", because as long as one life has been taken - it would be all over the news and would spread MASSIVE panic and havoc (which is not seen, as of yet). But okay, I contend that the anime did make \"most of the public evacuate from the area\", but that was only in the Aogiri incident, what about all the killings before that in 20th ward? Kids can still go to school and feel safe? No way, man.\\n\\n\r\nThe anime still has lots of explaining to do, and has no resolution yet, so I'm hoping the sequel addresses these problems and ties everything up nicely. Still, most of the story is fairly coherent, and inconsistencies don't lie on key plot premises. Characters act naturally based on situations and so do the organisations (except maybe CCG might want to use tanks/aircraft against the ghouls instead of just soldiers) (+1)\\n\\n\r\nAs for plot depth, it is definitely quite substantial, because the anime doesn't stick to one main character, Kaneki, and just leave you the whole anime from his perspective. It jumps from the point of view of the CCG, to the people at Anteiku, to the people at Aogiri. All the perspectives are different, but all of them are essentially fighting for their lives or to protect their population/species. The central theme to this anime is basically \"What defines being a human?\" And that question is up to you to decide for yourself. The author hints that being human is essentially just a way of life, and it is our moral compass, conscience and actions that we take that make us human, or not human. (+3)\\n\\n\r\nLike I said, there was no resolution, so I'm rating the story fairly as if I have only watched half the series.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nThe art for this anime is quite good. I love how the powers of the ghouls are fleshed out, all the blood and gore is a bit disturbing, but I guess it suits the anime well. The different character art styles and hair styles are also pretty unique and interesting.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 6/10\\n\\n\r\nThe anime has some quite poor OP and ED themes, but the background music never seems out of place, it was generally alright and kept the excitement going. The voice acting, really top notch here - must've been difficult doing all that screaming. Music was really good for all the touching scenes as well as the action scenes - job well done!\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 6/10\\n\\n\r\nThe characters in the story are many, but of course, in this 11-episode anime, not all of them can be fleshed out and fully developed. Character development-wise, we got to know the backstories of most of the main cast, Tohka, Kaneki, Nishiki, as the plot progresses, and their pasts tell a lot about why their personalities are the way they are now. There's also quite a lot of dialogue and interaction that goes on between the main characters, and it adds a lot to the identity of the characters. Even Mado and Amon's past and interactions are clearly portrayed throughout the anime, which I thought was a good thing (+2).\\n\\n\r\nThe main character in the story is actually quite cliched, but there's still reason to love him because it's the \"good\" kind of cliched, and he doesn't really get that annoying until the last arc where he keeps screaming and starts getting multiple hallucinations. Other than that, you can really feel for Kaneki every time he tried to fight his urge of becoming a ghoul. The character's struggle completely grips you each time. Some people might be slightly annoyed at how useless he is most of the time though, and always needs saving, but this is only present in the first arc, by the second arc his involvement, while still weak, manages to help Tohka defeat Mado, which is a statement to the increasing trend of his usefulness as the anime progresses. (+1)\\n\\n\r\nMy favourite character definitely has to be Tohka, even if she is the cliche tsundere in the story. She still ends up kicking ass and has some really beautiful wings, even for tomboy, which she uses to slay people in battle with a rain of red crystals. She's also kind, and slowly opens up to Kaneki, and ends up liking him, as she reciprocates the kindness that Kaneki always shows her, in spite of her cold exterior. She also protects Hinami like her younger sister and has strong affection for her. I also find her really cute, especially the way she blushes and the fact that she wears a rabbit mask. :3 (+1)\\n\\n\r\nThe final character who bears some interest is Rize, whom we still know nothing much about (except for the fact that she is a well-read bookworm who shares a similar taste with Kaneki), other than the fact that she is basically the \"ghoul-side\" of Kaneki after merging with his humanity. She haunts him about how it was \"all his fault\" and about how he has to \"suffer\" because he refuses to hurt other people, and about how his \"inability/powerlessness in making decisions/taking action\" result in the various tragedies surrounding him. She eventually convinces him that in order to \"protect something\" he must \"sacrifice something else in return\", which Kaneki eventually concludes that he has to sacrifice his own sense of \"humanity\" and become a monster to attain the power he needs to protect the people whom he cherishes. (+1)\\n\\n\r\nRize's character continues to be mysterious, but her influence in the anime seems much greater than many of the other supporting cast that the anime introduced and then totally left them out of any form of development.\\n\\n\r\nNone of the other characters actually stand out much because they aren't focused on too much. Yamori is one of the evil bad guys who goes crazy for no apparent reason and begins torturing Kaneki, for no other reason than, \"Hey guys I got tortured, so I think I should torture him too.\" Which is like...uhh bad reason yo. Also known as \"Jason\", he is the main antagonist in this 12-episode run, but he doesn't get much a back story and gets even less of development despite his central role in the anime, so that was disappointing.\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of character growth, Kaneki shows outstanding growth throughout this anime - from being a wimpy kid at first, to growing slightly stronger but still being generally weak, to end up going crazy because of Rize that is in him and accepting his ghoul-ness despite his best efforts in being human, because he realizes being human ain't gonna help him save his ghoul friends anymore, and he is too powerless as a human. (+1)\\n\\n\r\nTohka also shows a bit of growth, slowly opening out of her shell. While Hinami goes from simply crying and whining about her tragic life, which is truly sad, to growing stronger than she is expected to, and volunteering to fight to get Kaneki back at Anteiku. The other one who shows growth is Amon, who starts to wonder about whether ghouls are all that bad at all when he meets Kaneki, who spares his life and does something only humans would do. Amon also gives into the desire for revenge against the \"Rabbit\" Tohka-chan, for taking away his boss, Mado, whom he respected and looked up to a whole lot. But none of these are actually portrayed well enough, we can see the change in the characters but the progression to that state, not so.\\n\\n\r\nTohka's growth came while \"sitting idly by\" and \"reflecting about stuff that happened\", all of which was essentially skipped, and we only know this because Kaneki bothered to see her in her room. Hinami's growth came in the midst of her crying... it really does solve everything doesn't it? Amon's growth came from visiting Mado's grave. But the anime showed little or none about what led him to any of these characters' conclusion.\\n\\n\r\nThe anime also left me with some characters whom I'd really be interested to know about, like the old dude who leads Anteiku, Yomo, and of course the girl at the bar, Itori, because their character exudes some sort of special aura about them. Too bad they weren't fleshed out in this series.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nI really enjoyed most of this anime, from beginning all the way until the final arc. The scenes are action-packed, and when they are not full of heart-racing action, they are full of touching scenes of people crying, screaming, and talking to each other in meaningful moral dialogue. This anime I didn't want to put down from the time I started, till the time I ended, so good job for that. I did think that the entire of episodes 11 and 12 focused too much on the torture that Kaneki was going through. Firstly because the torture made no sense whatsoever anyway, and secondly because it just felt soooo long. Too long, in fact, and while it first gripped me, I slowly lost interest because it was the same screaming over and over again, and it was the same blood over and over again.\\n\\n\r\nSo, I can't give full points for enjoyment but it's still a very exciting anime to watch.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7.25/10",

            "content": "I REALLY almost desperately wanted to like this anime, but it failed me and went off the rails like a possessed train.\r\nI\u2019m sorry, to all Tokyo Ghoul fans, I really am. I had such high hopes for this show, but, it had so, so many issues. So, lets get down to it.\r\nThis post is spoiler free! :D \r\nCharacters: 3/10\r\nThe show started with a bang. In the first two episodes, I was ready to adopt Kaneki as one of \u201cmy precious babies\u201d. Then show unraveled like cheap sweater.  While Kaneki remained interesting, his emotional development got lost in the rather vast world of ghouls.Kaneki became background noise battered like a pin-pong ball between the too-fast plot and integration into the ghoul society. It's a shame too. Kaneki could\u2019ve become one of my favorite characters (I still plan on reading the manga despite the anime so it could happen!).\\n\\n\r\nKaneki aside, I (in all honesty) can\u2019t recall the name of a single character (I looked them up for this review) aside from Hide, who barely appears. I had a difficult time caring about anyone, especially the ghouls. Let me explain why the ghouls mostly sucked (for me). \\n\\n\r\nFirst, I\u2019m supposed to believe the characters live in a dystopian society, yet none of them (excluding Renji and Yoshimura) behave as if they do. Most characters have angst oozing out their pores, but, if ghouls live in such a crappy culture, how come none of the characters seem to realize it before the anime? For example, one character (who will remain nameless for spoilers sake), literally sits in [his/her] room for THREE days (or longer, not sure) because someone called [his/her] \u201cghoul power\u201d beautiful. Seriously? If I\u2019m supposed to believe [he/she]\u2019s is someone who grew up in a world this grating, why does something so small make [him/her] mope for three days? [He/she] is allowed to be upset, but honestly. If this character lived in such a war-torn and desperate society, a compliment shouldn't shatter [he/she]. \\n\\n\r\nIf you\u2019re thinking I missed the point and that [he/she]\u2019s reaction to a compliment should help me understand how hard the world is, I disagree. Watch Berserk, Attack on Titan, or Akira. Those characters live in a terrible world and act like it (note: I\u2019m not saying every character in a dystopian society or situation needs to be angry and miserable, take Allen Walker, for example).\\n\\n\r\nI have another beef with this compliment drama\u2014a human complimented the ghoul. This character\u2019s relation to humans befuddled me. First, [he/she] acts as if humans are beneath [him/her]. Then, suddenly, the character has a valued human friend and a compliment from a human that [he/she] had such contempt for before make [him/her] pout for three days. I did not understand that whiplash.  \\n\\n\r\nThis character isn\u2019t the only one filled with hypocrisy. Another character (for the sake of spoilers I\u2019ll have to be vague here) acts badly towards a human and shows [him/herself] to consider humans nothing but a food source and then\u2014suddenly\u2014is in love with one! It made no sense whatsoever to me. \\n\\n\r\nSeveral characters did some bewilderingly stupid things. Instead of feeling sorry for them, I could only blink at the sheer stupidity of their actions. \\n\\n\r\nLastly, many characters have rapidly changing opinions. They\u2019ll yell and berate or even attack in each other in one episode and--bam! They are desperate to save and protect each other for no real reason in the next. Again emotional development is sacrificed for plot. \\n\\n\r\nStory: 4/10\\n\\n\r\nThe story moved too fast, plain and simple. I understood it, but I just didn\u2019t give a two figs. Every other episode spent the first five minutes (after intro and recap) telling the viewer what happened since the last episode ended and the first began (in other words, most episode have huge plot developments and time jumps between each one). This made it extremely difficult to invest myself in the story.\\n\\n\r\nAs I said before, new aspects of the world kept cropping up like jack-in-the-boxes. Unfortunately, most of those elements vanished. The world didn\u2019t feel well-rounded, more like someone puked out a bunch of interesting ideas without considering how it all meshed together (I kid you not, someone ends up having a brother the viewer knew almost nothing (if anything, I can\u2019t remember) about that shows up around episode 10 or so. And I was supposed to care about this new sibling relationship (hint: I didn\u2019t)). Most of the world\u2019s elements fit the story\u2019s tone, but there was one bizarre arc that felt like it belonged in Pandora Hearts, Black Butler, or D.Gray-man. I enjoy all three of those, but such a tone certainly didn\u2019t fit Tokyo Ghoul.\\n\\n\r\nThe show is also chuck full of clich\u00e9s. I know some people will give me heat for saying this, but it\u2019s just true. I\u2019ve seen all of those plot elements numerous times. \\n\\n\r\nAnother big problem of this story: I was supposed to care about the ghouls. Um, how? None of the ghouls seemed to like humans; most of them seemed to hate humans, have contempt for them, or blame them for how tough I\u2019m supposed to believe their life is.  But I didn\u2019t pity the ghouls. They eat people without much remorse, for the most part anyways. I can sympathize with a bad guy; I can sympathize with non-human characters; but I found myself struggling to even view the ghouls as the good guys. \\n\\n\r\nAnother problem: I\u2019m supposed to believe (minor spoiler) that one of the reasons this world is so tough and rough is because ghouls and humans can\u2019t co-exist. But the only thing standing in their way was anger. No one seemed willing to give an inch and even try to understand each other (say Kaneki, for obvious reasons). In the end, I found them all stupid.\\n\\n\r\nThe plot moved faster than the Shinkansen, which through pacing, investing me in the story, and developing characters out the window. It seemed the anime aimed for big and shocking moments to show people how awesome and fast-paced it was. While it obviously worked--the show is popular, after all--it didn\u2019t work for me. I didn\u2019t care about the \u201cshocking\u201d moments because I couldn\u2019t care less about what was happening. \\n\\n\r\nArt (and cinematography in general): 10/10\\n\\n\r\nHere the show shined. Beautiful animation that made fights look like brutal yet elegant. Total eye candy.  \\n\\n\r\n(music): It added to the show but wasn\u2019t particularly amazing. \\n\\n\r\n(angles): They did a fairly standard job here. \\n\\n\r\n(intro/outro): I loved both, and the intro\u2019s animation was creative and stunning.\\n\\n\r\nFan service: 1/10\\n\\n\r\nThe show did not have up-skirt shots or laughably big-chested girls. Someone did fight mini skirt, but the female lead usually wore pants (shock). Here, the show did a pretty fantastic job.\\n\\n\r\nSub vs Dub: \\n\\n\r\nWatched it in sub and thought it was pretty good. It hasn't been dubbed. \\n\r\nWarnings: \\n\\n\r\nThe show has a few plot holes. No matter how I racked my brain, I simply could not figure out the problem\u2019s resolution. \\n\\n\r\nThat being said, Tokyo Ghoul is beloved. My opinion isn\u2019t a popular one. In fact, I think its reputation set my expectations too high (so did those first two episodes). Anyways, I plan on reading the manga, which could change my opinion on the anime. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 5/10",

            "content": "Please tell me, what is the monster inside of me?\r\nTokyo Ghoul is a dark action supernatural manga adaptation of the same name. It was one of the more hyped anime for the 2014 Summer season, due to the success of the manga and the proposed themes. It is an another take on the survival sub-genre, one that is really popular nowadays in the West, however fails to have a clear direction of where it wants to go with it.\r\nPlot: \r\nAfter a ghoul - monster that has superpowers and devour humans for living - attack, Ken Kaneki overgoes a surgery that makes him a half-ghoul, half-humancreature with one red eye. He must become accustomed to the new world he's thrown in, as the tensions in 20th Ward arise with increased ghoul and dove - ghoul investigator - activity.\\n\\n\r\nThe plot is pretty basic and simple but the premise looks really promising and you expect it would deliver a thrilling experience on what it takes to be a ghoul and how to survive in the cruel world. And that's where it ends. Soon enough it turns out to be a ghoul gang turf beef anime where the \"good\" and the \"bad\" ghouls fight each other for territory while the \"police\", the doves, try to eliminate them, and it starts playing out as a shonen.\\n\\n\r\nThe psychological aspect of the show, after the first three episodes, quickly becomes forgotten. Kaneki's demised encounter is made to be just an excuse to introduce us to the ghoul world, so much that he almost acts as a plot device. The anime tries waaay too much at the same time, introducing plot devices and characters that hardly get any explanation at all. They desperately wanted to include everything in the show, focusing on nothing specifically and ending incomplete. There's no direction, hardly any foreshadowing, and everything is just a big mess. There are a couple of distinguishable arcs but but they overlap each other and don't seem to have any significant importance. The ghouls are made to be either \"good\" or \"bad\", the good ones being ones that don't kill people but instead eat the already dead ones, and bad ones being those who kill for fun, and are just made to be bad so the characters could disagree and hate them and spark up conflicts. It could have been an interesting ideology and morality clash between sides but yet again, the series fail to flesh out the aspect.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\\n\r\nTokyo Ghoul is one of the rare anime that I would safely tell that the main character is the best one. Ken Kaneki, the protagonist, is just your everyday student, and then everything changes when the ghoul nation attacks. He is dubbed a half-human, half-ghoul creature, and acts sort of a bridge between two worlds. Sadly, that aspect is not focused on, and he doesn't seem to have much importance in the story as he's just a throw-in piece to get the audience accustomed to what is going on. What is good about him though is that he develops a pseudo-double personality, with Rize, the eccentric ghoul that tried to kill him but died instead and got her organs replaced with Ken's, acting as the ghoul part of him, and Ken acting as the human part. The double-personality part is really well done, but didn't receive enough time.\\n\\n\r\nThen we have your obligatory cliched characters that you'll quickly forget: Touka, the female interest and a pseudo-tsundere that has the most development out of the rest of the cast, but otherwise unimportant; Amon, a dove that acts as a representative for the rest of the investigator squad and is the only other character that receives significant development, when his motives for killing ghouls and the view on ghouls are questioned; Mado, a one dimensional villain dove that kills ghouls because he thinks they must be eliminated; and a ton of other insignificant one-dimensional characters or villains that are just there to catalyze the story forward.\\n\\n\r\nIn all honesty, the side cast of Tokyo Ghoul is the worst part of the show. There are maybe 2-3 characters that are important to the story at most, the rest are completely irrelevant, in addition to being one dimensional. The bad ghouls are all made to be sadists: there's absolutely no variety between them, and no backdrop as to why they are like that. Meanwhile, the good guys only show up to infodump you or to save the protagonists, and have no personalities of their own. Tragedy is an important part of the themes and the story and it is quite frequent in the anime but it is really hard to care for characters you barely know about.\\n\\n\r\nWriting:\\n\\n\r\nI wouldn't say that Tokyo Ghoul has bad writing but it's certainly below average. There are plenty of inconsistencies and jumps in story telling, and quite a few things that don't make sense at all. For the first couple of episodes where the anime was still slow, writing was decent, but they dropped the ball the moment the gladiator show was introduced. There is no ground level perspective presented: even though the main character is a representative of both human and ghoul societies, we are not given any idea on how ordinary humans feel about being killed everyday by superior species. It plays out as just a normal and obvious thing and no one seems to worry much about ghouls' existence.\\n\\n\r\nSince the story is focused on so much and yet on nothing, lots of interesting plot devices left unexplained and you only know about how they work based on assumptions. For example, Quinques, the weapons that ghoul investigators use, are supposedly from Kagune, a ghoul's organ that acts as a superpower, but it's not explained on how they are able to use them, how exactly do they get them or why. The ghoul's nature is hardly explained as well, resorting to a simple \"they need human flesh to survive\" explanation, even though their Kagune is a very cool and interesting superpower. The limits to said superpowers and varieties are not mentioned.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the genres and atmosphere, Tokyo Ghoul manages to create tension rather successfully - it doesn't have shameless fanservice or stupid comedy just for the sake of it, and tries its best to deliver the message (again problem being that there's just far too many messages to be delivered). There's not so much of a mystery though, since there is no foreshadowing and lots of things are introduced on the bat that you have to care about or you won't be able to understand what's going on, therefore there's not many expectations that some big revelations are about to show up later on.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation and sound:\\n\\n\r\nThere was a huge hiatus going on when the show aired regarding its massive censors on gore. Yes, that was actually a big thing. The censors killed a lot of fun, and it was a mandatory for a dark, almost horror anime to have excessive gore, because there were more than enough reasons to have them. It's not like the gore happened off screen - it was blurred out with black or even worse - changing the color palette to full green whenever a gruesome fight scene occured when it was impossible to just blur our the gore. I thought a lot about how much gore was needed for this anime and how much should we care that it was presented this way, but from a storytelling point of view it's not too much of a worry since you definitely know that gory stuff is going on, you just don't see them.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation itself during fights is well done, especially in the final episode. Character designs are made to look really emo, which coincidentally plays out to the advantage of the dark atmosphere. The voice acting is decent, with Miyano Mamoru pulling off an exceptional performance voicing the gourmet ghoul. The music is pretty okay, no stand out pieces but they do fit in the situation. All in all, apart from the censors, art and sound don't have anything wrong in them.\\n\\n\r\nAbout the opening and ending, the ED is very basic and generic with a couple of still-frames of the characters changing while the song plays. However, the OP is currently the best of the year - it has AMAZING animation and exceptional music, and does everything that a good OP should do - mirror the atmosphere of the anime and foreshadow the characters. It is more emotional than the anime itself, and I definitely recommend to check it out.\\n\\n\r\nSummary: \\n\\n\r\nTokyo Ghoul draws many comparisons to Deadman Wonderland, but it's much better in execution (that's not saying much though). It has a lot of interesting ideas but there's none that are given enough focus. The manga fans are screaming that the adaptation ruined the franchise, as the original material is actually very slow compared to the \"too fast\" anime version. It should have had atleast a dozen episodes more to avoid being so rushed. This again proves why 2 cour anime are usually superior to 1 cour.\\n\\n\r\nEven so, it still was one of my favourite anime of the season, because tastes, and not because it was objectively good (because it was not). If you like survival genre, or dark settings in general, you could check this out, although don't expect much.\\n\\n\r\nFinal Verdict - 4.6/10",

            "content": "First of all, just so you know, I have not written many reviews. Ever. Of anything. Also, I realise that in comparison to many other reviewers I'm like a newbie, seeing as I have only watched about 20 animes and have just (since a few months) started reading manga. \r\nAlso, while scrolling down numerous reviews I noticed a very distinct pattern: the reviewers who first read the manga and those who either haven't, or just started reading it. Those who read the manga seem to give the show a very low score while those who haven't seem to give it an absurd high score.\r\nNow, I'veread the manga after watching the anime so I guess my score will be something inbetween.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nI would like to give it a 7,5 but since that not possible I'll stick with 8. The story itself is very interesting, while at first glance it looks like your typical horror/supernatural anime with 'bad guys', ghouls who eat humans and the humans themselves, who are obviously the \"good guys\". However the story shows both sides, the human side, firstly via Kaneki but later on via Amon, and the Ghoul side via numerous ghouls that Kaneki meets. It explores grey areas of both species and forces you to ask the question: \"Who are the monsters?\" A very interesting story with so many possibilities had it not been so rushed and jumbled up. In the first few episodes it follow the manga fairly well but then it starts to diverge. Now everyone should probably realise by now that an anime that follows its manga to the letter is rare if not inexistent. However I think the anime made a mistake by not following the manga more closely, it made everything seem too rushed. Not fully recovered from the previous arc it throws you into another one without warning. Also something, that apperantly many reviwers dislike, is the ending. To me, personally it seems like a good ending, be it a bit rushed and sudden it definetly makes you yearn for more. which is after all, it's purpose I think.\\n\\n\r\nArt 7/10\\n\\n\r\nAs someone who values the art as something that must be either perfect or close to it Tokyo Ghoul wasn't a total disappointment but doesn't fit the criteria either. I do love the fact that they coloured the kagune differently than it's done in the manga, mostly because its colour reflects its user very well. Red would have done it too ofcourse but the change of colour is a nice touch. But then they added the censoring: piece of advice: please watch the uncensored verison (unless you really can't stand blood). The censoring was bothersome and unnecessary, maybe even plain on ridiculous.\\n\\n\r\nSound 8/10\\n\\n\r\nDuring the episodes I did not really pay cose attention to the sound or music on the background, mostly because I was too busy following the story (so technically, that's a good thing) but what I can say is that the OS could not have been better or more fitting.\\n\\n\r\nThen there is also the voice casting. Personally I think they did a very good job, the voice casting really matches the characters and the voice actors did a really good job.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 6/10\\n\\n\r\nThe characters themselves are very interesting and very promising, none of them are boring and for once there was not one character that I wished would just die (very rare for me). However, because of the rushing and the fact that they sqeezed, like 60 chapters into 12 episodes they do not get the attention or development they truly deserve and desperately need. They are easily seen as unimportant and merely stepping stones for the plotline or the development of other characters. Especially Kaneki Ken who only gets his develompent (or personality description) in the last few episodes and remains weak until the final episode, which was actually quite bothersome, even more so because he is the protagonist. And knowing that even the protagonist gets close to no development at all you can probably guess how much development the side characters get.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 9/10\\n\\n\r\nThe reason I enjoyed it so much must be because I hadn't read the manga at the time seeing as everyone who did seems to either dislike it or plain on hate it. Besides a few issues here and there the anime did a good job and attracted quite a lot of attention as one of the most popular anime's in it's season. And seeing as after I watched I could not get enough of Tokyo Ghoul and started reading the manga and it's sequel and spin-offs etc. I think it's fair to say: job well done!\\n\\n\r\nOverall 7/10\\n\\n\r\nIt's a good anime and that's that, I understand that there are a lot of people who've read the manga first that are disatisfied but I am not one of them. I look forward to the next season but I do hope that they will stick closer to the manga than they did in its first. I would recommend you try watching the anime because it's definitely worth your time and I also recommend reading the manga which is really amazing and feels less rushed. Also the manga is not censored (thank god)\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "\"Some things are better left unsaid\"\r\nI dont' know why, but this quote is implemented into the story of Tokyo Ghoul, literally and practically. I will go in-depth towards this perspective throughout the review but keep in mind I will keep this review short and precise so that you readers can make a choice of either to prioritize this anime over others or to not..\r\nI also will not include a synopsis in this review, because the description of this anime is written on the anime page.\r\nOpinion:\r\nTokyo Ghoul is far more superior than other anime in that it has a solid story and presented it well withinthe two episodes. We get the feeling as if, the main character (Kaneki) is going to turn out like the typical bad ass character. I feel that Kaneki didn't have enough background information and who his mother is. As to the quote I have mentioned above; the quote is said throughout the anime couple of times and you get the image that Tokyo Ghouls creator has lived life that way. I may sound kiddish hear but wait until you watch the anime. \\n\r\nSo let's get into the specifics here shall we?\\n\\n\r\n[\"What are ghouls?\"\\n\r\n\"Why can't ghouls taste human food the same as humans do?\"\\n\r\n\"What is CCG?\"\\n\r\n\"What the hell is a Quinque\"\\n\r\n\"What is with all the wards and fight between Humans and Ghouls?\"]\\n\\n\r\nTokyo Ghoul fails to answer these questions and seems to think the audience will just pick up the answer throughout the show. Nothing important gets background information. The whole concept of Ghouls and their nature and society hasn't been given any screen time and I feel that is what Tokyo Ghoul needed in order to properly build up the climax and plot in order for us audiences to completely be satisfied with the ending. What Tokyo Ghoul needs is a proper background detail of what each and everything is so that we can understand and build emotions to characters. Throughout watching the anime, I didn't get to feel a emotional attachment throughout the characters or even Ghouls; who are supposed to be badass and cool. They didn't have the character development in order to feel that way, and this is what Tokyo Ghoul did wrong. Now I understand, its a 12 ep anime. But I believe they haven't used that 12 ep wisely and just quickly proceeded through the story without having and logic. Now all of this doesn't make this show necessarily a \"bad\" show.  It does have very intriguing action fights which appear from time to time though are very small due to lack of time.\\n\\n\r\nI will now go into the real review containing:\\n\r\nStory|Character|Setting|Animation|Sound|Personal Enjoyment|\\n\\n\\n\r\n~Story~\\n\r\nThe story of Tokyo Ghoul was similar to Parasyte the Maxim who some of you may call Kiseijuu. A protagonist human being invaded by a non-human creature. But in Tokyo Ghoul, it was more of a decision in order to keep Kaneki alive. The story line does pick up well through the end of the anime where all characters are revealed and shown. I think Tokyo Ghoul is far advantageous because the story it has is of it's own kind other than the one similarity of Kiseijuu.  The only problem is that it wasn't delivered quite precisely.\\n\\n\r\n~Character~\\n\r\nWhere the show really doesn't shine is Characters. Not even a tiny bit of screen time for any side characters except if the main character is in the setting. None of the characters have any background details of them and there was no emotional attachment to the characters if one of them end up dying.\\n\\n\r\n~Setting~\\n\r\nNot much to say in this field, except that everything in the setting perspective what though out well. All ghouls in one area (Anteiku) and humans were seperated. It was managed well and there wasn't any problems with switching settings.\\n\\n\r\n~Animation~\\n\r\nReally well done. I loved how they made the uncensored version of this  \\n\r\nanime because it really does give more feelings to this anime. This section is for sure where Tokyo Ghoul excels. Blood and Gore were a part of this anime so if you're a fan of that, you should check this out.\\n\\n\r\n~Sound~\\n\r\nThe opening of this Anime is one of the better ones and believe it or not, I still get goosebumps when Kaneki's hair is flying in the beginning. The ending wasn't too great but that may be because I didn't take time out to actually hear it. The overall sound in this anime isn't something I critiqued often but as far as I remember, it was suitable to the situation and setting so you could say it was well done.\\n\\n\r\n~Personal Enjoyment~\\n\r\nI liked this anime, and some of you may think I don't; but to make reviews, you must look at the anime from a different perspective and pinpoint small flaws and details that could have altered the anime from being different than how it is. I feel Tokyo Ghoul had great potential if they had used their time thinking out each character and took more time to build up the process of Kaneki being a stronger hybrid.\\n\\n\r\nI know this review may have seemed like a rant at the beginning, but I had to let out how I felt after watching this anime, and hopefully you can make a decision to watch this anime or not, or to agree with what I have just said.\\n\\n\r\nThanks for reading!\\n",

            "content": "WTF kind of anime that I just watched?\r\nThat's my reaction after watching the last episode and according to the forum commentators, it was pretty much rushed and they were certainly right. I guess you might said that some manga would have better be left as mangas than be adapted as an anime...that is, if studios such as studio Pierrot won't do it right, so I'm gonna keep my review of this anime simple as I present my ratings for each of this anime's category:\r\nPathetic 1. \r\nStory- it was basically another one of those plot where the protagonist become somewhat of a........let's just say being ableto get intertwine in the middle of two worlds in this case Kaneki being a half ghoul and a half human. What makes it pathetic was how he get to be one, where he almost becomes a monster's snack if not for some weird accident that befalls the monster where she get's killed (where the scenario for the lady ghoul was too stupid to say the least) and the victim (Kaneki) become a victim of the doctor's malpractice where he get's organ transplant from his attacker. Now, this is the part where I would ask as to wtf was this series writer thinking Sui Ishida for coming up with such dorky concept as how Kaneki become a half human/ half ghoul kind of thing? If I were Sui Ishida I probably make Kaneki as some sort of lab experiment that got away, that would have have been cool than some scenario that is too stupid.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall- because it was rushed, it was pretty obvious that studio Pierrot should have extended it up to 20 episode, also we should have seen as to how Amon's rematch with Toka had transpired. Since the anime ended in a sour note, I wouldn't be surprise if the manga only run for about 13 volumes, pretty obvious that the whole series whether it's a manga or anime was more like gore porn than anything else.   \\n\\n\\n\r\nGood 7.\\n\\n\r\nArt- what can I say I love the blood and gore that see in this anime and that's that.\\n\\n\\n\r\nPoor 3.\\n\\n\r\nI don't like the opening and the closing theme, I don't like Kaneki's pussy voice, expect of course for Mado, I like the way that he voice out his pleasure of killing ghouls.\\n\\n\\n\r\nDreadful 2.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter- the reason why I gave it such rating was basically the way on how they were double standardize, now Nishiki Nishio and  Sh\u016b Tsukiyama where suppose to be dead and yet we still see them alive and kicking. Now, if them ghouls can't be killed then Rize Kamishiro should still be alive and them Doves would have been exterminated easily by them ghouls, also how the fuck did a half ghoul like Kaneki become a super ghoul after being tortured by Yakumo? Now he's a half ghoul right? So he should have some form of limitation, so how come he doesn't? I'm guessing that since he is the main protagonist he should come on top which it would be such a pathetic idea coming from series writer Sui Ishida. Now, the only characters that I see whose roles were right are Toka, Mado, Amon and Hinami.\\n\\n\\n\r\nDecent 4.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment- Well it was a bit enjoyable from episode 1 to 11, but the last one was shit all the way, I didn't even get to see Amon's duel with Toka which was a bit disappointing.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

Tbh I wasn't expecting that much from it but entertainment. Didn't think it would be the anime of the season but still a cool thing to watch !\r\nStory: It starts off with that guy getting mixed blood with a ghoul & becoming some kind of half human / half ghoul dude. That part was ok I guess, you kinda think ghouls are gonna be scary etc since they eat humans. But like every ghoul issome kind of emoteen... almost feels like the author thought only gothics could fit the role. \\n\r\nTo be fair I really didn't pay much attention to the story since it was so confusing. Not like complicated or anything but just borrinnnnggg as hell.. \\n\\n\r\nArt: I guess it well animated, I just don't really like the design it's so shonen & basic.. I guess the manga is like that too but it can be fine in animes with an actual PLOT. The art is the best part of the anime though\\n\\n\r\nSound: Wow! Not gonna hate but you really gotta be into that anime opening J-HARD ROCK/METAL kinda music which I really don't feel. It really deserves the DREADFUL 2 I gave it\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: I guess some are bearable, the MC is a whining bitch, dude can't get over being a ghoul. PFFF... I hate that kinda character, just slowing the pace of the story/action bc he keeps whining. If they actually put content every time he was crying the anime would've been a lot better.\\n\r\nMost the bad guys are crazy dudes on LSD / good guys are emos or just regular people.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Can't hate on the action scenes & the art which are the only things making this anime somewhat relevant & watchable.\\n\r\nThe story made no sense, the characters had no depth, the sound was terrible.\\n\\n\r\nBoring show overall, I don't recommend",

Nothing special or unique about the story.",

            "content": "overview:\r\nEveryone has been saying how Tokyo Ghoul: 2 was a piece of shit, but the first Tokyo Ghoul was a masterpiece. I have a revelation to share with the denizens of MAL. The first Tokyo Ghoul...actually wasn't very good. I'm going to depart from my normal format in order to try something new for me. I will divide the review largely into positives vs. negatives.\r\nSome Spoilers!\r\nBackground: \r\nSometimes a popular trend can go completely out of control and the media becomes hyper-saturated with a particular style or genre. For most people on MAL and 4chan, that evil that must be stomped out is \"Moe\" anime andslice of life shows. For me, it is fucking zombie and vampire media. I feel it has degenerated to a pathetic level that is tiresome, redundant, and as brainless as a zombie itself. I also feel that vampires have been absolutely raped by the likes of Twilight and other bullshit copycats. Tokyo Ghoul isn't Twilight caliber bad, but it IS absurdly overhyped simply because it followed a popular fad. Although ghoul is usually synonymous with zombie, the ghouls in Tokyo Ghoul actually share far more in common with traditional vampires. They are a completely different species that have a human appearance and human intelligence, but can only feed on human flesh and are sickened by other types of food. However, the \"Ghouls\" don't have typical vampire weaknesses and lack most of the powers associated with vampires. Tokyo Ghoul at its core, is a show about the struggle between humanity and the Ghouls, with the main character Ken being a ghoul that fights other ghouls.\\n\\n\r\nPositives: \\n\\n\r\n1. The art is actually quite good. The character designs, animation, and gore are all genuinely well done.\\n\\n\r\n2. The music is not bad, considering it was the composer's first soundtrack and the guy is younger than I am. Even though I'm beginning to grow tired of ominous Latin chanting for EVERY ACTION SCENE EVER! Too bad Carl Orff is dead. I would like to see his reaction to today's soundtracks and ask him if he regrets ever writing Carmina Burana.\\n\\n\r\n3. While it could have done more to build up its world and try re-invent rather than copy other vampire/zombie media, it does offer a few interesting, relatively fresh elements. The main character himself being a badass anti-hero ghoul that fights other ghouls is...sort of interesting. Although considering the ghouls are basically vampires and not zombies, we have seen this before in: Hellsing, Blade, Skyrim, Vampire Hunter D, etc. The ghouls have powers that aren't typically associated with zombies or vampires, which gives us something new to look at. The fact that the vampires fully eat their victims and 1 vampire can eat 11 people or just over 1,000 pounds of flesh in a couple days is...interesting I guess. In most media the undead don't typically have a really high metabolism since they don't generate body heat and lack heartbeats. Cold blooded animals typically need to eat WAY less often than warm blooded animals. At least the show didn't make us watch purple hair moe vampire chick take a several hundred pound dump! That would make this show suck even more than it already does.\\n\\n\r\n4. LOTS of nudity and blood. For some people, that could be a positive.\\n\\n\\n\r\nNegatives:\\n\\n\\n\r\n1. This series is tagged as horror, yet it completely fails as a horror series. It doesn't have ANY concept of how to build tension or create a creepy atmosphere. It just throws gore in your face. The music isn't suitably creepy. Even 11 year olds wouldn't be afraid of this shit!\\n\\n\r\n2. The plot and characters really aren't that good. It is a cheesy, poorly written drama that gets away with the same stuff other series get crucified for, because vampires and zombies are \"Cool\"! Weak characterization, plot convenient amnesia, and poor dialogue are just a sample of the things that Tokyo Ghoul has basically gotten a \"free pass\" on. While it offers a few elements that haven't been done to death, it falls FAR short of the works that actually made a massive impact on the undead horror genre. For example, \"Let the Right One In\" was able to keep vampires as vicious predators, but actually attempted to make the audience feel sympathy for them. It also contained a rather immoral and delightfully dark romance that was basically the anti-Twilight. Attack on Titan took the concept of brainless, stumbling creatures that were once human and live off human flesh, overrunning the human population and driving mankind to the brink of extinction along with all the other zombie apocalypse survival elements, but changed it just enough that most fans don't even realize it IS just another zombie apocalypse show. I don't actually like Attack on Titan, but changing the zombies into retarded giants was kind of a masterstroke of popular fiction writing. It didn't really change anything, but changed the surface texture just enough to trick people into thinking it was something new. By contrast, I don't really have any strong compliments I can give Tokyo Ghoul for its writing.\\n\\n\r\n3. Entertainment is of course a highly subjective category, but I really didn't derive any pleasure at all out of this one. The bloody action didn't really move me, the plot was garbage, the characters are garbage, and it didn't offer anything I really wanted to see. Half the time this series was like reading an old 4chan \"green text\" fanfiction before all the really nasty motherfuckers left to form 4chan's bastard offspring Gurochan. I laughed at horrible fanfiction about hot chicks eating hundreds of pounds of human flesh back in the early 2000s! I don't need to spend 6 hours of my life watching it on the big screen! \\n\\n\r\nTLDR:\\n\\n\r\nTokyo Ghoul wasn't really much better than its shitty sequel. It was an over-hyped, mediocre at best series that largely escaped negative criticism by riding the popularity of undead horror media. This series was a complete and utter waste of time and animation budget.\\n\\n",

            "content": "Oh god this show is impossibly difficult.\r\nOn one hand, it was actually pretty badass. I mean the concept itself is something very appealing to many fans in general, and the manga was already quite well received. But then, once you actually watch the show, all the hype turns into...confusion. Well here it goes, Tokyo Ghoul:\r\nThe show revolves around Kaneki Ken, an introvert who spends all his free time engrossed in literature. By the miraculous hands of the anime gods, he ends up on a date with Kana Hanaz- I mean Kamishiro Rize, a purple haired beauty with the same tastes as him regarding novels andbooks. A few plot points later, and our friend Kaneki turns into a ghoul. Now, ghouls are a huge problem in Japan. They essentially live off of eating humans, and they are hunted by various police investigators, known as \u201cDoves,\u201d who aim to end the ghoul threat once and for all. Now this sounds pretty interesting, and at some points during the show, it genuinely is. For a majority of the show, the issue between the ghouls and doves is a point of high contention, as well as the moral boundaries of the ghouls themselves. Other characters include Kirishima Touka, the other purple haired beauty (ha) that acts as Kaneki's superior in a way, and a varied secondary cast that is really not worth mentioning. This leads me into the main issue with the show.\\n\\n\r\nThe characterization and characters themselves are what drive this show to the ground. Honestly, nobody really gets fleshed out during the period of the show. 12 episodes is generally enough time for this to happen, but Tokyo Ghoul could not accomplish this at all. It force feeds emotional situations down our throats, expecting viewers to sympathize with whomever is having an issue during any particular episode. The problem is, no character is developed to the point where I'd care about them in the first place. Speaking on Kaneki a bit, his characterization is not particularly weak, however, the way the creators went about it was quite counter productive for a show of this type and length- it was not until very later on in the show did we see some real development for him, and by that point, its effectiveness was little at best.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are not the only seemingly lost aspects of the show, as the direction the show wanted to head in was quite skewed. This is a common problem in anime: the show does not know where it wants to go. At one point it will focus on the Ghouls vs. Doves, then it will jump to deep character relations, etc. The problem is none of these individual parts are fleshed out enough for viewers to really understand motivations and enjoy anything. And the ending. It certainly came as a surprise. I have not read a lick of the manga, (which ironically ended the same day as the anime.) therefore, I have no basis of comparison. However, the ending of Tokyo Ghoul is the largest example the skewed directions I just mentioned. It came out of nowhere. Literally nowhere. Everything about the show changed instantly. To be honest, it would have been enjoyable if the show gave itself time to get to the point. However, it fails in this regard as well.\\n\\n\r\nAs a positive, the show for the most part, looks great. Ghoul forms are  uniquely designed, and overall quality is medium-high. The show is not consistently good looking however, as many have pointed out. Animation can also be a bit wonky, but for the most part, is solid. This may deter a bit visually, however compared to the story flop, it is quite minimal. Sound wise, the show performs quite well. The OP and ED are simply superb, the OP being one of my favorites for the Summer 2014 season. The BGM did its job well, especially during the final episodes of the show. The sound, and to a lesser extend, animation and art, are strong points for this show.\\n\\n\r\nFinishing Tokyo Ghoul, I really didn't know how to react. Honestly, I liken this show to Evangelion in many ways, for those of you who have seen it. However, this show fails on so many basic levels, that it simply does not deserve a solid score. However, if you do choose to watch regardless, it is highly recommended to wait for the BDS, as the show is quite censored in the visual department for blood and gore. I don't necessarily regret watching this show, but could it have been done better? Hell yes.\\n\\n\r\nHave fun.\\n",

            "content": "What do you get when you have X men meet Resident Evil? That would be Tokyo Ghoul.\r\nTokyo Ghoul is an anime that contained a large amount of hype stemming from those who have read the manga, and for good reasons too. The premise would sound very enthralling and interesting to those who are in love with the supernatural and psychological genres of fiction, like myself. Since the show also throws in a high dosage of fast-paced graphic violence here and there along with a good soundtrack, you pretty much have the most entertaining show of this season, right!? Wrong. What makes Tokyo Ghoul a below-averageshow at best comes from its mediocre job of the most vital components that a show must have: the story, the pacing, and its themes. Instead, Tokyo Ghoul feels like a rushed adaptation of what seems to be a promising and worthwhile story. While its music and most of its characters are well-developed, the show suffers from an incredibly poor direction. \\n\\n\r\nWhat Tokyo Ghoul fails to do with its story is provide a coherent focus on what it wants to show you. Essentially, the story is about a college student named Ken Kaneki who tries to find his place in a world that is full of violence and hate. The cause of this violence and hate come from those known as ghouls, who are biologically-evolved humans that feed off of other humans. Long story short, Kaneki, due to a horrific accident, becomes a half human, half ghoul and must learn to live in a society that offers tranquility to humans but hatred and oppression towards ghouls. While the synopsis and exposition for the show are delivered very well, experiencing the bulk of the story will make you feel as though it is ultimately unorganized and messy. The reason for this comes from the extremely awkward pacing and the overbearing focus on subplots that feel completely unnecessary and very rushed, causing you to question the choice of direction for the show. \\n\\n\r\nWhat also makes the story of this show mediocre comes not from the main character Kaneki, but rather from the supporting cast of characters and the been-there-done-that tropes connected with them. I honestly don't think that I'm lying when I say that Tokyo Ghoul probably has one of the most boring and predictable cast supporting of characters you can view in an anime today. The presentation of the many different characters isn't the problem I had with them. The central problem came from the fact that each and every one of the supporting characters' actions are completely predictable along with their personalities. For example, the character Nishiki is the obvious hotheaded male who will always react to an insult that you can find in many different anime's. The character known as Hide represents the all-to-familiar obnoxiously loud friend of the protagonist of an anime. Kaneki, while being a pretty decent protagonist, also shows many tropes that many should already be accustomed to in other shows, the most notable being the frightened and soft-spoken character who always needs to get pushed around in order to do something, which is what the majority of his scenes in the anime involve. However, like I said, Kaneki is still much more enjoyable and developed than the show's various characters that seem unique at a first glance, but quickly become easy to read.\\n\\n\r\nWhat's also disappointing about Tokyo Ghoul is not only its disjointed pacing and focus of characters, but also its focus on the different genres it tries to become. While researching Tokyo Ghoul for the first time, one would notice that it is described as a psychological action mystery with horror elements thrown in it. The problem is that the show lies many times about the genres it delves into, with the exception of action and drama. In terms of the psychological aspects of the show, the first and last episodes are literally the only episodes that contain a well done manner of psychological elements, while the other episodes of the show completely forget about the psychological aspects that were being shown previously in favor of flashy action and very cheesy comedy that will sometimes appear in various episodes. Because of these irritations, the show has a hard time figuring out its identity for a genre for it to fall under. \\n\\n\r\nAlthough I said that the flashy action takes away the psychological/suspense aspects of the show, I must admit that I would be lying if I said that the action is mediocre. What makes the action in Tokyo Ghoul so damn good is not just the fact that it is both thrilling and fast, but it's also because of the music and art that make it even more exciting. The soundtrack of the show is incredibly addicting and perfectly fuses in with the action on screen. The visuals are also breathtaking to look at, especially from the many transformations and horrific, yet beautiful, mutations of the characters who are ghouls. The one annoyance that you shall find with the show's action, however, is undoubtedly its heavy censoring. I can understand that Tokyo Ghoul is a story that involves a plethora of gore, but the show is censored to the point of it looking like as though it's rated PG. \\n\\n\r\nTokyo Ghoul is an anime that ultimately does not feel as though it is has a clear pathway for what it's trying to show you. The pacing is disgruntled and suffers from focusing on too many different plot points in only a total of twelve episodes. Majority of the characters in the show are predictable and boring with their actions and how their personality is presented to you. The question is, is Tokyo Ghoul worth the watch? To this I would answer, yes it is. While aspects such as the pacing and censoring can be annoying, Tokyo Ghoul still manages to offer up some very impressive world-building and exposition while trying its best to stay focused on its story. The action and music in the show is also some of the best that you can find in an anime this year. Overall, Tokyo Ghoul is a show that shows much potential for improvements, but still proves to be a fun ride for those who love aesthetically directed action and minor psychological elements, all under twelve episodes.  \\n",

But behind the fact, Tokyo Ghoul have a various lack in their performance.\r\nThe story told us about Kaneki Ken, a boy who accidentally turned into a Ghoul. Ghoul is a man-eating monster that founded in Islamic Folklore. At first, Tokyo Ghoul seems so promising many things, but in the reality, it failed. The story has a relatively slow pacing, for example in one episode only happened a few events only. And sometimesa dull feeling occurs in the story. The other problem that occurs is the is the individual elements of the story is not going so well, the mystery is relatively predictable, the battle scenes is decent and over-simplistic.  The plot seems not focusing on the main story, it spews out everywhere like a juice. The anime have a decent and fair enjoyment.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation seems decent, with a combination of typical battle scenes and common battle effect.  Also, there are some \u2018gore\u2019 scenes that been censored, it really reduce the horror feeling of the story. While the sound settings are good, Opening Songs is good and tolerated and the seiyuu did a fairly good job.\\n\\n\r\nThe character of Tokyo Ghoul done their roles pretty well. There is some scene that conducts some development, but despite that, the main problem that occurs is the lack of the main character development. Why? Because it feels very forced and far-fetched.  The characters have developed but not relate the development with the story itself. Also, the motive of the villain is very notional and still abstract.   \\n\\n\r\nTokyo Ghoul maybe breaks the watching list of 2014, the anime have a relatively rare settings but have many flaw and mistakes. Is it good\u2026\u2026..? or bad\u2026\u2026?. The answer lies in the center\u2026",

            "content": "=================\r\n                  INTRO\r\n=================\r\nIt has always intrigued me how zombies or flesh eating humans has not made much of a presence in the anime industry. There were shows like Highschool of the Dead (and that turned into a fanservice horsecrap), Hellsing (mostly vampires but there was and an arc which featured great zombie actions), Sankarea (which mainly focuses on romance and hope), Ore was zombie desu ka (which was quite an oddity but its one of those shows that I can watch for pure stupid fun!), and a couple more.There was really no show in this genre that has truly captivated me; then came Tokyo Ghouls...at least I first thought it would.\\n\\n\r\n=================\\n\r\n             THE REVIEW\\n\r\n=================\\n\\n\r\nThe series started off great. You have this normal college student named Kaneki who has a crush on this girl who share the same interest as him. All is good and well when shit quickly hits the fan and he ended up becoming a zombie; not just an ordinary zombie but one that is self-aware and has an unrelenting appetite to human flesh. It was great how the series tries to explore the dilemmas that a ghoul has to go through in his everyday life and how the everything is not as it seems.\\n\\n\r\nThe show was great until Ep 4 came. Everything just went so effin fast. The show introduced this psycho who wants to be more than friends with kaneki. The episode started off from exploring different character scenes and the psycho trying to woo kaneki over and within a couple of minutes they end in this arena slaughterhouse. It goes worse as the series went on and the last minutes of the final episode just puts that nail in the coffin.\\n\\n\r\nThe pacing is just so terrible that it's hard to sympathize with the character's plight. The one saving grace this show had is the last episode where they showed Kaneki's inner monologue. Now that is great way to show a character's state of mind. It is a huge disappointment and a wasted potential as I feel that Tokyo Ghoul is one of those character study shows all the while showing some great action scenes. There is just so many things happening to coherently fit into a 1 cour show. It was only until Ep 6 that I found out that there was a manga. Reviews on it has been pretty positive and I have seen that it was also recently finished so I am going to start reading it soon.\\n\\n\r\nLet's not also forget the censorship. Oh GOD! THE CENSORSHIP!! There are freaking times when the screen gets cut in half or just fades to black and all you hear is the audio. For god's sake! Studio Pierrot knows that this is a mature show aimed at an adult audience so why the fuck are you guys doing this? I will not be surprised if they end up removing those in BR just to boost its sales and  that will be very underhanded, man.\\n\\n\r\n=================\\n\r\n             VERDICT\\n\r\n=================\\n\\n\r\nThe art style and premise got me intrigued; the direction of the show made me wince. So, to finally wrap things up I will now be giving a final score which comprises the built-in scoring system coupled with my personal bias and a fairly complicated process of wiping my lips clean with a tissue smeared with aromatic blood after taking a sip at a bloody testicle juice mixed  with a straw made from dried human intestines makes me want to give Tokyo Ghoul a score of..\\n\\n\r\n6.4/10!\\n\\n\r\nA show with potential hampered by the production staff and dubious marketing strategies. Fans of the genre will be left hanging by the noose and is advised to look for their craving somewhere else. If you don't mind horrible pacing and extreme censorship you can stay for the action which is still pretty good.",

            "content": "As a non-manga reader of the original Tokyo Ghoul, i am going to base my review purely on this animated title.\r\nI feel that this show has a brilliant array of aspects to it it, the combat is very gripping and intense, there is violence, a significant amount of it which heightens the viewer's engagement with the situation, generally i'd say that these 12 episodes are very emotive and dramatic, which is shown very cleverly as becomes more obvious towards the end.\r\nDipping into the story for the first time is a bit of a shocker, and a lot to take in, but throughout, this anime willgive you a great slice of life experience from the perspective of a main character who grows to understand more about himself as the show persists. The set up is oriented about the friction between humans and a race of humanoid like beings: ghouls, and this friction is described and felt so vividly at times which i greatly credit the show for. \\n\\n\r\nThere is no doubt in my mind that this is a very engaging series, and asides from the violence, it does have the ability to fit a very wide range of viewers' tastes. This anime has a mature feel to it, and the art is the best I've come across yet. Continuing with my point of the show being very easily likable, there's a hell of a lot crammed into this (what frankly should be longer) series of episodes, which adds to the level of drama but perhaps detracts in that at times it feels rushed.\\n\\n\r\nBut essentially, if you're okay handling drama and violence, you'll not be disappointed. Tokyo Ghoul is a very reputable anime, that really will leave you on the edge of your seat at times!",

            "content": "Tokyo Ghoul was easily one of the most hyped titles in 2014.\r\nThat's an undeniable fact. The manga got lots of attention before and all the fans were happy to see their new favourite thing animated. But oh boy were they disappointed when it started airing.\r\nThe animation in general was, for 2014 standards, below average for the most part. Certain visual effects, such as the Kagunes were well-done The character figures were a mix of good and bad, with the good ones leaving memorable expressions on the viewer and the bad ones being stereotypical character designs everybody will have forgotten about in a week. The backgrounds,however, were all largely well-done and one could see the effort being put into them, a quality which is still present in the lower-budget sequel that is Route A. But well, this is where the good parts end. The general animation looked horrible for the most part to the point where one could see the weird looking limbs during fight scenes.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack wasn't too memorable but it fit the atmosphere of the show. The Opening was not too happy yet a bit too happy in general to completely capture the feeling of the show.\\n\r\nThe voice acting wasn't too outstanding either. Most characters weren't too memorable and there wasn't too much effort put into it for the biggest part. It was average voice acting, perhaps a bit less considering the modern anime standard.\\n\\n\r\nLet's now move on the important parts:\\n\r\nthe story and the characters.\\n\r\nIf one were to get vulgar, one could simply say \"they sucked ass\" but since I want to give a reason as for why that is so, let me elaborate on it:\\n\r\nThe premise was basically ghouls living in Japan among humans.\\n\r\nIt is above average for originality and differing from the modern \"haha, everything is moeblob or medieval fantasy action\" standard. Bonus points for that. Unfortunately, that's where the pros end and the cons begin. It was wasted. For the biggest part nobody ever seems to do anything against them, save for one special unit and warning signs telling kids not to leave their houses once the sun has sunk, and the ghouls themselves have close to no kind of order. The humans acting completely normal despite knowing there are dangerous beasts out there is somewhat questionable as well. And saying \"they are an urban legend\" is no excuse because there obviously is an anti-ghoul squad.\\n\r\nThe pacing of it was goddamn awful and was faster than a Ferrari. One could tell that the directors simply wanted to get the boring parts over with and show some scenes that \"kick ass\".\\n\r\nIt had no kind of complexity to it and was mainly just X moving to place 1 because event Y required him to do so. It was plot-driven and the characters were reacting instead of acting.\\n\r\nThe story itself ended with a cliffhanger after having shown Kaneki getting super insta speed character development over the course of 10 minutes and going from a crybaby to a \"badass\" that wouldn't bat an eye even if he lost his legs.\\n\\n\r\nWhich leads us to the next section, the characters.\\n\r\nThese are mainly made up out of semi archetypes like the crybaby protagonist, the strong female, the cute loli and the mysterious old leader. But cliches are cliches, right? Yeah, no.\\n\r\nTouka is a generic tsundere girl for the most part and has largely any kind of conflict until the Tsukiyama arc is over. This was a good backdrop yet provided no kind of development for her as a character since it was simply forgotten 10 minutes later.\\n\r\nKaneki is a crybaby who has lived a hard childhood which gave him the mindset \"it's better to be hurt than to hurt\" which for a large part excuses his actions. His development as a character was fairly interesting to see yet whenever he seemed to finally do something on his own, he turned into the baby he was at episode 1. In the final episodes he seemed to receive some sort of development which, unfortunately, happened way too quick to feel like proper development. It was like he was turned into another character.\\n\\n\r\nAnd now for some good excused scorings:\\n\r\nArt section : 4/10\\n\\n\r\nGeneral art: 4/10\\n\r\nCharacter figures: 4/10\\n\r\nAnimation: 4/10\\n\r\nBackgrounds: 6/10\\n\r\nVisual effects: 6/10\\n\\n\r\nSound section: 5/10\\n\\n\r\nVoice acting: 5/10\\n\r\nMusic themes: 4/10 for not entirely fitting the atmosphere\\n\r\nSound effects: 6/10\\n\\n\r\nStory section: 4/10\\n\\n\r\nPremise 4/10\\n\r\nPacing 2/10\\n\r\nComplexity: 3/10\\n\r\nConclusion: Not available/10. Therefore it can't be taken into account\\n\\n\r\nCharacter section: 4/10\\n\\n\r\nPersonality: 4/10\\n\r\nBackdrop: 4/10\\n\r\nDevelopment: 4/10 since only one character develops which also happens way too fast to be semi-realistic.\\n\\n\r\nFinal score: 4.3/10",

            "content": "Tokyo Ghoul is one of the most popular shows of the summer. Adapted from a popular manga, Tokyo Ghoul is set in an alternate reality in which beings called ghouls exist. Ghouls appear to be normal humans, but possess superhuman strength and survive by feeding on humans. Kaneki Ken is a college student who unwittingly receives the organs of a ghoul during an emergency transplant. Tokyo Ghoul follows Kaneki's new life as a half-human, half-ghoul.\r\nI was instantly intrigued by Tokyo Ghoul and the first episode did a nice job of sucking me in. I was prepared for a dark, gritty thrill-ride. Unfortunately, Tokyo Ghoul didnot meet my expectations and turned out to be the most over-hyped show of the summer.\\n\\n\r\nPerhaps at the root of all of its problems is the fact that Tokyo Ghoul should have been twice as long. No matter how you cut it, trying to cram such a massive amount of information into only 12 episodes will never end well. I'm unfamiliar with the manga, but judging from those who have read it, the anime skipped a significant amount of the story and this is painfully evident in the choppy, broken pacing of the anime. The first few episodes flow smoothly enough, only to devolve into a mess by the show's conclusion. There's no sense of transition or linkage, and there's simply not enough time allowed for any meaningful character development. Moreover, pivotal plot points are given hardly more than a glance and they fail to really hit home because--again--there's not enough time. Why such a popular and anticipated adaptation was given only 12 episodes, I will never understand. The broken structure of Tokyo Ghoul is saved only by the fact that at the end of the day, the plot is still interesting. Yes, Tokyo Ghoul is a poorly-executed mess, but the ride is still fun enough to hold your attention.\\n\\n\r\nI really disliked Kaneki as a character. I don't know how his progression goes in the manga, but in the anime his characterization is pretty damn bad. Even as the story jumps aimlessly all over the place, at least it's still going somewhere. Kaneki remained static throughout the show and as its main protagonist, this provides for a very frustrating viewing experience. I found that Touka was much more engaging on screen and I felt that she definitely stole the show. Touka is dynamic, angsty, headstrong, and she is by far Tokyo Ghoul's best aspect. With regards to the anti-ghoul investigators, I'm not exactly sure how they factor into the plot. They seemed to exist simply for the sake of existing and only really contributed to one or two pivotal plot points. By the second half of the show it's easy to dismiss them as almost irrelevant. The rest of the characters didn't get enough screen time for me to really have any opinion on them.\\n\\n\r\nAt the end of the day, Tokyo Ghoul is pretty much the definition of wasted potential. Appealing art, an intriguing story, and well-received source material does not equal a good end product. Combine that with a measly 12 episodes, some of the worst pacing I've ever seen, an atrocious ending, an even more atrocious opening theme (I really don't understand its appeal), and you have the formula for how to create a massive disappointment. Tokyo Ghoul's two redeeming factors: Touka and the intrinsic appeal of the story. I certainly hope the second season will not make the same mistakes as the first.\\n",

            "content": "OK I had to write this review as all I saw on this page was a load of reviews with really low scores which is bizarre as this anime is actually really good.\r\nSome people claim that this anime is a bad adaptation of the manga which I completely disagree with. While this is not a perfect adaptation and some scenes have been changed around I do not think that this makes this Anime bad in any way. It is more like a slightly different take on the story which is still very good in its own right. \r\nHaving read the manga the manga and theanime are for the most part the same. There are some scenes in the anime which have been rearranged and a few smaller scenes that have been cut most likely due to restraints of the 12 episode anime format, but overall it is very close to the manga and does a great job of adapting all of the main scenes.\\n\\n\r\nI will say that Kaneki's character is presented slightly differently in the Anime as opposed to the Manga though. In the Manga he does come across as being more competent and heroic due to the slight change of a couple of key scenes and the omission of another quite major scene in the last arc. So I recommend that people check out the Manga as well to see this difference. \\n\\n\r\nI wouldn't say that this spoils the Anime though it actually made more sympathetic towards him in a way, so it is a different take on his character similar to the original Evangelion series and the rebuild movies. Kaneki is a bit more passive and reactive in the Anime as opposed to being more of a proactive competent protagonist in the Manga.  \\n\\n\r\nIf you don't like the more sensitive reactive kind of protagonists then you may dislike the main character in this Anime. I love those kind of characters though so its a matter of taste. \\n\\n\r\nThis anime kept me on the edge of my seat and it was very addictive and I couldn't wait for the next episode. The main themes of humans and ghouls trying to coexist and the complications emerging from this were well explored in the story and character interactions. The story goes into a lot of detail in fleshing out the setting to show the different perspectives of the ghoul and human characters. The picture painted is not a black and white good vs evil story but a multi layered one with different shades of grey. You will sympathise with both human and ghoul characters and also despise some of the human and ghoul characters, so the anime does a good job of getting you emotionally involved with the story. \\n\\n\r\nThe production values of the anime are overall very good with some awesome battle scenes and great music and sound effects. Special note must be made of the voice acting which especially for the main character really stood out as being exceptionally good. \\n\\n\r\nThis is probably the bloodiest anime I've seen and the attention detail in the fight scenes and blood and gore really was spectacular. You do really need to watch the uncensored version of this Anime. I feel it is unfair how people have marked this Anime down due to the censorship of the TV version because the Uncensored version of this Anime really does do the Manga justice in the level of gore. It is actually more gory than the Manga in certain parts with one new added scene in particular that really was very disturbing and very well executed. \\n\\n\r\nThe are a couple of standout scenes in this anime which really got to me emotionally, the pacing was very good to lead up to these events and they made this anime really memorable.\\n\\n\r\nOne particular episode is up there with the best I've ever seen in anime so I highly recommend this anime to everyone.\\n\\n\r\nTokyo Ghoul really was an intense and unforgettable experience.",

            "content": "Tokyo Ghoul is another fine example that animes are not for kids. The anime thrills you. They start with huge bang and ends with even bigger bang. The last episode leaves you begging for more. They lost momentum somewhere in between but its completely fine they made up for it with last episode that makes u scream with **** being tortured, question the world as **** speaks, and make u jump along with the action sequence. \r\nFlaws:\r\nDespite of the epicness i have mentioned there are some loopholes as well. If you haven't read the manga then its fine but if you have then you willbe left disappointed as lot of scenes are skipped. Censorship is the worst thing that the studio have gone to that anime. The anime are definitely not for kids and yet they are censoring every blood scene as its gonna effect some adult minds. Cowardly act by studio or trick to make viewers buy Blu ray discs either way its a pathetic act from studio. So if you have patience then please wait for Blu ray to come out. When all said and done Anime should have been 24 episodes long, scenes are skipped, pace is too fast, leaves you with an incomplete story. All these flaws would have been avoided if studio would have been a little more sensible. \\n\r\nStory:\\n\r\nThe first episode is enough to tell you that story is a masterpiece. Different people trying to make world a better place but their ways of achieving its make the world even a worse place. Story make you question your perception of  stereotype. And gives you some lessons as well. Sometimes being good is enough you have to let the beast inside you to go out to save your justice. Thats what the story taught me and you will realize what am i talking about in last episode\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nThere isn't a single character that disappoints in any way.Its an all out crowd of bad ass characters in just one anime.\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nIf you are into psychological thriller then you will enjoy it most. Those looking for action, drama or little bit of horror will enjoy it as well. There are some funny scenes in animes but its mostly dominated by action, suspense, horror, sorrow and thrills.",

But oh man I was wrong.\r\nIt isn't that bad actually, in fact the universe and concept is VERY well done, but just like SAO, it's excecuted more poorly than a backwards bowling shot. The series itself looks great, and the OP and ED sound awesome. However, the characters was what really ruined it for me.\r\nMeet Kaneki, a boy who doesn't want to stop crying. Now I know that he'sturned into a ghoul, but sometimes I just feel that he goes overboard with the complaining. I'm not gonna spoil about what happens in the end, but for me it was very underwhelming.\\n\\n\r\nAlso there's Touka, your average fangirl favorite. She's just there to make her seem like the perfect character, which I found extremely bland. Also the relationship between her and Kaneki was weak at best.\\n\\n\r\nThere are also other characters, but I don't feel like they are too important.\\n\\n\r\nThe BIGGEST complaint I have, is the fact that every ghoul is a handsome young boy or girl. First of all, why. This was the perfect opportunity to show off the dark and gritty life of being a middle-aged man in Tokyo, but no. Of course everyone had to be handsome and long-haired.\\n\\n\r\nAlso, why is coffee the only human beverage the ghouls can drink? I mean REALLY? That is so pathetic\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I'm giving this a 4, because I really like the universe and the art. Although it's pretty dissapointing that GIFs on Tumblr are more interesting than the show itself",

            "content": "Tokyo Ghoul is directed by Shuhei Morita which was based on a manga by Sui Ishida.\r\nSTORY (8):\r\nThe story follows Ken Kaneki, a college student who meets a woman named Rize Kamishiro at Anteiku, a coffee shop. They share an interest in literature and plan a date. However, Rize attacked Kaneki and it was revealed that Rize was a ghoul, human-like beast that feeds on human flesh. While Rize tries to kill Kaneki for good, she was crushed by a falling platform. Both Kaneki and Rize are sent to hospital. The doctor decided to transplant Rize's organs into Kaneki's. So from now on, Kaneki has tolive a life of a half-human/half-ghoul.\\n\\n\r\nThe concept sounds interesting but it suffers from some lack of explanations. Like ghouls, how do they exist in the world and how do they interact and deal with life.\\n\\n\r\nART (8):\\n\\n\r\nMany people are bothered by censorship of blood and organs. However, I didn't mind that as long as they have good plot and good characters. The animation is good. At least they give some creepy vibe but not so creepy to the point that I fear for my life all the time like the design of the eyes that are red.\\n\\n\r\nThe ghouls design looks like Gaara when he becomes a beast, however the difference is the pattern and color.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND (8):\\n\\n\r\nAt least the opening and ending song is good.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER (7):\\n\\n\r\nYou know, normally in action anime, the characters are the weakest.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters that stood out the most in this anime are Shu & Toka.\\n\\n\r\nShu is cunning and calm just like Hisoka from Hunterxhunter. Mamoru Miyano did a great job in making this character cunning.\\n\\n\r\nToka is a badass and she always has a mean attitude just like Revy from Black Lagoon. However, I do like her in the way she is brave and willing to take risks.\\n\\n\r\nYoshimura is like a father figure who is concerned about ghouls and especially try to help Kaneki in every possible way he can.\\n\\n\r\nHinami Fueguchi could at least have more material to work with because she always stays at home and never fights. But then again, I wasn't expecting much from her.\\n\\n\r\nKen Kaneki, oh boy. Where do I begin? He is the weakest of the bunch. I can understand that he is trying to adapt to a life of a human-ghoul. But the problem is that in the later episodes, he became useless and more annoying just like Yukiteru Amano from Mirai Nikki. He has the ultimate power among the bunch but the problem is he just couldn't do anything to save himself. Even during a fight scene with Amon, he just dodges but never land a single attack. I just feel ashamed of him.\\n\\n\r\nCONCLUSION (8):\\n\\n\r\nAlthough I have problems with the show, I enjoyed this anime regardless. I just hope that they will at least try to give some characters more development and give us more explanation on how ghouls exist. \\n\\n\r\nSo for what it's worth I give it an 8/10.",

            "content": "\"Tokyo Ghoul is so deep and mature!\"\r\n- A random pretentious edgy 12-year-old \r\nAfter the ending of Attack on Titan, the anime community realized that they needed something to fill the void that was left behind. Another anime about humans vs. monsters, with beautiful music and visuals (aimed at 12-year-olds who believe that everything with blood is mature), but that in reality is just an advertisement for the way better manga was exactly what the community wanted. And then we got Tokyo Ghoul, one of the most overhyped anime I've ever seen. If you heard the fans talking about it, you almost believed that this wasthe best work of fiction ever created, with deep philosophical themes, well developed characters and a brilliant story. In reality there was another damn story about humans vs. monsters (and one of the humans becomes a monster, so original), a bland cast and an attempt to raise the question \"are the ghouls or the humans the monsters?\", but even Elfen Lied handled this better.\\n\\n\r\n~Story~ 2/10\\n\r\nKaneki is your average shy and boring protagonist, who has a date with a girl who's at least ten times as hot as he is. Then she turns into a ghoul (a monster that eats humans) and tries to eat our poor hero, because of plot convenience some kind of organization drops a bunch of metal bars exactly on the girl and she dies, the wounded Kaneki who magically survives, gets some organs from the girl and he turns into a half-ghoul. Of course it's totally possible for a doctor to transplant organs from a ghoul into a human without getting trouble and of course our hero is now special, because he's both human and ghoul. He teams up with a bunch of ghouls who only eat death people and befriends a tsundere called Touka. Then we watch how the ghouls are victimized, because how can humans be so evil that they try to kill monsters who try to eat them? Only 99% percent of ghouls is evil, there is no reason to kill all of those murderous, psychotic monsters because 1% of the ghouls is good, right? What kind of logic is that?! \"We have to make sure that the audience feels sorry for the monsters, let's make the humans kill a little innocent ghoul girl's mother and laugh psychotic while doing it, that's not obvious and cheap right?\" It is, all the villains in this show look like comic book villains, laugh while murdering innocent people and probably strangle little cats for fun, they're not realistic at all! Everyone tries to kill poor Kaneki, because apparently half-ghouls are tasty, why? I have no idea. There is something going on between episode 1 and 11 that can be described as a plot, but you can summarize it in one sentence: people try to kill Kaneki and ghouls are victimized, the end. But then there is a shocking, extremely original plot twist....... victimization- power-up. Oh and an unsatisfying conclusion, read the manga or wait for season 2!\\n\r\n{CONCLUSION}\\n\r\nThe story consists of the constant and never ending victimization of monsters. No, there is no reason to sympathize with the ghouls. Yes, of course they just want to survive, but the same thing goes for the humans. And the humans aren't victimized 24/7 in this show. The ghouls aren't 100% evil, but neither are they 'misunderstood' like the director of this anime seems to think. The story is weak and there are unanswered questions and plotholes EVERYWHERE! Like why do the humans keep living the same way as before, when they are surrounded with murderous psychotic human eating monsters? Where are Kaneki's parents? Why does a certain persons hair turn white? How do metal bars fall exactly on the right spot? How can ghouls drink coffee, but no other kind of drinks? Why is every human either pathetic or evil?Why didn't the humans just force everyone to eat food and then checked the people who started vomiting, would that be too logical? And the most important question: why do people claim that this anime has a good story?!\\n\\n\r\n~Animation~ 9/10\\n\r\nThe backgrounds were detailed and gorgeous, the character designs were original and the battle scenes looked epic. I have only one problem with the animation: censorship. I personally hate it when half of the screen is covered with black bars, and I assume that most other people aren't a fan of black bars either.\\n\r\n{CONCLUSION}\\n\r\nIt looked great, even though the story is (supposed to be) dark, the animators used vivid colors, I think that this was a good idea. The gouls looked beautifully creepy during the fight scenes (look at those eyes), but the censoring was horrible.\\n\\n\r\n~Sound~ 9/10\\n\r\n'Unravel' was amazing. Yes, it was a bit edgy, but I don't even care. The OST's were all somewhere in between decent and almost perfect and they were used in the right scenes. The Japanese voice acting was also top notch, especially the voice actors of Rize and Tsukiyama brought their characters to life.\\n\r\n{CONCLUSION}\\n\r\nThe sound was extremely good, the ending song was forgettable but the opening makes up for that. The (Japanese) voice acting was great and the OST's were used at the right moments.\\n\\n\r\n~Characters~ 1/10\\n\r\nThey were a pain to watch. The most side characters just were there for 2 minutes and then disappeared just to never come back again. Kaneki is a walking punchbag, who cries a lot, pretty much the whole anime. And I don't feel sorry for him, because he is an overvictimised whiny brat. His development/ character swap in the last episode was weird and unrealistic (Spoiler: when most people are almost tortured to death, they don't turn in a badass). The best thing about him is his masker, great main character! Touka is your average tomboy and all her development is thrown out of the window in the last episode. Then you have bestfriend-kun, oldinspirationalman-kun, psychomurder-kun and victimizedlittlegirl-chan. Boring. Rize was an okay character during her 5 minutes of screen time and Amon seemed to think like a rational human being, those two were endurable. Special mention for Shuu Tsukiyama, he was great meme material and another horrible sadist, obsessed with our amazing main character, really what this anime needed!\\n\r\n{CONCLUSION}\\n\r\nOne of the weakest casts I've seen in a very long time. The main character is a joke, the rest of the cast a nuisance. The were either bland or over-the-top evil and sadistic. None of them was memorable and their development was either nonexistent or it came out of nowhere. A plain bad cast, but the voice acting was pretty good, what a waste.\\n\\n\r\n~Enjoyment~ 4/10\\n\r\nBeautiful music, great animation, shitty story and characters, what's new? This seems to be a trend of the last few years (yes, there are exceptions, but in general most new anime follow this pattern). This anime was enjoyable, but so damn forgettable, nothing about the story or the characters was memorable. If you turn of your brain and just want to watch an action series with nice visuals and sound, then Tokyo Ghoul is made for you. But if you want something with substance, don't watch this show. Also the last episode was predictable and the lack of a conclusion is annoying. Maybe that's the biggest problem, it ends with an open ending (watch the sequel) and leaves the viewer with a lot of unanswered questions, but it's not a cliffhanger. I don't want to watch the sequel, because I don't care anymore. If they ended it with something less predictable, I might have felt the urge to watch the damn sequel. Right now I just don't care. \\n\r\n{CONCLUSION}\\n\r\nIt could have been great. Imagine: an anime with amazing visuals, great music, an actual story about prejudice an discrimination and well written characters. Sadly enough, the last two things were nowhere to be found in Tokyo Ghoul. It's just another shounen anime, that's trying way to hard to be a seinen, but fails miserably. It was overhyped, overrated and a waste of time. If you want to watch a mindless shounen with epic battles, Tokyo Ghoul is great choice, but if you want anything with substance, then I would advice you to skip it. Peace!",

            "content": "Tokyo Ghoul will capture your attention with the captivating storyline in episode one, and will leave you interested throughout the series with its mixture of action, horror, and psychological concepts. The series will then end by leaving you thinking about the world of ghouls and humans, and who the monster really is. Are ghouls in the wrong for simply wanting to survive? Are humans right to exterminate the ghouls because the ghouls are killing people? There are so many questions you will be asking yourself as you watch this series.\r\nAn interesting aspect of the series was the use of weapons in the form of \u201cKagune\u201d.Each ghoul possesses a Kagune that is unique to them, so each one is different. Kagune come from the ghoul\u2019s body and can be many forms, from a blade to claws to wings and many more. Ghouls use their Kagune to attack humans, as well as other ghouls. On top of all that, humans have found a way to harness the power of a ghoul\u2019s Kagune and are able to turn the Kagune into a weapon for the human\u2019s use. This somewhat levels the playing field between ghouls and humans. It is nice to see the humans stand a chance against the ghouls and not just get wiped out. If you have seen D.Grayman or Akame ga Kill, the weapon concept is similar.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are memorable, with development throughout the season. The animation is well-done. The story progresses at a decent pace with a proper mixture of action and dialogue. The violence is heavy, but in the version I watched, it is censored by covering the most grotesque animation with black, which is not unique to Tokyo Ghoul, it seems to be the most common way to censor violence in anime. For me personally, this was one of the few negatives I would mention about the series, if you are going to censor the anime, do not make it so obvious, especially when all the gruesome sounds are still present. In conclusion, there is a censored and an uncensored version, so if you do not handle violence well, there is a friendlier version for you.\\n\\n\r\nYou might enjoy this if: You can handle a brain-twisting anime that will touch on your buttons of psychological fear. If you enjoyed Deadman Wonderland, you will likely enjoy Tokyo Ghoul.\\n\\n\r\nYou might not like it if: You are sensitive to violence, gore, and the horror genre. Certain scenes of Tokyo Ghoul are some of the most grisly out there.\\n\\n\r\nNote to the Viewer: Be prepared for an action-packed thrill ride that will have you captivated from the first episode!",

            "content": "\"All the suffering in this world is born from an individual's incompetence. The person who told me that was a real piece of shit.\" - Jason\r\nPreface:\r\nThis is the first part of my full Tokyo Ghoul review, and will be solely for the first season. I'm splitting them up because I felt it would be easier to follow and allow me to go into more detail about why this season is worthy of a decent score. This is NOT a manga review. Those have a place, and this is not it. I have not read the Tokyo Ghoul manga, but I have informed myself of whereit differs from the anime.\\n\\n\\n\r\nArtwork and Animation: 6\\n\\n\r\nThe first and last several episodes aside, Tokyo Ghoul has very average character models, fluidity, and overall consistency. While there are some nicely animated fight scenes, and a few very intense moments, the majority of it is 'meh'. There are some scenes where the kagune look like living, pulsating tentacles with marks and veiny looking details drawn on, and other times they look like a 4 year old went wild with the red, purple, and blue crayons. Overall, it works, but this isn't some hyperrealistic animation.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound and Voice Acting: 8\\n\\n\r\nNatsuki Hanae does a great job playing the timid, scared, and conflicted Ken in Tokyo Ghoul. While not Oscar material, definitely a good role, and one I found believable. Mamoru Miyama (Light, Death Note) is glorious as Tsukiyama, and Rie Kugimiya (Alphonse, FMAB) is fantastic as Juzo.  Overall decent sounding and with a veteran voice cast, can't go wrong here.\\n\\n\r\nThe opening theme, \"Unravel\" is a nice song to start the show, and a good mood setter as well.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 7\\n\\n\r\nUnlike Root A, it's very plain that Ken is the MC here. After his unplanned initiation to the world of ghouls, Ken becomes an extremely conflicted and detached person; unable to reconcile who he is, or what he has to do to survive, he shuts down and withdraws from life. \\n\\n\r\nThrough Ken, we're able to see the injustice and morally gray lives of the ghouls. There are those who would see their status as ghoul as an affliction, something that turns them into outcasts on the fringe of society, hunted by the government. There are also those who embrace their identity of ghoul as empowerment and use it to commit unspeakable evil. \\n\\n\r\nKen, as both human and ghoul, (due to the emergency surgery he receives after being attacked by a ghoul) is lost. On the one hand, he has to eat to survive, and the only way is to consume the flesh of a human. Yet, Ken refuses to give up his humanity, seeing it as cannibalism and denies himself until the point where he's being driven insane by his insatiable hunger for flesh that he would kill his own best friend. With nowhere else to turn, Ken manages to find a way out that doesn't involve murder, but does involve him addressing his inner turmoil.\\n\\n\r\nOther cast of note include: the emo scenester Touka, who serves as Ken's guide into the world of ghoul, Hide, Ken's best friend and human influence, Amon, the naive young special investigator of the CCG, and the wonderfully sick Tsukiyama and Jason.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 8 \\n\\n\r\nIt's this angst that drives the first season of Tokyo Ghoul, and it works well. The inner conflict of Ken trying to reconcile his dualistic nature, and learning what it means to be hunted for things far beyond his control lend an air of mystery and suspense to the show, for there are far, far worse ghouls out there than the ones he meets at Antique. \\n\\n\r\nNewly introduced into this hidden world, Ken learns that there are factions of ghouls that would seek to overthrow the CCG, the Commission of Counter-Ghoul, a special police force created to eradicate the terroristic threat that the ghouls pose to the wards of Tokyo. They're violent, merciless, and extremely bloodthirsty. Not only do these ghouls want to kill humans and devour them, but some of the sickest among them even hunger for ghoul as well.\\n\\n\r\nAlong with these groups, there are also peaceful ghouls that try to camouflage themselves in society by posing as ordinary people in mundane jobs, as students, and as a human being. There is a good portion of the plot dealing with how conflicts between the groups arise, which plays out suspensefully. The nail that sticks out gets hammered, and the ghouls are no different. The ghouls who commit the most crimes get more CCG investigators sent to their area, which further escalates the tension and violence. When these aggressive ghouls invade the territory of the peaceful ones, inquisitors follow, spelling a change in the way of life for those of the ghoul persuasion. \\n\\n\\n\r\nThe plot functions in small arcs, with Nishio, Tsukiyama, and Jason + Aogiri being the different headlining acts split up with the CCG side of the story as seen through the eyes of Amon and Kureo Mado. The action has weight and consequences, and nearly turns into grimdark horror by the end. Overall, the pacing and flow are pretty even, though the series thickens at the end in anticipation of Root A, it doesn't suffer for it. \\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8\\n\\n\r\nTokyo Ghoul is fun. I've heard it likened unto being a digest version of some heavier anime that are more existential or focused on moral ambiguity, but Tokyo Ghoul is more about the action than a deeper meaning. There are a couple of twists, but nothing that groundbreaking. Personally, what was better about Tokyo Ghoul than Root A was how it was focused on the characters, and their interactions within themselves AND with the others around them versus being one giant battle for the entire season. \\n\\n\r\nKen is faced with the trolley problem (sacrifice the few to save the many) late in the season, and due to his personality and his life up until that point, he's unable to decide, since he'd always been the timid, repressed one that went along with the crowd. Crippled with indecision, Ken ultimately ends up saving no-one when he tries to save everyone. He is presented with a harsh truth- a consequentialist one. A truth that says that his choices are the ones that he's to be judged on, and that if he chooses not to, then it's all on him- the lives of others, of his friends, family, and even the innocent he fails to protect. \\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8\\n\\n\r\ntl;dr\\n\\n\r\n+ Character driven story\\n\r\n+ Dark, dramatic, and brutal at times\\n\\n\r\n+/- Some annoying characters\\n\\n\r\n- Anime logic/biology*\\n\\n\r\n*(Getting impaled and living through it, numerous times. Two characters fall off a 50+ floor skyscraper, and the one that gets crushed by falling girders from the same height's organs are in better shape than the one that just fell... like wtf? The force of a ghoul character's kick on a human character hits them with such force that they fly 25 feet or so in the air, through a concrete wall. The acceleration force of that kick alone would have liquefied the other character's organs, never mind the blunt force trauma death.)\\n\\n\\n\r\nRecommend?\\n\\n\r\nYes, I'd say Tokyo Ghoul is worth a watch. If you like a dark, action oriented show, it'll fill the void nicely.",

            "content": "I love this show. I hate the second season, but I love this show. Now, as a warning, I'm aware of the manga, I'm aware that it's supposed to be better, but I have not read it yet. So, no manga bias in any direction going forward. Let's go everybody!\r\nStory : 8\r\nTokyo Ghoul's story is very character driven, and at some points it even feels a little like... I don't want to say slice of life, but there are a couple of moments. The biggest theme of Tokyo Ghoul is that of Identity Crisis, something I think was very well done here. In addition, thisshow has some of the best world building I've ever seen, only outclass, in my opinion, by Log Horizon. The show gives several examples of various types and classes of ghouls, from binge eaters, to gourmets, to that one guy that gets killed episode one. Screw you, Nishio.\\n\\n\r\nThat said, there are two general issues that drag this from a 9 or 10 to an 8. First, there are a LOT of plot holes early on (e.g. How come falling pipes manage to hurt Rize, a ghoul shown to have some exceptional speed?, How did the CCG get quinques in the first place, if traditional weapons can't hurt ghouls?, etc.). The other major issue is the lack of an ending. Several plot threads are left hanging. This wouldn't bother me too much, since there is a second season, but I'll tackle the issues with that another day.\\n\\n\r\nArt : 6\\n\r\nThe art style is well done. The character designs are, at least to me, quite cool-looking, and I love some of the mask designs as well. However, I can't compliment the animation because I CAN'T SEE MOST OF IT. The show is littered with unnecessary censorship. If you watch this show, watch the DVD/BR version. Apparently, the censorship is supposed to be gone in that.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9\\n\r\nThe voice acting was solidly done. Currently, there is no dub (I can deal), but the original va is brilliantly done, and even features the wonderful hamming of Mamoru Miyano.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is pretty good, though nothing stood out TOO much to me. However, I'd be remiss if I didn't mention the opening theme. Unravel is one of the best songs I've heard in a while, and nearly every remix of it I've listened to has been enjoyable, even, shockingly enough, the dubstep version.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9\\n\r\nTokyo Ghoul's strongest point, by far. Going hand-in-hand with its world building, the characters are wonderfully explored. The MC, Kaneki Ken, is a character who starts off wimpy, falls in love (okay it was more of a crush), and loses his entire sense of identity. Ah, to be young again. But seriously, as much as he cries and complains about his new situation, he handles it quite well, and as time goes along, he finds the virtues of his fellow ghouls.\\n\\n\r\nHide is the stereotypical best-friend character, though that didn't stop me from liking him. The best way to describe Touka would be a tsundere, though that's not necessarily a bad thing here. She's still awesome, but not overly fleshed out.\\n\\n\r\nI found Hinami incredibly relatable, especially since she's the character who essentially loses her innocence, and oddly doesn't crumble completely because of it. Plus, as a Japanese language student, I love the whole \"How do you read this kanji?\" thing.\\n\\n\r\nTsukiyama is just plain brilliant. Creepy, but brilliant. Moving on.\\n\\n\r\nIn the CCG, we've got two major characters, Mado and Amon. Mado is easily hate-able, which I can approve of in an antagonist if it's intentional. Amon is a brilliant foil to Kaneki, representing Kaneki's once-held beliefs about ghouls. He's your 'lawful good' character for the show, and I think the whole moral issue with him was wonderfully executed, at least in this season.\\n\\n\r\nLast, but certainly not least is Rize. She's the whole reason we have a plot, and I love her for it. After Kaneki is implanted with her organs, she starts speaking to him like a mix of subconscious and conscious thought. And. She's . Amazing. My only issue is that, like the plot, she just... ends. I would have loved to see her fleshed out more. Was she always a binge eater, or did something drive her to that? Was she sincere with Kaneki, liking books and him, or did she lie just to get another meal?\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment : 8\\n\r\nThis show was a ride, and I don't think there was a single episode that I disliked.\\n\\n\r\nOverall : 8\\n\r\nThis show would be an instant recommendation if the second season didn't ruin what good this first season set up. I still think it's brilliant, but I find it hard to recommend something with no good resolution.",

            "content": "This anime was eye-catching with its stunning visuals and also its brilliant opening.The opening was extremely detailed as it included the ghoul eyes in the ghouls reflections. Furthermore  its opening sound track brilliantly executed by Yamada Yutaka and it also complimented the stunning art. However it had its downfall as there was a lack of development in the characters background, also it tried to introduce too much characters in 12 episodes. They could have improved this by focusing on the main chracters and by also showing Kaneki's inner conflict with Rise. In my opinion the best episodes were the first and last as bothepisode kept  the audience at the edge of their seats.Personally I think that the manga was better as you got to see more of Kanzeki's fights as a bad ass. The series story is a very thought out idea as it shows conflict between ghouls and humans just as the writer wanted it, but the main character is a wimp who wants co-existence between human and ghoul he does nothing to show for this except cry throughout the entire series.The last episode however contradicted Ken's wimpy persona and he transformed into a total bad ass which the audience wanted to see. Another fail in character development was that they added a paedophile who did nothing but sniff Ken's blood on a napkin throughout the whole series. I hope that season two fill in the mistakes season one made and also I hope to see more of Rise's past as she is my favourite character in the entire series.",

            "content": "Looking back at the summer 2014 season, one of the most popular shows that aired was Tokyo ghoul, an adaption of a manga of the same name. And, just like any other anime fanatic, it caught my attention. When it comes to hyped up anime shows, there is generally one aspect of them that makes them good, whether it be the story line or the characters, but you tend to be skeptical of their actual worth. Popularity doesn't always mean 'Good' and Tokyo Ghoul seemed very popular at the time, and even some of my friends recommended it to me. For the sake of it'sreputation and others curiosity, I decided to review it. Take note that this is just a review on the anime as a stand alone, without consideration for the manga since I haven't actually read it yet. \\n\\n\r\nStory: I found the plot to be interesting and thrilling. The story takes place in Tokyo, Japan, where mysterious 'Ghouls' devour humans. And our protagonist, Kaneki, meets a ghoul which leads to certain events occurring and him eventually becoming a ghoul himself, and the story progresses from there on. I think part of what makes the story interesting to watch is simply the idea of ghouls and humans, the conflict between them and how they struggle to live in peace together and come to a consensus. In a sense, this is kind of realistic to the world we live in today. We humans struggle to find peace and prosperity, and this theme is portrayed in the story, through ghouls and humans. Different perspectives are shown in the story, and it makes you wonder where the story will go, how it will unfold. There is also a lot of action in it, but with a lot more blood and gore which I liked, It added to the thrill and excitement of the show. The only issue I really had with the story was the pacing. I'm not sure how it compares to the manga, but the pacing wasn't consistent. It felt to fast, especially at the beginning, which affected the development of the story. Other than that, I thought the story was solid and compelling.\\n\\n\r\nArt: The animation style was fairly good. It's not the best, but I didn't find anything particularly bad about it, nor did it affect the enjoyment of the show. Backgrounds stood out, and were some nice colors in certain scenes. The character designs were good, capturing the details of the characters, and are close to the original from what I have seen in the manga. The quinces and kagune's looked quite nice and sharp, as well as the details of the Ghoul's eyes. There were also some violent scenes that were censored, which I didn't like, but it depends on you.  \\n\\n\r\nSound: The music was great. I loved the OP, it sounds epic and it's fitting for the show. The BGM's weren't the best, but it's noticeable. The voice acting was good, and the characters were all conveyed well. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: I would have to say that the characters are the weakest part of this show. There really wasn't much character development and this may be partly due to the fast pacing of the show. There were times where Kaneki felt like a side character, and I personally found him to be somewhat annoying. There are also other peculiar characters, such as Hide, but 12 episodes wasn't enough to really flesh out his character and many others. I'm guessing and hoping that there will be more character development in the second season, where we will get to learn more about the cast members as well as see Kaneki's thoughts and monologues more.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Overall, I was satisfied with Tokyo Ghoul. I'm not sure how it compares to the manga, so I can't judge the faithfulness of the adaption, but the anime alone was solid. The characters need a bit more work, but the story line and concept was quite interesting, so I was able finish it with no problem. If you like anime shows with lots of blood and gore action along with a thrilling plot, then this is for you. If you prefer more light-hearted, less serious anime shows, then this may not be for you. It's a show with a good amount of potential, I look forward to the second season!",

            "content": "Tokyo ghoul one of the most popular and hyped shows of 2014, but does it live up to its hype. No it doesn\u2019t. The anime however popular it may be fell trap to one of the most common problems such as pacing issues and not enough character development.\r\nOk let\u2019s look at the characters Kaneki ken a normal college student who gets implanted ghoul organs and is therefore a ghoul, creatures who must eat humans for food, and he fights to hold on to his humanity. Fairly interesting but if you think this is going to be great story with attack on titan-esque fights and animationyou\u2019re going to be disappointed. Tokyo ghoul doesn\u2019t support either side it shows the struggles of humans and ghouls alike and leaves it to the reader to determine who is wrong. The anime tries to show both sides of the story but fails, due to rushed pace. If studio Pierrot decided it was a good idea to cram 60 chapters of the manga into a short 12 episode series it failed miserably. He protagonist and the side characters missed out on character development the anime thought was not important enough.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation was below average for an anime airing in 2014; the only notably good episodes were either the first or last episode. The animation itself for the characters sometimes felt unnatural and disordered. The fight scenes and the kagune were good to see animated, they were colorful. Chracter designs are pretty good and close to source material. Although during the original airing the censorship made quite a wreck of the show.\\n\\n\r\nThe music for this show was pretty good, the opening was quite catchy and the ending was alright. The music took a huge step up in the last episode it fit the fight perfectly.\\n\\n\r\nThe show to anime only viewers should be pretty enjoyable. My friends thought this was the best show of 2014 (obviously they haven\u2019t seen much anime). However for me after watching it decided to read the manga from scratch and boy did the anime disappoint me. I preferred the manga for everything but the fight scenes which were good to see animated.\\n\\n\r\nOverall the show is good for people who enjoy action and can stand a disjointed pace. For people who are expecting actual plot and a good story I would not recommend this to them.\\n\\n\r\nStory- 6\\n\r\nArt- 7\\n\r\nSound- 8\\n\r\nCharacters- 7\\n\r\nEnjoyment- 7.5\\n\r\nOverall- 7 \\n",

            "content": "As a stand-alone work, the Tokyo Ghoul anime is enjoyable, but it is lacking; it falls short in a few aspects that could make it truly great. So, if one is trying to choose between watching the anime OR reading the manga, the most fulfilling course of action would be to skip this and find chapter 1. The source material fills the gaps in the anime that prevent it from being more than just a fun thing to watch.\r\nNow, onto the details:\r\nStory - 7/10\r\nIt's tough for me to objectively rate the story of Tokyo Ghoul, the anime, without comparing it to the manga, butI'll try my best. The story seems somewhat cliche at first, but it's executed in a manner that makes it very different from anime with similar concepts -- it's a very character-driven story, and because the characters are mostly three-dimensional, well-developed, and fascinating, the story feels fresh. It's engaging and well-paced; it goes fast enough to really suck you in, but it slows down just enough to build suspense, as well. It's definitely not for the faint of heart, or for people who don't like sad stories. But if you're like me and you like dark, tragic stories, Tokyo Ghoul is a good choice. \\n\\n\r\nArt - 6/10\\n\r\nAt first, the art seems okay, if not a little mundane style-wise. As the show progresses, however, it becomes apparent that Tokyo Ghoul needs a more atmospheric and interesting style to suit its themes. Tokyo Ghoul is set apart from other anime in that it has its own brand of twistedness -- after all, it's a story about a protagonist whose body and mind take a turn for the horrific. What Pierrot came up with was, unfortunately, bland and mediocre; aesthetically, the animation just does not suit the story or characters. \\n\r\nEven worse, the quality of the animation falters quite frequently. For example, when Nishiki kicks Hide, the movements of both the kick and of Hide being sent flying are so fast, choppy and otherwise poorly-executed that it's actually funny. It seems that Studio Pierrot had issues with kicking while animating this, because when Ayato kicks down a door later on, he looks flat-out ridiculous. Tsukiyama's face looks beautiful half of the time, and it looks like one big blunder the other half. Worst of all, if you pause at the right (or rather, wrong...) moment, especially during action scenes, you're bound to come across a hilariously bad frame, or series of frames. At times it seems like the animators were just hoping that viewers wouldn't be paying attention at times when the characters spend a few seconds looking like they were drawn by a middle school kid. However, there are some scenes that are actually very well-done, especially in the later episodes, e.g. Kaneki's hallucinations/internal conversation in the later episodes were both gorgeous and memorable.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10/10\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is wonderful, both in the show and for listening on its own. Tokyo Ghoul's soundtrack captures the mood and tone of the story in ways that the animation could not even begin to accomplish. It's the perfect juxtaposition of delicate/melancholy and harsh/heavy. If you enjoy this anime, then listening to the soundtrack later on will probably make you emotional, it's that good. Standout tracks include \"Unravel\" (the first opening), \"Glassy Sky\", and \"Licht und Schatten\". The second opening, \"Munou\", was met with mixed feelings from the fanbase -- mostly because it's straight-up bizarre, and it's not the kind of song you would expect from an anime opening at all -- but personally I thought it was beautiful and very fitting, considering Kaneki's psychological deterioration as the series progresses. \\n\r\nThe voice acting is brilliant. (I'm talking about the Japanese here; I don't believe there's a dub out yet as I'm writing this, and it's not like I'd watch a dub of Tokyo Ghoul anyway, considering the perfection of the Japanese acting in this case.) Natsuki Hanae's performance as Kaneki is nothing short of devastating, and I mean that in the best way possible. In scenes where Kaneki was in pain, the voice acting felt so real that it was actually distressing. The other actors did a wonderful job too, of course, but Natsuki Hanae truly blew me away.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 7/10\\n\r\nThe characters are all very interesting and lovable. I've never heard of a fan who doesn't like Kaneki, and his development is what really makes Tokyo Ghoul so great. Watching him change is truly heartbreaking, and that's the point. The character designs aren't spectacular, but they're all really cool, especially Suzuya's. Suzuya himself is a fascinating character that I got attached to very quickly, and his fight scenes were usually the most entertaining. However, a lot of characters were deprived of the development that they should have gotten. This is another situation in which it's hard to be objective about the anime, because in the manga, characters that the anime neglects development-wise (such as Banjou and Tsukiyama...ESPECIALLY Tsukiyama) go through outstanding development. But disregarding that, they're still great characters. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 7/10\\n\r\nYou'll enjoy this if you're not looking for a story with some depth but not too much of it. If you want something that will really keep you thinking about it, skip the anime, go for the manga. Or do both.\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 7/10\\n\r\nThere are characters and plot points that were full of potential that they weren't allowed to reach, and the animation was mostly lackluster, but it's still a decent anime. Definitely not a masterpiece, but it's good enough.\\n\\n",

            "content": "(This has been adapted from my reddit thread)\r\nMost people hate being something they're not. \"Just be yourself\" is a common phrase used to express the feeling that, as a person, you should just act the way you normally do (within reason). But what happens when this type of mentality is challenged by those around you? Tokyo Ghoul aims to explore this idea by pitting the ghouls versus the humans and how they live their lives in co-existence.\r\nSTORY\r\nTokyo Ghoul stars Kaneki, a young high school student who, early on, takes an interest in another woman. However, during a freak accident, Kaneki is forced to become a\"ghoul\", a person who must feed on human flesh in order to survive.\\n\\n\r\nOne of the things I thought the show did well throughout the series was showing the dynamic between ghouls and humans, and what it means exactly to be a ghoul. Most prominent of all is the idea of eating flesh. But besides this, the show looks at more interesting scenarios, such as ghoul and human relationships, how ghouls are treated both by humans and their own comrades, and how to get by in a world not designed for you. I found these parts of the show to be the most interesting. While not on the same level as something like Shinsekai Yori, when the environment holds certain social discrepancies, it always invites interesting situations for the two sides to collide. And the show presents these quarrels in interesting enough ways to make the story enjoyable.\\n\\n\r\nAs a negative, I felt Tokyo Ghoul spent too much time on the eating aspect of the ghouls. It becomes apparent early on what they must do (and not do) in order to obtain nourishment. But even for some of the villains, their main trait still revolves around \"food\". I wish there would have been less focus on that and more on other ghoul facets, but that is more of a personal feeling.\\n\r\nI also agree with /u/ThatAnimeSnob's (a reddit user) reasoning that throughout almost the entirety of the series, Kaneki plays a passive role in an aggressive world. \\n\\n\r\nBesides the final episode, Kaneki is portrayed as weak, helpless, and scared. Because of this, he has to maintain this role. However, the show suffers because of this. The characters around him drive the narrative; Kaneki is usually just along for the ride. Even though he is the lead, it never feels as if his actions provide any effect on what occurs next.\\n\\n\r\nRegardless, the show's pacing is also quite quick. There is never really any clear goal that the characters are looking to achieve. Rather, they deal with the problems presented to them as they come. In this way, the show sort of becomes a \"something happens, take care of it, wait a bit, something happens...\" type of deal. Again, this problem stems from Kaneki's lack of power or hold over the narrative. Because he does not have an active role in the things that happen, and since he is the lead protagonist, there is no clear overall purpose to the show's story-telling.\\n\\n\r\nANIMATION\\n\\n\r\nTokyo Ghoul's animation is actually quite good. All of the fight scenes themselves are well choreographed and are easy to follow despite all of the jumping and twirling. The show goes into great detail when a character begins expressing extreme emotion. In these circumstances, the character's faces have actual individual teeth, facial muscles, and a manic facade.\\n\r\nThe art style is also quite nice. It mostly sticks to darker colors in order to give a more mature feeling while simultaneously making the world seem darker (both in subject matter and in mood).\\n\\n\r\nPersonally, I liked the character designs. Jason's larger physique, Touka's kick-ass ghoul form, Mado's old but wise demeanor. Everyone presented a unique look that fit their personalities well.\\n\\n\r\nThe only gripe I have, and so do many others, was the extensive use of censorship. It can be argued that such a device was used so heavily in order to make selling of the actual copies of the show later to increase. But when I am watching the show, and half the screen is black to hide some random dude's missing arm or there is a shower of blue blood due to negative coloring, it does not help it in the slightest.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS\\n\\n\r\nTokyo Ghoul actually has quite a large cast. Due to this, many of the characters themselves are never fully explored.\\n\\n\r\nTechnically speaking, the only main characters are Kaneki and Touka. Kaneki, while pretty much pathetic, does experience the most growth of any of the characters. It is pretty small during the middle of the show, but it does exist. He understands that he is weak and unable to do the things that other ghouls can. He learns that he not only doesn't fit within the ghoul lifestyle but as a human as well. Near the end, he comes to the realization that what he wants and what he thinks are actually completely different. And after correcting his line of thinking, he finally starts to \"just be himself\". But at this point, it is too little, too late.\\n\\n\r\nTouka, contrarily, sees little development. Throughout much of the show, she is a brooding character; more \"tsun\" than \"dere\". She has acclimated to the world around her. She goes to school, does human things, and at the end of the day, resorts to what she needs to in order to survive. These qualities make her out to be a well-rounded character already, meaning there is no room for improvement on her part. They attempt to instill some form of empathy for her following her fight against Mado, but it isn't touched upon enough to have any lasting effects.\\n\\n\r\nThe only other notable characters are Jason and Rize. Jason is depicted as being quite psychotic (for obvious reasons), but I felt that his lack of presence throughout the middle of the show dampened his effectiveness as a proper villain.\\n\\n\r\nRize, in a similar fashion, is alluded to quite often during the show, and makes her best appearance near the story's conclusion. While she isn't necessarily explored, her actions and monologues were quite interesting. Even though she wasn't on-screen much, she definitely left an impression when she was.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND\\n\\n\r\nBoth the OP and ED for this show are very, very good. The OP starts off slow and peaceful, but by the halfway point it picks up, making you as energized as the people in that world. In contrast, the ED goes for a mellow tone, with simple beats and a nice rhythm. It helps you to wind down from the craziness that usually happens during that episode.\\n\\n\r\nThe rest of the soundtrack is okay. There isn't anything too memorable or of the same quality as the OP and ED (but that is hard to do).\\n\\n\r\nThe voice acting performances were very well done, especially by Kaneki, Jason, and Mado. Other notable performances include Touka, Rize, and Tsukiyama (Mr. French-man). In general, everyone did a very nice job.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT\\n\\n\r\nTokyo Ghoul had a great opportunity to present a world filled with conflicting sides. I am a fan of all different genres, and while the psychological aspects for the show were fine, it never really expanded beyond that. Yes, there are good fighting scenes present within the show, but to me that wasn't the focus, or at least it shouldn't have been.\\n\\n\r\nI found that many of the characters within the show, besides Kaneki and Touka, were used then quickly forgotten. Examples include Hide (Kaneki's best friend) and Ayato (Touka's brother). This is most likely due to the shows time constraint (only being one-cour) but it never really makes sense to introduce such characters and then not do anything with them.\\n\\n\r\nI don't think this show is the best example of a psychological thriller. It does have these elements, but I think it is more aligned with people who enjoy a darker take on what it means to be human. Does the show even do this well? Not exactly. However, for what it is worth, the show was still a nice watch, even if the ending we received left many unanswered questions.\\n\\n\r\nSUMMARY\\n\\n\r\nStory: Fine, wants to explore ghoul vs. human but with no clear direction\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: Good, nice detail and atmosphere mired in censorship\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Fine, some are likable and hated for what they do while most are underdeveloped\\n\\n\r\nSound: Great, fantastic OP, ED, and voice acting\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Fine, mature but never quite fun\\n\\n\r\nFinal Score: 6/10",

            "content": "It set up really well to then leave the scene, and give the spotlight to the angsty pizza boy.\r\nThe show started out looking promising but failed to keep a good pacing. It gave one of the most forced and painfully pretentious protagonists I've seen. \r\nIt keeps trying to convince you you should like him, although his timid and naive nature is just too unconvincing. The show then wants you to believe his Jesus transformation syndrome, which is a thing that's always really corny but it's done really poorly here by not even having the story events really arc into this transformation and character development. Whichcomes off as (a thing very common in anime) the creator's self-insertion. When you can't mistake the feeling, of the artist trying very hard to live out his fantasy through a fictional character in their own personal project. Usually this character will come off as lacking depth or any sort of realistic reaction to what happens around them. Which leaves the viewer with a feeling that they're just looking at someone's personal ego boosting. This protagonist is the big problem, but sadly not the only problem.\\n\\n\r\nTokyo Ghoul started out really well. It had an interesting idea and a first episode that really paced itself well. It was shrouded in mystery that gave you the sense of \"All will soon be revealed to you\". All was indeed revealed. With little to no fanfare whatsoever. It was explained in a manner as if what is going on here is as normal as drinking your morning coffee. And it comes off with the message that they're just different, and you shouldn't hate others for being different. Insert a whiney \"Don't judge me!\" here. The show really hammers in how pretentious it is, and I'm pretty sure the writers are completely unaware of it.\\n\\n\r\nThere was something of potential here, there really was. But it casts away society and the general public view on this problem of ghouls living in the city. After the first episodes it all shrinks into this really small world. Just a couple of small groups of people, and gives the spotlight completely to characters that are frankly not strong enough to carry the show home. It would really have been nice if the show had kept consistent for one thing, but even more importantly, treated its premise with care. It starts out like it should, addressing the existence of ghouls as a problem to society. But it shrugs it off and just becomes small gang skirmishes... and barely even. We don't get any reason to why the ghouls even exist. There's no endeavor to make the viewer actually care about what's happening. This should've had a bigger plot. It's just a series of small forgettable events, and no plot.\\n\\n\r\nIts art style is pretty nice... the animation is pretty good too. Nothing amazing but it's good enough. What I really think is done well in Tokyo Ghoul is lighting. Lighting, shading and character outlines. The voice acting isn't really anything to critize either.\\n\\n\r\nThe opening sequence was decent with a decent song, but the real feast, is the ending sequence, that sets a tone the show in general should've tried to mimic. The songs fit the aesthetic really well.\\n\\n\r\nSo to sum it up. Tokyo Ghoul had something going for it. If it had just treated its premise with better care. But the main problem is an extremely lacking protagonist that steals the show, but has nothing to show for it.",

            "content": "This review goes for both seasons of Tokyo Ghoul (so far), and despite the fact that I don't think of Tokyo Ghoul as an anime that falls on the 'good' end of the spectrum, I will still be watching the third season. Why exactly? I don't really have a good reason. In fact, I expect to be asking myself why I am watching the third season of an anime I don't care about right up until I have finished the last episode.\r\n* Note that I haven't read the manga, and even so, this is a review about the anime as a standalone work.\r\n[potential minor spoilersahead]\\n\\n\r\nThe very first episode of Tokyo Ghoul requires a strenuous amount of suspension of disbelief and overlooking clumsy storytelling. The first episode of a show is supposed to pull you into its world in an immersive way that leaves you with many questions and wanting to find out more, not dump a whole load of information on you solely through forced dialogue. While explanation via dialogue is often necessary, especially in sci-fi/fantasy settings, there is a point at which \"show, don't tell\" really has to come into play.\\n\\n\r\nDespite the over-explaining, it is still peppered with plot holes that beg for an explanation: for example, how can a knife break in half when thrust at the abdomen of a ghoul because \"human weapons can't harm ghouls\", yet a bunch of shit falling off the roof of a building can actually kill one while simultaneously leaving its organs unharmed enough to transplant? (sidenote: what was with the exchange between the doctors when they transplanted the ghoul's organs into Kaneki? I have never heard such unrealistic dialogue in my life). There are plenty of other scenes I could talk about that made me raise an eyebrow, but I don't want to spoil it for those that still intend to watch this show after my review.\\n\\n\r\nWhat I will say in favor of the show, however, is that at times, the art and animation can be quite emotionally evocative - the soundtrack is also very good, and the art in general is smooth and well animated (aside from the incredibly annoying enormous black lines that appear in most versions of the show to block out the gore. God dammit. Gore is to me what fanservice is to others) but that's really the only genuine compliment I can think of for this show. Had it not been for these elements of it, I would absolutely have dropped it out of sheer boredom. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters are very flat and seriously lack any real substance or relatability. Especially Kaneki. Though, in comparing TG to Sword Art Online and Mars of Destruction, it is a practically masterpiece in this respect. While one could protest that the fact that Kaneki basically stops being a lil bitch because the shit is tortured out of him is 'character development', I beg to differ. A 180 degree flip in a character's personality (or whatever little personality Kaneki has) over the course of one episode does not constitute realistic or interesting character development in my opinion. Even in the case of a severely traumatic event, like, for example, the shit being tortured out of you, you don't just switch from being whiney as hell one episode prior to being totally emotionless and abandoning everyone who has ever accepted you the next. Kaneki starts off as a total crybaby, before taking on a somewhat Kirito-esque Jesus-Kun aspect to him. Although there were hints of development of his character before he totally changed, it really wasn't enough to make his shift from one personality to another believable or realistic. Of course, there's always the way he is supposedly 'torn between good and evil' etc, but I have seen that premise done a thousand times better elsewhere, and with less dimensionless characters.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the supporting characters, none of them seemed to show any real development at all. The only character I actually got much enjoyment out of was Juuzou, and honestly, even he was a shit character. I think I like him because I'm biased towards childlike psychotic nutcases who enjoy ripping people to shreds with scythes, no matter how shittily they're written.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters just aren't believable or realistic. They are too black or white - even Kaneki, who is meant to play the part of grey, is too one-dimensional. The problem is that the plot doesn't leave any room for ambiguity to keep the viewer guessing, to get the viewer caught up in the turmoil of the characters. My general rule of thumb is that if you can easily summarize a character in one sentence (or god forbid, one word - eg. tsundere), the writer is probably doing something wrong.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the course of the plot... As far as I'm concerned, I'm not actually sure I could see that it had much direction. If you want to see the same basic concept TG follows applied in a more realistic way, I'd recommend Parasyte: The Maxim. I get the feeling that Tokyo Ghoul was trying to be somewhere between slice of life ghoul style and a dramatic thriller, and I didn't feel like it quite worked. There wasn't enough back story to most of the other ghouls in the cafe to make it possible to really keep track of what the hell was going on, especially towards the end of season 2.\\n\\n\r\nI suppose, what I have to say about Tokyo Ghoul is that it tried. I mean, it managed to hold my attention, and it wasn't completely unwatchably idiotic and putrid. It was a good time killer at least, and a small part of me vaguely looks forward to seeing the third season.",

            "content": "Tokyo Ghoul is an anime that would satisfy your craving for suspense. The lack of character development and the unconvincing plot is the downside but the action sequences and the art makes up for that. At the very least, it is enjoyable.\r\nStory - 7/10\r\nThe plot started out good enough. The fast-pace format of the first episode then the slow pace format of the succeeding ones are actually beneficial at least for the first three episodes. And although it is only twelve episodes long, watching the third quarter (7-9) is really hard for me because of my diminishing interest in the anime as a whole. Nonethelessepisodes 10-11 are quite good and the last episode had great moments but nothing more. What I meant truly meant to say, is that the series never really regained the momentum that it gave during its first few episodes and although the last episodes tried to reach that, for me, it didn't work. Also, I know there is a second season but they should have made the ending better. Great endings are after all what constitutes a great anime.\\n\\n\r\nArt - 9/10\\n\r\nAt least the animation was good, I could say that. There never really was a dip in the quality and the action sequences were spectacular. Minute details in facial expression were beautifully done. I however do not like the censoring and even some scenes that were done in \"negative\" shots, to possibly make the gore at least pleasing to the eye which they shouldn't have done. They should have known better that the people that would probably watch this would crave those, and expect more of gore and blood but to deprive them of that is absurd.\\n\\n\r\nSound - 9/10\\n\r\nVery nice OP and ED but somewhat not remarkable. The score during the fighting scenes, or just dramatic scenes however were majestic.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 5/10\\n\r\nThe characters are thinly drawn. Although there are some moments of greatness such as the relationship between Kaneki and Hide, or the inner goodness of Touka but other than that, there is really no other complexity of relationships between the characters. There is your standard bad guy that turns tolerable, the seemingly weak girl that actually has a super strong power, etc. All of them just became stereotypical. It could have been better if the series was longer at least a few more episodes highlighting more of the stories of these characters for us to actually get attached to them. In this case, I even forgot the names of some supporting characters\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 8/10\\n\r\nIt is a very enjoyable anime. It did satisfy my craving for suspense and a little bit of horror. I hated the ending though. (Spoiler alert!) I guess a few scenes of torture is okay but going on for a few episodes is very intolerable, that I had to skip some parts of that. \\n\\n\r\nOverall - 7/10\\n\r\nA good anime to watch and somewhat better than average. Some parts of it may turn off viewers like it did to me. I do however, respect the fandom that it generated and I guess it deserved it. However, this is not a class A anime. But if you are looking for an anime that you would at least enjoy and be thrilled about, then Tokyo Ghoul is the anime for you.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Everything problem in this entire anime stems from one simple fact: Too few episodes. \r\nIf this series were a 23 or 24 episode anime, actually hell, even a 16 episode series, this anime would be at least somewhere in the 200's on MAL & a definite better anime. \r\nHowever, just to say before I continue, You should watch this series. It's incredibly entertaining and fascinating regardless of what i say or what anyone else says, because I'm going to be objective but i enjoyed this anime 10/10 so you shouldn't let anything anyone, including me, writes dissuade you.  This anime is well worth it.\\n\\n\r\nAnyway\\n\\n\r\nThe story suffers, not because the plot is weak but because it's too short. Many parts of the anime are too packed into one, especially the ending which is basically set up in the most retarded way possible. I wish i could write more than that, it almost feels like a disfavor not to, but anything else would be too close to spoilers but in a simple sentence, which is the best i can do & will allow: The ending sucks. \\n\r\nHowever, despite the story's incredibly jam fucking packed ridiculousness, It has great, and i mean GREAT, action scenes. Some are short due to length(again, this is already like the 4th problem due to 12 episode slot) & it is rather well portrayed, at least in the sense it's only 12 episodes. It certainly starts off well anyway. \\n\r\nIn summary: Story not so great, it's okay, mah mah desu yanno?because 12 episodes. \\n\\n\r\nArt: Art is fantastic. 100% great animation, no bad quality episodes(better not be with 12 fucking episodes) & the fight scenes are incredibly well animated. \\n\r\nSummary: Art good. Episode length not in effect. Wow. \\n\\n\r\nSound: Sound is pretty subjective but since most people are morons, I'm going to go ahead & say that the sound is amazing. It's nowhere near my favorite but at the very least, objectively, it's a 8/10. I gave it a 10/10 cause i loved it but still, it's great. Opening is a great song with a vivid animation which fits well with the show. Background music & OST good, not amazing but ranged from good to really good and always portrays scenes well, in fact in some scenes, the background music & OST does a fantastic job & you'll know when. AS for ending, I never watch the endings cause that's fucking pointless but it was okay. Nothing to download illegally. Also, I don't know if voice acting matters for sound? Some reviewers do it & that seems stupid because i dont think that has really anything to do with the sound MAL is referring to but in case I'm wrong, it was great. I mean,  unless you're fluent in Japanese, are Japanese, or have lived there & either A or B apply to you, you will never be able to tell truly good foreign voice acting. But not to brag, but i am entirely fluent in Japanese, he he he, due to my major, that I can honestly say the voice acting is suberb, especially by Mamoryu miyano (you may remember him from Death note as Light, so yea, pretty fucking good). \\n\r\nAS for dub, I don't watch dub cause I'm not an uncultured lazy american. \\n\r\nSummary: Sound good, dub is for suckers. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Oooooooo, characters. Too many of them for such a short series. Way too many. which is funny. Cause there's like 13. Again, this is entirely due to length of series. Some characters undergo change, have opinions, feelings, (maybe like 4 or 5) etc etc but even then, their backgrounds are sporadic and few and far between, and when they do come in, they seem entirely out of place, almost like the writers were too lazy & shoved them in into a tiny opening. Then there's character you think will be important and they should be, but the 12 episode thing really fucks with them and then they're hardly given screen time. Like Kaneki(main boy) best friend. At first you're like, this nigga is about to be important. Then it's like \"You seen that orange haired bitch?) & then the complete reverse is true but only in the sense they add characters way too late that are now incredibly important. Each of which is given no backstory at all. Basically, you only ever give a fuck about a few characters & that's just on their personalities and roles in the story. Not because they're great characters. If anything, the character department of Tokyo ghoul is the worst part and is a good reason it's ranked in the 400's. \\n\r\nSummary: Character's rarely given background info, thus, most suck and are either useless, become useless, or are now suddenly useful. Thanks 12 episodes. Who the fuck is in charge of these episode lengths anyway?\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10 would bang. Also, many aspects of Tokyo ghoul are left unexplained. Because 12 episodes. (getting the theme here folks?). Many questions are raised, such as \"Wtf is the CCG?\" \"Why do ghoul parts make humans ghouls?\"(yea, that's technically a spolier but it's in the first episode & you'd have to be retarded to not know that judging by, hmm, synopsis by MAL, hearsay by people comparing it to Parasyte & the fucking opening) or \"Why and where are their wards?\" and finally \"Where in the world is carmen santiago?\"\\n\\n\r\nOverall\\n\\n\r\nAll kidding aside, why did hitler kill himself? Because the jews sent him a gas bill. \\n\\n\r\nOkay, last joke. Sorry. Anyway, I would watch this show. Well i have. So You should watch this show. It's great fun & it's short(really, haven't said that before) so knock it off in 2 days like i did. Or in 1 & save the rest for masturbating. \\n\\n\r\nP.S Fuck you to all my haters who gunna say this wasn't helpful. This shit was helpful as fuck. Fuck you.",

            "content": "\"I tried to be normal once, and it was boring.\" ~Juuzo Suzuya\r\nThis quote sums up Tokyo Ghoul pretty well. It tries way too hard to be deep and unique, when it's actually a very superficial and generic anime. Why did Tokyo Ghoul even became so popular in the first place? It's really nothing special in my opinion, yet it's many young otaku's favourite anime. The plot isn't insanely creative either and almost seems like a weird mishmash between Bleach, Parasyte and Pupa. \r\nSo TK is about Ghouls, man eating monster that look like normal people, except they have different eyes and weird glowing claws thataren't properly explainend. They just have them.  This story's main character is a boy namend Kaneki who becomes a half Ghoul himself and now has to deal with ghoul problems like having to eat human flesh. \\n\\n\r\nFirst of all it was way too short. The story telling really suffered from this. Therefore there was barely any character developement and all the characters felt lame and unispired. Also this show just didn't know what even it was supposed to be. Example: the Ghouls have these claw things that I mentionend before and there are even different types of claws. The claw fights however are boring, short and complettely unnecessary. Why did they even explainend the different claw types in the first place? You'd think they tried to establish some sort of power ranking or something. But it adds nothing to this anime, since it's not even actually about fighting. \\n\\n\r\nProbably my biggest disappoint was Kaneki's (in)famous transformation. Not that it wasn't cool, but it happenend at the very end of the show! Since I saw white hair Kaneki in so many forums and websites as an avatar,  I thought this form would play a major role in the plot, but NOPE it's only relevant in the last 2 minutes. Heck, it was even in the opening of this anime! That was just a major let down for me. \\n\\n\r\nFrom a technical standpoint is was ok. The animations were a little sloppy at times, but not too terrible. Music did it's job, but wasn't really memorable aside from opening + ending and maybe the song \"Licht und Schatten\", which usually plays right before the ending. Other than that the OST was rather uninsprired. \\n\\n\r\nOverall this show is not deep and thought provoking nor is it silly but entertaining fun. It isn't even horribly executed that it becomes \"so bad that it's good\", it's just boring.",

The graphics and the soundtrack are really beautiful, the atmosphere is rhythmic and a little anxious, the actions are fluid.\r\nFor the storyline, this anime is only the first part of the story. I'm watching the second season and I don't thus judge the whole work. This first season is rather quiet. The first episodes explain us perfectly the principle and the context in which the story takes place. The end is much gorier - without spoiler nobody- and it is the moment which I preferred. We see the evolution ofthe psychology of the main character and the others. That is what I expect from this kind of work.\\n\\n\r\nI would say that this first season can be considered as a kind of \"prologue\" which introduces the second season which seems to be even better.",

            "content": "*This review covers both seasons, and contains spoilers.*\r\nThis show was terrible. I guess I was expecting a lot going into this anime, and I wanted to like it so badly but every time I think about it I just can't. I might have mixed up this show and Tokyo Ghoul Root A in this review but I hope you can overlook that because I see them as the same show. I guess I'll do this review systematically as well just to be fair.\r\nStory: 1/10\r\nI guess it started off with a pretty good idea, but the farther I got into the story the less faith Ihad in it. I'm trying hard to be as blunt as possible here but it really made very little sense. Characters would go somewhere for a very vague reason and at the end of the arch it would still be unclear what they were doing there and what had been accomplished. Kagune's and Quinques were not explained at all, and there was no development in the origin of ghouls; there was just a deficiency of reason in anything that happened in the plot.\\n\r\nI am not the kind of person who likes fighting in anime because it doesn't progress the plot or character development or anything really. Fighting needs to have a really high quality of animation like what we see in  Fate/Stay Night or martial art style like Avatar for me to enjoy it. Tokyo Ghoul's fighting animation really didn't impress me and there was quite a lot of it, which left me with a lot of moments thinking about what they were doing and if that scene needed to be that long. The scenes had a painfully low amount of frames, and it made me cringe how badly they were animated.\\n\r\nMy other piece of criticism with the fighting is that it really doesn't match the theme of ghouls very much, who I thought were supposed to be hidden among the masses of Tokyo, and expected something much more like a \"wolf among us\" kind of violence. Instead it was a hack and smash, storm-trooper level accuracy gunfight. There was one part that still bothers me to this day (SPOILER).\\n\r\n(SPOILER) Amon, a squishy human with a melee weapon, is fighting two ghouls, who are supposedly knife proof, super fast, have teeth that can rip a man apart, and have tails that can also rip a man apart. Two ghouls. One man. Amon suddenly has a flashback to something his teacher says: \"in a toe to toe battle, a human will always lose to a ghoul. So be sly. Be sneaky.\" With that being said (remembered, thought, whatever) Amon reveals that his sword can split in half and he defeats each ghoul with each sword. How could a squishy man defeat two ghouls with close range weapons in the middle of a losing fight? Secondly you're already in the fight, it's already too late to be sneaky. Sneaky is dressing an animal up in your clothes and releasing it as you make your getaway to make the enemy think you transformed. Sneaky is wading underwater breathing through a blow gun with a poison blow dart until twilight and assassinating their ass while they're drinking tea under the gazebo. Sneaky is covering yourself in a rock shaped blanket and waiting to shank their ass when they least expect it. In no way is splitting your sword in two sneaky. (SPOILER END)\\n\r\n(SPOILER END)\\n\r\nI'm sorry for digressing so much but that part just made no sense and it still bothers me just thinking about it. I have a feeling it's meant to be a long anime like Naruto or One Piece so they thought they had time to answer questions in the future, but they just left me confused and now I'm not going to watch that far. I spent way too much time being confused by the story of this anime.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 3/10\\n\r\nI'll say this right at the beginning: the style of this anime was amazingly good. The dark, night-lit Tokyo where ghouls with awesome kagune's lurk in the shadows left a good impression on me when the title of the show appeared during the theme song. I was completely enchanted by the idea of ghouls, their cool looking masks fighting special police forces.\\n\r\nBut the drawing was a complete let down. The characters were crudely drawn, the frame rate was painfully low, the extras were not believable. \\n\r\nThe style and the idea was mind-blowing, but the execution was terrible. I chose this rating because it has the word that best describes my impression of the art: poor. Giving this rating makes me sad that I don't like this show.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10/10\\n\r\nThe theme songs were absolutely mind-blowing. The lyrics, genre and sound were all appropriate to the show. The sound during the show was not really that impressive, but the opening and closing themes were good enough to pull my rating to a 10. Even if you don't watch the anime, it's worth it to check them out.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 3/10\\n\r\nI really didn't like Kaneki. He was so stupid and a lot of the time I was wondering how he was still alive. He's a ghoul but doesn't want to eat meat. I understand you don't want to eat your own kind, but I'm sorry if you don't eat you die, and you should be dead. Same with Amon. I see that he is insanely buff and manly, but there is no excuse that he should be able to fend off a lightning fast centipede kagune who is literally balls to the wall bat-shit crazy, can smell the sweat on your balls while you can't even see in the smoke, can rip your throat out with his toenails, while you're only wielding two little sticks. \\n\r\nPutting stupid characters who really should be dead aside, there were a bunch of characters that left me wondering: why are you here? Examples being Touka's bffl, Kaneki's bffl, every member of Aogiri Tree, half the members of Anteiku, and last but not least, pretty much everyone on the police force. These characters have zero development, serve as pretty much filler in the plot, and do absolutely nothing except get crudely drawn.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 3/10\\n\r\nI did enjoy parts of Tokyo Ghoul like how each ghoul had a different kagune and different mask, and there was a moment that nearly touched my heart when they showed us that ghouls had feelings too, but the next rating level was called \"decent\" and I'm afraid this show fell short of that.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 2/10\\n\r\n\"Dreadful\" is a great word for me to describe this with. As much as I wanted to enjoy this show, I was let down. For those of you who rated it highly I wish I could see what you see. I even watched Root A hoping it would get better but I wasted my time. Don't watch this show unless you want to support crappy work.",

I will follow this statement by saying that Tokyo Ghoul is also not perfect. I will also say that it is one heck of a series. The music is beautiful. the opening theme is by far the best and can make you want to do the impossible. the character voices and development were casted and executed perfectly for this thrilling horror. Unlike many other horrors (cough cough deadman wonderland) the entire thing is not filled with pointless amounts ofblood, guts, and agonizing screams. You will develop an emotional bond in some way or another to Kaneki Ken, even if it doesn't occur till the season finale. I don't know how to describe Kaneki ken other then saying that he is every characteristic rolled into one. he has a part of him that everyone can relate to. whether it be his nerdy book lover side, his badass white  haired  he-did-not-deserve-this- side, his cannibalistic insect of horror side, or his team mom side shown in Tokyo Ghoul:re, everyone can relate to the poor kid. \\n\\n\r\nWhat is bothering most people about this series, is the fact that if you did not read the manga the series becomes VERY CONFUSING. characters start popping up out of the blue and mean nothing to the actual plot of the anime! Also, if all else fails Kaneki will either be found smiling or crying. THERE IS NO IN BETWEEN. also after season one, the anime parts ways from the manga and does not have any similarities until the final battle. NOTHING THAT HAPPENS IS SEASON 2 IS RIGHT!!!!!!!!!!! it bugs me to no end. \\n\\n\r\nThe reason I am rating this so high is because the entire series (anime and manga) are amazing. yes its not perfect but its definitely worth wasting your time on! it will always be my favorite series. PLEASE WATCH THIS ANIME!!!!! but if all else fails.......\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nREAD THE FREAKING MANGA YOU WEEABOOS",

            "content": "\"Tokyo Ghoul\" is an anime of the year 2014 based on the eponymous manga Sui Ishida.\r\nThe anime has a plot is not very attractive, in the sense that immediately attracts the viewer, or at least that is what I thought I, the person who likes splatter. The picture presents many problems, both technical and in terms of plot and presentation of the latter.\r\nThe plot: we are in a Tokyo where over humans in everyday life there are the \"ghoul\", the \"ghoul\" are and are not human beings, let me explain better, but they are humans with no human characteristics resistance as well above average, regenerationcapacity and beyond, not deepen to avoid ending up in spoiler. And it is in this reality that the souls takes place. The protagonist Ken Kaneki will one day to flounder from being human to ghoul and here begins the story of the anime.\\n\r\nThe plot has trouble setting level or there are parts very, very boring like the dialogue in \"Caf\u00e8 Anteiku\" between the characters that are really unnecessary and boring parts, such as fighting, that could have been better but were a hole in the water. What this leads to is largely the poor quality of the animations from the studio Pierrot who not only organized the evil souls but also produced animations of high level at all; one of the reasons why many people are found to suspend the series, and I'd be lying if I said that I'm not even I was tempted but in the end I decided to go on, but you will be back after this speech.\\n\r\nThe characters are not at all to remember with the typical protagonist \"mollaccione\" Kaneki, the typical girl strong and tough on the outside but tender and fragile inside, Touka, and various characters among which you could save Hide, friend of the protagonist, However, that has almost no importance in the history and conduct of the anime.\\n\r\nThe technical sector as mentioned above is not the best with little animations cured and sometimes unnatural, but not too much to luck. As already stated before this is a big problem because a person from an anime of 2014 expects graphics and animations done in a certain way, certainly not perfect, but even rough. The voice acting is really poorly done except for the dubbing of Kaneki that is made well enough. The fund sound is bad and almost always annoying and does not help to give depth to the scenes, you can save but the opening that is cute.\\n\r\nCompleted the review I can say that I do not recommend these souls especially to lovers of souls horror, splatter because most likely remain disappointed and instead I can say to those who do not fit the above categories to see it only if you have no more to see in the list.\\n\r\nFinal score: 1.",

            "content": "After months away from the series leaving myself the last 2 episodes, I finally decided to go back and finish watching Tokyo Ghoul, and I'm really happy I did. I do think that all the hate it got is not hard to understand because people expected so much and felt let down. I would also like to mention that I have read the manga and do agree that as a whole it is much better than the anime series, but I still very much enjoyed watching it. \r\nI think that most of TG's problems arise from the attempt at squeezing what is a well-paced longerstory into a 12 episode program. This caused the pacing issues and the seemingly out of nowhere decisions and character development. You are thrown into a lot of what happens as opposed to being eased into it. \\n\\n\r\nStory:\\n\\n\r\nTokyo Ghoul is about protagonist Kaneki Ken becoming very involved with ghouls. Ghouls are human-esque entities that are just like us... except they live off of only human flesh and the occasional cuppa joe. So they're monsters? The bad guys? ...that's the grey area that Tokyo Ghoul explores. What is bad anyway? These are the kind of questions you find yourself asking when you realise that many times their actions are simply the result of circumstance. The premise of the show intrigued me right off the bat and I knew I was in for a ride (albeit a rocky one here and there). \\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\\n\r\nThe art is great. The action sequences were beautifully animated. Many complains were about the unnecessary censorship, which I completely agree was pretty ridiculous but the uncensored version it out so yeah. \\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\\n\r\nI thought the soundtrack was very fitting and that OP is amazing. Coupled with the animation, that OP is definitely one of my favourites, it really put you in the mood for something epic. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\\n\r\nI think the reason it's harder to have a connection with the characters and understand why they do certain things is because there wasn't enough time for the creators to flush them out due to how rushed the story was. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, Tokyo Ghoul was pretty enjoyable. Wasn't as great as we knew it could've been, but it was fun. It may have felt like important build up was amiss but the ending was pretty satisfying and convinced me to check out season 2. If you are still unsure whether its for you, I'd recommend you check out the first few episodes and see for yourself, it could be hit or miss. \\n\\n",

            "content": "In overall it's not an anime I'd would want to buy or watch over and over again, except for a few specific scenes. To me this adaptation feels like an insult to the manga and for the loyal fans of Tokyo Ghoul.\r\nEpisode one was fine, it can give you the impression that it's worth to try but afterwards it goes down hill. Too many character get thrown into the story too fast most of them get neglected until later on, which makes you wonder why the hell they introduced the characters so early.\r\nSecond the characterisation is well, terrible. While the manga shows Kaneki quitesharp on certain situations; like during the restaurant when he noticed something was strange with the coffee and already was wondering if it was a trap; in the anime he just walks into Tsukiyama's trap without any second thoughts. At least in the manga Kaneki had a reason for entering the restaurant. Another important note Hinami: Despite being still young she was able to pick up danger with just her nose, in the anime she just runs into a trap, also without second thought... great job girl; you're 13 not 6 use your brain for a while.\\n\\n\r\nAlso I found the scene with Yamori visiting Hinami's father to get his new torture object very pointless and having Mado and Amon on his heels didn't do any justice to it. \\n\\n\r\nBut if you just ignore or skip all the annoying useless talk and pointless complicated plot of the anime and watch only the fighting scenes, you'll probably like it, if you don't mind not knowing what's going on.\\n\\n\r\nIf you're just beginning to get into manga and anime I advice you to watch it, since the more experienced fans will be more fond of characterization and plot and for the fans who are already familiar with the manga, only episode 8 and 12 are worth watching.\\n\\n\r\n(Edits done to this review are spelling and grammar errors only)\\n",

            "content": "There comes a time when an anime studio decides to get their hands on something in order to make an adaptation that will blow the source material out of the water.  Look for example at the highly acclaimed but most (not me) Attack on Titan.\r\nThen there comes a time when a studio by the name of Pierrot adapts something, wait wait, did I say adapt?  A better fitting term would be vandalize.\r\nYes ladies and gentlemen, Tokyo Ghoul is not only an example of wasted potential, but it is also an example on how a rushed plot underdeveloped characters, and unexplained events ruined aseries.\\n\\n\r\nFirst off, I want to point out that there is a season 2 in the works at the moment so most of the unexplained stuff that I mention at this time could be cleared up so don't hold it against me.\\n\\n\\n\r\nTHE STORY\\n\r\nHere is a basic summary of Tokyo Ghoul.  \\n\r\nThe story of Tokyo Ghoul follows our main protagonist Ken Kaneki who is a college student that meets a woman named Rize Kamishiro at a coffee shop. Both of them hit it off quite well with an interest in literature.  Soon they start hanging out and Kaneki is feeling really happy about the company.  One day while walking her home, Rize transforms into a creature known as a ghoul a human-like creature that can only feed human flesh.  Anything else well, tastes like shit.  Well, its no difference than eating Wendy's.  As she is about to kill him, she is crushed by a falling platform. After being taken to a hospital Kaneki has Rize's organs implanted inside him in order to save him.  This causes him to have the qualities and powers of a ghoul while being a human at the same time.  Now Kaneki goes off into the world trying to remain human while his ghoul side slowly consumes him.  Trying to learn about Ghoul society through meeting characters, and ultimately asks the question, who are the real monsters?  \\n\\n\r\nTo start off with the positives of the story, I thought that the story has a great concept.  The idea of a half ghoul half human Jekyll and Hyde scenario is quite intriguing, and hasn't been done that much in anime.   Sadly this psychological element is not shown most of the time in the anime, with the only highlights of this scenario being in the first 2 episodes, an episode in the middle, and the very last episode.  A great example is in the first episode with Kaneki constantly switching and struggling back and forth between a human mind and a ghoul mind.\\n\\n\r\nAnother great part about the story is the atmosphere.  The anime does a good job here and there with capturing the themes of horror and terror within its setting.  The overall message of who is the real monster is portrayed in a good way, with the reoccurring theme being for the most part, the only thing holding this anime up.\\n\\n\r\nNow, here is the bad, and boy is there a lot to talk about.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime has been drugged by Pierrot with Black Bullet Serum.  What I mean by this is that after a certain point the anime becomes rushed to hell to the point where the character development suffers along with the story.  This causes the anime to have weird transitions from one scene to another and leaves some things unexplained.  If you don't think the rushing affects the characters and explanations on things, here are a few examples\\n\\n\r\n-Kaneki states a few episodes in that he wants to find out more about Rize and her past but the audience is never given any information.  It's like they completely skipped over him wanting to find out more about y'know, THE PERSON LIVING INSIDE OF HIM\\n\\n\r\n-Side chracters are introduced that are never fully explained with no back story.  This causes these characters to become nothing more than plot devices, if the series did not rush to hell then these characters could have been explained without leaving any lack of explanation.  A perfect example is the character Juuzou Suzuya who works with the agency opposing the ghouls.  He comes into the story out of nowhere, and with how eccentric he is you would think his character would be important?  Wrong, instead a lack of explanation because of the rushing causes him to be nothing more than a plot device used in killing ghouls so that other members of the agency known as the Doves can progress.\\n\\n\r\n-The rushing shows up the most though in the second to last episode where they introduce new ghouls, a new enemy and a few new elements added to the story that have not yet been explained at all*\\n\\n\r\n-Remember that platform that fell on Rize?  They mention it wasnt an accident and that it fell intentionally by someone.  Do you think they go back to this idea to find out who did it? No, they just gloss over it.\\n\\n\r\nThis bring up a major point, since they announced a season 2 at least a week after the first season they were obviously in the works of it for a while.  Why rush season 1 if you already had a season 2 being worked on?  This is the same studio that gave Polar Bear Cafe 50 24 minute episodes, why couldnt they have done 2 seasons of 25 eps with tokyo ghoul, they already have enough money made from naruto, they could easily do it!\\n\\n\r\nThe rushing is not only the problem, the execution also plays a big role in how this anime had a downfall.  *Minor Spoiler Alert*  An example of the execution being flawed was how they executed Hinami's mother's death.  There was emotional buildup to the scene where Hinami's mother would meet her death.  Right when the mother is about to be killed the episode ends.  This not only disconnects the viewer from the show, but also removes any emotion the viewer has for when Hinami's mother is about to die.  This could have easily been put into the previous episode so all the viewer's emotional buildup to have payoff.  This only caused most viewers to get blueballs with no payoff having to wait another week or click another episode to get the payoff which has already been broken because of the switch between episodes.\\n\\n\r\nAnother flaw in execution is Kaneki's torture scene.  Even without the the censors, the torture did not live up to the hype people were giving it.  The last episode had better execution than the second to last episode in terms of the torture but in the second to last episode there was no explanation on what was happening to Kaneki.  There were no good shots of Kaneki getting tortured, whenever he did the camera would pan away from the scene which gives the viewers a feeling of emptiness.  Seeing Kaneki getting tortured would have been really emotional but only hearing it is not enough.\\n\\n\\n\r\nTHE CHARACTERS\\n\r\nAnd now for the characters, just a brief explanation on them and any criticisms I had.  The side characters are really bad, they literally have zero to no development\\n\\n\r\nKaneki our main protagonist I can describe as being a better version of Yukki from Mirai Nikki, but that's not saying much, Kaneki's character development is sporadic to the point where he out of nowhere shifts from being a character on the sidelines of battle to a badass character who all of a sudden knows how to fight in the end.  Now, it does state that he was getting training on how to fight but we never see that training.  Is that a gimmick the writer of the story did in order to make Kaneki's character badass out of nowhere?  It's like if I was the writer of Fairy Tail, and I wrote Natsu got a tutor, and all of a sudden he becomes the next Einstein without any scenes of him studying and the only hint is because the writer randomly wrote it in.  Kaneki is nowhere close to being a dynamic character, he doesn't even have the best development and he's the main character\\n\\n\r\nTouka, a girl who is a ghoul who works at the coffee shop doesn't change throughout the story.  In short she has some qualities of being tsundere, but she did show little growth throughout the show so I have to respect that.  \\n\\n\r\nRize, the ghoul that now \"lives\" in Kaneki showed promise to be a great character inside Kaneki's mind that would slowly drain his sanity, but even then her character was underused to the point where I feel like her character became irrelevant with the only times appearing or even being referenced again were in an episode in the middle and the very last episode.\\n\\n\r\nNishiki, another ghoul who starts working at the coffee shop, while he does play a role in the gourmet ghoul arc the role is not big and it leaves me wanting more from his character because he felt highly underdeveloped.  A great example of wasted potential.\\n\\n\r\nHide, Kaneki's friend, is shown in literally 3 episodes of this anime and plays no significance at all. People would think that he plays a role in the story, but literally he does nothing to serve the plot making him a waste of screen time.\\n\\n\r\nTsukiyama is probably the most entertaining of the bunch.  Basically if Tokyo Ghoul had a Hunter x Hunter Hisoka it would be this guy.  The wackiness this character has and how weird he is really made this character eccentric.  But the problem is once again, the development of this character is nowhere to be found and he remains as an eccentric weirdo who sniffs bloody napkins.\\n\\n\r\nAmon, a person working for the Doves, the opposing side of our main protagonist, gets the most development out of all the people in this show.  After the death of a character in this show that he considered his mentor he slowly overcomes it and becomes his own person in the end, able to fight by himself and growing as a person throught the character's death\\n\\n\r\nHinami, the daughter of Ryouko is only useful once in the entire show during a fight scene.  Other than that she's just kinda there to show an innocent side of the ghoul society.  But this doesn't make her a good character, in fact she's just a pretty stereotypical anime girl, only difference is she's depressed as hell.  She would have gotten development in the end, she volunteered to do something in order to help Kaneki.  Did we see her do anything and rise up from her struggles? Nope.  Hopefully in season 2 we will get something.\\n\\n\r\nSuzuya, Juuzou is basically a plot device as I said earlier whose origins are never really explained and is only in the story to help the Doves advance through difficult areas.\\n\\n\\n\r\nTHE ART/ANIMATION\\n\r\nMoving on to the art/animation of the show.  The show from a visual standpoint looks pretty solid with the high points being the action scenes in terms of animation.  The kagune which are the weapons that grow out of a ghouls back look really greatness stand out.  Facial features on the characters also help capture the emotions they portray quite nicely from fear to sorrow.  Animation for the most part is smooth with a but of choppiness here and there.  The anime also did a pretty great job of capturing the darkness of the city.  Also to contrast about what I said about the expressions there are some points where the facial features look too comical to be taken seriously.  The character Tsukiyama was a character I was curious on weather or not to take seriously because his facial expressions were too comical for his own good.  Also, might I add that the PVs had better art and animation than the ACTUAL SHOW, those bastards. Now, about the censoring.  The censoring can only be described in one word \"atrocious\" but now that I'm watching Terraformars, the censoring in terraformars makes the censoring in Tokyo ghoul look great.  Although, the consorting in Ghoul is nothing to smile about for they take away from action scenes that could have potentially had an impact on the viewer.  Going back to Kaneki's torture scene, the censoring didn't make it clear on how exactly Kaneki was getting tortured until they had to explain it in the next episode which made it seem very out of place due to the fact that Jason starts explaining all the things he's been doing to Kaneki for the past few hours out of nowhere due to the fact that the audience couldn't see what was going on previously.  Scenes that don't even need censoring got censored.  If you don't believe the censoring is that bad, if you can tell me what is going on here I will give you 20 dollars.  I mean, look at Akame ga Kill, as much as I don't like that anime there is an abundance of blood with literally no censors.  The censoring though will not affect the overall score that I give this show though, just thought I might give you all a warning\\n\\n\\n\r\nTHE SOUND\\n\r\nThe ost is done by Yamada, Yutaka.  The only thing he has done is indeed Tokyo Ghoul.  For a first time composer he did a pretty okay job.  I'm not saying the music was bad, it was actually quite fitting with the highlights being the songs that play through the battles.  There is a lack of originality when it comes to the ost.  Most of the music sounds like it was done by Hans Zimmer, the person who composed the music for the batman franchise and for Inception.  Look up the Touka rabbit scene with Inception music and it will literally be the same if you were to watch the scene without it.  Overall the pieces weren't bad, they were just decent at best.    The opening song though is a completely different story with it being one of my favorite openings of the year. All and all the soundtrack was decent at best.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSo all and all, Tokyo Ghoul is an example of an anime with wasted potential.  Is it the worst anime I've seen?  Hell no, is the anime good?  Hell no.  So where\\n\r\ndoes it stand?\\n\r\nGiving Art/Animation a 7.5/10\\n\r\nMusic 5.5/10\\n\r\nStory 4.5/10\\n\r\nCharacters 4/10\\n\r\nEnjoyment  4.75/10\\n\\n\r\nTokyo Ghoul gets a score of 5.25 with an overall recommendation of pirating it rather than suppporting it on Funimation",

And oh, please take note that I haven't read the chapters of which this anime was adapted from so I will review it based on the anime itself not on the adaptation from manga to anime (hope we're clear on that. :p)\r\nSo first allow me to say this, Tokyo Ghoul is simply amazing. The story, the art, the character. Zenbu. As for sound? That did it. Words failme. The moment I listened to the song, I was hooked. The song fits the anime perfectly. Needless to say, I really enjoyed it to my heart's content. *sigh\\n\\n\r\nSo let's go down to the details.\\n\\n\r\nWe have Kaneki Ken, a shy and bookish university student. He was a regular customer of Anteiku (a coffee shop run by Yoshimura, a ghoul, which serves as a refuge for fellow ghouls in 20th ward) where he met Rize, the binge eater, he instantly had a crush on her but he was about to have the surprise of his life when she attacked him after their date. One thing lead to another, he woke up feeling strange. Thus, his nightmare began when he discovered what he'd become.\\n\\n\r\nI love tragic hero stories because I sincerely believes that those who have experienced the most painful things are the ones who are capable of deep understanding of life, that is if they stick to their values, have the wisdom to endure and the courage to protect the most important thing to them.\\n\\n\r\nHonestly, all the characters have their own story to tell. This is the reason why it's painful to watch because you understand where they're coming from and it's hard to ignore. Although it's almost impossible, I hope they come to understand each other and break the chain of revenge. *sigh\\n\\n\r\nHowever, I must say, even though I haven't read the manga I feel that the pacing is a bit fast and rushed. Somehow, I know there are many skipped chapters I can understand the disappointment of those who read the manga.\\n\\n\r\nAfter watching this I read the manga as to what happened next. I can't help myself. And so I'm so ready for season 2. Bring it on!\\n\\n\r\nAnd oh, I haven't mention that aside from Kaneki, one character that I really love so much is Hide. I kind of know the feeling of having a best friend since childhood so my heart really goes for Hide for being such the best best friend Kaneki could ever have.\\n\\n\r\n*I'm currently reading Tokyo ghoul:re, I wish Hide is somewhere alive, please.*\\n\\n\r\nSo much feels. Amazing.",

On top of that, none of the characters in general really develop throughout the show at all, and all of them are very boring and uninteresting. \\n\\n\r\nYeah and with all that, I didn't enjoy this show at all. It's just so lacking and fails to meet my standards in all the criteria. This show is like eating school lunch - you get the same, disgusting slop that never improves.",

After watching the latest (and last) episode, it is hard to give the anime anything higher since there are plot holes. \r\nArt - 9\r\nWell done on art, it has nice vivid colors that truly stand out from others. Such as the way the hair colors standout, not to mention other details they go into with backgrounds. \\n\\n\r\nSound - 7\\n\r\nOpening is very nice, one of my favorites but not much liking for the ending theme. OST is done nicely, not really the best but certainly not the worst. Enough to keep the mood.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 6\\n\r\nMain character has the typical bad past like most do where his parents are dead or something tragic happened. There hardly is any character development especially since there only 12 episodes. Although I seen short animes with good development. Anyways, characters are made fair enough where the viewer will either like or dislike them.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 9\\n\r\nI was always looking forward to seeing the next episode and during the waiting period for next episode to air was painful, lol. \\n\\n\r\nOverall - 7 \\n\r\nA good anime that should at least be given a try despite not being absolutely perfect. It is probably a good idea to read the manga too (I plan to do that) which is 100+ chapters which will satisfy more :) \\n",

Kaneki gets ghoul powers but he's not ever really incorporated into any plot at all, there's no real plot progression in the anime, that's aside the anime being so awful at passing. The anime tries to focus in shaping he's character, but the writing is too flaw to make it work, it has to tell you how to feel about the character, it doesn't let you feel a way towards a character. \r\nYou are also never explain how many things work in the anime, like character motivations and ghoul powers and abilities.\r\nArt\r\nIt's not bad, but it isn'treally anything to brag about, specially since the animation drops in quality after the first episode, not to mention the anime for the most part looks dull and stale, which isn't so bad since the anime is indeed dull and stale. \\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\r\nThe music is fine, my biggest complain is that many times i forget that is even there, I don't remember a single track that isn't the opening or the ending. Is not good enough to build tension at the right moments, but overall is not terrible.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter\\n\r\nThis is easily the weakest aspect of Tokyo ghoul, the characters aren't interesting, many of them are boring, there's no solid reason to care about them. The character with the most development isn't even the main character, most of the time you can't even tell what the characters are about.\\n\r\nThere's also the fact that many characters are just there for manga readers to point them out when they see it, and then they either don't show up again, or don't do anything important or cool again.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment\\n\r\nI just could not get into what was going on this anime has to many problems\\n\r\n-Dull and stale\\n\r\n-Forced emotional scenes\\n\r\n-The characters aren't interesting\\n\r\n-No real plot to keep me interested in the series\\n\r\n-Bad dialogue in many key moments\\n\r\n-Lack of exposition to understand what is going on\\n\\n\r\nOverall\\n\r\nDon't touch it/10",

Instead, the only real desire it brought upon watching, was a reinforced want to buy a French press. From the poorly executed themes of equality, to the absolutely abysmal character progression. You can tell this show was slapped together with too much from the source material, and it never actually did anything with it. The only good parts of the show were the music, the episode exploring regular ghoul life, and then the final 5 minutes of the last episode. Everything else was executed terribly. So much so insome portions, that I was left with no choice but to turn away from the show in disgust after watching people have their limbs ripped off. The torture scene toward the end, while I understand what it meant, was shot in poor taste. I don't need to see people have their fingers and toes ripped off, and have a form of psychological torture demonstrated to the point fetishization rivaled by that of edgy teenage fangirls who swoon about series killers because they're \"mysterious\".",

The 12eps was the reason why it was rushed, why it was slammed by the manga-readers. But this review is with respect to the anime only and not comparing it to the manga.\r\nStory: 8\r\n The story is unique and finds you within two worlds, the humans and the ghouls. Through the eyes of our MC we see who are the real villains... not the humans nor the ghouls but the ones who are truly bad at heart. The story is not very complex but definitelyhas alot of depth.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8\\n\\n\r\n The only thing Ishda's masterpiece lacked in the start was the art which got better and better as the manga progressed. But here in the anime, the color palette used, the animation and the character sketches are really well done and this one of the big positives. The 'kagune' of the ghouls also looked cool. The art would have got a 10 from my side but the unnecessary censorship got it a '-2'. But be sure to get the BD versions because they are uncensored and definitely will not annoy you.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9\\n\\n\r\nI have nothing to say about the sound. The opening, 'unravel' by TK was really well done and I found the the ending song enjoyable too. \\n\r\nThe voice acting in fact was a very strong point in the series.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:5\\n\\n\r\nThis is where the anime fails. Very rushed and all the important plot points in the manga were skipped or not properly dealt with and caused the huge cast of characters who had the potential of character development, had almost nothing. *SPOILER* The MC, Ken Kaneki has a huge character development towards the end of the series but the poor execution of sequences which lead to the development made it look meh.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8\\n\\n\r\nI will say this. If I had not read the manga, I would have enjoyed this series a lot. It's not that the adaptation is terrible, the manga itself is too good in my opinion\\n\\n",

            "content": "Tokyo Ghoul is a very curious case in that it is probably the only series that fails to deliver only because it is not violent enough. Its whole world has a rather dark and brutal feel to it. Or a least that's what it tries to convey: the expression of the characters are most of the time distorted; everyone has a really sad past involving numerous deaths; and almost all of them have some mental disorder thanks to the fact that they have to live on the edge of society for being ghouls. The main character and his friends try to find their place byforming a group that keeps them out of trouble. It makes them the most reasonable of their kind but even they are really messed up.\\n\\n\r\nYou think it would not be hard to sympathize or at least understand such tragic souls but they are so boringly written that it just makes them annoying, especially Kaneki. I get it, it is cool that he starts out as a whining loser to later become a big badass, but both of his personalities are so stereotypical anime tropes lacking anything new that the way they overemphasize his pain just makes it really tiresome. And it is more or less true for every character, especially because the adaptation feels very rushed and so they have very little time for development.  \\n\\n\r\nFor a long time I just didn't get why this story doesn't work, but the last episode made me accept the reasoning of the manga-readers: it is way too censored compared to manga. The last scene in the anime is just so brutal that even this toned down version succeeds at giving you a feeling the anime should have given from the start. The feeling of becoming totally lost that can only be dispelled by going out of your way. \\n\\n\r\nIf you want to show something that can make even the most sane man crazy you really need to try because there have already been many anime that shows you real desperation (Shingeki no Kyojin, Claymore, etc.). In many cases violence is just a tool to make things more exciting. But Tokyo Ghoul just doesn't have anything else that makes this craziness and sadness believeable.   \\n\\n\r\nThe best part of the show is its incredible opening. That\u2019s how the whole series should have felt like. \\n",

            "content": "It has potential, but the first season, which is what I'm reviewing, seems like a very long introduction to the story, and not the story itself. Maybe it is. \r\nThe plot is interesting enough and I was pleasantly surprised at the direction it chose to go in by exploring the parallelisms and contrasts between the two species. The \"cycle of hatred\" concept feels a bit overused, but like I said, Tokyo Ghoul has the potential to become a lot more reflective and critical. It definitely has the material for it. \r\nThe main problem I have with it is character development. The main characters fail tobecome anything more than the usual angst-ridden archetypes. The main protagonist, Kaneki,  is especially poorly developed. Throughout the anime he is made out to be this special, almost mythical, being that exists between the two worlds, but beyond the moral dilemma and confusion typical of anime \"half-breeds,\" he does not seem all that interesting, overshadowed by his more intriguing friends and enemies. Towards the end, he undergoes a tremendous change, but it is not adequately established why this change happened so abruptly and so completely and to such an extreme degree. To avoid spoilers, I won't go into too much detail, but suffice it to say that adopting a new world philosophy does not equate to sudden physical prowess.\\n\\n\r\nAs for said friends and enemies, saying that they are more developed than Kaneki is not saying much at all. None of them are able to distinguish themselves from other anime characters with similar roles and characteristics. Plus many are introduced so quickly with almost no backstory or introduction that I barely had time to process their part in the story. \\n\\n\r\nThere are also philosophical themes that are thrown in so randomly that I had difficultly understanding their connection and relevance to the story thus far. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, it's a quick, haphazard ride that you might enjoy if you like your gore and think of it as a prologue to something better.",

            "content": "I've watched this anime several times over, completed the manga and am up-to-date on the current Manga and airing season before deciding to write this. This will be my first review I've ever written but i see Tokyo Ghoul as being something really worth doing this for. \r\nStory- 8/10 -  The story is well written and they do a great job taking from the manga, obviously things are gonna get left out or the time of an event may change but nothing to truly ruin or change the original story line. It stays enjoyable through its entirety, Throughout the series it has some verygraphic parts that give it the horror feel but it's still a very enjoyable watch even for people not super into gore.\\n\\n\r\nArt -  9/10 - The art is fantastic, not just the character's but the scenery as well. The different ghoul's kagune look awesome in color and motion ( especially Tohka's).\\n\\n\r\nSound - 10/10 - The music for this is just amazing i really cant praise it enough. The intro is the perfect song for this series, TK from Ling Tosite Sigure has a very unique sound to him and it just fits so well with this dark and unique story.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter- 8/10 - The characters in this all have very unique personality's that you get to experience,They all become rather lovable , even the bad guys, While Kaneki may be the main character you really get a feel for a lot of the cast, who they are, what they like to do, their past, it feels like you're watching over a city as it's story about ghouls and investigators  unfolds and not just watching 1 character go through life and the struggles that come with it.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 9/10 - I personally really enjoyed this, enough to watch it several times over. The story is intriguing and there isn't a lot of filler like some anime's have. With only 12 episodes to work with in this season they did a great job keeping it interesting and moving the story along at a decent pace.\\n\\n\r\nOverall this is a really great anime, i recommended reading the manga first then moving onto this and the next season so you can really get the full experience of what the author has to tell. I did my best to not do any spoilers ( which is tough cause i totally want to rant about this explaining why i rate this so high among everything i've seen, but no spoilers for you!)",

So what we saw after that they didn't know WTF they should do they got lost in what Kaneki wants and they kept into giving us BS episodes. i give it 5/10\\n\\n\r\nArt and sounds: \\n\r\nThe way they censored everything about cutting people, made it harder to watch the anime, and it wasn't something special. But the opening and ending songs is just great and really liked it. I give the art 3/10 and the sounds 8/10.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters and enjoyment:\\n\r\nWhat a bad experience i had with the characters they deleted them all in the last episode and they just gave 0 F*cks about them, yeah Kaneki is a bad character he's just lost, till the last episode came and got his shit together to finish the anime only. They forgot about the rest it was just Kaneki trying to survive the whole show.\\n\r\nDo you want a good character development? just kill the little girl's dad and mom! loved this idea from them. Enjoyment didn't actually deliver that to me. So characters is 2/10 and enjoyment is 2/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall i give it 4/10, i didn't get much excited about what will happen over the course of watching the anime and everything turned into a fail try from this anime.\\n",

In fact, I think that the plot is thick enough here to warrant many more seasons. Season 1 does a excellent job setting the context and introducing us to the characters. It would be a shame if Tokyo Ghoul ended after just 24 episodes Including Re . If you fail to reach the midpoint of the first season, you will judge this series inaccurately based on limited data. If you make it to the midpoint, however, you will have that epiphany you've been searchingfor and the show will appear before you in a new light, as it has to me.\\n\\n\r\nThis show has great character depth and animation and was pretty hectic with the violence and despair. But it was also censored to pieces and the ending was vague. The second season may clarify some things\\n\\n\r\nDon't judge this series based on the manga; they're totally different artforms and should be judged separately. It seems to me that a lot of people who negatively judge this series are extremely biased in favor of the manga, and that's just unreasonable. \\n",

How each sides have different views of justice, but the bottom line is that we're not much different from the prejudices and stereotypes we all hate so much. One cannot judge everyone in the same category. It's like saying: \"many black people are criminals, therefore, all black people are criminals\". I liked that message, I found it intriguing. \r\nThis show lacks in character development, the story feels rushed (though it IS only 12 episodes), they censor a greatdeal of bloody and violent scenes, which I found quite annoying, and the different special powers each ghoul has is stunningly cool looking, but each ability isn't as unique as I wanted them to be. Overall it's a good anime to kill time, but it'll easily vanish away from my memories as the years go by. Nothing memorable, in other words.",

            "content": "Just imagine this, it is the first time you were in another world and you don't know anything. All you know is that the world is dangerous and that being there is no laughing matter. Well, that's how Tokyo Ghoul is to me, seeing Kaneki trying to fit into the new world he's in can actually make you realize a thing or two about the real world as well. The reason is because Kaneki is like a newborn baby suddenly being thrown into a dangerous and deadly world, of course, without doubt he will freak out. Then there's the fact about friends, that you shouldtreasure them because they are precious to you. \\n\\n\r\nThe story of Tokyo ghoul is not a let down, its interesting enough to keep me, an anime watcher who quite hate an anime where the main starts at zero and works his way up to the top. It is interesting because the way the anime adapts real life problems by using ghouls is amazing. So from this, I can actually learn about the scary world of adults and corruption, a good anime to learn from. \\n\\n\r\nThe art is not that bad either. the actions of the ghouls fighting with their kakuja and stuff is amazing. The way they try to depict the fight scenes as realistic as possible is what makes it amazing. So overall the animation is no problem. \\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack of the anime is amazing, it gives background sound to enhance how the character feels at a particular scene. If it's anger then the soundtrack follows, if its pity the soundtrack also follows. The soundtrack is also a good soundtrack to listen to without having the animation, especially the opening. This anime opening is my first opening where I can't just skip it every time I watch an episode. So in my opinion the soundtrack is top notch. \\n\\n\r\nThe character is just so amazing that I have lots to say. First of all the way they pick a seiyuu that have a voice that can be hysterical at the worst, is just super amazing. Hanae Natsuki is like the best seiyuu that they could get to act out a hysterical boy trying to adapt to a new environment, but in a very scaredy cat way. The other characters as well doesn't disappoint. also each villain in this anime also really acts like a villain and not half-half. \\n\\n\r\nOverall this anime is such a good anime for a psychological and supernatural anime mix with school. The ending of the anime makes you want to watch the last episode over and over again because you know the second season will not be coming any time soon. So its a great anime for a first timer in anime and its also a good anime for those of you who like gory or bloody because without blood this anime wouldn't be called Tokyo Ghoul, so blood plays an important role in this anime.",

            "content": "I feel obligated to defend Tokyo Ghoul because I think that most people who dislike the show fail to recognize the clever messages that Sui Ishida is trying to deliver.\r\n***************MAJOR SPOILERS********************************************\r\nThe claim that \"The manga is better than the anime\", though likely true, is misleading and should be rephrased as \"The second half of the manga is better that root A\". Why? Well because the first season of Tokyo ghoul was more or less a faithful adaptation of the manga's first half. \r\nThe only minor events cut out of the manga through adaptation that I noticed are:\r\n-Touka training kaneki and breaking his finger.\r\n- Hide andKaneki getting burgers right after kaneki became a ghoul\\n\r\n- Touka and Kaneki going to the CCG to provide false information to lure Mado to a river nearby a school, though the anime still implied that this event happened off-screen.\\n\r\n-A brief backstory involving Rize and Banjo\\n\r\n- The events leading up to Kaneki\u2019s capture by Jason are slightly more detailed.\\n\\n\r\nNone of these events have any major significance on the quality of characterization:\\n\r\n-Regarding the first event, Touka was already established as a rough character in episode 1.\\n\r\n-The anime establishes Kaneki\u2019s struggle with keeping his secret from Hide as well as his inability to eat human food.\\n\r\n-Mado is shown in Amon\u2019s backstory to have great intuition for spotting ghouls,   so the third event isn\u2019t needed.\\n\r\n-The backstory is nice, but it is so brief that losing it does not mean much.\\n\r\n-Kaneki\u2019s capture this time tells you a bit about Aogiri but nothing overly important.\\n\r\nAll of the major events in the manga were faithfully replicated in the show. Now to explain why I like this show as much as I do. \\n\r\nSeason 1 of Tokyo ghoul has two major focuses:\\n\r\nFocus #1.\tKaneki\u2019s suffering due to his refusal to make selfish decisions; he adopts his late mothers\u2019 philosophy \u201cIt is better to be hurt than to hurt others\u201d for almost the entire season, only to finally reject it in episode 12.\\n\r\nFocus #2.\tThe development of the relationship between Kaneki and Touka.\\n\\n\r\nFocus #1\\n\r\nWhen Kaneki first becomes a ghoul he experiences conflict between two desires:\\n\r\n1. The desire to interact with all people in an altruistic way. \\n\r\n2. The desire to survive, which necessarily involves eating human flesh as well as a willingness to defend oneself against attackers which are either ghoul or human.\\n\\n\r\nThis conflict is shown at multiple points:\\n\r\n-He is unwilling to take his first bite of human flesh in episode 1.\\n\r\n-His desire for flesh overcomes his desire to keep his friend Hide when his hunger becomes too great. Touka has to step in to prevent tragedy from occurring in episode 2.\\n\r\n-During Kaneki\u2019s fight with Amon, Kaneki tries to initially stop him without using excess force though he eventually gives in to his ghoul side and viciously attacks Amon in order to help Touka.\\n\\n\r\n-Episode 12 is where Kaneki\u2019s most interesting development occurs. Sui Ishida exposes the naivety of the mindset that \u201cYou should always put other people before yourself\u201d. By considering the backstory of Kaneki\u2019s mother, he makes 2 key arguments:\\n\r\n1. If you show altruism towards inconsiderate people, you will suffer. Note that by altruism I mean helping other people at your own cost which is different to simply helping others. Kaneki suffers for trying to put the needs of the psychopathic Jason before his own, just like his mother who suffered for putting the needs of the lazy and manipulative sister before her own. This is reasonable: \u201cWhy would someone be satisfied with themselves for helping someone who is not deserving of help\u201d?\\n\r\n2. Time spent showing altruism towards inconsiderate people is time not spent showing altruism towards considerate people who actually deserve it. Kaneki\u2019s mother ended up neglecting her son because time which could\u2019ve been spent taking care of him what instead used to try and financially support her sister. Kaneki showing altruism towards Jason meant that Touka\u2019s life was left in danger, though she would\u2019ve been fine if Kaneki simply fought back at Anteiku. Kaneki expresses anger at his mother\u2019s decision to care for her sister as opposed to her son. \\n\\n\r\nSo Sui Ishida exposes the philosophy of Kaneki\u2019s mother as one that is often masochistic and immoral. He argues for the importance of selfishness in certain situations, and what is clever about all of this is how he uses the purely selfish character Rize to help Kaneki become a better person by learning to be more selfish when dealing with cruel people. Kaneki accepts the ghoul part of himself i.e. the part that is selfish.\\n\\n\r\nSui Ishida, through Kaneki\u2019s character, offers the meaningful life lesson: \u201cOnly go to great lengths to help someone if and only if that person is good and shares a close relationship with you\u201d.\\n\\n\r\nFocus #2\\n\r\nWhen Kaneki first meets Touka, the two don\u2019t get along for the following reasons:\\n\r\n1.\tTouka dislikes Kaneki for his lack of sympathy. He focuses only on his own pain while disregarding any negative experiences that Touka is afflicted by. \\n\r\n2.\tKaneki dislikes Touka for her aggressiveness and rough nature. Her lack of friendliness makes her seem like a cruel person.\\n\\n\r\nAs the show progresses the two characters grow closer by having their initial impressions of each other challenged. \\n\r\nKaneki becomes more understanding of Touka and sees her as a good person. He notices the following:\\n\r\n-Her grumpy attitude is partly due to how hard she works; she balances school with a job at Anteiku and also keeps up her strength as a ghoul.\\n\r\n-She appreciates the effort that her friend Yoriko makes by consuming the food she cooked even though it makes her ill.\\n\r\n-She feels guilty over killing one of the doves so Kaneki realises that she only harms to protect herself and the people around her; she is in no way psychopathic.\\n\r\nTouka realises that Kaneki is a sympathetic person through the following events:\\n\r\n-Kaneki shows kindness towards Hinami by helping her improve at reading.\\n\r\n-Kaneki apologizes to Touka after the gourmet incident for bringing up her friend Yoriko.\\n\r\n-After Touka gets injured fighting the doves, Kaneki says that he\u2019d be upset if Touka died and then offers to help her. \\n\r\n-Kaneki compliments Touka for how she cut Hinami\u2019s hair.\\n\\n\r\nNote that at the beginning of Tokyo Ghoul, Touka only helped Kaneki because she was ordered to by Yoshimura. By the end, Touka was willing to go against Yoshimura\u2019s intentions when he said that there was no point in trying to save Kaneki; Touka has developed a deep concern for Kaneki\u2019s well-being in spite of initially hating him. \\n\\n\r\nWhat makes Touka an interesting character is that she shows that there is more to being a good person than merely being friendly: She is a hard-worker; has a conscience; appreciates the good intentions of others; is willing to listen to Kaneki\u2019s advice and has a strong desire to protect those who are close to her. Characters like Rem for Re: Zero are easy to love for their kindness and affection whereas characters like Touka can only be appreciated if one is able to judge a characters\u2019 kindness based on more than just friendliness.\\n\\n\r\nAs far as soundtrack and animation are concerned, I was more than satisfied. The tracks Licht Und Schatten and Unravel are two of my favourite tracks in all of anime.\\n\\n\r\nThat\u2019s all I really have to say about season 1 of Tokyo Ghoul and I really do feel that this anime is underappreciated by the anime community. I think it is silly to write this off as a show that only appeals to edge-lords when this show makes its characters suffer so that they can grow and not just for the sake of shock value. The easy to follow plot; the fast pacing; the great soundtrack and visuals and the shows well-handled relationship coupled with a clever critique of universal altruism make Tokyo Ghoul, I think, one of the best stories to check out for newcomers to anime.\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "My experience with the Tokyo Ghoul anime fanbase led me to believe that those who say that it's the best, or one of the best anime out there, either watched about 10 anime (including Naruto, Bleach and SAO), or are straight up emo. I'm not trying to be mean, these are just my observations so far. Feel free to prove me wrong. It's not totally horrible, but it definetely lacks in a lot of areas.\r\nPlease note that this is a review for two seasons that are released at the time of writing this review, not just the first season.\r\nYuo might like this anime if:\r\n- Youare new to anime\\n\r\n- You enjoy dark anime\\n\r\n- You don't care about the bad things, and instead focus on the good ones\\n\r\n- You are looking for some decent fighting scenes\\n\\n\r\nYou might dislike this anime if:\\n\r\n- You watched a decent ammount of anime, especially the top ones\\n\r\n- You dislike edgy shows\\n\r\n- You hate weak  main characters\\n\r\n- You are looking for well developed characters\\n\r\n- You hate shows with weird pacing\\n\r\n- You hate forced romance\\n\r\n- You are looking for an anime with a good, consistent plot\\n\\n\r\nStory: 6\\n\r\nThe biggest problem with the story of Tokyo Ghoul, is that it's all over the place. It may be caused by the length of the series, but I honestly cannot tell. The story also tries to make you feel bad for a couple of good ghouls, and portray humanity as stupid, cruel bastards, who can't understand that 5% of ghouls (who EAT ONLY HUMAN FLESH) are not evil, and instead they just eat already dead bodies, as if that's okay or something. Also the romance feels inappropriate and forced in for the sake of appealing to the younger audience.  There are redeeming qualities, as the ghoul \"culture\" is actually quite interesting. Their behavior and backstory, as well as their attempts at blending into society proved to be something that grabbed my attention more than what was actually supposed to do it. Some scenes were also okay, but the longer I watched, the worse it got. At some points I felt genuinely insulted by the stupidity of the plot. In the end it made too many stupid decisions with the direction it was taking, trying to take itself way too seriously, while some aspects of it were really dumb.\\n\\n\r\nArt and Animation: 7\\n\r\nBoth are for the most part decent, with a few drops here and there and a few really pretty scenes. The main problem I have with the artsyle however is its darkness. I understand that it's a dark show, and the artsyle should complement it, but at some point I got bored of seeing blue, dark blue, black and gray. It jumps from those colours from time to time, but while watching, you will mostly see these ones. The character designs, for the most part, are fine, but a few are just plain stupid. Not going to say which ones though, because spoilers. Overall the artstyle is okay, but nothing too memorable, maybe except for a few scenes scattered around.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9\\n\r\nThe best part of the anime in my book. I can hear the care, that has been put into the soundtrack and overall its really enjoyable. It fits the scenes well. Extra points for the first opening, and the endings. I would consider that opening to be one of the best ones ever. Ironic how I have the least to say about my favourite part of the show.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters : 4\\n\r\nSadly, the characters, that at the beggining seemed interesting, were turned into stereotypes one after another. I don't want to write an essay on every single one so I'll try to sum it up in two sentences. There are about two moments where the characters develop at all. There should be more care put into them, as the show tries hard to be heavily focused on the characters. That should be enough. This is not the biggest problem though. The biggest problem are the side characters. Basically there are too many of them, they are introduced way too fast, and you never get a chance to care about 90% of them. There are one or two exception, but that doesn't change the fact, that they are also massively underdeveloped. So was there anything that I liked about the characters? Well, while their motives were mostly trash, in some scenes they seemed believable. Not often, but sometimes. Overall I felt disappointed by the lackluster characters, as some of them had some serious potential.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 5\\n\r\nI didn't care for most of the characters, so I had to push forward without anything good to cling to. I had hopes for this, I really did, and even while the quality gradually dropped, I hoped that it would become something more. It never did. There were few scenes that grabbed my attention, but between them I had to watch something, that I wasn't really interested in. Disappointment is a word that describes my experience with this anime the best. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 6\\n\r\nIt had potential, it had good core material, it had a good idea of where it wanted to go, it had an interesting setting, but it lacked way too much to deviate from the pile of mediocre anime. While it's not the worst thing that happened to humanity, as some poeple may lead you to believe, it's not worth a watch unless you just don't have anything better to watch. But hey, if you do decide to watch it, try not to think too much, as this anime is clearly not made for that. And you should watch it, in order to witness how can something with high potential be easily ruined. Also read the manga, it's actually really good, which surprised me drastically. But hey, in the end everything is just my opinion. Just try no to call it the best thing in the world, and I won't mind.",

            "content": "I don't understand why it's so fucking hard to get an action show that's consistently entertaining. Of all the programmes I watched, Tokyo Ghoul is probably one of the few shows that actually made me feel like I was wasting my time watching it. \"Oh, why didn't you drop it?\" you might ask? Well for starters, I was actually following the programme as it was airing at the time (fun fact: I actually had the most upvoted preview at the time, but it got taken down because the show finished airing). But that isn't enough to truly explain why I so viscerally despise Tokyo Ghoul.Yeah, this show was beaten into the ground but I still got pent-up feelings of frustration that I need to vent.\\n\\n\r\nI think the biggest reason as to why I fucking hate Tokyo Ghoul is because of how often it denied me my greatest pleasure as an anime viewer: intense action brimming with blood and broken bones. The first episode starts off with a ghoul feeding and then escaping, then it cuts to a REALLY nice opening sequence which then further sets the mood and I was just thinking to myself \"aw yeah, this is gonna be awesome!\" but then guess what happens? It cuts to some punk kid getting ready for his blind date and it isn't until half-way through the episode when we find out that his date was a ghoul. The ghoul tries to eat him, they get into an accident at some construction site, shit happens, and now the punk has the ghoul organs inside him. You know what that means, right? MORE BULLSHIT THAT GETS IN THE WAY OF THE ACTION!\\n\\n\r\nA recurring theme of the show is Kaneki's struggle to accept his new ghoul status. He happens across a pair of benevolent ghouls who ease him through this transition but even so, Kaneki still wants to mope about. You see, I wouldn't really have such a problem with this but Kaneki isn't likeable in my book. This mostly stems for the fact that I've got a /VERY/ deep-seated resentment built-up toward Shinji Ikari clones and Kaneki certainly fits the bill and then some: he's a punk kid forcibly brought into a life-altering situation and now has to shoulder the burdens of this new life. It also helps that his female sidekick, Tohka has purple hair just like Misato and tries to get him settled in. Great...\\n\\n\r\nOn top of this, the whole reason why Kaneki's life got flipped, turned upside-down is mind-numbingly retarded when you think about what actually happened to him: the guy was on the verge of dying and he ends up getting the organs of his would-be murderer (who is also a ghoul) transplanted into him. So you mean to tell me that there is NO screening process to see whether or not someone is a ghoul, let alone whether or not an organ came from a human or a ghoul even though humans and ghouls have coexisted since time immemorial? Also, how is it that the ghoul's organs could've been transplanted into Kaneki so easily? Assuming that ghouls and humans have nearly identical physiologies (which is already a fucking asinine assumption to make because ghouls are man-eaters that can mutate at whim), how is it that the ghoul and Kaneki would have the same blood type or whatever it is that keeps a transplanted organ from getting rejected? The list of holes in the story get bigger and bigger, but I think I've made my point.\\n\\n\r\nNow you may be thinking to yourself \"oh, why overthink this show?\" or \"why do you have to bring real world logic into this?\" Well guess what? This show is quite possibly the furthest thing from entertaining possible. I can tolerate the annoying main character and his bitching to some extent and I can let the gaps in logic slide provided that the show is entertaining enough to override my critical faculties. Unfortunately, this show just LOVES to deny me my fix of fast-paced action filled to the brim with all kinds of blood, guts, broken bones, and all that good shit! For almost 17 minutes of every 20 minute episode, we gotta put up with Kaneki's bitching, boring talking scenes involving the ghoul enforcement squad or whatever it's called, etc and then we get a few minutes of Kaneki tapping into the power of Ghoul ex Machina and then we see him using his magic ghoul powers to make pizza sauce and not much else. On top of that, the censorship was absolutely appalling when it was airing. The entire screen's colour palette would be inverted for 1-2 minutes at a time, and all that was being censored was just Kaneki stabbing the latest villain who's impossible to take seriously with his magic ghoul tentacles. Yeah, censorship's a non-issue now that the Blu-rays are out but that still doesn't erase what happened.\\n\\n\r\nBy the end of it all, there's a lot of shit that can be said about Ghoul and most of it sure as hell ain't gonna be pleasant from me. The only thing that's keeping this show from being so bad that it shouldn't even be mentioned in the same sentence that barrels are in is the fact that it's got some pretty colours and a nice OST to it. The only value that this abysmal excuse for a show has is snark bait. Now if you just so happen to unironically enjoy this programme, good on ya. You're able to do something I clearly can't do. Maybe the manga will be much better than this piece of crap but given the EXTREMELY sour taste that the anime left in my mouth, I can't really say that I'll give the manga a shot. Anyway, that's all for now. Feedback's welcome and all that guff, so I'm out. Peace :)\\n\\n\r\n***\\n\\n\r\nIf someone has a mod for Reaper on the PC version of Overwatch that makes Reaper look like white-haired Kaneki with the mask, please send me a video of it.",

I had heard nothing but rave reviews so I decided I should check it out; needless to say, I'm glad I did. \r\nThe concept itself of Tokyo Ghoul was incredible to me -- \"Ghouls\", people-like monsters who need human flesh to survive -- but that's just the basis. What they made this concept was what really captivated me. Keneki begins as a naive, good-hearted boy; and, unlike many other series, his transformation is much more realistic. The care placed in the developmentof the main character is wonderful, but what makes this anime a standout to me is how much is put into the side characters as well. The writers created many, many characters you can genuinely feel for.  As someone who gets bored quickly with unnecessary side back stories and characters, I really appreciate this aspect of the story.\\n\\n",

            "content": "One of my many not-so-popular opinions is that this is one of the greatest \"tame horror\" animes of all time.\r\nThe first thing that caught me was the music. The title sequence and the song 'Unravel' are both beautiful, and masterfully expel a mild eerie feeling, not too much to deter the average anime watcher from continuing, but still enough to let you know that it's gonna get creepy.\r\nThe second thing that caught me is that even though this is a pretty gory anime, massive or obscene amounts of blood or gore are usually blacked out. You may be thinking, \"well any horror cartoon can censor\"..but personally, the animation style and the characters reactions to the horror in front of them is so much more subtle and, well terrifying in some cases if you're not de-sensitised to horror by now. \\n\\n\r\nAs much as I praise this series for it's creepy art, great music and animation style.. Some of the characters are just so dull. Although, sometimes this isn't such a bad thing, as the majority of the time it plays into the whole \"emotionally exhausted\" vibe that a lot of the characters give off. As great as that is, it does stunt the development of the story in the emotional aspect, which slows the anime down a bit. I didn't really see that as a bad thing though, but I know it annoys some people.\\n\\n\r\nThe main thing is, I absolutely love this anime. Mostly because of it's atmosphere and it's masterful use of censorship to tone down the gore. I'd really recommend this to people who are smack bang in the middle of the \"scary scale\" when it comes to fear factor.\\n\r\nFor people who loved Deathnote, got enjoyably freaked out by Future Diary/Mirai Nikki, but aren't ready for the likes of Corpse Party or Deadman Wonderland. I'd recommend this to people who love outright gore and mildly psychopathic characters, but absolutely hate jump-scares like I do. \\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Tokyo Ghoul was one of the anime I was admittedly on the fence about watching. However, I decided to give it a shot, and what I will say is that it was definitely worth my time, and just might be worth your time as well. To save everybody some reading, I\u2019ll break it down as simply as I can. I\u2019m sure other reviews can give a good enough basis of the plot so we\u2019ll go ahead and skip that. \r\nNot many anime compel me to want to go back and read the manga, but Tokyo Ghoul did. Not only because I had heard the mangawas better from others, but because the story isn\u2019t as fleshed out as I would have liked. Now I haven\u2019t read any of it yet, so I can only give this review in terms of somebody who has only seen the anime.\\n\r\nI will say that I love the concept; it just lacked the proper amount of time to fit everything in nicely. The pacing feels incredibly rushed, and for the story that lies underneath it all, it definitely deserved more... a lot more. So while it\u2019s an enjoyable experience, it feels like pieces are missing at times, character development falls a little flat, and that dampens the overall effectiveness of the presentation. Again, I still found it to be enjoyable, and not nearly as mediocre as many claimed, but I can understand why manga readers in particular may be upset. \\n\\n\r\nThe art style is good, I love the designs and everything is pretty aesthetically pleasing even though I\u2019d say the animation is just about average when compared to some other current anime. Oh, and yes of course it\u2019s better uncensored. The censoring that this anime originally received is what put me off of it to begin with, but now it can be watched in all its original gory glory, the way it should be. \\n\\n\r\nThe music is definitely fantastic. It\u2019s probably my favorite aspect to the entire presentation of the show. The intro is absolutely beautiful, and as somebody who generally skips intros to save time I had to refrain from that for Tokyo Ghoul. I\u2019ve found myself sitting through not only the intro but also the end credits of every episode. The voice acting is also great. All of the characters do a good job and at the end of the day that definitely helps keep the viewer engaged in what\u2019s going on. So thumbs up on that!\\n\\n\r\nOverall, will you like Tokyo Ghoul? Honestly I think it\u2019s hit or miss, but it is definitely something you should at least watch a couple episodes of to see if you personally like what it has to offer. I had a hard time giving this a 6/10, it has so many things that are good about it, and yet so many glaring flaws. You may end up being pleasantly surprised like I was. It's a flawed yet worthy adventure. Just remember, if you want the *full* Tokyo Ghoul experience you will have to pick up the manga! \\n",

            "content": "I literally wanted to kill anyone who was about 100 cm in radius within me after i finished the last episode. \r\nDon't get me wrong, it was not because of the fact there were no episodes,NOT because there was a million dollar cliffhanger at the end but because of the emotional intensity of this anime.\r\nAh~ i remember Tokyo Ghoul manga- it was that one manga under the horror category which i didn't wanted to read- because i judged it's cover, but ultimately the manga rose to get a good rating and here we are the anime: the most wanted thing in the world for somepeople. Read the synopsis first- it would give you some clueless story about Ghouls and stuff- but don't judge just watch and experience.\\n\\n\r\nStory:I actually forgot the watch this story in the 3rd person view so i can criticize and judge it accurately- but that failed because the story was one of those which you get immersed from the start. This one i get is filed under the horror category, which i began to wonder which freaking part was horror. The battle scenes should have been thought out more- or they could have created an epic battle system. Character pasts of the story was emotional- it could make you cry whether you are a man/woman or a child. (yes so apparently 13 and 8 year olds watches this too) There were hints of ecchi- a little bit throughout the anime- the character development of the main lead was epic but alas it was given at the last moment. \\n\\n\r\nArt: Absolutely stunning, this anime has that vivid animating feature where you are in the middle of an epic battle or something important and something which is 100% reluctant to stay out of the safe zone comes inside and disturbs that epic scene causing it to be more intensifying for the audience. Kaneki's mask I'll wager is one of those popular Otaku iconic element in the 2014 for sure. \\n\r\nThe Scenic atmospheric elements have been reorganized to suit the emotions of the characters: for example, When the theme \"Hope\" is given- you can see the sun rising and bathing the current scenery with sunlight to suit the mood. I personally loved how the Intro totally matched the opening theme- extremely good. \\n\\n\r\nSound:The opening theme was heaven to me. The ending was good. The lyrics of the opening matches Kaneki's situation so much that it seemed to me that it was made for this anime or something. There was good soundtracks but no signature ones i guess, all i know that it suited the mood perfectly. The Seiyus were superb. Also someone should stop giving Miyano-san which makes him look more like a sadistic bastard you know. *hehe*\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: Kaneki is one of the iconic anime males in 2014, no doubt. You can see his image almost everywhere- his Ghoul mask illustrating most of his emotions. You get all sorts of interesting characters, their attitudes which justifies the situation- You get sadistic characters a lot in this one- all they think about is eating. We also see how people who get converted to be like animals- how they suffer in isolation and solitude. Their pasts dealing who they are mostly in every situation. The only personalties i took interest in was Hideyoshi/Uta/Kaneki and Suzuya. Take note of Hideyoshi that guy is very sharp, he is one of those memorable secondary best friend lead i've ever seen. and Suzuya's not what he is meant to be obviously. Mysterious symbolic elements are within this anime like a hidden object game which can tell it's own story to the audience if you can predict the future story by picking up the pace and the patterns.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Before i started this anime- i knew it was epic to the core, everyone was talking about it, so many positive reviews. And yes i saved it for Halloween because i knew it was epic. I was literally crying at the middle of 11th and kicking the chair,shaking the PC with frustration during the 12 th episode along with my womanly tears for Kaneki- which i had no regret whatsoever for shedding them. There were some good humour in the anime- but would have liked more of it. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: It's definitely must-watch, this anime gives out very good morales. Apparently doing good to people does not always give you good- you gotta need some luck for it. Also there were many negative complaints about this being censored- i'm not going to voice my opinion on this but indirectly i would say- I watched horror all my life and the best horror stories/urban legends whatever does not need gore or jump scares to make it good. It all depends on the emotions which can give to the reader/audience and the story itself being unique and interesting. This anime very accurately gave out that disregarding utter gore but nevertheless did not completely fail to be a horror anime. Also keep in mind it's the world that's messed up not you- you voluntarily gets messed up because you can't handle it. Those who are the strongest are not the ones who have the best powers or physical strength, they are the ones who can keep their sanity and move through this hell like world. \\n\\n\r\nHappy Halloween 2014!\\n\r\nAnd a dedicated review to Kaneki Ken.",

            "content": "Some Spoilers Ensue:\r\nWow...that finale....I needed a few minutes after it ended. This show was brilliant. The genre of 'zombie' or what have you is extremely overdone right now, so a show coming out about ghouls who eat humans didn't seem like it would be that good. I was happily proven wrong about that. This is considered horror, and it is, which is refreshing since it's tough to find horror anime. Also, I love that this show didn't hold back on the character deaths and psychological turmoil, especially that which was inflicted on poor Kaneki in the last episodes. It was delivered well, and added ahuge shock factor to the show. Next to Book Of Circus, this is my favorite anime this summer.\\n\\n\r\nStory: Ghouls are able to only eat one person per month, and live well...but there is one person who has been binge eating and causing problems in Tokyo. From that opening, we are treated to an interesting and action/horror packed ride through the world of ghouls. Some are heartless, some are funny, and some are loving. The beauty of the story is the fact that you don't know the outcome for any specific character. All can change. The reveals and plot twists were excellent and I was hooked from the first episode.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: what can I say? It is definitely gorgeous to watch. The ghouls are interesting to look at as are all their different powers. The visuals throughout were lovely, however I would have liked to see more gore...but you're listening to a horror conesuer talking here.\\n\\n\r\nSound: outstanding...just wonderful voice acting especially from Kaneki. There's a scene at the beginning where he has just been turned ghoul and he bites into his favorite burger and starts crying...it gave me chills. The ending as well during all of the torture, he was just amazing to listen to as he went through all that horror. The theme song is one of my favorites of late as well and I highly recommend the amazing OST.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: From jump, Kaneki was well developed. He is loveable and naive which are qualities that sometimes hinder the character, but not here because his dark side is also beautiful. Rize and Jason along with any other opposing villains were also very 3 dimensional causing the viewer tho harbor extreme love or hate towards any of them. I don't so much like Toka (just my preference) but am fond of Nishiki and definitely Tsukiyama. Villain or not, they are super interesting.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I hope they are going to do another season because I loved this show, but for now, I'll try to mend my feels.\\n\\n\r\n8.5/10 Watched Subbed.\\n",

            "content": "~~ This review contain spoiler ~~\r\n       I think that the zombie reinvention in Tokyo Ghoul is, quite frankly, disturbing. I mean, wow, zombies with sentience... Great. Which makes the series interesting to watch actually because it will make you believe that all is lost for humankind etc. EXCEPT (spoiler alert) there are humans that can go neck and neck with these mostrosities. Shocking, right?\r\n        Now, all is well and good and until episode 10, I thought that I can rate this series 7.5 (or maybe a solid 8 at the highest), butthen that's where I realized that the pacing was off. No offense to the amount of effort put into the first 10 episodes, but episode 12 just has SO MUCH impact, that I've watched it nearly as many times as Shougo Makishima's death scene. In my honest opinion, producer should've stretched the ending out more and cut the Doves' screen time.\\n\\n\r\n         The other thing that made me like the series less is the fact that after all his griping and suffering, the protag got an epic power boost, again, in the bitter end. And I think that the importance of his being a hybrid is overshadowed by the fact that he was kidnapped... Wow. There should've been more substance to his character (and Hide's too) but there isn't much that can be done in 12 episodes.\\n\\n\r\n         For the plus points: powerful opening song by TK, who coincidentally sung Psycho Pass' op. Unravel's mood actually matches the mood of the entire series. (The ed is laid back, but still pretty memorable). So, without further ado, I rate this ANIME (without iiinfluece from the manga) a 7.",

            "content": "This review contains SPOILERS so do not read this review if you have not watch Tokyo Ghoul.\r\nTokyo Ghoul is an action, bloodthirsty and supernatural anime that has lot of bloodshed and violence. If you want to watch an anime that has a lot of action, I recommend to watch this one. Tokyo Ghoul is like Deadman Wonderland and the video game Prototype. The anime has superpowers and a good story.\r\nStory -7: The story is impressive, where ghouls who loves tasty meaty human flesh and if they eat anything else they will feel sick and vomit but it the story some missing elements. For example wedo not know much about the protagonist Kaneki and the anime does not tell us any information about him till the end of the anime. They need to give us more information on what the ghouls are. They need say why the ghouls cannot resist human flesh or why do the food taste awful to the ghouls or ancient history about them. Sometimes the story can be very confusing at times that you will keep saying \"I thought he.... When did he....\". Characters you cannot tell if they are dead or not, for example the one that Kaneki was dating she was been crushed by a building and I don't know if she was alive or dead. Sometimes I don't know what's is going, I keep saying \"Who died?, who is this or that?, why does everyone want to kill Kaneki!?.\" \\n\r\nWell the ending was too effortless for it not to have a season two. They must have a season two for it to end like that. The anime ended too quickly, they should have made 25 episode instead of 12.\\n\\n\r\nArt/Sound - 7: I can't judge on the art because they are all good in almost every anime.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 7: Our protagonist Kaneki is not that strong, I mean not his character but his strength. He keeps getting his ass kicked in every battle and somebody always has to help him. He has a lot to learn to control his power but then I think to myself, his half human, half ghoul so he would not  have the capable power of a full ghoul. And weirdest thing is that the food for example the hamburger, he tasted it and it was awful, that makes no sense. I mean his a \"half half\" right? can't the food be tasteless and he will not be starving. And he is a \"half half\" having human flesh should not be the only nutrients that he has can only have and he shouldn't be tempted of eat human flesh so bad, I mean he has half humanity left in him right? He seems like a ghoul instead of half half makes no sense. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 8: You will enjoy the action and bloodshed in this anime but I will say it again, it is like a Prototype where the blades come out of their hands and they can use powers, have different abilities.\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 7: This anime is good don't listen to the haters and 10 year old. I think the story, the action and drama is very good but it lacks of explanation.",

Eventually, sooner or later you are going to end up breaking up, or you are going to end up hooked up for life; these are just about the end of possibilities for most. What you don't expect is to avoid getting eaten, to have their organs surgically inserted into you, and for you to live out the rest of your days as a bloodthirsty vampire (I'd say \"ghoul\", but come on, the influences here are clearly more vampire-inspired).\r\nI probably enjoyed this much more than I thought I would, consideringI'm no longer a teenager or \"edgy\", so I guess that suggests for the most part this anime is particularly well-made. The soundtrack is on point, the animation has clearly had some effort put in, and the Kagune/Quinque's make for a creative means for battles (not to mention a lot of gratuitous violence). A lot of fun so far, decent pulp entertainment. 7/10",

            "content": "Tokyo Ghoul feels like a show that really wanted to be something dark and grown up, but had to be pulled back into it's shonen roots. I'm unfamiliar with it's origins, so I can't comment on that, but the show itself has a decent premise - the idea that there is another breed of humanity (?) called Ghouls. These ghouls have enhanced strength, speed, durability, an odd power-signature called a gleam, and an overpowering hunger for human flesh. They HAVE to eat it - and I like that the story has built in reasons as to why. At first, I thought this was just goingto be another take on the \"vampire who chooses not to drink blood\" trope, but no, a ghoul who starves themselves will inevitably go mad/rabid from hunger. Their tongues develop different taste buds, making natural foods taste rancid, and eating human food can even poison a ghoul. \\n\\n\r\nHowever, what, exactly, a ghoul is isn't explained very well. Are they like mutants, just an off-shoot branch of human evolution? I'd buy that, but then what is their gleam? The show has several gleams manifest throughout and they're all slightly different. They all originate from the back of the ghoul, and many appear to be tails of bright colors, but there are also wing-gleams or more blade-like gleams. Just what are these supposed to be? And there's the fact that they're apparently removable.\\n\\n\r\nThis hidden society is policed by the Doves - as they're nicknamed by the Ghouls - and the Doves use weapons called qinque. A qinque appears to be the gleam of a ghouls removed from their body. How this works without the body, I don't know. How the qinque, which often change shape or move according to natural instructions, function without their natural form, I don't know. It's never addressed in the body of the show.\\n\\n\r\nThe series itself features a number of ghouls and (largely) two Doves, but our star is a Normal, Quiet, Average Young Man named Kaneki. He's pretty boring and largely uninteresting until he has ghoul parts put into his body and thus, he becomes half-ghoul, and we follow him into this world. \\n\r\nI have to say, I didn't like Kaneki all the way through the show. He's too quiet and too withdrawn for a lead character. He falls into each situation, barely manages to make it out alive, and makes no decisions. Everything he has in the show is handed to him and that REALLY bothered me - until episode 12. I won't go into details, as the Guidelines say to avoid spoilers, but episode 12 explains Kaneki's motivations from the beginning. It also breaks those motivations and suddenly I'm much more interested in where he's going. It's actually a shame that the change in character happens only at the end because New Kaneki suddenly has a bite to him.\\n\\n\r\nThe show also throws in the \"he's a half-breed, so he's more powerful!\" trope, which only bothers me because the nature of what creates a ghoul is never explored in this. Given that Kaneki is the first human turned into a ghoul by science (it appears), that would make me think that he should be critical to the ghoul/human situation. Isn't there some kind of gene test to see if someone is a ghoul? I would think that if a body can only process human flesh, there HAS to be something going on with that. But again, we get no explanation, just that Kaneki tastes better than any other human and when another ghoul eats some of him they get super-charged and on and on. \\n\\n\r\nThere are a smattering of side-characters that are vaguely interesting. For me, Amon - who is one of the Doves - is the most interesting character in the show. He's a lawman, looking to bring the ghouls to heel, but the loss of someone close to him pushes him further. I don't quite buy the logic of this drive, as the character who dies is kind of insane and really unrelatable, but at least Amon makes decisions and CHOOSES to do something about it.  \\n\\n\r\nAs I said at the start, the show really starts to push itself into darker themes - ghouls predation on humanity, how hunting ghouls affects the Doves, how ghouls interact with each other, and how both sides tend to view the other as something less than human. But then it also pulls back at nearly all of these story points. Amon's partner, Mado, comes off as a ghoul-hunting-psychotic, but we're never shown why, and it's hard to care for him when he laughs as he kills people that the show goes out of it's way to make you care for. The show seems to be presenting neither side as right, and positions Kaneki to be the bridge between the two, but he's so busy getting the crap beaten out of him and being indecisive that nothing ever comes from this.\\n\\n\r\nThe show LOOKS good for the most part. Character designs are clean and effective, no two characters look alike, and the fighting animation looks good. The visual effects for the gleams were really well done and often pretty neat looking.\\n\\n\r\nDespite my overall complaints about the show, it's watchable, although I did have to kind of drag myself to the finish line once I got to the last three episodes. There are a lot of interesting concepts brought up in the show, but it fails to explore those satisfactorily. I'm hesitant to say that maybe if it ran for longer, it would have, but I kind of get the feeling that it wouldn't have. Thankfully for it's narrative, an interesting world and interesting side characters make the show entertaining enough to string the watcher along. I wouldn't ever put this on my Top Ten list, but it isn't horrible either.",

            "content": "[I HAVE NOT READ THE MANGA, SO THIS REVIEW IS FROM SOMEONE WITH NO KNOWLEDGE ABOUT IT]\r\nMy first impression of this anime was; \"Wow, this actually could be a decent one\". I was right, but I was also wrong at the same time.\r\nI was surprised to see an anime with a dark theme which also was assiciated with the shounen genre, since of the year having lacked such deep, griddy and dark elements in an anime. So I was actually pleased to see something different. Now since it was a shounen, I was expecting no more than a mediocre anime that everyone will forget aboutin a couple of months, though this anime seems to have left a mark in the community, even if the story progression was not all that great.\\n\\n\r\nI have to say that the first half of Tokyo Ghoul was pleasing to watch, to a certain extent that is. This is because it had a nice progression and didn't rush anything to explain the situation that every character is in. After all the first impression is the most important one. Though I wish I could say the same thing about the second half. The second half seems rushed compared to the first, since it was not as slow paced and well organized as the other one. They introduced many characters that did not play much part in the anime for the rest of the series. This is also the point where I think that the story telling itself got sloppy. The main character, Kaneki Ken, lost almost all of the attention and the position for main character seemed to have switched off the the secondary characters. I have to say though that the last episode did make the first half justice.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is very tragic and the way the studio presented it with the art complimented the story accurately. It had a lot of shadows but not too many to keep one confused (this is, of course, if you ignore the constant censoring). The character designs, were pretty down to earth. No one had insanely unnatural aspects about them, ignoring the hair colors chosen. The way the characters are drawn were to be expected from a modern shounen.\\n\\n\r\nThey had different variants of characters, though they were mostly stereotypes or copy paste characters from different shows.\\n\\n\r\nSince I have a kind of love/hate relationship with this anime I could not let it go even if my brain told me to. It was mediocre at best and will never rise above mediocrity. That is why I am rating this anime 5/10",

            "content": "\"To be, or not to be\" says William Shakespeare in Hamlet. If Sui Ishida was a poet, he would maybe have written something similar to this, \"To be, or not to be a ghoul\". But Mr.Ishida is Japanese, not English and that's why he wrote a manga and made a lot of Otakus very happy. In 2014 an, on this manga based, anime came out, with the same name. May I present...TOKYO GHOUL!\r\nPlot and Story Line\r\nOkay, before I start with the plot and story I have to make one thing clear. Although the manga and the anime are similar, they are not the same. Funimationchanged the chronology  and a trifle of the main plot  and added some annoying censorship (more about it in animation section).The main story line however, remains the same, and let's review this thing already. \\n\r\nWe firstly need a setting for this story. Tokyo, Japan. In recent time the city is being haunted by half-human half-monster creatures called Ghouls. The ghouls have special abilities and enormous strenght, but have to carry the \"curse\" of not being able to eat human food. They have to eat human flash in order to survive. But eventough it's hard for them to survive without it, some ghouls try not to eat humans. At least not the living ones.\\n\\n\r\n In such a crazy world lives Ken Kaneki, a rather ordinary 18-year-old university student. One day, Kaneki decides to go out on a date with a very intelligent, as he thought, girl called Rize. Poor Kankei, he didn't know what was waiting for him. While walking Rize home, she suddenly attacs him and reveals her true self. Yes Kaneki, Rize is a ghoul. I am sorry. Luckily, an accident on the construction side, stopped Rize from eating Kaneki, yet he had to be hospitalized. In order to save his life the doctor Kanou transplanted some of Rize's organs into Kaneki. But what Kaneki thought was a kidney was actually Rize's kagune (a ghoul's predatory organ used as their weapon). Dear dr.Kanou, that usually  makes experiments with ghouls, turned our cute, innocent Kaneki into a half-ghoul. And that's my dear readers when everythings starts. \\n\\n\r\nI mentioned the Hamlet quote for a good reason, because most of the anime turns into a fight of human-Kaneki and ghoul-Kaneki. The steady struggle inside kills him (not literary). Just imagine the pain he had trying not to eat human beings, being one too just a day ago.\\n\r\n His moral and attachment to humanity kept him up all this time. And as such, he also tryed to make the humans and ghouls understand each other. In a couple of moments he spares the life of ghoul investigators trying to explain that ghouls also have a human side, like him and the other non-human-eating-ghouls at Ainteku. Unfortunately, that didn't work. His dream as a half-ghoul to be the linking bound between those two worlds turned into a nighmare and made him realize on thing: \"This world is wrong\". \\n\\n\r\nIf you decide to watch or read Tokyo Ghoul, be prepared. There is so much action, so many fights and so many bloodshead. It is just amazing. I really love action and there were some action scenes I watched twice. I just had to, because they were so epic. If you are a action-adict as me, I am sure that you will love Tokyo Ghoul. I garantee you an intersting story from the very beginning making you imaptient for the third season to air. \\n\r\nThe only little disadvantage of this anime are some plot holes in the background stories but they are negligible. \\n\r\nI became a huge fan of Tokyo Ghoul after watching it. You should see my school notebooks. Full of drawings of Suzuya, Touka and my own Tokyo Ghoul O.C.s. Now let's see the characters.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters\\n\r\nHmm...Wahat to say about the characters. Just great. There are so many different charactes, unique personalities and awesome character developments regarding their background stories. I loved almost every character in this anime, whether he was a villian or a hero. The \"almost every\" is beacuse of the one and only guy I hated in this anime. Ayato Kirishima, the younger brother of Touka. I just didn't like his attitude and the way he thought about the world. Nevermind, let's move on to the three I want to talk about.\\n\r\nKEN KANEKI as said in the beginning, an ordianry 18-year-old student that loves to read in his free time. Although most people would call him weak and a cry-baby, I wouldn't. His pain is so damn hard to bear because he was made as a ghoul, he wasn't born as one. You have to look at it from his point of view. I envied him on his humanity and attitude, I really did.\\n\r\nThere she is. TOUKA KIRISHIMA is such a badass of a woman. She is so strong and independent, and although she looks cold-hearted, deep inside she is a very caring and nice person always ready to save the ones that are close to her. I also have to mention the way she manages to have a normal human life despite being a ghoul. I am actually a bit sad about her loosing her tuff and badass personality in the end, not fair Mr.Ishida and Funimation.\\n\r\nThis is my favorite character of all. JUUZOU SUZUYA is a childish, optimistic and crazy person that went trough a lot of pain in his childhood. He is so funny but detremine and careless that makes him the most unigue character I've ever seen. His personality developes to a more responsible ghoul investigator in the Tokyo Ghoul: Re manga series. It's still airing...\\n\\n\r\nAnimation and Style\\n\r\nAs said in the previous review I decided to add \"Style\" to this review section, so let's see. Firstly the animation. As expected from a 2014 anime, the animation is awesome. Bright and dark colors when needed, awesome backrounds and what's most to pride is the caharacter design. The style of this anime is also outstanding. One of the best I've ever seen. It's unique and special, just beautiful.I have to mention the fact that that's the reason that made me watch this anime. A good friend of mine told me about the epic animation of Tokyo Ghoul and I thought :\"I have to see that one\". I wasn't disappointed and became a great fan in an instant.\\n\\n\r\nConclusion:\\n\r\nWatch Tokyo Ghoul folks! It is amazing and has already become a cliche anime in the world. You have an interesting story a smooth plot, some awesome characters and unfrgetable fights. I truly recommend you to watch it and please don't judge it on the first glance, there is a lot of deep stuff in this show. My dear readers, Tokyo Ghoul!\\n\\n\r\nYour AnimeGirl",

            "content": "Lately i have found much enjoyment in Dark animes, Tokyo Ghoul was to much satisfaction giving me all the Dark Fantasy anime i needed. This show really gets going quite early and with only 12 episodes in the first season, that is expected. Regardless there is enough material in those 12 episodes to leave me wanting more. \r\nFirst off the story of Tokyo ghoul is a frightening dark one, more so then what i was expecting. Our main character Ken Kaneki is faced with the burden of becoming a ghoul (Not by choice, watch and find out why.) he must find ways to deal withthe many problems a ghoul faces, for example being hunt down by Anti-Ghoul investigators or learning how to accept eating humans. On the way he meets other Ghouls who become his friends and help guide him through these hard trials. It is your typical Dark Anime story: A character accepting his new way of life. Eventually we learn there are good ghouls who try and co-exist with humans and bad ghouls who want to rid of the humans. The story leads to a 3 way battle between the \"good ghouls\" (Anteiku), the \"bad ghouls\" (Aogiri Tree) and  the Commission of Counter Ghouls.\\n\\n\r\nI have not much to say about Art and Sound as I do not watch anime for those reasons, But i will say i had no problem with anything of the sort in Tokyo Ghoul.\\n\\n\r\nBack to our main Character Ken Kaneki, a human who becomes a ghoul. His character does not take well to the transition of becoming a human eating ghoul (who would) alot of crying and weeping occurs for Ken Kaneki, sadly enough it takes along time for it to end. I was hoping the transition to him accepting his new life and becoming the hero of the story would happen sooner. There are a few moments were we see the potential he holds but it doesn't come to full capacity until we near the end. Outside of Ken Kaneki we dont get a view into any of the characters other lifes, and once again with only 12 episodes it is quite hard to. Toka's life (One of the first \"good ghouls\" ken encounters) is still much of a mystery come the end of season. As well as Hide, kens bestfriend who is a human. On a side note i did enjoy the character Sh\u016b Tsukiyama who really embraces the Dark side of this anime with his fond appetite and sadistic ways.\\n\\n\r\nOverall Tokyo Ghoul was quite dark and a few times made me cringe, and in a way thats what makes me like it. Backed up by an interesting story of the life of a Ghoul and i find myself pretty satisfied.Still, 12 episodes was not enough and i hope the 2nd season explains alot more about the background story of some of the characters. Also quite excited to see the new Ken Kaneki. Tokyo Ghoul season 1 receives a solid 8.2 thriving off the interesting life of a Ghoul!",

            "content": "Ever had that moment where someone told you, \"hey wanna hear something?\" and they end up saying never mind? Any normal human being would feel like they've been left hanging and leaves one thinking \"what was he/she going to tell me? is it bad? good?\" This is the experience you will get with this particular season of Tokyo Ghoul. After watching it, you will be left with a void; and not the kind of void where you hunger for more, rather one of those \"read the manga\" kinda trolled feeling. As of writing the review, there is a second season but I will be focusingon this first season.\\n\\n\r\nThe story/plot is nothing to write home about, however, it isn't something to completely brush off as a generic plotline that is highly predictable either. There are 2 beings, Ghouls and Humans. Ghouls eat humans because their the only ones that are considered nutritious to the body of a ghoul and humans are pretty much defenseless outside of the CCG (anti-ghoul operators). Then comes in our MC Kaneki Ken who somehow becomes an oddball to society after an encounter and it makes him half human, half ghoul. \\n\\n\r\nThe problem with the whole story line is if you're interested in backstories of how things come to be, then this show does nothing to fill that hole. There is no explanation of how ghouls came to exist, how humans have dealt with ghouls and why is society the way it is even though they have been together for 70+ years (going off one of the ghoul characters in the show). These are things that if left unanswered, makes some viewers think where the show is headed towards. For this kind of show, just turn your brain off and enjoy the censored violence/action scenes. Don't try to delve into a deeper concept of the show or you'll turn up empty.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters are fairly standard. They introduce a boatload of characters, but in 12 episodes, there really is no room to bring out any character traits for any of them. What you see is what you get. I felt Ken was the only character in the show to have some kind of motivation to answer one a question of the show's plot being if humans can coexist with ghouls. Every episode kept bringing forth new characters and it became more of a violent, fighting show more so than for other aspects that people may enjoy such as character development/story development. \\n\\n\r\nSound is pretty good, its hype when it needs to be and music fits the mood of certain scenes in the show. If whoever is reading this hasn't watched the show, you can watch the opening and call it a wrap because its probably the only thing i enjoyed in the series besides the last episode. \\n\\n\r\nTokyo ghoul definitely had the pieces it needed to be a more thought provoking and conceptual show, but it falls flat probably to please a certain audience that I'm unaware of. I've not read the manga for this, but if it disproves my thoughts on the show then so be it. This is strictly a review for the first season. \\n\\n\r\nFinal thoughts- watched too many great shows and need something to ease up with? Grab some popcorn and enjoy the blood/violence. Make sure to turn your brain off because deeper and more meaningful themes are not present in this first season.",

            "content": "Tokyo Ghoul is a supernatural- horror(questionable) anime summer release, or simply put propably the most anticipated aka hyped anime of the year.\r\nThe fact that they released only 12 episodes it was definitely a deteriorating factor, thats why i will judge the anime by its 12 episodes and not ''how could it turned to be if it were more' afterall thats a producing studio decision and it would have been UNFAIR for the anime itself to be judged like that.\r\nSpecifically:\r\nStory 7: Inevitably it was rushed, but it had a steady flow and some very interesting twists. Its crucial to mention that it succeeds where many otheranimes have failed..and thats to create a very dark enviroment even though i wouldnt label it as a pure horror anime.\\n\\n\r\n1 Ghouls that apart from flesh and blood are keen on cofee? Hell yeah!\\n\\n\r\nDifferent kind of masks to personalize the ghouls a little bit more? Hell yeah\\n\\n\r\nThese were some interesting little things that definitely enhanced the anime and improved the immersion\\n\\n\r\nArt 8 : Art is of top notch..lively colorfoul and very realistic. The battle are definitely above average, and of course cagounes steal the show.You wonna see some epic battles full of blood and some gore characteristics?...well u have them\\n\\n\r\nSound 9 : Easily its strong aspect, the intro and ending songs are both great the sound effects are amazing.Moreover Kaneki's character Hanae Natsuki sure made one of the best voice acting i have experienced definitely in my top 5. Kaneki's reaction's add a lot of drama that help the dark side of the anime\\n\\n\r\nCharacters 5 :Its not something new...yeah Tokyo Ghoul really struggled in terms of character development, even Touka who is MC we dont get to know much about her during the 12 episodes.So beyond Touka and Kaneki the other support characters, even though they got their respective time we hardly thought we know anything about them after the 12th episode, there were just ''filling'' the spots and that was bad\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyemnt 7: Adjectively i think people will enjoy this anime, it dielevers a dark enviroment with some flashy and bloody fights between ghouls and ghouls with humans, the story its not rocket science thats for sure, but ic ant be helped ..there are only 12 episodes,\\n\\n\r\nOverall 7: I Would like to pinpoint 2 things\\n\\n\r\nFirst Tokyo Ghoul dielevers exactly what it created for, a dark bloody enviroment , and it does it well, it is almost certain that anime that get hyped so much are doomed to fail most of the times*Aka dramatical murder'' but i think tokyo ghoul w as pretty solid, with its glitches of course\\n\\n\r\nSecondly with all the respect i see a very small number of reviewrs who vote music/art 9 and then they give it a 3 overall because it dissapointed them its not like the manga they dont even bother making an average rating, taking into account that people read us in order to start an anime, i beileve we ought to try and be as much adjective as we can\\n\r\nThank you in Advance\\n\r\nSubby",

            "content": "No, I haven't read the manga. As the other reviewers noted, Tokyo Ghoul is a dark fantasy set in Tokyo. Our hero, Kaneki Ken is an average, bookish fellow whose life takes a drastic turn after his first date with an attractive girl. Turns out the girl has an uncontrollable case of munchies. No, this is not a love story. Spoilers ahead. \r\nFor 11 episodes, Tokyo Ghoul is an anime that deserves praise. An anime that isn't afraid to delve into philosophy: What does it mean to be human? Should you be considered human if your biological default is to eat another human? Does denialof the self serve friendship? What does it mean to be selfish? When is it time to be selfish? Good stuff. One of the things that made this series so enjoyable for me is that it asked questions. \\n\\n\r\nAnimation 9/10, Sound 10/10\\n\\n\r\nThe visuals are well-done, even though certain scenes bordered on the meme territory (e.g. copious amounts of tears, extreme close ups of characters shouting and roaring in their emotional moments). The artsy and obviously half-hearted blood censorship (color inverts) made it more stimulating. The music and the sounds were decent.  \\n\\n\r\nStory 8/10, Character 7/10\\n\\n\r\nThe pacing is all right, striking a balance between moving the overall plot and providing the necessary back story. Granted, not all important characters were given the back story treatment. I don\u2019t get the complaints that the pacing sucked because it didn\u2019t match the manga.\\n\\n\r\nThe world building is decent. The series refrained from explaining everything, possibly because the manga has not provided the materials. That works for the story because it\u2019s unlikely to have Kaneki undergo a massive information dump on ghoul living. As far as the story is concerned, Kaneki is an average citizen, trying to live the life of a murder-free ghoul. He's not being schooled as a secret agent, so giving the audience a major intel on Tokyo ghouls and a rigorous course on ghoul mythology is a fat the series does not need.   \\n\\n\r\nFor the 12th episode, Tokyo Ghoul deserves to be panned. I'm aware that the manga is ongoing, that's why I can forgive some missteps, like the certain fight subplots in episode 12. On second thought, those missteps are rather unforgivable. I guess they didn\u2019t decide to wait for the manga for this cash grab. Instead of making a semi-satisfying conclusion to these encounters, the studio decided to leave it hanging.\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe character development is superb... for 11 episodes anyway. The biggest disappointment is that Kaneki went through the personality vortex and came back another person... almost like another character! I'm certain the manga has  a good excuse as to why the introspective Kaneki, who constantly negotiates with his inner psycho and determines that empathy should win every time, suddenly turned into a cold \"bad ass\" that served the revenge fulfillment of some audiences. Trauma, perhaps. This \"bad ass\" engaged in casual cruelty: torturing an already subjugated villain, oh just because hmm plot device. We\u2019re supposed to derive some emotional closure to this? Problem is, the audience is well-aware the character has been traumatized and is engaging in acts he would not normally do... and yet the studio decided to package this as some sort of triumphant ending.  \\n\\n\r\n*sigh* \\n\\n\r\nEleven out of 12 episodes are well done, so the series is worth a chance, even with the last episode taking a bit of dive.",

            "content": "I don't think it would be an exaggeration when I say Tokyo Ghoul is one of the more recently hyped anime series but I did not go in with any expectations, rather I went in with an open mind and zero knowledge of the story or characters. That being said, it probably would have been better if I had researched before watching and I will explain later.\r\nSTORY:\r\nThis starts off as a very well executed, extremely well paced story of transition, isolation and adaptation. It builds very well off of the character's plight and pathos, going from a well established life that include friendships and goalsinto an unknown life where the future seems vague and uncertain for our protagonist and even the supporting characters.\\n\\n\r\nUp until that point, which is only the first few episodes, I was honestly ready to give this a 9 or even a 10, the direction is excellent, the pacing is perfect and even the characters are well defined through actions more than through dialogue. This is very high quality stuff, but it seems that as soon as the setup is complete, the writers did not know what to do with the story because it collapses in on itself very quickly and we get a rehash of pretty much any modern vampire story. And make no mistake, this is a vampire story.\\n\\n\r\nBut I digress, the issue comes when after the first few episodes, the pacing completely falls flat, dragging for about half the series and then jumping into hyper drive in the last few episodes rather than gradually pacing the events as a good series would do. It culminates in one of the most anti climactic 'endings' I've seen for an anime series and I understand that there are more series after this one (Tokyo Ghoul root a follows I believe) but I am judging this one on its own merit rather than on the merit of the future episodes.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is incomplete, the characters begin as very relatable , understandable and even a bit mysterious but the series blows its load from being so excited that they become mockish cartoon cut-outs of what they started out as being. \\n\\n\r\nAs always, that is the best non-spoiler review I can give for the story.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nART:\\n\r\nThe art was serviceable. I found some of the establishing shots and a couple of the fight sequences to be absolutely beautiful, but for the most part the color palette is very drab and unfocused. I understand that the point was to take us from a bright cheerful world into a darker, unfocused world, I get it, I really do.... but in doing and focusing so intensely on setting the mood, they completely forget to draw us in through the artwork the way they did in the beginning of the series. \\n\\n\r\nAgain it's as if they had a fantastic idea for a series but once they finished the setup, they had no idea what to do or how to do it.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER:\\n\r\nAs stated earlier, I found the characters to be interesting, unique, mysterious and well defined... at first. But then their actions completely defy all logic. Characters that are established as being untrustworthy or antagonists to the main cast are suddenly taking actions that contradict their previous development. It's just very poorly written and the characters have no consistency whatsoever after their initial setup. Again they are done very well at first and then after the story collapses, it just becomes a bunch of nonsense.\\n\\n\r\nBut worst of all; \\n\r\nThere is absolutely no consistency with the internal logic of the character strength. One character can get stabbed a good 40 times through the series (You'll know what I mean when you see it) and they'll be fine... whereas other characters are cut once and they're down for the count. I would guess that it has to do with weak points such as a part of the body or head... or perhaps even a special weapon that works against the Ghouls, but this is never established at all. It just so happens that some characters can randomly take, nearly insurmountable levels of punishment, whereas other characters cannot.\\n\\n\r\nThere is absolutely no consistency. This completely made me lose interest in most of the characters because I realized that whether a character dies or not is entirely at the mercy of the writers; I know this is true for all series but at least other series establish some rules that the writers must follow, here they're just blatantly making it up as they go along. It's terribly written.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT:\\n\r\nI adored the first few episodes and if I had to review just those, I would not hesitate to give it a 10, but as the story, characters and even the art got worse as the series went along, I can only tell you that if you are like me and expect a good story to stay good, you will be disappointed. Your enjoyment will melt away with each episode.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL:\\n\r\nIt earns a lot of points in my book for the first episodes. After that it just isn't any good.  I would not recommend this, nor will I watch the next series. It lost its nerve and threw away the magnificent levels of quality it set out to achieve.",

            "content": "Most peple on the internet declared it to be the greatest anime of 2014. Beautiful fan art of it filled my feed. My friend literally begged me to watch it. And so, I watched the all twelve episodes of Tokyo Ghoul. \r\nStory\r\nYeah, well, you probably know the story by now.\r\nCharacters\r\nThe characters are pretty much standard fare anime characters. We have the whiny, powerful main character who does almost absolutely nothing during the entire show except for cry and wonder why he is so weak without bothering to try to make himself stronger. The only hero who bugged me even more than the brilliantly named 'KanekiKen-kun' was Yuuki from Mirai Nikki. If you can even call that guy a hero. But it hurts more in Tokyo Ghoul because Kaneki has so much potential, and can easily be one of the strongest Ghouls around, but decides to spend 95% of the anime wailing. The last ten minutes give him credit though. And he looks freaking awesome with that mask.\\n\r\nRize has far less screen time than most other characters, but is more important than most of them. It is because her organs are transplanted into Kaneki that he develops his ghoul powers, his kagemune, and becomes a one eyed ghoul. She appears time to time, usually seducing our main hero while trying to convince him to accept his ghoul powers and use them.\\n\r\nTouka is kind of a mix of two characters. On one count, she reminds me of Mikasa Ackerman of SHingeki no Kyojin because of her attitude and her raw power, besides her latent arrogance. I mean, the moment I saw her, I thought 'Mikasa'. There's one huge difference though. Touka is a tsundere, while Mikasa is a partial yandere. Not Yuno level, but she is obsessed with Eren.\\n\r\nThe second one, and I realized this immediately too, is her appearence resembles Mei Misaki from Another. They both have navy-blue hair that covers one of their eyes. I don't know, it just popped into my mind.\\n\r\nShe's probably the most interesting of all the characters anyhow.\\n\r\nWe then have a bunch of characters who, as usual, I didn't really care much for. There's the painfully and blatantly evil Mado (I think that's his name), the heroic Amos who has a couple of minutes wondering about the morality of what he's doing, the cooking guy who is basically the Orochimaru of this anime (pedophilic, continuously licking his lips). Not to mention that white haired kid who looks kinda like a girl, and a bunch of police guys. I mean, I don't even remember hearing their names. And there's Jason, a sadistic and overly-violent ghoul.\\n\r\nAnother character is Hide, who is basically Kaneki's best friend, but his importance basically diminished as the show went on.\\n\r\nUnfortunately, I didn't really like many of the characters of the show, and I kept feeling like I saw all of them somewhere else.\\n\\n\r\nPresentation\\n\\n\r\nOn the animation front, I have absolutely no problems. I don't think I've paused the video in order to absorb in the beauty of the animation this much for any other show. And this is remarkable, because Tokyo Ghoul entirely takes place in a mundane metropolitan background. They don't even get chances to render stunning vistas like Sword Art Online did, but it impressed me all the same. The sound didn't really stick out much, but the voice actors play their parts well and match the characters. The opening is something to be admired and matches ethereal vocals with beautiful imagery. The animation studio is the same one that took care of Bleach, so they're pretty experienced.\\n\r\nSomething I should mention about this show: it's very gory. I mean, not like Corpse Party gore. Or maybe it is. Unfortunately, the anime right now is only available in the censored version, which means your experience will freqeuntly be marred by unnatural black shadows running acorss someone's stomach. But when the uncensored version does come out, you're gonna see lots of graphic imagery. Ghouls eat humans after all, so don't be surprised if you see one bite off a chunk of meat.\\n\r\nAs for how the idea is presented...that's what I really wanted to talk about. Once again, Tokyo Ghoul feels like a collection of various ideas that I've seen in various other shows. For example, its moral ambiguity. Throughout the entire show, Tokyo Ghoul wants to make you wonder whether humans are right to kill ghouls as monsters or not. Many anime before this one have tried this idea, but the only other show that has it this fleshed out is Shiki, and I know most people won't agree with me, but I think Shiki did it better. Shiki was more of a mystery, and less intermittently splattered with blood. Because of this, it humanizes (is that the right word here, considering what I'm talking about?) both sides until you actually care for both races. On the other hand, Tokyo Ghoul's viewpoint is primarily from the Ghouls, with humans mostly being depicted as arrogant people who kill ghouls and look down upon them. Throughout the series, you'll be supporting the ghouls without a second thought for mankind. In fact, humans are made so easily hateable that you'll wish all of them were dismembered without a second thought. The only morally grey character is Amos, and he felt to perfect and heroic, and loaded with judgemental ideas to be likeable, so I wanted him to die too.\\n\r\nAnother thing is those eyes. Those eyes. Seen them somewhere? Maybe, maybe not. If you have, it just might be Shiki, where black eyes with red irises are used to distinguish the Shiki from humans. Sound familiar? In this anime, it's what is used to differentiate between ghouls and humans.\\n\r\nI can make a vague reference to Lucy's hands in Elfen Lied about Kaneki's kagemune, but that isn't really valid because Kaneki's power looks more like tentacles. Let's hope that doesn't go down the wrong road one day. Just kidding, Tokyo Ghoul is too good to go down the same road that Sword Art Onine went on.\\n\r\nThen, as you approach the final episodes of the show, we get an extended and mostly unnecessary torture scene that brought up memories of RIN: Daughters of Mnemosyne, whose first or second episode features a similarly sadistic antagonist and a similarly fast-regenerating protagonist. Of course, RIN was far more explicit and would probably have to be completely censored (for a good reason this time) but you know what I'm talking about.\\n\r\nThe show contains some shounen elements like Kaneki not wanting to hurt anyone, but that gets rectified by the end of the series.\\n\\n\r\nOverall\\n\\n\r\nTokyo Ghoul feels more like a prologue to something else far more interesting. While the animation was well taken care of, the idea of thrusting 60 chapters into 12 episode is not logically sound, and led to us losing most of the interesting details in the process. It also feels like there were too many arcs in such a short span, and seeing someone who was absolutely hated three episodes earlier helping our heroes is kind of jarring. Besides that, it also feels like an amalgamation of ideas from other anime piled into one. While most others may like the idea, I sat there and throughout the show  I thought 'Hey, nice idea. But it was better done in (insert anime name here)'. \\n\r\nOverall, watch it, because it's still pretty good despite its faults. Be prepared for a blood-fest, though. With a lot of black lines.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 7\\n\r\nArt: 8\\n\r\nSound: 8\\n\r\nCharacter: 6\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 7\\n\r\nOverall: 7\\n\\n\r\nNOTE: I'm enjoying the second season more, although the opening is now crap.",

            "content": "Tolyo Ghoul was recommended to me by a friend. He said this anime had blood, battles and an awesome main character. So after giving it a watch I can call it only one thing: Disappointing (I haven't read the  manga btw). \r\nTokyo Ghoul centres around a boy named Kaneki. Ghouls are monsters who look like humans and eat human flesh to survive. After an incident with a ghoul Kaneki undergoes an operation where his organs are replaced by ghoul organs. Now he is a half-ghoul and must eat human flesh in order to survive. He also meets ghouls who are living in secret andmakes some of them his friends.\\n\\n\r\nThe first two episodes and the opening sequence were awesome. They perfectly showed Kaneki's hunger and how he struggles with it. We see Kaneki trying to keep his humanity as his ghoul hunger seems to take over his mind. It also promises to delve into the subject of insanity and show us a psychological warfare between Kaneki's human and ghoul personalities. \\n\\n\r\nSadly, what follows are nothing that even come close to these topics. Instead, what we are given are filler episodes that mostly consists of Kaneki whining about himself. Kaneki's mental war between his two personalities are completely forgotten until the very last episode. And whatever happens in all the other episodes contribute almost nothing to the plot or Kaneki's development as a character. \\n\\n\r\nThis anime has a very large cast of characters. But each of them get very little screentime to make any kind of impact. On the ghoul side we have the Manager, Touka, Jason and some other characters I won't bother to mention. On the human side we have the ghoul investigators Mado and Amon, and some others who appear later in the series.\\n\\n\r\nMado was actually my favourite of the bunch. Maybe because he was just plain evil and badass, but also because he is a nice guy when it comes to work. All the other characters ( with the exception of Jason) can be summed up in one word: Hypocrites. Especially Amon, whose hypocrisy knows no bounds. Their actions made me want to scream at the screen because of how self-contradictory they were.\\n\\n\r\nThe animations and sounds were good, nothing too special. However, the opening and ending songs were some of the best I have seen in anime. The fights, especially the ones in the last episode were very good. It's a shame, because the censoring blacked out half the screen during the bloody parts. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, this could have been an excellent anime if it focused more on Kaneki's development in the middle episodes. I can only recommend watching the first and last two episodes since only these are the ones that are not fillers.\\n\\n\r\nNote: This anime ends with a cliffhanger good enough to make you want to watch the second season. But don't get your hopes high.",

Or it was for me.\r\nStory: 5/10\r\nI never fully understood the story of Tokyo Ghoul.  The idea of ghouls 'suddenly' taking over is very complex.  I must admit this has pretty good execution, but never really liked it.  But everybody wants to be a ghoul just to have a kick ass kagune, right?\r\nArt: 6/10\r\nThe art was pretty average for an anime, in my opinion.  My favorite thing was how all the characters had their own uniquething, like Kaneki's one eye, Juuzou's weird personality, Touka's confusing human life, etc.  But overall, I mainly enjoyed everybody's kagune.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound: 4/10\\n\r\nPretty self explanatory, the only good 'sound' in the anime is the OP and the ending.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 4/10\\n\r\nAs explained while while I was talking about art, the best part is everybody's personality and uniqueness.

It starts off slow and then progresses itself into a action packed adventure leading to gore and much more.\r\n The whole story was alright, it started out as a boy leading into a college and then left off as a \"Ghoul\" that found his power from a television show. It's a very bland story at the start because it starts out like every other anime, a character gets a power that he doesn't realize about and gets very scared about it, except this one is not really a power,it's more of a curse in this anime.\\n\\n\r\n The art style is very nice and smooth with a tint of darkness to get the audience frightened or curious. The sound is like every other anime that has action in it with some copyrighted sounds from different companies that I have heard before.\\n\\n\r\n The characters have no life to them except for a couple of the villains, leading my enjoyment to a 7 because I had no experience of life except for a statue in the characters.\\n\\n\r\n I feel that I might be over-pushing this and making this review harsh on the characters, but this is my opinion.\\n\\n\r\n Overall, I give the anime atleast an 8 because it's an anime that has a lot of action / gore, with some mystery in it that has some life in the show. I hope you liked reading my review, have a good day!\\n\\n\r\n# Second Review",

I'm fine with stabbing and some violence in an anime I watch but this one was very violent.  The level of gorey-ness, as one may put it, was too much for me, which is why I didn't give it a9 or 10.  \\n\\n\r\nSo if you dont mind the intense gore that this anime will bring, then go for it.

            "content": "Tokyo Ghoul, where humanity has a predator. It presents a great story of how a boys world is turned upside down and his attempt to adapt to his new life after being turned into a Ghoul himself. However, fans of the manga will see quite notable differences between the anime and the manga. Now don't get me wrong, this doesn't stem from the manga's story (Let's save the second season for another time) it's just different. A few scenes have changed, like Kaneki went straight home instead of meeting with Hide after leaving the hospital and how Kaneki's meeting with Ghoul Touka was under differentcircumstances as well as many other differences as well as some parts cut out.\\n\\n\r\nThe art was amazing and their Kagune's were very colourful for monsters who eat human flesh. It was animated pretty great as well, however I'd recommend watching it uncensored as there is gore which they decide to censor with covering the entire screen with black which ruins the art at some points.  I didn't pay attention to the soundtrack other than the opening theme so I can't really say much about it.\\n\\n\r\nPersonally I loved the characters. It made us care a lot more about ghoul's than the human characters. We watched Kaneki befriend Hinami, a child ghoul who wanted to live normally. We see how far Touka goes to blend in with humanity and we even start to like Nishiki despite the fact he was antagonistic in the first few episodes.\\n\\n\r\nTokyo Ghoul is a great anime for those who are looking for something a bit gritty and dark. 8/10\\n\\n",

            "content": "Tokyo Ghoul is probably the finest example of a show that fails to faithfully adapt its source material.\r\nBack in 2014 when I first viewed this show, I was immersed in the story that unfolded before my eyes. It never occured to me that Studio Pierrot had neglected the manga and what could have been a masterpiece ended up being an \"okay show\" at best.\r\nAs with any review, I try to limit it within 500 words. Short but sweet as per say.\r\nSOUND 7/10\r\nOpening was definitely one of the more memorable ones for the show. UNRAVEL was a song that summed up the show perfectly and reallyturned into a viral hit. I got nothing to complain about when it comes to the sub and dub, both were up to a solid standard and deserve praise. The OST is forgettable to say the least. Nothing really stood out or felt out of place either. \\n\\n\r\nART/ANIMATION 7/10\\n\\n\r\nStudio Pierrot have never been known for setting the bench mark in terms of animation. (AHEM Naruto & Bleach). I believe the show does a better job that the two I mentioned but it is still nothing spectular. It was consistent for the most part but nothing to write home about.\\n\\n\r\nI am gonna praise the art for adding to the show. Enviroments had a dark vibe which really added to the enviroments and made the ghouls kagunes really stand out in their battle sequences, especially Toukas. More so the openings choreography was spectacular.\\n\\n\r\nSTORY/CHARACTERS (4/10)\\n\\n\r\nRemember what I said about not adapting a quality manga correctly? Well this is where the studio messed up monumentally. The anime chops and skips important character development and leaves us baffled - thankfully not as much as the second season, but well we won't talk about that trainwreck. To this day I am still questioning why the show ended where it did, there was no closure and I cant really say that it was an effective cliff hanger either; It just left you thinking WTF!\\n\\n\r\nEven with this average adaption, the characters still shine - that should show you the quality of these written characters and what potential there was to build on them. Kaneki is someone you genuinely sympathise for, Touka is the big sister bad ass that you wish you had and Hide is that Loyal friend who seriously lacks screentime, and the rest of the supporting staff share the same fate as Hide, a lack of screen time. I guess this cannot be helped due the small amount of episodes given.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL (5/10)\\n\\n\r\nSome parting thoughts...\\n\\n\r\nTokyo Ghoul really is a story of what might have been, hopefully Madhouse pick it up and faithfully adapt this story. There is so much untapped potential in the show. Lets forget about Root A, that makes the first season of Tokyo Ghoul look like a literate godsend from the heavens.\\n",

            "content": "Note that this review covers both seasons.\r\nDuring the start of the 2014 summer season, Tokyo Ghoul was one of the most hyped shows. This really doesn\u2019t surprise me any as those first couple episodes were some of the most intense of any anime I\u2019ve ever seen. I admit, I was a little leery going into this, as I\u2019m not a fan of the horror genre, when it involves lots of violence and trying to scare me like that, so I was pleasantly surprised that instead it seemed to be a psychological horror, offering an incredibly powerful start. Of course, many shows don\u2019t live up tothe standard they set for themselves early on, and while I loved the start of Ghoul, I also loved the start of Black Bullet and Brynhlder in the Darkness if that tells you anything. But those aren\u2019t the show I\u2019m talking about today, instead, I present to you my review of both seasons of Tokyo Ghoul.\\n\\n\r\nStory\\n\\n\r\nTokyo Ghoul focuses on Kaneki, a young college student, which isn\u2019t a high school student, so that immediately earns the show some points from me. He seems to be somewhat normal, a bit shy, bit of a book worm, he likes a girl who also seems to be a bit of a book worm. So, the two of them go on a date, and then she precedes to try eating him.\\n\r\nOh yeah, did I mention that the world of Tokyo Ghoul is filled with Ghouls, creatures who look like normal humans, except they eat humans. And as luck would have it, Kaneki had a crush on a Ghoul who decides he would make a good snack. Of course, due to the magic of plot, he survives barely, she\u2019s dies, and to save Kaneki, the doctor takes some organs out of her and puts them in him, so he survives, but then becomes a half ghoul himself. Now if you can ignore the huge amounts of plot convenience there and things that aren\u2019t ever explained, you can then move onto the good parts of the story. \\n\r\nWe see Kaneki struggling with his new identity as a Ghoul. As I said before, Ghouls eat people, and while the instincts within him tell him that he needs to do so something that of course repulses him, and this is made worse by the fact that any other food tastes disgusting, except coffee because the plot says so. This battle within Kaneki is presently incredibly well at first, as he wants to survive, he wants to just continue his normal life as a human, but this soon proves difficult as he finds himself falling deeper into the world of the Ghouls. He finds shelter at a coffee shop run by some ghouls who have chosen to live as vegetarian, only eating the bodies of those already dead. \\n\r\nThere are other Ghouls and organizations of ghouls that end up becoming Kaneki\u2019s enemy, so he wants to become stronger, taking advantage of the incredible physical strength Ghouls have along with their glowing red thing that I can\u2019t remember the name of. It\u2019s at this point the show shifts from a physiological horror to more of an action shonen, which really was disappointing. They also introduce the CCG, a police/military force created to fight and counter the ghouls. What I like about them as that for the most part, neither the ghouls nor the CCG are pure good or evil. Amon is the main focus from this group, and I really like his character, and the battle between him and Kaneki about two thirds the way through the first season is one of the best moments in the show. Of course, when it comes to intense scenes, I have to mention episode 12. It presents the torture Kaneki goes through, getting into his mind and showing who he is and who he wants to be, all leading to one of the most satisfying battles I have ever seen.\\n\r\nUnfortunately, Ghoul wasn\u2019t able to keep up its intensity throughout the show. It was very rushed at times, and this really did hurt how engaged I was able to be throughout it. It\u2019s second season Root A then completely ignored everything that made the first season good, focusing on way too many things at once to tell a good story. While many of these side plots could have been interesting if they were explored more, it was done in a way that none of it was engaging, and left me bored most of the time. The battles became lame, making the shaky build up to them just completely fall apart. The slice of life parts just seem to get in the way of what could be an interesting action series. There were a couple moments where the show seemed to remember it\u2019s Psychological horror roots, but these were too few and far between to make up for these problems.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters\\n\\n\r\nThe characters don\u2019t offer anything other than a couple. Once Kaneki gets over the panic at being a ghoul, he\u2019s mostly an observer, bounced around the world of the ghouls to show the viewer what it\u2019s like. While I do like his character, especially once we see his backstory and his transformation, after this transformation, he\u2019s just there. He\u2019s the main character, but in many ways becomes detached from the story.\\n\r\nThe characters in the CCG I found a lot more interesting. Amon is my favorite from the show, a noble hardworking person who wants to fight the ghouls to protect humanity. Meeting Kaneki though seemed to make him question his black and white view of the world. Unfortunately the show, instead it seemed to move away from this plot point until the end. There are several other interesting characters in the CCG, but the only one I can talk about without spoiling much is Juuzou, the generic crazy likes to kill things type of character, and I liked him, he was fun to watch, and once we see where he came from, his twisted worldview really does make a lot of sense. He actually gets a bit of development too in the end, making him a great supporting character. There\u2019s also Mado, who is one of the major villains for the first season, but it\u2019s not until the second season that he really gets fleshed out, mainly from the perspective of his daughter, which was an interesting twist, but it felt like this was only done this way due to door planning.\\n\r\nAll the other side characters were disappointments. Touka ended up just being someone who seemed love struck for Kaneki, Himari who I liked at first, just felt like an adopted little sister to Kaneki, Hide was just Kaneki\u2019s old best friend. When Kaneki wasn\u2019t around these characters, they just feel like they\u2019re going in circles, not trying to do anything about what\u2019s going on in the world. Hide could kind of be considered an exception, though he was so far removed from season 1 that his involvement in season 2 feels kind of out of place, even if he did have a role to play in the end.\\n\r\nCharacter wise, Ghoul definitely tried doing too much. It attempted to have a large diverse cast, but instead what we got was a whole bunch of flat characters that got little to no development, and when the time was spent more on these side characters as the show went on, it just fed into the other problems the show had.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation + Sound\\n\\n\r\nThe show\u2019s animation is probably the most noticeable difference between the two seasons. The first season was as a whole pretty good, aside from the censorship, which I admit, didn\u2019t bother me that much. The second season everything went downhill. Even the battle scenes which should be the best animation scenes were just bland, had no impact at all. I could get into this more, but I\u2019ll just tell you to go watch Mr. Reckless Penguin\u2019s videos on it, he\u2019s far better at picking apart animation than I am. \\n\r\nThis really is disappointing, as the first season really looked good when it needed to, so it just doesn\u2019t make any sense for it to be so bad in the second. It\u2019s not like this is a small studio that doesn\u2019t have any money; this is Studio Periot, the same one who does Naruto, and they\u2019ve certainly been milking that one for all it\u2019s worth.\\n\r\nThe music for the show is also something that changed quite a bit between the two seasons, except this was one aspect of the show that improved. The first season\u2019s music was largely unremarkable, able to enhance the show when needed, but nothing overly memorable. However, the second season had a couple insert songs which really did a wonderful job at conveying the tension and the uncertainty the characters felt, and these songs were so great they easily stand on their own, especially Glassy Sky and On My Own. I also like them because they\u2019re in English, so I know what they\u2019re saying without the need of subtitles or fandubs. \\n\r\nThe first opening for Ghoul is one of the best I\u2019ve seen. Of course, this is contrasted by the second season\u2019s opening, which is one of my least favorite openings ever. Just having a picture of the main character with pretty colors changing behind him to a generic song is not how you get someone excited for the show! Well, the song was kind of fitting, for the show, and it highlighted an event at the end of the show, but still, it was very underwhelming. Of course, considering how much of it was boring the second season was to begin with\u2026maybe it was fitting after all.\\n\r\nI\u2019ve only seen one episode of the Root A dub, so my judgment of that is a bit limited. Overall I\u2019d say it was okay, the only stand out part being Todd Habberkorn as Ayato. The rest were somewhere along decent to meh. If you really prefer dubs, I\u2019d like to say you\u2019d be okay with it, but considering they haven\u2019t dubbed the first season yet, they\u2019re not really an option unless you want to jump in half way through the show, which I wouldn\u2019t recommend.\\n\\n\r\nFinal Thoughts\\n\\n\r\nThe show is probably the best example of wasted potential I have ever seen. It had a great start, a couple plot holes maybe, but it had the perfect setup for a great physiological horror. If they could have kept that up, added in some action from time to time, fleshed out some broken characters and really explore the themes of being a monster and hating what you are it would have been something awesome.\\n\r\nInstead we got\u2026I don\u2019t even have words for it. Actually, I have lots of words, you\u2019ve been listening to them for a while. So let\u2019s switch to numbers instead, since I like numbers.\\n\\n\r\nScoring\\n\\n\r\nStory: 3/10\\n\r\nCharacters: 3.6/10\\n\r\nAnimation: 5.4/10\\n\r\nSound: 8.1\\n\r\nTotal: 4.12/10 (Note categories are not weighed equally)\\n\r\nFinal Vote: 4/10\\n\r\nRecommendations\\n\r\nFate Zero: A dark modern day fantasy with epic battles and some interesting thoughts on being a hero\\n\r\nMononoke: The only other horror anime I\u2019ve seen.

            "content": "\"Tokyo Ghoul\"; an anime that tends to devour the heart whole -- literally.\r\nBeing a dark/horror fantasy, this anime does a wondering job of capturing its audience. There are bloody fight scenes, and wonderful animation to go along with them.\r\nHanae, Natsuki, Kaneki's voice actor, is a surprisingly rare voice in the anime industry, but no less talented. He's probably most known for his role of Sakishima, Hikari (the main character in Nagi no Asukara). Out of the few roles he's had, he has voiced many characters, each of their voices differing. Hanae can be anyone from the unemotional robot in Kaizuka, Inaho (Aldnoah.Zero) to the wimpymess that is Kaneki, Ken. He plays Kaneki to a 'T', and makes our fragile character loveable. Other mentionable people are Amamiya, Sora (Kirishima, Touka) and Hanazawa, Kana (Kamishiro, Rize). Amamiya is another rare gem to have. She is also the voice of Akame (Akame ga Kill) and Fujimiya, Kaori (Issuukan Friends). Her heartfelt and tough portrayal of Touka, a strong but insecure ghoul, is beautiful. Amamiya also plays the role perfectly. Hanazawa also did a great job, but it's a bit odd to have the sweet Moriyama, Shiemi (Blue Exorcist) become this cold blooded binge eater of a ghoul. However, when Hanazawa goes dark, the voice suddenly fits Rize's character and sends chills down the back.\\n\\n\r\nFor such a hyped anime, \"Tokyo Ghoul\" certainly lived up to its expectations. The animation quality knocked out all other animes out of the park. It was unfortunate some of the more brutal scenes had to be censored. Moving onto the characters, they were diverse and believable. Kaneki was wimpy at points, but was not unbearable. Other characters like Rize and Touka were the perfect addition to the series. They held some strong female roles! There are many other characters, but watching the series would be better than reading about them from this review. But even the story was good! Ghouls were carefully thought out with how strong they could be, and the type of powers they held. It was even shown than humans could stand a fighting chance. Humans are no longer the weak and defenseless creature they're normally portrayed to be. The only problem with \"Tokyo Ghoul\" was its pacing. To my chagrin, the anime decided to skip important arcs located in the manga. This greatly disturbed the pace and made the show a little more than confusing at times. This anime really should have been two, twenty-five episodes seasons.\\n\\n\r\n\"Tokyo Ghoul\" is not an anime for the faint of heart. It is bloody, and it is violent. But those who have a strong mind and a love for fantasy will love it. I have mixed feelings about \"Tokyo Ghoul\", but I'm going to go ahead and say it will be one I never will forget. It has truly captivated my heart.\\n\r\n-\\n\r\nStory - 8\\n\r\nThe story is very well scripted. It just flows like an anime should. However, the pacing is a little off and it's concerning that the anime skips arcs from the manga.\\n\\n\r\nArt - 10\\n\r\nThe artwork was actually one of the best this season. The character were detailed, and very pretty. The fighting scenes were excitingly horrific, in that they had blood, gore, and all things a good fight scene could have. Too bad stuff like decapitated bodies were censored.\\n\\n\r\nMusic - 10\\n\r\nFrom the OP to the ED, the music is just a work of brilliance. I practically have the song \"Unravel\" memorized, it was so good. And even though the ending song can't even compare to the opening song, that was also good in its own respect. But the OSTs are what really made the anime. The music fit so much that I can't even remember what kind of songs were playing. Very well done.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 8\\n\r\nThere was lots and lots of character development, as well as character reinforcement. I do wish that I had gotten to see more of side characters like Mr. Uta (Mask Guy) and Hide (Kaneki's best friend).\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 10\\n\r\nEvery week, I would eagerly anticipate the next episode. \"Tokyo Ghoul\" never let me down -- not even once.\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 9.2\\n\r\nThis anime was a great addition to my 2014 Summer lineup. It reminds me a lot of a story I am working on, but holds a certain charm that keeps me hooked. This anime has everything a dark fantasy horror needs.",

IT MADE ME WANT TO COVER MY EARS AND SCREAM. this honestly was not an overexaggeration like, the opening sucks so so so bad please i know theres a second season out and i really hope its opening doesnt suck as bad as this one. im the kind of person that leaves the page the second the ending starts unless its really good so ill be completely honest and say ive never heard more than 10 seconds of the ending but i didnt like those 10 seconds either. \\n\r\nthe voice acting was okay i guess, though it could be better. i didnt focus too much on that when giving it my score, so read another review on that. \\n\\n\r\ncharacters: 8/10 \\n\\n\r\ncharacters were one of the mangas strong suits, so thats why im giving it such a high score even though theres like, zero character development in the anime. kaneki seems like a whiny bitch in the anime and he kind of is for the first bit of the manga but after a while he comes to realize that things arent in his favor and that he is in fact a ghoul. he puts his human life behind him and focuses more on surviving even when things are looking down on him and [spoilers] he gets tortured in some weirdo's house for a while before Finally kicking his ass and becoming this cool white haired guy. [end spoilers] he is able to fight for himself and isnt ashamed of his ghoul side anymore. the anime took away all of his good moments because studio pierrot wanted to get to the Cool White Haired Guy asap so they could rake in the cash. \\n\\n\r\nenjoyment: 5/10 \\n\\n\r\ni watched the anime first, then while waiting for the next episode read the entire manga. after seeing how it all actually went down, it was really really hard to watch this anime and see such a good manga get butchered like that. not to mention i watched this only for the gore and the gore was overcensored to the point where you could barely see what was going on. \\n\\n\r\nso my advice is to watch this anime only if you dont love yourself/havent read the manga first. then once youre done the anime read the manga so that you too can realize how bad this is and regret wasting like 6 hours of your life watching it. \\n",

            "content": "When I watched Tokyo Ghoul I felt mixed emotions. Although the great ambiance  and what in the first look seems like well developed characters, the history is not well developed, and some characters simple became two-dimensional. Especially in the final half, the choices and the focus seems to be in the wrong scenes and characters, and it is made poorly.\r\nI will try to judge it based  in the anime only, since I didn't had read the manga yet when I watched it. But I still have to do some reservations specially regarding the character development and changes in history.\r\nThe first half episodes arequite enjoyable, I would even said that it is better than the manga begging. The rivalry between Rise and Jason, that help to the creation of the final climax, and the much darker and dreadful ambiance than what manga presents. I got truly worried about Kaneki issues.\\n\\n\r\nThe second half is where everything goes downhill. A lot of information bad presented or not presented at all, that always keep you in the dark. Scenes with no context, crucial scenes to the character's development excluded. The changes in the order of events don't help either, they instead made appear that Kaneki strength development is equal to none.\\n\\n\r\nI think my biggest issue is how some characters and parts of the history are so radically different from manga. There is no \"Yamoru\" in the anime only a psycho Jason 24/7. Aogiri? These guys are to cool to you to know anything about them, instead we will just show these dialogues that don't offer no context at all. Good fights? Sorry we only have 12 episodes and we need the extra time to the no-context scenes.\\n\\n\r\nAlthough the flaws, especially in the second half, I think that Tokyo Ghoul is quite enjoyable. The manga is far superior, but if you don't wanna read it you will be fine with the anime (as long as as you don't watch season 2).",

            "content": "Tokyo ghoul a 12 episode anime adaptation of the popular manga based around conflict in a world of ghouls and humans.  After reading the manga, it is hard to compare it to the anime as it is poorly executed with the shows character development and story. The show lacks detail which leaves many viewers confused and less sympathetic from what the producers were trying to achieve. This is done for the reasons of forcing 60 chapters into 12 episodes which is like driving on the freeway blindfolded.\r\nThe psychological aspect and dark atmosphere is what got me hooked as I was intrigued of seeing Kanekibattle and struggle of living a half human/half ghoul. The cast size and overall pacing within the 12 episodes is its downfall. It was hard to have any sort of connection or emotion towards any of the characters. The animation was fun to watch with beautifully designed quinque and kagune (weapons). The opening and ending were great and fun to listen to as it described the tone perfectly.\\n\\n\r\nOverall I did enjoy Tokyo ghoul as I love psychological \u2013 gore shows. Although I recommend reading the manga instead as it is so addicting to read.\\n",

            "content": "A friend of mine had suggested we watch this back in October 2014 and I read an article about it in Otaku USA. Going in I was kind of so-so about it. The premise seemed interesting but I had heard it was pretty gory (which I'm not generally fond of).\r\nThe first 3-ish episodes were great and I couldn't really understand why it received an MA rating (Hulu). The next 6 episodes were okay. The last 3 I'm not sure what to say. A lot happened, there seemed to be a lot of unnecessary violence. There were a lot of unexplained happenings and then it endedon a major cliff hanger.\\n\\n\r\nI like the premise even if aspects of it are clich\u00e9 at this point.\\n\r\nOrdinary guy leading boring life has an extraordinary life-altering experience that suddenly makes him interesting and important.\\n\r\nHe must then learn how to live and survive in this new life.\\n\\n\\n\r\n---More In-Depth Summary (Spoilers)---\\n\\n\r\nIn this case Ken goes on a date with a red-head book worm and then agrees to walk her home. Turns out she's a ghoul and wants to slowly tear him apart and eat his flesh. Through a freak \"accident\" some steel beams fall on the both of them, killing her. Some unknown doctor harvests her organs and uses them to replace Ken's destroyed organs.\\n\\n\r\nHe wakes up in the hospital and is \"fine\" with the exception of all food making him ill. The medical staff doesn't seem at all concerned about this though and discharges him to return home. Once there he has mysterious urges, a mental battle with the girl that tried to kill him, realizes that all food now makes him sick, learns that one of his eyes now turns black and red, and comes to the conclusion that he's a ghoul.\\n\\n\r\nHe starves himself for awhile then wanders around town, almost kills some people, then comes across another ghoul eating a person in an alley. Another ghoul shows up claims the territory is his, then another ghoul shows up and says it's her territory. There's some fighting. She tries to force Ken to eat from the corpse which he refuses. She then brings him to the coffee shop where she lives which turns out to be a hide-out for \"peace-loving\" ghouls. Ken learns that the only things Ghouls can eat are flesh and coffee. He's then extended a job to work at the shop. He learns that the food these ghouls eat comes only from people who commit suicide. He's also taken to a seedy part of town to have a mask made to conceal his identity from ghoul hunters (CCG).\\n\\n\r\nThis whole section was really interesting and I wish they would have spent more time on it.\\n\r\nThe human ghoul internal identity crisis that Ken goes through.\\n\r\nThe ghouls destroy human families and the CCG destroy Ghoul families. \\n\r\nThat there are humans and ghouls that want to coexist and there are humans and ghouls that want to kill each other.\\n\r\nAll of this was really interesting.\\n\\n\r\nThe next section wasn't as interesting. Some more characters join their party. We learn more about ghouls. Multiple characters try to kill Ken.\\n\\n\r\nThen in the last three episodes all hell breaks loose and the MA rating becomes completely justifiable. \\n\\n\r\nI'm intrigued enough that I'll probably watch the second season but I feel like this series could have been so much better than it was.",

            "content": "Tokyo Ghoul is an overrated anime, alot of people say that Tokyo Ghoul is the best anime but I really think the anime is regular. The characters of the anime are boring, the best characters for sure is Nishiki, Juuzou and Mado. (Even if I don't like the last one that much.), the plot has a really interesting premise but it didn't turn out good. Kaneki is really boring, (SPOILER) He got crazy in in the end and he got way cooler but he didn't have much TIME on the screen, (Remembering that this review is about season 1.) Touka is extremely arrogant. But Ilike that personality in other characters like Vegeta and Alucard, it just don't fit with her. She keep annoying the protagonist because he's \"coward\" but when the characters start to fight she just wins because of Kaneki's support. The rest of the characters consist in a good officer that hates the enemy 'cause of the loss of his friend, a homo that only thinks in cannibalism (or not), a character that dies in the first episode and just exists to provoce Kaneki and a villan that suffered tortures and started torturing people because of that. (Ironic, huh?), I'm not going to comment about these characters because I think they were a bit \"forced\" (I don't think Rize is \"forced\" and Jason participating cool but I think I don't have many things to comment on them.), anyway, that's my opinion of the regular Tokyo Ghoul, I also would like to say that the anime just have one episode that is good because of a awesome moment and a good fight, the last one.\\n\\n\r\nTokyo Ghoul \u00e9 um anime superestimado, muitos dizem ser o melhor anime mas sinceramente achei bem mais ou menos o anime, os personagens desse anime ou s\u00e3o sem gra\u00e7a ou s\u00e3o sem destaque, os melhores personagens desse anime com certeza s\u00e3o Nishiki, Juuzou e Mado (apesar de eu n\u00e3o gostar deste ultimo), o enredo tem uma premissa interessante mas n\u00e3o se desenvolveu bem, Kaneki \u00e9 muito chato, (SPOILER) ele enlouqueceu no final e ficou bem mais legal mas n\u00e3o teve muito tempo na tela (lembrando que essa \u00e9 uma review sobre a 1 temporada). Touka \u00e9 extremamente durona e arrogante, apesar de ficar legal essa personalidade em alguns personagens como Vegeta e Alucard, n\u00e3o ficou bem na personagem, ela sempre pega no p\u00e9 do protagonista por ele ser covarde mas na hora da porrada ela vai pra cima do inimigo e s\u00f3 ganha por suporte do Kaneki. O resto dos personagens consistem em um policial mocinho que odeia o inimigo por ter perdido um amigo pra ele, uma bicha que s\u00f3 pensa em canibalismo (ou n\u00e3o), uma personagem que morre no 1 ep e s\u00f3 serve pra provocar o Kaneki e um vil\u00e3o que sofreu torturas e come\u00e7ou a torturar os outros por causa disso (ironico n\u00e3o?), n\u00e3o comentarei muito desses personagens por achar eles meio for\u00e7ado (n\u00e3o acho a Rize for\u00e7ada e a participa\u00e7\u00e3o do Jason legal mas acho q n\u00e3o tem muito oq comentar sobre os 2), enfim essa \u00e9 minha opini\u00e3o sobre o mediano Tokyo Ghoul, tambem gostari de acrescentar que o anime s\u00f3 tem 1 ep que se destaca por ser um momento daora e uma boa luta, o ultimo.",

Those will be separated as \"As an adaptation\" as i will be reviewing it as a direct adaptation from the manga, and \"As an original\" just liked said, to me, this was more of an original series rather than a direct adaptation, so i will review it considering this is an original series.\r\nSTORY: 4\r\n-Part 1 - As an adaptation (3/10)\r\nOf all the things they could've done, they decided to not follow the story. While at the beginning it looked like a pretty good adaptation,they lost that later in the series. To my eyes, it's just an original series made inspired by the manga. \\n\r\n-Part 2 - As an original series (5/10)\\n\r\nThe show is ok, obviously it needs a lot of work. It is fast paced for those who don't like that much dialogue, while at some points it's quite confusing since they don't focuse on telling us the meaning of things, you get the hang of it after some time.\\n\\n\r\nART: 4\\n\r\nThe art is nothing from the other world, it's good most of the time, but sometimes it just stops being smooth and that's where the problems come. Most fights were not properly focused, so you could barely understand what was going on. The point i probably liked were how they did the Kagunes, they are straight up beautiful. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 8\\n\r\nThe music and voice acting in this is such a nice thing that a lot of shows are missing. The Opening is really nice and the Ending is just fabulous. The insert music was also really pleasing and it was put in the right places.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 3\\n\r\nWe get to know a lot of characters, like, a lot. But, unfortunately, none of them has proper development. To me, the 2 that got proper and nice development were Kaneki and Rize, all of the others were almost just like extras to actually make a story, they didn't really contribute in anything.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 6\\n\r\nPart 1 - As an adaptation (5/10)\\n\r\nI liked this show, but at the same times i hated it, i read the manga before hand and they didn't follow everything from it, at the beginning it was going good but instantly went down and they clearly started a new story, or better said, they just wanted the fast way out. They did things way too quickly.\\n\r\n-Part 2 - As an original series (7/10)\\n\r\nThe show is nice, but there are some things that could've been explained before anything, the way they ended it was also weird and bad, it just felt empty and dull after that fight, to just end it with kaneki eating? Ok.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 5\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "When I started watching Tokyo Ghoul, I was there for three reasons. One, the setting being about \"ghouls\",so I knew this would be the mysterious action filled type, and I was in. Two, I wanted to see what Kaneki's transformation would be like. Three, I wanted to know what was 1000-7. Like all others, I saw that show would be a promising genre and I was hyped. But in the end, the show just went so offtrack that I rated it a 6.\r\nWhy?\r\nSimple. Because it lacked APPEAL.\r\nA show needs good appeal in order to make the viewers hang on for the ride. Note that whilepopularity fetches you the first episode viewers, the appeal of the show's episodes make up tons of enjoyment value to keep them hooked.  Tokyo ghoul lost that pretty much going in. The show strayed away from its protagonist Kaneki, who was the prime reason of watching the show. You put us through 12 episodes before showing his transformation? Very very anticlimactic.  To add to the disappointment was the dramedy (A parody of drama and tragedy) which seriously lost its touch because of how badly the characters were handled. There were so many characters to keep count that we didn't mostly care about. This further made sure we lost Kaneki's arc. Soon, what was supposed to be Kaneki's search for existence turned out into a wine-tasting contest.\\n\\n\r\nBut the most notorious of them all, which made sure the show was unexciting, was the fact that we are supposed to be rooting for Ghouls. Murderers, serial killers who eat human flesh. Tell me how I am supposed to root for those people? Granted, they did not become Ghouls of their own choice, but they try to justify their existence by Darwinism. Pathetic. They say that they are supposed to control the population of humans as part of a food chain. IN JAPAN FOR GOD'S SAKES. Do you know how crazy you sound? And they keep using these excuses to justify their existence. Like it is all right for them to kill humans, because humans kill chickens. That is seriously wrong, and misused.\\n\\n\r\n First, not all humans kill chickens. There are vegetarians too. Second, Killing is WRONG. EVEN CHICKENS HAVE BLUE CROSS. Doesn't mean that you can kill humans inordinately. Third, you using Darwinism is same as the excuse Hitler used for killing Jews. I don't have complains with Ghouls killing humans, but the justification they are using makes me sick. You are all criminals by nature. How can we root for you?\\n\\n\r\nAdd that to the fact that Touka kills two innocent policemen in cold blood. Just doesn't help matters.\\n\\n\r\nAnyways, this anime lacks much in plot and characterization, so I suggest you read the manga, which is better than watching 4 seasons of Tokyo going nowhere.",

Now I had already been spoiled of what happened in the mango before watching the series and when I started watching Tokyo Ghoul I was in a very emotionally unstable and depressive state physically, mentally and emotionally which made Tokyo Ghoul one of the best things to possibly watch at the time. The edgy and dark tone of the series felt somewhat relatable to me at the time and I felt alone. Also felt relatable whenever Kaneki andTouka were together and there was some cute moment or whatever. I was in a very emotionally frustrated position in terms of relationships and it just hit me in the feels I guess. Either way ill probs re watch this at some point after I finished watching Gotham, The 100, Shameless, Orange is the New Black, Vikings, and pretty much every other series im trying to get through. I must say Tokyo Ghoul is probs made in perfection and was perfect for what I needed at the time. I think you will enjoy this series especially if you are edgy or something.",

Then after I finished it I was just in complete disbelief of what I say so I decided to readthe whole manga first manga and I really came to really enjoy it all over again and get the full story. \\n\\n\r\nTo me this show set a whole new scale for the horror and psychological genres cause throughout all of the other horror psychological shows I have seen none of the shows came close to my joy from watching and reading Tokyo Ghoul. (I still enjoyed the other horror and psychological shows FYI ;p) The story of this really had a feeling of just amazement and none of the other shows somewhat like this didn't come close to comparing. The art was really good and it felt good seeing how much work was put into this. (including the manga) The characters were well done and I thought that a lot of characters can go through many personality changes, but not as many as Kaneki has and I really enjoyed seeing him go through so many changes and feelings as well as hair color changes. It was a really well done character made to suit this type of show. Sui Ishida really did a amazing job and Studio Pierrot did a fantastic job animating this. \\n\\n\r\nI really look forward to Ishida's new work and I hope Pierrot and animate it again.\\n\\n",

Our main character fuck wit crybaby protagonist number 287 is a normal human who's turned into a half vampire/zombie/ghoul after running into the undercover mental retard known as Rize.  \r\nThe story is pretty much parasite to a degree. it revolves around a main character coming to terms with the fact that they're half monster now. Buteven if you like stories like parasite I'd recommend watching parasite again rather than this. \\n\\n\r\nBecause unlike parasite tokyo ghoul is just pure edge...It uses shock-value to make you give a shit about its unlikable characters and that would be fine if any of them were interesting which they aren't aside from juuzou.\\n\\n\r\nI'm just going to sum this up now because this review is getting too long.\\n\\n\r\nEvery conflict in the show feels forced and dull.\\n\\n\r\nThe support characters often fall flat on their face and the ones that don't never get enough screen time.\\n\\n\r\nThe episodes have a tendency to drag on with nothing of note happening.\\n\\n\r\nThe fights are uninspired attack spam festivals that fail to draw the eye.\\n\\n\r\nAnd most of all the gore is pretty tame....",

            "content": "Tokyo ghoul it's a show that talks about \"Ghouls\" some sort of half humans, they look like us except in one thing: They have to eat humans to survive. \r\nYeah .. it sounds like a horrible show with tones of blood and disgusting parts (like they eating the humans) .. but no it is not such thing. \r\nWhen we look at the synopsis, we may think that it would be a terrible anime in the way that it would have to many blood coming out of dead bodies while watching the ghouls eating them with pleasure .. a really sick plot but i repeat, ITISN\u00b4T. \\n\\n\r\nThey censured the bloodie parts and when it comes to eat the humans, they do not show that part (except in the first episodes) then we no longer see it or it's censured. So don\u00b4t worry if you think that this show would scare you out becuase of this \"sick\" theme. \\n\\n\\n\r\nTalking about the art, it's a normal art. Substancial design, i didn\u00b4t thinked it was to great, but the characters are solid, well made and with bright colors wich make them look nice.  \\n\\n\r\nThe story, well we definitely have a nice plot with the \"Ghouls\" and related things to him (like their kagunes. Kagunes are some sort of weapon that changes in every Ghoul, and it allows them to fight against each others). But, just that is different .. all the rest is just nice. We have the usual badass girl (Touka), the anoying protagonist that fights for peace (it seems like a character from a shonen) and the others are pretty much the same as the others secondary characters look like in other animes. Although, due to the fact that they are ghouls, we find out that they have a nice history behind them, wich creates a good character developement even though it is small, it's enough to make us care, even for a litle bit, in the drama. \\n\\n\r\nThe sound .. i found it OK .. it is quite enjoyable, fits with the plot but nothing else besides that.  \\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall, it is an ejoyable anime, the second season is now being released so chek this one and if you liked the plot, you will have the pleasure to follow up this show. According to the first episode of the second season, we will have a better show then Tokyo Ghoul first season xD. \\n\\n\\n\r\nFeedback from you would be nice .. i've been working on my reviews, and i suppose that i'm getting better, but nothing is better then the feedback from the readers. I always try to be as objective as i can so that you can see from my reviews, if the anime worth or not. But i'm having the feeling that i'm not beeing able to it correctly so give me some feedback if you have something to say.  \\n\\n",

            "content": "If you're a fan of anime chances are you've heard of the recent series Tokyo Ghoul. This Dark Fantasy/action series has gotten a lot of hype lately, perhaps overhype to be more accurate. While I did enjoy watching the short series, there were many flaws which stopped the anime from reaching its full potential. Now i'm going to say this first, I have not yet read the manga..i'm simply basing the review on the anime itself without comparing the show to its manga counterpart. \r\nNow as I said before it's not a stretch to say Tokyo Ghoul is overhyped. Why? I don't know. Nevertheless thereis a lot of potential for the series to perhaps get better when the second season comes around in January. These 12 episodes though suffer from feeling a bit rushed and cramped together, like the studio felt they needed to squeeze as much as they can into these 12 episodes and that certainly hurt the show. Why? Lack of character development, and scenarios and conflicts which are solved fairly quickly before the show rushes on to the next thing. This does eliminate boring filler-like episodes, but I wish I saw characters like Touka, developed more because she was a badass for the time she was given. Another thing the show lacks is a proper goal or \"thing\" the characters are working towards. For example trying to take down a villain or obtain an objective or like I said a goal. There are a number of antagonists but none of them really feel like a main villain, they feel more like just an enemy for Kaneki and Anteiku to deal with for a few episodes. That said, one of the antagonists in particular actually played a good bad guy; Jason. Towards the finale, you really start to see how he gets into Kaneki's head and make him crack. The amount of emotion that the show hits you with in the last episode was actually incredible. It really makes you feel like you're going through what Kaneki is and that's a quality I wish I saw more. Aside from all that, Tokyo Ghoul lacks a good cast of supporting characters as well. I can't help but to think that this is partially because they crammed 60 chapters into 12 episodes. Hide, Kaneki's best friend is seen a good amount in the beginning but then feels pushed aside and not really relevant towards the end. Some of the other Ghouls who act as supporting characters weren't as well fleshed out as they could've been which is disappointing as well. Nishiki was in my opinion a very interesting character and he was explored in the beginning but after that we don't see too much of him either. At times, the show try's to make you feel bad about a situation a character is going through and to be honest it just didn't work. The series tries to develop Amon as a connectable character but I didn't see a reason to feel bad for him all to much.\\n\\n\r\nThat all being said, there is a number of things Tokyo Ghoul does very well. The intro song-unravel by Tk is a beautiful song that fits the tone of the show perfectly. In all honesty It's definitely contender for best anime intro of the season so far. The soundtrack itself doesn't stand out as being anything special though, however it still blends well with the specific sequences and seems to add good rhythm to whatever was going on in the episode. Speaking of episodes, episodes 11, and 12 are by far the stand out of the series. The whole raid scene in episode 11 was fantastic and got my hyped. Due to shortness of time though, there's only so much of it we could see and I admit I wish I saw more. The emotional roller coaster of episode 12 was done very well too, especially the ending fight which was short lived but mildly epic. The animation goes without saying as being gorgeous. Character designs aren't anything ambitious but they did what they needed too. The environments though were the standout of the animation. The city of Tokyo was so detailed and lush looking the CGI was implemented perfectly. Action scenes had good flow and designs of the ghoul weapons- Kagune, looked pretty interesting though they're not completely different from something I haven't already seen. Another thing the show has going for it is the main character, Kaneki. He grew as a character and was developed the best. The show does a good job at putting everything in his perspective and not straying away from that, you see him grow and change especially at the end. The characters aren't interesting enough to drive the story completely but the story itself is for the most part interesting. I can say there was never a time the show bored me. Tokyo Ghoul also does a good job at putting you in this grey area of right and wrong. It's obviously wrong to kill people but is it so wrong for the ghouls to just be alive? Those are some themes sprinkled throughout the series.\\n\\n\r\nOverall I enjoyed the series.. sticking to my guns though, the show has many flaws the next season hopefully fixes. I hope they're fixed anyway because I enjoyed the show and want it to get better next time around. Tokyo Ghoul is nothing great but it's certainly worth the watch. If you like Dark Fantasy or action i'd say that you'll enjoy it. If you're looking for something strictly horror though, you're not gonna find much here. Anyway, apologies for the lengthly review but please give it a thumbs up if you agreed !",

Albeit a little graphic at times, the story itself is a rather interesting one and the uniqueness of each character in backstory and abilities makes you hope that more expansion will take place. However, the story within 12 episodes is painfully uneventful at times if not repetitive and annoying as we are faced with having to watch the main character wrestle with being a human and a ghoul over and over again with no real progress being made - until the end.\r\nSpeaking of the end - there really isn't one. Everything is left upin the air.",

            "content": "When a human being is born it tends toward a certain nature by its gestures,behaviour and decisions. It starts with things that others see as minor and unsignificant.. yet they are clearly a sign as to what kind of individual that person will be. The next part is the acceptance of that nature by the human itself and the relatives.\r\nThe action in Tokyo Ghoul takes place in the city that partially names the anime and is about the rebirth of the protagonist which struggles while attempting to cling to the nature of human despite having turned into a ghoul, a flesh-devouring human with enhanced physicalcapabilities. He refuses to acknowledge that he is human no more and ultimately ends up suffering for it as much as his acquaintances.\\n\\n\r\nThe things the artists managed to achieve using shades and colors is amazing, maybe because important scenes take place at night or in enclosed spaces where those two elements of artwork are essential, also being action-oriented some dynamics are required to a modest to excellent degree which this series did not fail to supply.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters are a variety of personalities that are mostly ghouls that have accepted and are content with living like that. All of them have sad tales as to how they became as they are now and are an element of focus based on the episodes. They are all made in order to highlight the protagonist in his state of observance and ultimately activity.\\n\\n\r\nMy enjoyment consists of the fact that I like tragic tales that are somewhat psychological when suffering and death are involved, however there are certain moments where those two elements of existence are not involved and the focus lies on nurturing the future, but that is my personal opinion so I shall stop here.\\n\\n\r\nHopefully my words have convinced you to or not to watch this series which is well worth watching.",

            "content": "I am reviewing TG as a viewer who watched the anime before reading the manga.\r\nI feel TG gets too much criticism especially from manga readers. There are some complaints that I would like to address.\r\n1. They left out a lot of stuff from the manga.\r\nThis is partly true especially in the last arc but other than that, things that were left out were mostly nerdy trivia unimportant to the development of the story (explanation of ghoul kagune types, Hide and Kaneki's bromance dinner date, etc). \r\nThe only real problem here is the crack-induced pacing of the anime's last arc where a dozen characters were introducedin about 10 minutes and a few important scenes were cut out. This was quite disappointing since I felt the pacing and execution in the first 3-4 episodes were almost flawless. The drop in quality was likely a result of the 12 ep limit, so this is forgivable.\\n\\n\r\n2. Censorship\\n\r\nThe censors were quite atrocious as it is overused and detracts from the horror experience. Maybe it was done to reach a wider audience, but it's silly how half of the screen often gets blacked out or everything just turns blue. I don't know who is responsible for this, but I will nomnom their flesh. \\n\\n\r\n3. The MC is a wuss.\\n\r\nSeriously? If you want a protagonist who wtflolpwnzallggnore, go watch SAO. I'm sure you would like that kind of story \"development\". The point is Ken is a believable character who is just trying to survive. He might have a whiny voice and get kicked around for much of the series, but he does what he has to and grows stronger little by little. Watching his growth from squeaky anorexic wimp to I-will-eat-your-face beast in the face of dangerous situations is what made the show for me.\\n\\n\r\n4. Underdeveloped characters.\\n\r\nThis is also true for some especially the supporting characters. Killing off side characters, some of which had 2-3 lines (and one whose face wasn't even shown (like wtf?)) and expecting to make it into a tragic story development had me rolling my eyes. These dead characters might as well be cattle.\\n\\n\r\n- Hey I'm gonna kill you dead and leave your family and loved ones forever in despair! Got any last words??\\n\r\n- MOOOOOOOOO!\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nSo overall, TG was very enjoyable despite some of its legitimate flaws. It's the series I looked forward to every week, and I will be looking forward to it in S2.\\n\\n",

I am not sure how to review this anime because I have too many mixed feelings about it. It was not what I was expecting, and not in a good way. I have seen so much hype for this anime, which is one of the reasons I watched it in the first place. However, my expectation were shot down into the depths of no return with utter dismay. The only saving grace for this series was thelast episode, no joke that was the best episode and had me saying \"finally, something good!\" I will say the first episode is interesting too because it grabbed my  attention, wanting me to continue the series. But no, after the first episode the rest of the season was a snooze fest and the story was all mixed up and confusing that I did not understand what was going on half the time. I only kept watching because I wanted to see the main character, Kaneki, go super saiyan because I knew it would be crazy epic,  but of course that didn't happen. It would have made the anime much more interesting if Kaneki went bat sh!!t crazy from the get go, or at least half way through the series; but instead they decided to make him a whiny kid that cried almost EVERY episode, seriously I think it was every episode. Though I will admit I understand why he was that way, fighting the demons inside himself and trying to keep his humanity, but still no excuse. I wish he had been more compelling because the other characters were just as bad, if not more useless. Honestly, some of them had no need to be part of the story because they did not have any serious impact to make any difference. Nonetheless, there were a few appealing moments where they make you stop and think about how cruel the world can be and how things never change. It was quite eye opening in those brief moments of inspirational thought, but they unfortunately were overcast by the slow haul of a story that they were almost forgotten. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, the story is interesting but the way it was executed was not pleasant. It dragged on to the point where I almost ripped my eyes out up until the very end. The art is actually quite nice, but seriously there was NO NEED for censorship. The so called blood and gore was nothing and having it censored, I believe, took away from the whole experience. The music was decent, but not very moving as I was anticipating. The characters, just were bland and many had no reason to be a part of the story because they made no significant influence. The enjoyment was there but was slowly cast away trying to get through the series, until the very end the spark came back. This anime could have been done SO much better, it could have been beautiful in more ways than one, but has left me in complete disappointment.",

            "content": "Tokyo Ghoul is a great anime for fans of the genre \"gore\", I type! The work presents gory themes and even controversial, however, the lack of truly remarkable characters in my view and especially the conduct of the end of the anime, for me I read the manga, it was a drug, downgraded a little anime. \r\nI'm not saying that the ending was bad, far from it, because the struggle Kaneki and Jason was amazing in the anime! But still, the final phase of the anime was very poorly explained and summarized unnecessarily.\r\nRegarding the characters ... I particularly enjoyed the few characters in Tokyo Ghoul!Not that the characters are bad, weak in combat or something, but lacked the charisma overwhelming majority, after all, the ones who had something else in relation to others - in my view - were Rize, Uta and Suzuya! \\n\r\nThe soundtrack is spectacular! Especially the opening, whose letter went almost exactly the emotional and psychological state of Kaneki ... but ... does seem a shoujo anime (romantic)! Despite incredible, the songs are not exactly the idea of the anime (blood, \"cannibalism\", sadism, psychopathy).\\n\r\nThe design, the graphics and art as a whole are simply extraordinary! It is essentially a romantic and \"sweet\" graphic, but that's exactly what makes Tokyo Ghoul such a psychedelic anime ... contrast that art form, between violent and beautiful is something perfect! No more words: art is so perfectly absurd! \\n\r\n. \\n\r\n. \\n\r\nThe anime is great, but it lacked a better development in the story, like in the manga. The soundtrack is perfect, but it did not fit extamente the plot and the themes presented. Aside from Rize, Uta and Suzuya, none of the characters really draws attention to the charism, not even the protagonist, but still the cast is, um, good. I have made clear that art is absurd and perfect! Summing it all my private note to Tokyo Ghoul is 8, especially for the characters! \\n\\n\r\nPS .: A friend asked me to speak of Amon. I hate him ... for me he is the weakest character - in the sense of charisma, history and even the dialogues - the whole anime. '-'\\n",

The art style is also very nice and I find that often in anime it's either to gory or there's no blood and guts at all, whereas in Tokyo Ghoul you do get the occasional decapitation or maybe someone gets ripped in half, while still being enjoyable to watch. I'd also recommend the second season beacause the second seasons of many animes I have watched are just unnecessary and ruinthe first one, however in Tokyo Ghoul Root A it takes the loose ends of the first season and ties them up neatly.(Even though I did in fact find the end slightly disappointing I enjoyed this anime immensely and am going to have a hard time finding one that will interest me this much).\\n",

            "content": "Change. We all experience it. but Kaneki knows how it actually feels better than anyone else. It is indeed very scary, but becoming 'someone' you're not is better than dying in vain. That is something Kaneki is hoping to believe. \r\nTokyo Ghoul is indeed a very popular animation, adapted by its manga, becoming more and more well-known across the globe. I happened to find out about Tokyo Ghoul on Tumblr, with all the endless amazing and bad ass fan arts of the characters, i decided to give it a try.\r\nThe main plot of this story is about the two different types of citizens living inTokyo, the human and the ghoul. Being aware of each other, they live a very careful life. The human avoided being eaten by the ghoul, while the ghoul hide themselves from being captured by humans. \\n\\n\r\nKaneki was once a very ordinary boy, living a dull boring life, but that drastically changed overnight. What was he like ? Why did his life change ? How does he cope with it ? The answers lie within his journey. Vampire and ghoul are two very mainstream animation idea, that's what makes it hard to turn the idea around and create something original. Would you like the animation and keep on watching or would you do the opposite ? The answer is yours to decide.  But it is totally possible for you to click the 'next episode' because honestly, what's not to like about it ? \\n\\n\r\nA boy living with ghoul's organs only to become, probably the most powerful and unique ghoul around, the somewhat gory scenes, the amazing plot. Still not convinced enough to watch it ? Did I mention about the bad ass and cool looking female protagonist ? I just did.\\n\\n\r\nAs much as i love the anime, i do have something about one of the character that disappoint me a little bit at the beginning. The male ghoul named Uta. His cool fan arts on tumblr could be the reason why i started watching, (although i keep on going because of the story itself), i expected him to be as bad ass as in the fan arts, but he is more of a polite guy, and possibly a little shy. Nevertheless, i happen to love him anyway. \\n\\n\r\nI'm very looking forward to the second season. The ending of season 1 will leave you wanting more because of the cliffhanger, so the continuation must be breathtaking.  \\n",

            "content": "This is my first review in MAL. Many reviews that I have read either give too long or not enough so I will try my best to provide enough yet short review without any spoilers.\r\nTokyo Ghoul or Tokyo Kushu mainly set around a boy name Kaneki Ken. His world is filled with fear of ghouls, a man eating being. He was a plain citizen that fear ghouls until he meet Rize. \r\nStory: 5\r\nTo be honest I was bored half-way through the anime, only to be excited in some parts throughout all the episodes. It is the usual plot that shounen anime often have. The characterencounters something new and it change their fate. They then must struggle to understand the meaning of why did they end up like they are now. In TK Kaneki is similarly like it.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 7\\n\r\nThe overall art was okay. However, I just love it how the made the battle scenes. The blood effects, the invert and the sensors were put perfectly to enable the viewers to still feel the full feeling of it. The speed of the fight was fast yet the detail was not missed. Especially the details on their wounds and movements they make.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8\\n\r\nTo me the opening fits the plot very well. So implementing it to the anime would really give the vibe of what's the battle like to us, viewers. As I wrote, I love their battle scenes. The sound of the music in the background when they fight give off a perfect mix of how the character feels about themselves and the fight with each other. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10\\n\r\nThe character development here is just too awesome to describe. I love Kaneki's character development. You can say he went from a coward to a super badass. In the anime you might realize he often cannot decide what to do. Yet after his decision he was able to unleash the power in him. Other character's development was also very interesting. Their struggle to obtain their place in the world and their view about the world were somewhat changed by meeting Kaneki.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8\\n\r\nIf the plot was better and more interesting I would most likely give it a 10. Even though I got bored most of the time, in the end it became my most favorite anime. If you have a 'who am I?' psychology problem, you probably can relate to Kaneki here the most and to other characters as well. This anime somewhat represent the injustice to some group of people in the society\u2026\\n\\n\r\nWell that's my opinion. Hope this helps (^U^)v",

            "content": "So have you ever had tried something and thought oh man this is going to be the most amazing thing ever but turns out you get less then what you were expecting? Your not exactly disappointed but your just there thinking of how much potential it has? Welcome to the Tokyo Ghoul!\r\nThis anime just likes to play with your feelings in the sense of having such a great potential but not reaching it. The story might be all over the place and quick but there is something there! The whole concept is kind of cool. The story is based in Tokyo where everywhere in thecity there are creatures called ghouls who survive off eating the human flesh because they don't eat regular food. That is the simple story of the whole show. This is where its downfall is. I feel that it could of gone so much beyond the story they went with. So that is where I will began.\\n\\n\r\nThe first problem is the fact how simple and quick everything escalates and relaxes during the show. Like there should be a little more time taken on developing the story, obviously maybe the studio only wanted to keep it at 12 episodes but I can imagine a 30 episode version of Tokyo Ghoul were you will get to understand the story at a better pace instead of jumping from one event to another in one episode to another. The extra details you see in other anime's would of gone really far with Tokyo Ghoul.\\n\\n\r\nMy second problem was there was no emotional connection with the characters. I don't know about you but the shows were you feel something with the main characters can make something good to amazing. Like when something happens like they lose a love one and you are actually choking up a bit because you are just like \"wow...\" that's when you know you have a connection with the characters. For me there were only 3 moments within the 12 episodes that actually had me feeling something in my stomach, and those scenes were so deep it actually annoyed me! Why couldn't there be more moments like this throughout the show!\\n\\n\r\nMy last problem was I wish there was a little more story and development with certain characters. The only characters you actually get to know about are Kaneki, Touka, Amon, Nishiki, and Henami . I would of loved to see more story with Rize her character seemed like such a cool character and someone you wanted to know about but she is just shrouded in mystery with no background whatsoever. I think if you watch you'll understand what I mean when I say a bigger role for her would of been awesome. Plus characters like Yomo and Yoshimura. These characters need development and it would of came a long way for the series.\\n\\n\r\nThe one thing about this show, even if it was exactly the best story and you don't get a connection with most of the characters, I can't help but love this show. Something keeps drawing me back to watch the next episode. Despite the 7/10 rating I gave it, it just has those 9 and 10 out of 10 moments within. This anime is differently worth the 12 episodes of your time, I can guarantee it. \\n\\n\r\n7/10 | Story\\n\r\n9/10 | Art\\n\r\n7/10 | Sound\\n\r\n7/10 | Character\\n\r\n9/10 | Enjoyment \\n\r\n7/10 | Overall\\n\\n",

            "content": "An anime that has a very cool and interesting story about a teen that lives in Tokyo where these creatures called ghouls have to eat human flesh in order to survive because ordinary food is not enough. The thing that got me hooked to this anime was the fight scenes and the cool characters that goes with it. Tokyo ghoul is not an anime you want to miss.\r\nStory- The story is more to it then just a bunch of ghouls running around tokyo and killing people, is more about how society doesn't accept ghouls so they are hunted down by the law. Is about survivalin a place where you aren't accepted because you're different and about how to deal with being different in a wolrd so cruel. If that interest you then Tokyo ghoul is for you. Love every minute of the story as it goes on and made me want to watch more.\\n\\n\r\nArt- Amazing visualization that excel at looking great. Expectially in the fight scenes.\\n\\n\r\nSound- Sound was good I just didin't like the choice of music in some of the scenes. I though it felt out of place it didn't need to be there. I just wanted to hear what they were saying and not some music in the background. I did like the music they used for the fight scenes. They could of done a better job at sound editing.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter- They were all great in their own ways. Some were funny, some were quicky, I mean they all have something interesting to bring to the table. I got to admit that some of the characters weren't relatable. You don't feel a connection with them only the protagonist. That's something that I felt was a let down. Like none of the characters has a strong bond except for Ken and his best friend Hide.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment- Had a great time with this anime, with the fight scenes and the cool characters that you just want to know more about them, and of course the story which is interesting. Tokyo Ghoul did wonder for me and I hope it does for you. I recommend it to all anime fans.\\n",

            "content": "Note: I am writing from the point of view of a person who haven't touched the manga at all before diving in to the anime.\r\nI first get to know Tokyo Ghoul from a friend who recommends it to me. Although it is stated horror as the genre I decided to gamble and watch... and honestly I get more than what I expected. I am currently reading the manga to catch up (and because I just can't wait for the second season teehee) Here are what I think..\r\nStory 7/10\r\nHonestly having a character which is half human and half something else (that is not human) is notso original anymore. However Tokyo Ghoul (I'm referring to both manga and anime) did good execution in the setting. Ghouls, who somewhat like vampires who can't survive without human meat and blood, were first portrayed as the bad guys... but when our protagonist Kaneki got into an accident and transformed into a half ghoul, it appears that ghouls are not what humans think they are. Ghouls have feelings too, they have family, friends, they also have their own internal problems.. The exploration on both human and ghoul sides are done very well, making us the audience who knows what happened on both sides got agitated (at least I did) hoping they will somehow get to understand each other because they do have some similarities.\\n\\n\r\nThe story starts light in the cafe but starts gripping into you, deeper and deeper. Both manga and anime manage to mess with your psychology and emotions, definitely not something you will forget. I do notice they decided to switch the arcs, but as someone who watch anime first then reads, it doesn't matter so much to me.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 7/10\\n\r\nHonestly I feel the character design for main characters might be quite generic (at least for Kaneki and Touka), but not the characters themselves. Kaneki is introduced as shy, somewhat closed yet kind-hearted, somewhat naive and always blaming himself, but when we got to know him and his back story, it makes sense why he acts like that. In the end of the anime he got major character - I won't say development, it's a - transformation, and the reasoning I can accept it.\\n\\n\r\nI find Touka is somewhat typical bad-ass hot-tempered girl. I am okay with some characters and I do hate several.. the good thing is Tokyo Ghoul have a wide range of characters. All the characters here, no matter how annoying they might be, have roles to play to Kaneki's growth as well as moving the story forward. I'm still reading so I'm waiting for some more surprise and revelation.\\n\\n\r\nArt 8/10\\n\r\nIt has very interesting art.  While the drawings in the manga are good, making it into colored, moving images and animated makes it even better especially in action scenes. I like how the color contrasts greatly on each other and darker colors - there's a word for it, \"chiaroscuro\" if you know art and drawing. It suits the mood of the show, which is dark and somewhat grey. \\n\\n\r\nI didn't expect Studio Pierrot to produce something like this so well (coughnarutobleachcough). The character design are the same with the manga which is very relieving for the manga readers. Animation are mostly good, battle scenes with kagune and quinques are smooth... effects like explosions, sparks, rain are well-done too, although I kinda annoyed with the sensors - black or white spots suddenly popping here and there (while in the same time I'm quite saved by it since I got a weak heart) \\n\\n\r\nSound 8/10\\n\r\nAnother good aspect about this anime is... the sound. The opening is very good! It's catchy (still playing in my mind until now) also the meaning of the song lyrics fits perfectly with Kaneki and what this show is about. The OST are quite ok.. \\n\\n\r\nI give so high marks for sound in respect of the seiyuus - Kaneki's seiyuu's Natsuki Hanae-san in particular.. in the last 3 episodes his voice acting really got me to feel Kaneki's emotions (ok I'll stop here so I won't spoil..) \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment & Overall 8/10\\n\r\nIt's been a while I watched such intense and emotional anime.. I am amazed and horrified by it in the same time, but overall I enjoy it. It is not a horror where there are scary ghosts, it's more on psychological with disturbing gruesome scenes that stir your emotion.\\n\\n\r\nIf you haven't read the manga at all, I suggest you watch first then read. That way you will enjoy it better because Tokyo Ghoul is, in my opinion, a good anime and as you read you will find out more about the characters, details and explanations which are all dropped in the anime.\\n\r\nIf you have read the manga, lower your expectation and just enjoy the show~ \\n",

            "content": "It's like I have no idea what happened, a story with a great idea was displayed far worse than what it could have been. I never read the manga but from what I hear it's far better than the anime. It feels like they rushed the anime yet they waste a whole episode on the makings of coffee while skipping the more relevant and enjoying parts of the manga they could have added.\r\nStory - It's about a wimpy kid struggling to keep his humanity as a ghoul. The main character Kaneki lives in a world where humans are the majority and ghouls survive by eatingthem. Due to what I would say a lucky turn of events, Kaneki lives his encounter and becomes one of these ghouls. The ending was pretty bad for an ending, but it was the best episode of the season. I can't say more without spoiling it but the ending of it basically changed the whole plot of \"Trying to maintain humanity\" to \"Lets just give in to it\". I have no idea if season 2 will come out, but at this rate I hope not, they ruined what it could have been, don't force more.\\n\\n\r\nArt - Art is good modern style, nothing you can really complain about with the art, its well done, the animation is well done as well.\\n\\n\r\nSound - the opening is pretty good, can't really think of much to say about it, nice to hear but nothing stands out.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - The characters aren't anything unique, like many other anime before it, the main character is a complete wimp and the main female of the anime is a cute tomboy girl that picks up his slack.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - It is enjoyable to watch when you have nothing else to do or watch other than this. It does get annoying watching a wimpy character constantly cry in every episode.\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 6/10 - could have been much better.",

            "content": "This anime is AMAZING!\r\nI was originally sceptical because I thought Tokyo Ghoul was only popular because it was violent and graphic, but after watching it I was astonished by how complex and well constructed it was.\r\nFirst of all the music is fantastic, especially what is probably regarded as the flagship of the OST, the track \"Licht und Schatten\" which always seems to cature the spirit of the moment when it plays during the show. The opening theme has an outstanding vocal performance and the ending theme is so groovy that I could listen to it on repeat for hours on end.\r\nVisually it looks beautiful, thecolor palette tends to be very plain for the most part and then they bring in the sharper colors for the intense and important scenes.\\n\\n\r\nStorywise this show takes a very basic setting: \"Us vs. Them!\", The Humans vs. The Ghouls, and manages to make it so nuanced that you can't say that one side is the good guys and the other the bad guys, there is both good and evil characters on either side of the spectrum and it will have you second guessing your own judgement on characters as you learn about their individual circumstances and motivations. The finale was absolutely mindblowing, now ofcourse I won't write any spoilers, all I can say is that Kaneki has an epiphany based on something very fucked up.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters deal with themes like guilt, acceptance in society, helplessness, grief, good vs. evil, and losing control to your urges. Both sides of society, human and ghoul respectively, believe themselves to be fully in the right and believe the opposition to be fully in the wrong, but as the story progresses various characters starts to doubt this motion.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all I can't help but give this show a 10/10 because I truly enjoyed it and was totally mindblown after the finale. I never got bored, there's no characters I found annoying (which happens alot in anime), and it kept me on the edge of my seat. At the end of an episode I would on one hand be like \"Iwant to watch what happens next NOW!\", and on the other \"But I can't skip this song it's so GOOD!\"",

            "content": "- 0/10- A rare fail by concept series, of which the anime doesn\u2019t even try and redeem. Intentionally ignores good characters (Amon, Hide, Rize) and focuses on the boring ones (Touka, everyone at the caf\u00e9, Uta, yeah most of the ghouls). Disregards what could have been awesome plotlines such as the potential for Kaneki to get in with the humans right away and have a ghoul, human team for the ghouls that need to eat a bullet or ten (interestingly this was to be the premise for the later Tokyo ghoul Re but remarkably even that had the ball and dropped it, again by forgettinggood characters and introducing an extra bland cast). An inferior production of a manga that was in sore need of a good anime to give it some life, just all round dire.\\n\\n\r\n- Characters: 0/10 - I get it, ignore the intriguing characters and focus on the boring ones, give the Emo\u2019s their chance to shine. Emo was done long before Tokyo ghoul came out, and it\u2019s failed to convey their\u2026 er, charms. Virtually all people and ghouls are astonishingly monotonous, un-inspired stereotypes for characters as well, flush. Apart from Kaneki, no one goes though any development over an entire 12 episode session, we\u2019re non better for knowing them, they could spend the rest of their lives working in the coffee shop and you wouldn\u2019t notice their absence. Same with the police side, nothing original and like the ghouls it was clear from the outset that the least appealing characters would get the focus on them. Seriously, what is the point of any of these clich\u00e9, literally copy and paste wooden boards?\\n\\n\r\n- Animation: 3/10 - Surprisingly bad, objectively speaking and from a technical standpoint the only thing that is notable is the fluid blood like kagunes which are aesthetically impressive, to the extent where it\u2019s inspired other anime (Seraph of the end apparently used similar designs for the realistic blood) of which this has to be commended. A shame they couldn\u2019t apply some effort to make up for the poor backgrounds, and the clear disdain the studio has for this series with its dodgy animation in places. It is even more unfortunate since this would have been a great chance to animate Tokyo city that would be neat. And an effort to resurrect a lifeless cast from the manga would be impressive too, but why bother, right studio? \\n\r\nWhen it comes right down to it, a series can have the best animation imaginable, but it counts for nothing when it\u2019s on top of a bedrock of crumbs like this anime. Even if the art were decent, who would ignore everything wrong with this series and go ooh look at the pretty art, isn\u2019t Touka wearing some absurd rabbit mask so beautiful? Behold, the best animated scenes ever! Of an oil spill/blimp explosion/toilet eruption/Tokyo Ghoul manga.\\n\\n\r\n- Sound: 4/10 - Yamori had an appropriate voice, Touka did as well, but again under average. Subbed should definitely be chosen over dubbed voices, but even then the voices fail to bring out the emotion or feelings of the text and drawn on paper characters. There is little to make them stand out, nothing to explore who they are. \\n\r\nIn both aspects though it\u2019s hard to be positive, for example Kaneki\u2019s voice during the lopping off toes scenes unfortunately didn\u2019t work so well, they were supposed to be serious scenes, not laughable ones because of how ridiculous it sounded (especially compared to the sub), kind of awkward to say the least. \\n\r\nBackground music also doesn\u2019t count for much, neither do the titular songs, though it appeals to the Emo audience who love the sound, like the beginning song (unravel) it was all rather cringe inducing for everyone else. Then again, Twilight has its fans, Tokyo ghoul has its fans, and there you go. As well as the titular songs, the background tracks for the whole series were forgettable, never a good thing in an anime, especially in this one which could have capitalised on appropriate sound effects to exemplify the tensions that were supposed to be present. Never mind, the only song that wasn\u2019t dire was the ending one, though it cannot be enjoyed it because of the association with this Taco Bell squat result of an anime. Thanks Tokyo ghoul for putting people off something potentially good through your association with it.\\n\\n\r\n- Enjoyment: 1/10 \u2013 1 given for the cliff-hanger at the end, anything to make it register that this animes out to be as bad as it can, the fans appreciated it that\u2019s for sure. And, splendidly it leads conveniently into the swamp of no returns that route A sequel is, thanks a bunch. The 1 was also because fans may appreciate the manga being animated, notably the kagunes, though with this result they still needn\u2019t bother watching. Still a mercy point for trying, we have to be constructive. \\n\r\nThe studio has succeeded in bringing the authors story to life, in the sense it\u2019s a filled to the brim catheter of an anime. For the points awarded for the animation and sound, these ultimately count for nothing since both go down with the ship that is the concept of Tokyo Ghoul. A series is doomed from the start when you\u2019re making a cake with cement instead of eggs, locusts instead of sugar, and horse poo over icing made of chicken dribble. Deliberately choosing the bad characters, storylines and clich\u00e9 avenues, and saying, \u201clook mommy, look at the Tokyo ghoul I made in my diaper!\u201d What do we do? Give it a gold star for trying? Sink time into those doctors are angry with this granny adverts; you\u2019d get more fulfilment from those scams then this.\\n\r\nIf you enjoy series where the worst imaginable storyline is followed (an office rom com between Amon and Akira anyone? No?) And it spirals off into an Emo fest, then by all means this is for you. Fans can drool over Uta, Touka and Kaneki\u2019s Emo form - Kaneki\u2019s still something, Tokyo ghoul can\u2019t taint a decent character like him. Why invest anything in this anime, all the best, but don't be tricked into thinking this is good, this means as much to the viewer as it clearly meant to the studio that made it: nothing.\\n\\n\r\n- Overall verdict: doesn\u2019t warrant a rating/10 - even a \u20180\u2019 is giving this animation version of B-movie some unwarranted credibility that it is not entitled to, and undeserved critique that should be reserved for something notable.\\n\\n",

            "content": "So while this is a pretty controversial anime (mostly due to the second season in relation to the manga) I'm going to specify I'm writing this independently of that second season.\r\nIn short, I quite liked this entry to the Tokyo Ghoul world. The way they establish character, the morally grey, and the downright evil are quite interesting. Those who are the most twisted were usually victims of an institutionalized system of a sort. One of the Doves, and one of the Ghouls. Due to the facts of everyday life, and \"that's just the way it is\" constant victims and enemies are produced in a greatmachine that churns them out endlessly.\\n\\n\r\nWhile I can sometimes have a hard time getting into the flow of darker anime, I don't ever feel like Tokyo Ghoul ever lied to me about what kind of series it was. It was one of pain and suffering used to make one either stronger or weaker in almost an instant.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, it seems that they can provide the substance and style of the series. However, I think they do lack in showing proper motivation for characters sometimes. It either comes as some reveal, or it's too nebulous to get a good grasp on it. It was only in the final episode that it really started losing me a little, however it was nothing that was out of the ordinary for many shows I watch. If you like some dark gothic tones, you might enjoy this show. If not, steer clear.",

(3/10)\r\nThe characters, are really bad characters, if you do not agree, i willshow it to you, and saying somethings about some characters.\\n\r\nFirst - Kaneki, he doesn't do NOTHING until the episodes 11 and 12, he just cryies almost all of the time, and he is a DUMB\\n\r\nTouka - She at least is a \"cool\" character, in personality I say, but she almost dont have any development, just like Kaneki and other characters, and just RUN all the anime...\\n\r\nJuuzou - Why you guys like so much this character? He is just a psycho, and nothing more, even the characters are overrated in this anime.\\n\r\nThis characters was just some examples about why the characters are too bad in this anime.\\n\r\nArt and Animation (6/10)\\n\r\n(Art) (7/10)\\n\r\nTokyo Ghoul anime have a \"normal' art, but it isn't a bad art, it is a good art, but it is a \"normal\" art, i think a better art it is the one that differentiates from the other anime.\\n\r\n(Animation) (6/10)\\n\r\nI think everybody knows that Pierrot isn't a bad studio, BUT makes a lot of mistakes  in popular anime, like Naruto, Bleach, then... Tokyo Ghoul... Okay, okay, i was lying about Tokyo Ghoul hehehe; Tokyo Ghoul don't have a bad animation, but the Tokyo Ghoul animation is a \"normal\" animation, I think they could do a better animation, but as i said it isn't bad, but it isn't good.\\n\r\nStory. (6/10)\\n\r\nTokyo Ghoul have a such of a great idea; A world with \"Ghouls\" (\"Animals\" that look like people and eat humans) with humans trying to kill all these ghouls, and survive; I think this is a great idea, BUT the ANIME put this idea on trash... And transform the story in just a human that became a ghoul, and... Nothing more... The story don't received a worst rate because as i said, Tokyo Ghoul anime has a great idea, but it's used too bad...\\n\r\nEnjoyment. (6/10)\\n\r\nIt wasn't a bad enjoyment, but it wasn't good, understand? And i think you can enjoy Tokyo Ghoul more than me... So i think the enjoyment is something more personal than critical.\\n\r\nOverall. (5/10)\\n\r\nThe anime is bad in a lot of points, you can see this in my review, and a 5/10 is fair for this anime.\\n",

            "content": "At first this anime didn't strike me as interesting, but when I actually sat down and watched it, it instantly became a personal favorite for me. The main character at the start of the anime is a bit hard to like at first, but in the second season it focuses on him being able to hold his own, instead of hiding behind everyone else. The progression at the start of the anime is a bit fast, but easy to understand. Also the manga to this anime, is a bit more detailed and just as enjoyable, so check that out.\r\nI gave this anime a 10/10 forthese reasons. The story kept me entertained throughout the entire anime. The soundtrack went well with the anime and the opening is one of my favorites, the opening in the second season sucked though. The art is really good, but I would say the story line is one of its strongest selling points. Most of the characters were interesting to learn about. If I had to compare this anime to another then it would probably be Parasyte. Both are similar anime styles and focus on a character turning into a supernatural being. \\n\\n\r\nSome of the negatives of this anime. I think the anime didn't go into enough detail as much as the manga did and skipped out on some important points that the manga focused on. The only other thing would be the main character at the beginning of the series, but nothing else really bothered me about this anime.\\n\\n\r\nDefinitely an anime I highly recommend!!! Give it a shot at least through the first episode!",

            "content": "Introduction\r\nFirst and foremost horror in anime is a horrible (hah!) genre. Showing as much blood as possible doesn't qualify as horror, it's straight up splatter and gore.\r\nTokyo Ghoul uses a dark and eerie theme, but is far off from being a horror show. It's a typical action and drama anime and focuses on either ghouls and humans struggling to live a peaceful life together. Ghouls are humane-looking, yet driven by their hunger for human flesh and hidden powers in strength, agility or vitality.\r\nPlot and pace\r\nThe story revolves around Ken Kaneki, a somewhat shut-in and introvert student becoming a \"half-ghoul\" after a certain incident and thefollowing struggle to fit in either world. He realizes that ghouls are way more present than he thought they'd be and are having their own social and cultural lifes.\\n\r\nIt's always hard to maintain a healthy pace of plot progression when it comes to shows in which the main character who has to adapt to rather disagreeable sitatuations, while still driving towards a wrap-up and solution. Tokyo Ghoul fight's with having a way to big and explorable world, too many characters and too less episodes to make the audience feel immersed into it.\\n\r\nAt the beginning you really can feel for Kaneki, but it's only temporary, because the show loses it's way in the middle and get's caught up in important plot points, with way to less time running on the clock.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters\\n\r\nOne of Tokyo Ghoul strentghs are its characters. It's easy to like and hate them as they are very outstanding and designed to fit in their role or a certain theme. Perverted high-society gourmet, ripped masochistic asshole, etc.\\n\r\nIt's very easy and exciting to comprehend on their lives and actions.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation and Art\\n\r\nThis anime manages to emphasize with the help of the animation and settings the fact that ghouls live, outside their ghoul lifes, a pretty normal life, while, in scenes where it's appropriate, creates a big contrast between the \"normal\" and \"ghoul-filled underground\" tokyo. The animations and transmassions are seemless and one of the positive aspects of thie show.\\n\\n\r\nMusic\\n\r\nAs typical the music is used to underline certain situations, drama, action, hype. The Soundtracks used are mostly fitting but some are very hard to distinguish from each other while some are very very outstanding. \\n\r\nThe opening theme and video are spoilerfree and fitting, and get's the most out of it in episode 12.\\n\\n\r\nConclusio\\n\r\nTokyo Ghoul was a typical action anime in many senses. Main character struggles, get's supernatural power, overcomes struggle, struggles more. Struggle Struggle Struggle ... Fight Fight Fight ... \\n\r\nWhile it is very exciting to immerse in the life of the ghouls, there is only little time used for that, thanks for that way to low amount of episodes, it was still a pleasant and sometimes overwhelming and emotional watch.\\n\r\nTokyo Ghoul is must watch for action fans, horror fans should reconsider on watching it as a horror show, as the show is not anything near terrifying.",

            "content": "This is my first anime review so please forgive my grammatical and technical mistakes. Although I like \"survival\" but this anime does not seem to be getting the point.This anime is a little too much overrated and makes me wonder what the hell had happened to our taste of enjoyment. I wish anime were written a little smarter. Character development is very bad and too generic actually make me less interested also because of how unrealistic the characters behave. There are no redeeming characters in this show, they might as well all be 2nd graders given their intellectual acumen. The season one is just tooslow paced and kind of boring because I just couldn't figure out the direction of the plot and the main point to the whole story. What happens to the main character just is enough to drive the plot forward in my mind.\\n\r\nStory 6/10: (Spoiler alert!)\\n\r\nThe story was pretty good and random with ghouls here and there. It did not had anything special in the story. The story was neither emotional nor cheerful. It felt like they tried to put a thick layer of emotional cheese in this creepy pizza but it turns out that it turns out they forgot to put anything else. Seriously how are they supposed to make it emotional without any character development and with the boy crying and the strong protective girl. The starting was good but hey, look at the ending, there comes a war and the main character gets some potential and kills the villain it was just boring. And everything was pretty dumb. The plot seemed king of low, half of the episodes were held in a hotel. I was expecting they should at least take it to a wide area .\\n\r\nCharacters 4/10:(Spoiler alert!)\\n\r\nYet another coming of age type show with a dark hero. I really hate these weakling heroes turned superman on a whim type shows but it is what it is. Kaneki also is too pessimist for a main role, he should be happy about fitting in both worlds. Oh look there its happening, First Tsukiyama Shuu  tries then tries to save Kaneki and then Nishiki Nishio who first tried to kill him is also supporting him, also Rize Kamishiro who first turned Kaneki into ghoul and then saves him from turning dead by teaching  a heartless lesson, are we supposed to be with them or against them. And I already had mentioned , there is not a little character development... all of them should die. Also when there is no character to take sides with, why should we even care about who the hell dies. And Hideyoshi Nagachika, Kaneki's  best friend for just four episodes, seriously, is he even a friend of Kaneki. And also I thought mask were to represent their personality so why did such a bold girl like Touka Kirishima gets to be a little cute bunny. But the characters were also eye-catching with different styles and I really like that the characters are perfectly drawn.\\n\r\nArt 10/10:(Spoiler alert!)\\n\r\nThe art was the best thing in the whole series, everything was perfect except the low plot and  those shapeless and colorless, odorless ghoul weapons. \\n\r\nSound 9/10:(Spoiler alert!)\\n\r\nThe sound was also good, doesn't sucks so bad and the best thing is that it has a dubbed version. Also I only know about the dubbed version. The starting and ending song was also good.\\n\r\nEnjoyment 3/10:(Spoiler alert!)\\n\r\nIt was kind of a sick entertainment only for sadists. How could we even enjoy this thing with not even a single joke to cheer up, why someone would even watch such a creepy movie with an ending which ended only by changing some mind set. I watched this anime because my friend told me that this anime comes in watch before you die and that you will love it. But when I was watching this thing, I thought that I am watching the  wrong anime or the did I skipped some episodes as there was nothing good in this anime that it claims to be.\\n\r\nOverall 6/10:(Spoiler alert!)\\n\r\nThis anime has noting to go on with, this story could just had ended in 2 episodes... Kaneki becomes a ghoul and then tries not to eat anyone ..but wait, how is he still alive?. ..At the end he ate the bad guy , fought with him and defeated him, the end. There is nothing to it. This anime does not contain any romance ,funny scenes, mystery etc. This story also seems to be following ,first fight then talk policy. although there are some catchy seems which you usually don't get to see in many anime, like a little girl eating human flesh and a ghoul who is getting tortured by humans. The anime was neither interesting nor disgusting ,it lies somewhere in between. Although the story ids totally different from what it seems to be in the cover.",

            "content": "So this is my first review since joining MAL, so you can tell i enjoyed this.\r\nFirst however, note that i am reviewing TG as a standalone anime as i have not read the manga.\r\nIve seen a lot of reviews on this and i felt they were unjust, criticising TG for being too short, and being forced into 12 ep's. I don't want this to deter people from watching this however, because as an anime its one of the top 5 this season.\r\nStory:9\r\nTokyo Ghoul is one of the more darker anime's this season. Combing both elements of horror and gore and mixing them into a psychological,supernatural drama, TG is an anime that stood out among others this season. It darker atonement worked perfectly and the story could flourish. Starting smooth ad finishing with a epic climax, the story was spectacular.\\n\\n\r\nArt:8\\n\\n\r\nVisually, TG was stunning. While maintaining the standard of art we would all expect in 2014, TG's art was up to scratch. It holds itself visually as a dark anime, and the only reason its not a 10 is that, it was the standard, if it pushed this it would be the 10.\\n\\n\r\nSound:9\\n\\n\r\nThe EP had viewers nostalgic before the show had even started and the OP gave them that moment to reflect on what they had seen, the sound of TG again was up to the standard we all want to see. The voices matched well and the shouts and grunts of pain really portrayed the characters emotions and feelings, creating a very strong drama feel.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 8\\n\\n\r\nThere is a broad range of characters, from the humble Kaneki, to the fiery Touka, to the sadistic Jason, many characters make the show their own in this show. The vast range of personalities allows you to fell their struggle but also helps portray the view that ghouls are \"human\" too, they show the same feelings. The main character is displayed as this hopeless boy who doesn't know who he is, but we see a huge development. The supporting characters also shape this anime well, creating many who will be remembered, whether you hate or love them.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10\\n\\n\r\nAs i said, i have not read the manga so i am reviewing this purely as an anime, rather than a adaptation, and as an adaptation, it was superb, a masterpiece of this season. The tension and suspense was real, and the i thoroughly enjoyed it. For only being 12 episodes it managed to capture my full attention, and since its only 12 episodes as it stands, i would highly recommend everyone sees this.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9\\n\\n\r\nOverall i give TG a 9 out of 10 rating, TG was an eye catcher this season and held me with suspense for 12 weeks straight. It's everything i look for in an anime in that genre and i was definitely not disappointed. If some scenes had been fleshed out a bit more, giving more time to other support characters, and had the MC not seemed so helpless for long, this would have  been a guaranteed No 1 this season",

            "content": "Tokyo Ghoul is a very hard title for me to rate. At some moments I was just dying to see what would come next, while a certain story arc in particular just felt silly and uneeded. I would say it's strong suit is it's phenomonal animation and choreography which was paced well with fitting sound effects and music. However, the story's plot could be very convoluted at times, and although it has some admirable characters, the main character himself, Ken Kaneki, fell short of my expectations.\r\nAs for the story, the overall concept seems to be innovative, however it doesn't seem to know what it wantsto be. At first, it seemed to be centered all arounf Kaneki, and him learning how to deal with his recent predicament of becoming a ghoul. They showed Kaneki's psychological melt down wonderfully, and it seemed to be about Kaneki struggling to figure out how to become a ghoul. The psychological story about Kaneki's internal battles and his decisions to either somehow overcome his insatiable hunger for human flesh, or succumb to his carnal desires.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, this character has little to no character development whatsoever. He is taken in and babied by the workers at Anteiku, and everything he knows is taught to him, not having to figure out things out by himself. Even when he is told what he has to do in order to save the ones he cares about, he still comes off as a p*ssy. Although I did not like Kaneki, I did however love Touka's character. She was rational, yet hot headed, and wasn't afraid to be blunt. Also, I admired how they went over Nishio's back story, and why he is the way he is, although I wished they elaborated just a bit more on it. \\n\\n\r\nEveryone who has seen Tokyo Ghoul knows it mainly for its phenomanal opening. I actually didn't like the opening song that much, and found it to be quite average. However, I came to love it, along with it's abstract imagery. The opening song, Unravel, also plays during the finally which brings back a feeling of nostaligia and really ties it all together. Not only was the opening great, the background music and voice actors (Japanese) fit the scene and the characters. \\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of music and sound effects, they blend perfectly with the different atmospheres and fight scenes. The uncensored fight choreography was great, although it tended to go overboard and turn into a pointless gorefest. However, I found it to be tasteful at most times, and since it has such dark themes, explicit violence is to be expected. I absolutely adored the character designs of this anime. Each was unique, and tended to reflect on their personality. Although some may think they go over the top with these designs, I find them to fit in with the world they are placed in.\\n\\n\r\nMy overall enjoyment of the series is a fairly high rank. Although it had it's flaws and downfalls, I still find it to be a good commentary on topics like discrimination and humanity, especially in the last couple of episodes. It constantly questions you who the true villians are, ghouls or humans?",

The battle of Kaneki (main character) with the world and with himself and his \"condition\" brings a contrast to the reality v/s ideal concept which is its more interesting to watch.

I wasn't really interested in it because I thought it was just one of those anime where they only have one season and it's done. I watched the first episode at the panel and I was hooked already. Here is what I liked: It had an awesome story line with characters I felt emotionally attached to and most relatable. I also enjoyed how the characters change and mature throughout the story realizing both ghouls and humans are wrong and Kaneki is theonly one who can reason with both. I disliked how it was one of those animes where it's really good but it's only 12 episodes. This anime really had me anticipated for the next episode every Thursday. Can't wait for Season 2.",

            "content": "This is my first time writing a review on MyAnimeList. Helpful/Not Helpful votes are appreciated and comments about my reviewing, writing, and quality are appreciated.\r\nWhen I don't call a character by their full name, I use whatever name the other characters use.\r\nAs many of you may know, Tokyo Ghoul is an adaptation of a wildly popular recent manga. I have personally read the manga, but I will not reference it at all since manga and their anime adaptations should be standalone works of art and should thus be judged separately.\r\nTokyo Ghoul was a great premise with lots of little holes strewn throughout the entire show.It has great insights into the nature of monsters, and the grey morality vs. ethics debate going on throughout the show is very well thought out. Where this show is lacking is little details all over, such as Kaneki's random ability to knock out an intimidating thug, or even more so his sudden bursts of fighting ability even though the anime never showed much of him training. Issues like these slowed down the show but did not take away enough for me to give it a terrible review. \\n\\n\r\nStory- 6/10\\n\\n\r\nThe premise and world of Tokyo Ghoul is brilliant. Man-eating creatures known as ghouls exist and interlope in human society, constantly murdering humans for a food source since ghouls can only receive nutrients by digesting human flesh. Our hero, Ken Kaneki, gets thrown into the chaos of being a ghoul while still keeping his connections to the human world. What would happen if the only way a human could survive with his new body is to eat other humans? The show tries to answer this question and does a solid job of showing Kaneki's despair. The first few episodes were extremely strong and were arguably the strongest episodes save for the finale. After that, the show takes a nosedive. The Gourmet arc was disappointing. It simply became a battler against the evil guy with none of the provocative morality issues that the show lives and dies by. However, after that the show manages to pick up and until the very end it does well in keeping its original premise and moral dilemmas.\\n\\n\r\nThe major issue with the story is that the pacing is horrendous. Plot points seem to be missing, things happen for no apparent reason, and the setting skips all over the place. The show fails to give a sense of time so the viewer is led to assume that all of these terrible things that happen to Kaneki are chronologically very close. On top of this, the show has episodes were a lot happens, episodes where very little happens, and episodes that are too inconsistent. While squeezing this complex story into a 1-cour season may have been tough, it would have been better to make a slower, better prepared 2-cour show that in turn adapted more of the source material. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters- 6/10\\n\\n\r\nIn a show with grey morality and grimdark happenings in the plot, the characters and the way the characters are shaped should star as conflicted individuals who are hard-pressed between the lesser of two evils. This is not the case.\\n\\n\r\nOur hero, Ken Kaneki, is a little bitch. While this may help advance the plot and enforce the themes of morality vs. ethics, it does nothing for the enjoyment of the anime. The way to get around this is to give our little bitch some fantastic character development throughout the course of the story, where he slowly hardens as more and more crap is thrown at him. What actually happens in the story is that he has almost no character development throughout the story and then suddenly his entire personality changes. This is not the proper way to develop a character.\\n\\n\r\nThe best written character and character development comes from the main heroine Touka Kirishima. As a powerful former rogue ghoul who joined the coffee shop and secret ghoul society Anteiku, her extreme bluntness was entertaining when she got lumped together with the clueless and helpless Kaneki. Touka gets proper development. Events change her more subtly. Her personality does not really change even though some events shake her considerably. Compared to Kaneki, Touka is a well written character who personifies the ghoul side of the morality debate. \\n\\n\r\nThe other notable character is Kotarou Amon, but he does not get as much screen time as I felt he should. As the human protagonist and the human anchor for the morality debate, seeing more of him and more of his thoughts on ghouls would have been ideal.\\n\\n\r\nSome of the other side characters, such as the manager Yoshimura and the young girl Hinami, are great supporting characters. Others, like the ghoul hunter Mado and the eccentric ghoul Tsukiyama, are much more linear. Because of Kaneki's bad characterization and some weak supporting characters, I gave the show a score of 6/10 for characters.\\n\\n\r\nArt- 6/10\\n\\n\r\nThe animation and character design for the show is very good, with each character being instantly recognizable. Action scenes are well done, and the animation of the special ghoul kagunes is very pretty to look at. The major flaw with the animation is that every time some grimdark mutilation of the body occurs, a giant black area appears on the screen and obscures whatever happened in the anime. It's impossible to tell what happened to certain characters because of this and completely takes away from the experience. The angles scenes are shown from however are very well chosen to portray the mood and atmosphere of events.\\n\\n\r\nSound- 7/10\\n\\n\r\nI really liked the opening of the show at first, but as time went on, the overly high pitched vocals started to get on my nerves. The lyrics of the song tie in very well to the show itself.\\n\\n\r\nThe voice acting is done by a great cast. All of the characters sounded alive and the emotion in their voices (or gruesome screams) was done well. Mamoru Miyano was spectacular as usual, but it was a damn shame he got placed on an unremarkable supporting character.\\n\\n\r\nThe BGM for the show never caught my attention. It certainly didn't take away from the experience, but it was nothing to write home about.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment- 7/10\\n\\n\r\nThe main \"thing\" this show offers is its extremely well defined look into morality. Is it ok for ghouls to eat humans to survive? Are there ways around this? Should any ghoul be killed on sight? This show, despite its huge flaws all over the place, made me think. It made me think a lot about how I condemn certain people for doing certain things. Despite how great this is, many aspects take away from the show. Kaneki is pathetically weak despite his potential strength. The random censoring of gore is extremely annoying. The plot is full of holes and is inconsistent. I can go on and on nitpicking little things, but my stance on the broad aspects of the show is very positive.\\n\\n\r\nOverall- 6/10\\n\\n\r\nTokyo Ghoul failed to accomplish what it set out to do as an anime. Despite this, it was fun to watch and as a weekly show it certainly did not waste my time.\\n\\n\r\nIf your question while reading my review is \"Should I watch this show?\", my answer is yes. However, do not go in with high expectations, and if you want a better representation of what this story and world stands for, you should go read the manga.",

Now there an Anime adaptation coming up in summer of 2014. Tokyo Ghoul is like read the F***ing manga first; before, watching the series, cause either you don't have to but you won't understand it at all (kinda). It a Dark Fantasy, Psychological Horror that a seinen genre for grown men's at least it mature and not immature.\r\nPlot- 6.59/10 (It likewicked city (references)! but not that great, Ghouls vs. Humans to build up society on the timeline it fine but a major characters only have the focused on lack of ability to make decision if your half human or half ghoul during the events on the plot not satisfying)\\n\r\nIntroduction: 7/10\\n\r\nConflict: 8/10\\n\r\nPacing: 6.59/10\\n\\n\r\nArt- 8/10 ( It really visual, great detail.

I'll like how she an anti-hero she my kill bad ghouls, but humans for the act greater of kind of ghoul society)\\n\r\n Development: 6.59/10\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment- 9/10 ( I really! really enjoy it! From the start it very awesome, The middle of it quite fine, to the end it gone from Shockley brutal though WTF!) It not the best anime, it not the greatest, it just good 75% GOOD!\\n\\n",

Set in tokyo's 20th ward, Nerima, Ken Kaneki, a mere average individual, has his life changed exponentially. What first began as a dream date with the girl he admired turned into something beyond he could believe would happen.\r\nAs a huge fan ofthe manga, I was slightly disappointed in the potential that was lost in this anime. Of course the limit of 12 episodes guarantees that not all content would be implemented, but factors such as Kaneki's extreme training underground and the reason he doesn't see others in his family. If one hasn't started either, I recommend the anime first then the manga so no disappointment is had.",

            "content": "Tokyo Ghoul is this season's guilty pleasure anime. I remember when I saw the first episode; \"This is going to be a lot of fun\" and it did, in some ways. I am torn in to give it a rating, it definitely deserves more than 7 but it has too many flaws to be an 8. If I could use a decimal place it'd definitely be a 7.8 \r\n-Minor Spoiler Alert-  \r\nTokyo Ghoul focuses on the Kaneki Ken a human who is artificially made into a ghoul, a humanoid who devours on humans. Unlike it's manga counterpart which is more like an ensemble ofdifferent characters focused equally. Anime follows a different perspective, it revolves mainly around the struggles of Kaneki Ken rather than involving much of the awesome side characters. \\n\\n\r\nBefore I go on to justify my opinion, I want to make a note on how beautiful the series's soundtrack is. The theme, the in-anime music, the ending song they all blend well with the series. Another great thing about the anime is it's art, though not extraordinary, it is beautifully drawn. Ironically anime's major disappointment also comes from the art, it is heavily censored that just kills the mood. \\n\\n\r\nAs I have said before, Tokyo Ghoul anime unlike manga follows a fast pace; It might be a good thing for some but some bad decisions follows. Anime skips a lot of character development such as Rize's back story and all together never goes in to explain much about wards or other exclusive words which are extensively used. \\n\\n\r\nNow to the part where I want to justify all the anime/manga differences: \\n\\n\r\nIn my opinion hate surrounding the anime is unjustified and vague, if you have read the manga you will know that even though anime is skimmed of much of its glory from its parent material; this was the only way to make a great story like Tokyo Ghoul feel good to general anime viewers who are not patient enough for slow plot development. For example, refer to the Chapter 61 of manga, which is the part where Kaneki gets tortured, read it a bit you will find how not only different the manga is not just in the feel but also the story and narration. One other instance would be when Touka gets called 'beautiful' the emotions delivered in the anime though subtle are effective unlike the manga which feels rather dull on that department. Kaneki's battle with Yamori, I still can't believe how fantastically they pulled it out unlike manga which felt a bit dry and not 'epic' at all.    \\n\\n\r\nNonetheless, read the manga or the anime.

Kaneki, the protagonist of the show was pretty much a fragile character with no real combat skills getting his ass handed too or crying every other episode. I know it was all for the build up for the final episode where he finally snaps, but it shouldn't take that long, its very time consuming. But dont get me wrong, the12th episode was epic, I am stoked and expect great things from the second half of the season. More fights, more gore, and morefeels, things such as that. I like the idea of the storyline as well as the artwork, im sure the manga is pretty epic and more in-depth than how the anime has been but still definitely worth the watch!",

            "content": "SPOILERS ALERT:\r\nAh, the summer of 2014. The spawn of several great, mediocre and well, underachieving anime. And Tokyo Ghoul is no exception.\r\nStory: 7\r\nTokyo Ghoul overall, has a pretty good story. It's quite original, although the sight of eating devouring people is quite old. The story does eventually get its points, etc. The story in ITSELF isn't cringe-worthy, and I enjoyed the concept of living in a society with creatures disguised as humans devouring the very species we are. The only exception I have is that do the ghouls only live in Japan? I mean, why does every single thing happen in Japan? What about therest of the world? Don't they not react to this type of situation when they KNOW there are intelligent creatures out there, eating people. Shouldn't they research them instead of killing them with suitcases disguised as weapons? Besides that, good story.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9\\n\r\nThe art in itself is very nice. Studio Pierrot is an experienced animation studio, having created the works of Naruto and Bleach. And overall, I had high expectations for the animation and it didn't fail to deliver.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 7\\n\r\nThe soundtrack for Tokyo Ghoul wasn't anything special. There was no OST that really stood out for me, and the opening and ending songs wasn't something I entirely enjoyed. I had high expectations for the OP song when I heard the band that sang the Psycho-Pass OP song was going to this one, but unfortunately, it didn't really catch my attention.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 4\\n\r\nOoooh boy, where do I begin? This is, simply point out, the WORST aspect of this entire scrap-pile of an anime. Ken Kaneki, your average pussy-boy for the 12 episodes. I have read the manga and I know he starts out as a wimp, but I had REALLY hoped that they would get Kaneki to shapen up by like.. The 8th episode. That didn't happen. What even DISAPPOINTED ME FURTHER was that the anime was only 12 fucking episodes long. I mean, the manga ended a few days ago, so you could do us all a favor and make another 12 episodes. But no, on the last episode you have Kaneki turn from a big wimp to some apparent badass who could beat the shit out of Jason because of some extensive torture (math). I mean speaking realistically, I think I'd just cry even more. But I don't know, shit happens. Touka Kirishima is just one of those stereotypical female leads that just loves to use her fists instead of her head. And whatever happened to that guy who loves to sniff Kaneki's fucking bloody hanky? Oh, he tries to kill Kaneki once but now he's apparently working with him in order to secretly devour him one day. In a nutshell, the characters suck.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 6\\n\r\nI personally didn't enjoy this anime too much. I had high expectations for this anime, I really did. I was really excited when it came out, but it more or less a roller-coaster ride that only slowly went downhill from the first to last episode. Maybe you'll have a better time watching it than me, but I personally didn't find it TOO great\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7\\n\r\nEven with all the flack and criticism I've been giving this anime, it's one of the ones that in itself stood out and was one of the better ones of the Summer 2014 anime roster list. I can name a bunch of anime much, much better than this, but in itself, it wasn't too bad. I might have rated it higher if it was 24-25 episodes, but season 2 hasn't been confirmed yet, so I can't for sure right now. If you like colors (specifically red and black), watch this anime.",

If you like zombies, you'll like Tokyo Ghoul. In my personal opinion, \"ghouls\" in this anime are a mix of the two, which surprisingly, turned out to be a cool and unique concept.  \r\nStory: I started watching the anime two days ago, and I finished it today. Going into it, I didn't know much aside that it may be \"zombie-like\" and that it is a very popular anime of this season. The story andplot are fast-paced, and there is consistent action throughout each and every episode. As most of the supernatural concepts used in the anime are not something completely new and original, I'm giving the story an 8, but that doesn't mean the show itself isn't great, because, it is for what it is- violent and fun.\\n\\n\r\nArt: The art in this anime is an 8. It's \"up to date\" and doesn't look like it was made more than 5 years ago, but the character designs are overall fairly simple in my opinion. This however, is not necessarily a bad thing, because it makes all the interesting supernatural elements stand out more. :) The main character is likable because he is so dull and ordinary when starting out, but then, well, exciting plot happens~ Anyway, despite not being the most amazing art out there, it definitely has its moments especially in the fight scenes.\\n\\n\r\nSound: I was thinking around a 7.5, so I gave it an 8. The sound is good, and the op and ed are pretty good. but nothing outstanding really popped out at me. All the appropriate action scene music sequences are there when they are supposed to be, though. Overall very good sound no major complaints, but again, nothing amazing, either.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: The characters are what I really like about this anime.  Despite there only being 12 episodes, I feel there was a lot of character development. :) There are also a lot of characters, so I would say it was probably quite difficult to have that without making the anime seem like, \"Oh this ep was all character development and no action.\" It never felt like that; there was always a good mix of the two.  \\n\\n\r\nOverall, I really enjoyed this anime and would recommend it to supernatural and action anime fans.  There are also some funny moments and plenty of dark humor if you're into that as well.  \\n\\n",

Every single shot was essential. Not a single second was wasted on a character that will not further the plot, irrespective of how strong they were.\r\nAnd the other important thing, that I'm going to specifically point out and appreciate in this anime, is it's focus. There is no tension because of an implied romance (doesn't mean that there isn't any). No entire episodes wasted on the backstory of some side character. Despite this, the viewers get a pretty decent ideaof what each character is about, and what they value. \\n\\n\r\nAnd that ending, despite it leaving the story hanging, was so beautifully done. Two words. Character growth.\\n\\n\r\nAmazing characters, a well-written story, spot-on pacing, why is this not a 10? What does this anime lack that the anime that I have given a 10 to (like Oregairu, Clannad AS, HunterxHunter) have? You cannot really put a finger on it can you? It comes down to personal preference I suppose.\\n\\n\r\nAnyway, the finale gave us this wonderful quote, \"It may seem like you're choosing both, but, really, you're forsaking both\".

            "content": "I've always been interested in Tokyo Ghoul. It's something that I've been hearing from my friend who is a huge fan of it, and for a while I've been thinking about giving it a shot. I picked up the first volume of the manga when I was at MomoCon last year, but never had the time to read it. I then picked up the first season last month after Christmas after seeing it on sale. A month later and here we are. So how is Tokyo Ghoul: The Anime? Apparently its been the talk of the town back in 2014 but forgotten after that. Whathappened?\\n\\n\r\nLet's go to the beginning. I will admit, I was liking the anime at first. The action and story got me genuinely hooked into it. I was actually having a good time with it. True the characters didn't really click to me than I thought they would (minus Touka best goth gf don't @ me), but at least I was enjoying with it. Well...the first half at least.\\n\\n\r\nThen after that, the second half just takes a tumble out of nowhere and then the problems start to show. I've heard many people say that the problem with the anime is how they crammed all 60 chapters of the manga into a short 12 episode anime. And they're right sadly. This felt rather rushed with its story. Even coming from some who hasn't read a lot of the manga, it obviously shows. The pacing goes out of nowhere around the latter half of the show, making the flow of the plot feel out of focus. I think the real kicker is the final episode. Don't get me wrong, the episode had some gruesome but good moments as well. But once the episode ended, I literally said \"That's it?\" It's obvious its just set up for the sequel and it did a poor job at doing it.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is good, I will give them that. From the dark and gloomy backgrounds to the design of the ghouls fit the tone pretty well. Tokyo Ghoul is a dark anime and it works well in this scenario. The soundtrack is possibly the best part of the show. Much like with others, I enjoyed the OP and credits song. But I also liked the shows score as well in the episodes. Much like with the animation, it fits the show well. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters though...eh. Minus Touka and I guess Juuzou, I didn't really care a whole lot for the characters. Including Kaneki. Either because we didn't get a lot of time to focus on them or I just lost interest due to how, well, rushed the character development were handled.\\n\\n\r\nAnd that's the word to describe the first season of Tokyo Ghoul. It felt rushed. Like it had a deadline to get out so it can still maintain its hype. But hype can kill something as well. It's not a terrible anime, but it is rather disappointing to say the least.  It's weak at certain points, but the action makes up for it. Sadly, it doesn't make up that much and all we got was a decent, but disappointing, anime. Will \u221aA improve on the problems I had with this season? Only time will tell. And honestly, I'm probably going to enter it with some low expectations.",

MAYBE IT'S BECAUSE THEY CRAMMED 60 CHAPTERS IN 12 EPISODES??? I hate to bring the manga into a review, but we couldn't just let that pass. Godammit Studio Pierrot.\r\nArt (7) : The art is really beauytiful, realistic and all. However kids, rememmber, it's Studio Pierrot we're talking about. Kagunes that look like plastic, stupid censoring (I couldn't stand seeing those damn blurs and black bars. It seems like a joke, and I really wish it was. \r\nSound (10) : TheOP is a masterpiece and the SFX is really well done. The screams are agonizing but not obnoxious. There's not really much to say.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter (5) : The show fails epicly when it comes to developing characters, mostly because Pierrot decided to fuck fans and give  12 EPs to develop a bunch of characters. A big bunch. (PS: 20 ~ 30 episodes would be enough for the first part)\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (8) : One of the biggest pros of the show. Well-paced battles, really effective cliffhangers and the OST just nails it. Really gets you going and that's why most fanboys and fangirls exist.\\n\\n\r\nOverall (6) : Overal, could've been much better. Make it longer, take out censoring, develop characters properly and that's it.\\n\\n\r\nMoral of the story: Fuck Pierrot",

Not even specifically about character development. I want to talk about details. \r\nIn this anime there will be a surprising amount of occasions a detail about a situation is completely skipped and a character just wakes up the next day as if the events from the previous episodes never happened.\r\nSo many ghouls get effectively beaten to death and stabbed inthe heart, yet it's never shown if they die or not, its never explained if they have regenerative abilities or not, except for a single side comment made in the final episode. Then you see that ghoul alive 3 episodes later with NO explanation at all.\\n\\n\r\nThere are 2 occasions where life and death enemies in one episode are effectively friends by the next episode and no time or character development is put into showing  the transition of that relationship, or even really justifying why it should happen. No one forgives that easily.\\n\\n\r\nThey never explain what a ward is, yet spend the whole series talking about them. Some weird government war is initiated in the last 2 episodes with no explanation as to why. Some trap pickpocket appears on a motorcycle with no explanation or exposition. The MC's teammates trying to save him don't even turn up in the final episode. It's just one big cliffhanger for the next season which because it was so bad I don't even want to watch now.\\n\\n\\n\r\nAnd then they try to pull some moral lesson shit at the end about MC's guilt related mommy issues or something.\\n",

            "content": "Wow, do I regret not finishing this anime sooner.  When Tokyo Ghoul first started, I was intrigued by the plot, and surprised by the level of gore.  It was interesting to watch Ken struggle with his new found Ghoulish nature.  It wasn't the strongest of anime starts, but it was good enough to keep me watching.  That is, until I got to the \"Gourmet\" arc and I totally lost interest.  The Gourmet is such an irritating and over-the-top villain, one of those flamboyant homosexuals that irritate both straight and gay people.  His ridiculous antics and mannerisms just kind ofturned me off big time and made me lose interest as the anime started to feel more cartoonish than like an anime.\\n\\n\r\nI powered through those ridiculous episodes, and was willing to go forward, but then when I was hit with a flashback episode right after that, with how Amou and Mado met, that was all she wrote and I tapped out and only just returned now after four years.  Man, do I regret that.  Because after the MC meets Jason, well, the anime takes on a much more intense vibe.  I feel safe to say that, that is the most insane way to shift a character from a sniveling irritant to a beast, I've ever seen in anime.  \\n\\n\r\nThe final episode is how you finish off a season correctly.  Too many animes today choose a tepid finish to angle for a second season.  They don't really blow your mind.  The end of this season was the exact opposite.  It's not something I'll ever forget.  \\n\\n\r\nHowever, that doesn't mean that one can gloss over the flaws of this anime, just because the final episode was the bomb.  There's a large cast, but half of the characters feel undefined, somewhat empty, with the exception of Touka and Amon.    The other half are way over the top, like Jason, Shuu (The Gourmet) and Rico.  This blend of \"meh\" characters with the blend of explosive ones, kind of messed with the flow of the anime.  It made it feel somewhat less realistic than it should have.  \\n\\n\r\nThere were also logic gaps in the anime, but I won't go into that too much so as not to spoil.  But, a huge issue was that they just kind of rushed into the Aogiri Three storyline out of nowhere.  Just, suddenly, the \"organized movements\" mentioned early in the anime are pushed to the back, until boom, we're suddenly at war.  And during this war, Ken is being created over a course of what seems like days and weeks, but apparently happened in just a few hours?  I don't really know, the pacing was off.   \\n\\n\r\nBut, as I already mentioned, the episodes with Shuu were just kind of a momentum killer.  That was my biggest problem with the anime.  Still, the ending has me going immediately into season 2.  The ending was truly nuts.  \\n\\n\r\nStory: 7\\n\r\nArt: 8\\n\r\nSound: 10\\n\r\nCharacter: 6\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8\\n\r\nOverall: 8",

            "content": "WARNING: CONTAINS SPOILERS!!!\r\nWhen I decided to watch this (three days ago), I had not seen a psychological anime in a very long time. I think the last time I saw one was before I'd even heard of MyAnimeList. The first ten episodes of the anime were fantastic. The characters were well-developed, the art and voice acting were great, the story was original, but then Kaneki got kidnapped. By this time, I had thought this anime wasn't that serious in its psychological-ness. Sure there are some parts where some people might find it mindblowingly psychological, but I didn't.\r\nSo Kaneki gets taken, I freak out when Banjouand the other two are saying they'll get him out. I freak out more when Touka lets Tsukiyama help get him back and then it goes back to Kaneki and Rize and his hair is white and I'm like, \"So the guy in the opening was Kaneki\". I like died when he got out because he was in a totally different mindset and stuff. Don't get me wrong, I understand why, and I think it makes a lot more sense than a ton of other shows I've seen, but I just absolutely hated the ending. It made me dislike Rize more and it changed how I felt about Kaneki.\\n\r\nAnd the worst part of the ending was that it left me feeling really incomplete. I plan to watch the second season, but at this point I have no idea what happened to Touka, Hinami, the manager and all the others. Not to mention that I'm reluctant to watch it because the Kaneki in the last few minutes of episode 12 reminded me too much of Accelerator from A Certain Scientific Railgun and A Certain Magical Index (Toaru Kagaku no Railgun S and Toaru Majutsu no Index).\\n\r\nBut overall, Tokyo Ghoul was a great anime, and a horribly good way to rethink how I felt about psychological anime.",

They read the manga. Then what happens once they read the manga? They realise that there is a lot of things that are different. Which is sad. When you adapt something, you should at least make it some what close to home. Not kick the ball to North America. Although what is done is done and the opinions have to be said. Lets go on Tokyo Ghoul, not Ghouls.\r\nStory 6/10 In all seriousness itwas a good psychological story, with some stuff going good. Although if you look pass the psychological stuff, what you have is a MC that is useless, flashy colours and people die in this anime! Who would've known? Has the word Ghoul in it, its expected. \\n\\n\r\nArt 8/10 The art looks decent, but its at best in battle. Also the psychological moments, because the art is hella good at those times. Then you see flashy colours which is a good thing.\\n\\n\r\nSound 7/10 Worthy mention the opening is epic in this one, you can feel the umph in it. No seriously you can. The music in anime is kinda meh, I really couldn't tell if there was music in the background to be honest because I kept seeing flashy colours. Although I did hear some of the music in the background and I gotta say its pretty good.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters 6/10 I gotta say, the MC is really unbearable for me. He's useless absolutely useless. Unless its about books, the other characters actually pick up his slack a little because they are quite useful. Now depending who you are looking at and why it can change you view on things. If you look at Nishijo you will feel sad, if your looking at Tohka you will feel that you need to keep close to your parents. If you look at MC for some odd reason, then I don't even know what you would feel. Maybe be boss and no overworking in life? \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 8/10 I gotta say, it was pretty enjoyable at times even if the MC was useless as hell.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 6/10 Its not the best, but it is good to show an average joe. They will probably like it and they may not see the faults. You might not know its pretty good if your just watching it for fun.",

Not the manga. \r\n Do I believe Tokyo Ghoul is worthy of your time? \r\nUnequivocally, yes I do.\r\nStory - This is a story that has been told in many anime before. I would, in fact, say it is THE story in action anime. Weak main character is 'special' in some way, and through training and conditioning becomes the hero that saves the town/country/universe. Tokyo Ghoul tells this story, but does it in such a way that it feels fresh. Almost like a deconstruction of the genre. The story unfolds with surprising (to meanyway) care and nuance. This is a world that feels like it is teetering on the brink of disaster, and one wrong move will tip the scales. I particularly liked the villains. A hero is only as strong as his opposition, and here the opposition is worthy. \\n\\n\r\nArt - The battles are spread throughout the series and are the flashiest element. They do not disappoint. Character design is spot-on as well, with each character's look complementing their personality and role in the story. \\n\\n\r\nSound - Music is perhaps my least favorite aspect, but its not terrible by any means. It just doesn't stand out the way some other series musical score does. I will mention the OP and ED's are excellent. Voice acting is quite good. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter - Any one of them taken individually isn't going to blow your mind, but the way they are handled. The way the fight scenes are properly motivated by character needs and desires. The character arcs. The way the antagonists mirror and are the opposite of the heroes. The relationships that develop over time. The author of this story clearly took tremendous care with crafting his characters, and it shows.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - This, at times, wasn't an easy show to watch: it is incredibly violent and gory. Especially the final arc. But it was never less than absorbing and entertaining. This show will make you realize why THIS story is such a cornerstone of action anime. If you go into it like I did - knowing nothing about it, I find it hard to imagine you will disappointed. \\n\\n\r\n10/10",

It is literally intense about every episode which i really like. I wish there could have been more then 12 episodes but it is confirmed there will be a season 2 to this anime so I'm pretty excited about that. This anime is basically about Ghouls which are these human looking monsters who basically feed on human flesh to survive. I really have nothing to complain about this anime besides how short is actually is the artwork is on key and sois the actual story I'm not too big into a bunch of gory action type anime but the last couple I have watched have been very great i recommend this to any anime lover it was a great entertaining series and i literally couldn't stop watching!",

I gave it 7 because while there are very great action scenes that it was kind of slow at moments, and the censors get out of control and break the immersion. I really love the intense emotion in the characters voices that I haven't really seen in any other anime, For exampe     ( S P O I L E R     A L E R T  )          \r\nWhen Kaneki is being tortured and you can really hear how closehe is to insanity. Well, I'd say this is my favorite anime right now, and you should definitely give this anime a try. While it depends on if you like action or horror anime. However, ( this might just be my case ) I mostly watch slice of life comedy anime and yet this is my favorite anime and it really keeps you on the edge of your seat  \\n\\n",

            "content": "Now, I give Tokyo Ghoul an 8, yet it is a very weak 8 due to some glaring issues with pacing and the characters. Now, let me start off by saying that I have not read the manga and I did enjoy the show to a degree.  \r\nLet's start with the good of the show. Aside from censorship, the art is very nice with interesting visuals and decent animation. I have no complaints about the music, not my favorite, but not bad. The story is pretty engaging and keeps you interested. \r\nNow, onto the bad and why I consider the show a weak 8at best. The pacing in this show is really bad. some things you just have to accept that they happened without them actually being shown, like Kaneki's fighting training. I believe that they show him training once, during which he doesn't exactly do well, and then later, he remarks how his fighting training has really helped. So you just assume that he has been training, without actually seeing it. Since everything happens pretty quickly, you never really gain any attachment to the vast majority of the characters. Most of which get very little backstory, if any, and are easy to forget. Finally the ending is basically saying \"now wait for season two\", The main fight in the end takes only a few minutes, due to some pacing issues in the last episode, but this time, they drew everything out in the last episode and leave no time for conclusion and rush the moment you were waiting for.  \\n\\n\r\nIf the show was, say, 24 episodes, they could have avoided these issues and  my grade and overall feel on the show would be better. Take the issues with a grain of salt and enjoy what's there, which kept my grade at an 8, although a very weak one at that. Just have to sit back and wait for a second season for (hopefully) a conclusion.",

            "content": "Tokyo Ghoul seems to divide people into two groups. One of them saying \"season one was ok, but the second season was so bad\" and then the other group \"hey, I'm quite a fan of that, both were pretty cool\".\r\nI guess that both groups have their own rights, and I do respect both sides. Although in this review, I'm going to talk about this series from the side I've chosen. Let me say that loud and clear. I'm quite a fan of that, I think it's a good series with a magnificent plot, a marvelous problem which I would discuss with my friends, and thinkabout even now, not knowing what is the answer.\\n\r\nYou might be curious what that discussion might be about.\\n\r\nAnd well, it's essentially about choosing one side, because you cannot solve this problem by a consensus. \\n\r\nAnd yes that is the problem, being able to surrender on something, being able to survive, being able to live.\\n\r\nAfter watching this you might ask yourself, whether what you saw is fair or not.\\n\r\nYou might ask yourself if what happened is humanly right.\\n\r\nYou might ask yourself, what you would do, what would your behavior be like.\\n\r\nTest yourself, ask yourself. What do you feel.\\n\\n\r\nSCORES:\\n\r\nSTORYLINE:\\n\r\nIt is very good. Nicely written.\\n\r\nHere we find ourselves in Tokyo. Modern Tokyo to be exact. Humanity faces a problem, that problem is called ghouls. These although, having the looks of a human, are actually predators to humans. They would attack people to devour them afterwards, that's how they eat, that's how they live, and that's the only way they can survive.\\n\r\nYou would think. \"Hey that is really bad, they all should just die! They kill people, and then eat them!\"\\n\r\nBut the question that will be asked is.\\n\r\nWhat are ghouls supposed to do?\\n\\n\r\nVIBE:\\n\r\nEssentially it's a horror anime, but you do know that it is not scary, there's not a lot of anime horrors that would scare you. It's more of a psychological freakout than anything else.\\n\r\nBut that is good, it's better than a simple spook, because it makes you think about stuff.\\n\r\nOf course, there is gore everywhere, you can imagine that just from the idea of somebody eating someone. But it's quality gore, they won't exaggerate with blood and body parts flying around, it's simply quality.\\n\r\nI do like it's vibe, it's just making you uneasy, because you experience things from opposite points of view, and from that you get doubts. You start thinking, it makes you uneasy, you see that they are at unease too. It's good, it will keep you going through the whole thing.\\n\r\nIt also changes, the vibe changes. I cannot judge if it changes for the better, but it is simply different, I could say, more uneasy.\\n\\n\r\nART STYLE:\\n\r\nDamn it's pretty, it's damn pretty. You can obviously see that they wanted to make it old-school style, especially the investigators, big guys, big muscles, small heads, small eyes. It works well for the vibe.\\n\r\nAnimation quality is awesome, especially in fights, you could imagine that from the people that made Bleach and Naruto, they surely know what they are doing. \\n\r\nThere's is nothing in the art style that would make you mad, or unsatisfied. I like the looks of it, it's quality drawing.\\n\\n\r\nMUSIC/VOICEACTING:\\n\r\nI've been listening to opening from that anime for a couple of weeks now, and I can't get enough of it. Acoustic version of it, is even better.\\n\r\nI simply love this soundtrack. Just because you can hear lots of violin there, that is what I simply love. If I could marry violin, I would do it!\\n\\n\r\nCONCLUSION:\\n\r\nI simply think that this is a anime without mistakes. They didn't make any mistakes, at least I couldn't find them. To be honest with you, while turning on the first episode on my PC, I was very pessimistic. I knew it was very popular and often very popular animes are bad. I was surprised, and I am happy to be surprised.\\n\r\nI do think it's not for everybody, but it's a anime to watch. There's a lot to feel, and a lot to experience, if you are able to understand it. Some people might have problems with understanding it, or they might just simply don't like it. I heard people saying that it's \"disappointing\". \\n\r\nI do not agree with them.\\n\\n\r\nVideo Review: https://youtu.be/IALCIk1chco",

If I am wrong, Just message me to correct me.\r\nThe story of the show is a masterpiece no doubt about it. The way the characters just tie together in one huge web is amazing. I also love the way they show the Doves as more than just an enemy they have to defeat, as real people with friends and family. My problem with this is that they didn't show this concept earlier in the show. They make you grow all this hatred for themlike when--\\n\\n\r\nSPOILER ALERT\\n\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------they killed the little girl's (I forgot her name, sorry) okasan right in front of her, then show that they have friends and family so we could feel compassionate about them a few episodes later. I feel like that's a huge FUCK YOU to the audience. But other than that the story is amazing.\\n\\n\r\nArt and drawing style in this anime are beautiful and unique. It really shows the emotion and intensity of the characters. Sadly that is all I could say about the animation.\\n\\n\r\nMusic is.... Just... Spectacular. Both themes for ending and intro are just energetic and match the shows mood perfectly. I would pick no other songs for it at all.\\n\\n\r\nThis is a show that you could binge watch and NEVER get bored. You'll never get a dull moment when watching it. It's action scenes are graphic and that's the way I like. And the eating scenes are, again, graphic just the way I love it.The show is NOT for the weak of stomach.\\n\\n\r\nOverall this show deserves a perfect score. This show is definitely something\\n\r\nyou should watch before January 9th, which is the day season two comes out. That's all I have for this review and I'll see you guys later.",

            "content": "Tokyo Ghoul is maybe not your type of horror anime that composed of pure gore, torture and violence. I kinda reminds this anime that I watched before, it was \"Parasyte: The Maxim\" where Parasites are at the very top of the food chain, and the humans are below of it. Same way here on Tokyo Ghoul where the Ghouls are the top where the humans are at the bottom. Except not anyone likes to eat human flesh, there are also times that Ghouls can eat other ghouls as well. In the world where Ghouls were living, either anyone can be an enemy, a supportive friend,or anyone can be a cannibal, psychopathic ghoul who likes to taste of their own kin. Whether it's a Ghoul eats other ghoul, or a hybrid eats another ghoul.\\n\\n\r\nTokyo Ghoul, I should say, is one of the darkest, story I've ever encountered since Death Note and Parasyte: The Maxim. It is a story full of vengeance, betrayal against of your own family member, loss of your love ones, the pain and suffering, philosophically questioning who and what you really are, the consequences your going to face if humans treated you in a wrong way, and wondering which is the real pests in the world, the humans or the ghouls.\\n\\n\r\nSad to say, from what I've saw, it looks like the story is kind of unfinished in terms of development (from what I believe though, because Studio Pierrot is known for developing the anime \"Naruto\", I guess that's the reason why the 1st season here is a bit complicated). Also, I don't feel like I'm going to watch the sequel of this season due to the negative feedback amongst the MAL community. But, from my point of perspective, I'd say it is a very decent anime that you should try for. If you like anything dark themed, then it is highly recommended to watch this anime, you will not be disappointed.",

            "content": "Tokyo Ghoul took the anime world by storm in 2014 and received large praise. While I think this anime is a tad overrated, I still found a large amount of enjoyment in watching this anime. What I liked about this anime was first off, the story, I enjoyed the story heavily it was dark interesting and the setting and atmosphere were very good. The animation as very good as well though the censoring was a bit bothersome at times. The music was solid and the opening theme,Unravel by TK is possibly one of the greatest anime opening themes I've ever heard.However I had a coupleof problems with this anime, one is the characters. Now I liked the characters but I felt that some of them just felt one dimensional, notable examples being our main protagonist. The characters weren't bad or unrelataable by any means,I just wish they had a little more substance. Though I did enjoy the characters of Nishki and Hinami in particular. Another problem is the aforementioned censorship, I know you can find uncensored versions but usually you'll be watching the censored version and it will feel distracting at certain points. And finally I would have liked a bit more quality action scenes. Like some were good and others were average. In conclusion Tokyo ghoul is a fun,dark anime that is definitely worth watching despite my gripes with it.",

            "content": "STORY:\r\nOut of all the vampire/Ghoul animes I have watched, sadly this one was the least of my favorites. The story doesn't seem very interesting or intense because it isn't original and its confusing. It seems like they are trying to make you feel sympathy for the ghouls but they don't portray them as great people. Like Shiki, it somewhat has the idea of showing \"who is really the bad guy,\" or \"is anyone really bad?\" But in this anime it is very ONE SIDED. It only shows the point of view of Ghouls, which seems weird because Kaneki was human but doesnt show any sympathyfor humans. It only makes it seem like ghouls are the nice innocent ones who does nothing wrong even though they murder people. The ghouls seem to not give a crap that they have to eat human at all so its hard to feel sympathy for something that doesnt seem like they are forced to do it or like they have no choice. It would be great if they also should how humans feel when they are preyed upon or elaborate on how Kaneki, who was once human, has to eat his own kind because then it really hypes up the conflict and would really get you thinking.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER:\\n\r\nHonestly, the main character seems very pathetic. He relies on people to tell him what to do all the time and rarely thinks and acts for himself in my opinion. It deosnt really make sense that he is half human and ghoul because he has most of the characteristics of a ghoul.  He doesnt even at least think like a human because he feels more sympathy for the ghouls and easily go to their side. He lacks the morals of a human. The other characters dont seem that interesting nor important because it seems that the anime doesnt build up on them.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT:\\n\r\nI was honestly bored with the story.  It seems like most of the episodes is about them trying or thinking about eating. It seems like that is all the story talks about, them eating but not really the theme of \"who really is the bad guy,\" like people say it is. It just seems a bit like the story ripped off of Shiki a little. Im not trying to say that they are really similar because they arent really. This story lacks suspense and mystery even though it falls under the category of mystery sometimes. The main character quickly got into the ghouls side without needing to be convinced even though he spent most of his life as a human, so viewers cant really question which side he will be on.\\n\\n\r\nART:\\n\r\nThis anime's art isnt anything unique but it also isnt bad, its just okay. I have seen lots of fan art and stuff with Kaneki in a mask and it looks really cool but the anime's art doesnt have that coolness. From the first episode, I was thinking that the animation would be great like every other over hyped anime but over time it didnt seem that spectacular. The end of the first episode animation was good though. Some their reactions freezes in time and it makes the scenes look awkward.\\n\\n\r\nOverall this anime just seemed over hype. If you are looking for a good vampire anime with action I suggest you watch Hellsing(or hellsing ultimate)",

Basically my reaction to every fight is hell yeah that was awesome and all the weapons and kagunes (the ghouls powers) look awesome\\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\r\nthe sound isn't bad it just isn't great the intro is food and suits the show but again the sound doesn't fell overly bad or overly special\\n\\n\r\nCharacter \\n\r\nSo to preface every no character is black or white they are all morally grey and I love that but a lot of people might hate that. There are a lot of good well thought out and interesting character but there are also so a few character that fell very mundane and boring but that is mainly due to a lack of character development of backstory and a lot don't have they're backstory explain until season 2 \\n\\n\r\nOverall 9/10\\n\r\nI throughly enjoy Tokyo ghoul I think it is all most perfect and just needs to have more character development and backstory sooner but beside that everything is perfect from the action to the darkness and gore so If you like action, philosophy, gore or just generally dark shows this is for you and to anyone less I recommend it\\n\\n",

            "content": "So this is my first review, so keep that in mind. Also keep in mind that just because I enjoyed it, doesn't mean that it was perfect. \r\nWhat first caught my eye in Tokyo Ghoul was the dark setting it looked to have, but ultimately the setting was more there to sugar coat the story than to actual establish a dark atmosphere. While Tokyo was displayed to have ghouls living and hiding within the city, yet the residents leave their houses at night, the time most ghouls feed, and are not even skeptical of their own neighbors. \r\nThe ghouls seemed like the perfect monster togive fear to humanity and the best enemy I would want to see humans fight against, yet we only see them as human looking monsters that wanted to live with their food in harmony. The most normal acting characters were actual some of the most dangerous ghouls the show had known.\\n\\n\r\nIgnoring the censorship, the fights were well done and nicely executed. I say nicely and not perfectly simply because no matter what anime, there is always more talking than fighting.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters were pretty easy to read for the most part. Each one fell into a different arc-type making it easy to tell what would happen when one character interacted with another. While this isn't exactly a bad thing, it did make predicting the future of the show too easy for me.\\n\\n\r\nAll together, this anime was a good watch. Whether or mot is was a good anime is debatable, but it's not my place to say. Instead, I'll just say that this was a good watch and worth the time I invested into it.",
