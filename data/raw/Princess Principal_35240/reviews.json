            "content": "Princess Principal a title that could mislead any viewer. First, you could think that the show is about a school and girls. Then you could start considering any slice of life plot and girls related storytelling and few moments about spying. I must say, it is wrong. \r\nStory: 8/10\r\nPrincess Principal has a very creative plot with an impressive storytelling that could surprise a lot of spectators. The story deals with espionage in a divided nation, nothing to do with a slice of life plot. The spies are young girls that use their student status as a cover. During the day, they are typical students andwhen the duty calls they transform into dangerous and very skilled spies with particular abilities.  \\n\\n\r\nOne of the possible issues found in the forums and some reviews is the lack of a plot sequence that changes between some episodes. I want to say that the storytelling focuses on \"file cases\" so each episode is a different mission and the principal idea (espionage) remains. This method helps with the pacing because the story is always advancing and changing. Also, the show doesn't need a sequence to connect the story. Furthermore, each episode keeps adding information to the main arc, and the characters background. I consider that constant additions a plus. \\n\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9/10\\n\r\nThe art is \"steampunk.\" It is stunning and formidable that goes well with the color palette, the mechanical design, and the character's concept. You can notice that some areas don't have the standard lighting because they like to create a dark ambient. Also, the art helps a lot with the storytelling, timeline, and the possible fantastic ideas such us the use of the mineral \"Cavorite.\" For experience, someone could find the steampunk art weird or not attractive. However, it isn't a reason to drop the anime. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 8/10\\n\r\nThe sound is great. They elaborated a complex sound mix with a delightful soundtrack. The sound of each action sequence adds emotion to the plot and is played at the right time. The songs are good. For me, the OP is excellent, and the ED isn't bad.  \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 8/10 \\n\r\nWe have five main characters. I decided to give them nicknames. Dorothy \"The face,\" Agne \"The liar,\" Beatrice \"The voice,\" Chise \"The stranger,\" and Princess \"The usurper.\" With that original nickname, you can start guessing about their background. \\n\\n\r\nIn more detail, Dorothy is the leader of the group but is the one that enjoys the freedom; she is more the \"sempai\" of all them. \\n\\n\r\nAgne. We don't know when she is lying or telling the truth but is a character that will give up everything for someone or the mission. She has some hidden secrets. \\n\\n\r\nChise has high values for her tradition and displays her unsatisfaction when she isn't considered as a useful part of the group. \\n\\n\r\nBeatrice is the most insecure member of the team, but her skills are convenient on every mission.  \\n\\n\r\nFinally the Princess, she is more an actress but with a defined goal. \\n\\n\r\nFor me, each character is different and not generic. These girls have their problems, a painful past, they have secrets, and they take their own decisions to complete an objective. In other words, the characters have a spy profile that works with the plot.  \\n\\n\r\nSomething I enjoyed is the extra background information given. On each episode, we could have more details about each character. I know that some of the outcomes could be predictable but not all them. Additionally, the characters emotions evolve during the story, and we could see unexpected decisions that indicate a proper background build. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9/10\\n\r\nIn summary, I have few negative aspects about this anime and are insignificant for this review. Each episode left me a good sensation and entertained a lot. I enjoyed this animation. The pacing, the storytelling, the art, the sound blended well and created a show that deserves to be watched and repeated in the future. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9/10\\n\r\nFinally, the character design is stunning. We can't find this art quality (steampunk) in the recent original animations. The sound mix complements each episode.  The story isn't weird and doesn't need a complicated plot to capture our attention. I consider this anime very attractive and unique. For example, the character backgrounds and the file cases weren't repetitive, and the extra additions to background keep the viewers hooked all the time. You should give the first episode a try. You won't be disappointed. Actas and Studio 3Hz did a splendid job. \\n",

            "content": "Princess Principal oddly enough is kinda reminiscent of a popular cartoon, which gained popularity in all of the Western world\u2019s kids\u2019 programmes in one way or another and I\u2019m sure you know which series I mean if you ever watched one episode of both shows. \u201cHere we go again, we\u2019re going on the road, till\u2019 we stop. And then we\u2019ll shop\u201d might be the biggest clue I am giving you here, but if this lyrical masterpiece of an opening theme might still not manage to draw your attention to what I\u2019m talking about, I might just spill the beans right here: Totally Spies. An alreadypretty stupid kids\u2019 show, mainly targeting a female audience with the estimated age of 10-14, gets its \u201canime adaptation\u201d in a now pretty promising setting, leaving loads of potential to set up an intriguing political thriller including the spy-mechanisms unutilized. It fails to pack any sort of punch in this very serious setting, but unlike a kids' show like Totally Spies, its presentation does indicate that Princess Principal does not leave the slightest clue during the entire runtime, that it is even aware of how stupid it actually is, making me consider to put bitchin' Totally Spies as the superior work comparing these two with one another. So, what exactly did go wrong in the story which plays out in the split superpower of Albion, located in Europe and divided into the Commonwealth and the Kingdom of Albion, setting its border right in the city of London?\\n\\n\r\nMinor spoilers, mostly about the first half ahead.\\n\\n\r\nAs the setup itself practically screams \u2018promising\u2019 right into your face regarding the potential a country-conflict like this could have regarding a literal \u201cwar of spies\u201d, it makes it even more disappointing, that it would\u2019ve been shut down by loads of conveniences one after another. It only appears decent on paper, rather than in the actual conversion of it. While we get a big info drop right at the start, explaining how Albion grew to be the powerhouse of Europe now riddled by lots of riots and an actual split of countries in terms of interest and territory in kind of a cool way, it more or less takes a huge backseat to the character conflicts our main team faces during their missions in an episodic fashion. This in itself can be great if executed correctly, but oh boy it sure doesn\u2019t know how to do so, but we\u2019ll get to that aspect later in this review. The core complain I have regarding the matter here is, that it basically betrays the idea we get from episode 1, which might\u2019ve been riddled with inconsistencies in terms of writing writing all over the place (Ange literally silencing a patient by hand and drugging them dressed as a nurse, while the other patients not even trying to say anything about it in an open room, only leading to a hilarious reaction face by the woman lying in bed in vis-\u00e0-vis position) and the core conflict being cookie-cutter at best, it still gave me a somewhat thrilling ride to enjoy. My enjoyment for this probably only issued from some flashy choices in the presentation during the action scenes and a neat colour-palette though, which left the show any way in later episodes.\\n\\n\r\nNagging about the conveniences the team of spies faces in their individual missions, making the facade of this work crumble in almost every episodic conflict the characters face, wouldn't do me any good if I did not offer some more examples, which can be narrowed down to some general ideas on writing-mistakes made during the production. The first general complaint I have is, that the characters in the show are depicted as being in another league of intelligence when they finesse their opposing counterparts as e.g. several guards, but that\u2019s mostly because those are almost always depicted as generally retarded from my point of view. Falling more than 5 times to the likes of a woman with exposed bosom, is just a sign that the writers were too lazy to think of anything else, leading to me not appreciating on how the team does things, but rather to me not being able to wrap my head about how easy their job is in hindsight. That doesn\u2019t only apply to mere guards, core participants in the normally overshadowed political conflict act that way and seem to have no intelligence of their own. I\u2019m aware that this is something a lot of works covering espionage fail to deliver well, but there\u2019s such a thing as \u201cgoing too far\u201d with it for me. On the other side of things, there definitely are characters that know way more about what the spies are planning as they should and get the information the audience is getting too, from whatever source that is, as the show doesn\u2019t bother to explain that. A good example for this is the devotee of the Kingdom of Albion, disguised as a soldier of the Commonwealth, experimenting with neurotoxins and eventually going full-rampage-mode against the company which does the laundry to hide his secret, as his uniform got picked up accidentally against his own will. Where he even should know that they\u2019re doing chemical tests to find him here is beyond my knowledge, as there was nothing or even a hint that this paranoid fellow did know so.\\n\\n\r\nThe second big complaint I harbour towards the work is, that the gadgets of the team and insane fighting capability of our samurai loli just outmatch those of their opponents by a landmile, making thoughts like \u201cwow, they\u2019re not gonna make it for once\u201d practically impossible. There\u2019s one such as having a lipstick with an implemented laser in it or a Swiss Army Shoe (better watch The Naked Gun instead) to give the spies a little advantage, but in Princess Principle we have a \u201cC-Ball\u201d, that gives you power to literally control gravity to your will and a lot of other conveniences, depending on whether direction the plot wants to progress. Additionally, the series has no chill regarding its presentation, which leads it to make a fool out of itself most of the time. Victimization is omnipresent and trying too hard to make you feel engaged (Dorothy\u2019s backstory, Ange\u2019s meeting with the girl on the streets), leading to it trying to hammer the message of \u2018the world is so cruel!!\u2019 laughably hard into your head and failing at virtually every single attempt. Also, following up a supposedly meaningful commentary about political conflicts, basically referencing the Latin quote of \u201chomo homini lupus\u201d, with a casual talk about what name would fit a girly team of spies well during tea-time might not be the best of ideas in terms of presentation:\\n\\n\r\n\u201cThis world isn\u2019t black and white, only black and grey. And the princess is grey. Keep a constant watch on her\u201d. *eerie music in the background*\\n\r\nFollowed up by more precedent matters as \u201clet\u2019s name ourselves team carrot\u201d \u2013 \u201cI don\u2019t like carrots\u201d. Welp, this might really by the espionage-version of K-ON, they even dress the same way during their missions and concerts.\\n\\n\r\nI already highlighted the problems surrounding these main character conflicts during its episodical storytelling, but these conflicts aren\u2019t much to write home about either, ranging from pretty decent (Ange\u2019s and Princess\u2019 relation) to utterly terrible and clich\u00e9 (almost anything else), which gets me even more salty about the fact, that they sacrificed the pretty promising set-up for it. These are mostly ruined by the constant victimization and the black-and-white style they\u2019re presented by, sometimes redeeming itself through its somewhat creative ending, as we did with Dorothy\u2019s conflict of her past. But even though these might\u2019ve been executed pretty well through some evident skill direction-wise, they were by no means unpredictable or either very good from my point of view, as the series tried to hit you with a \u201cplot twist\u201d right into your face, even though all of it could\u2019ve been gathered from the behaviour of the characters during said key moments leading up to the ending. The show mostly doesn\u2019t know how to show emotions without the characters defining themselves as distinctive rage, happiness or sadness at the moment. Also, another thing I can't really wrap my head around is, why the show even bothered to implement the big mental strain Princess faces with the triple amount of work she has to do (serious spy work, school, and royal duties), when missions as the ones she's participating in time-wise shouldn't even be possible in the first place (especially the Laundry one), nobody in the family would smell the rat if the Princess of a powerful nation would willingly work full-time in a laundry shop, am I right? If the show didn't depict that as a noteworthy problem, I wouldn't have to hit at that fact, but sadly it did.\\n\\n\r\nAdditionally, what we gathered from her pasts doesn\u2019t reflect on their behaviour when not confronted by it or how they formed them during the test of time, the creators rather just trying to serve the fans of a certain archetype of a girl more than anything else, making the experience of these backstories even more forgettable. We have the apathetic girl, the devoted girl, the more mature and way more experienced girl (in both, a supposedly sexual and work-related way) and last but not least, the Loli samurai of Japan, combining both of their supposedly greatest achievements all in one character, as it is surely been seen through the eyes of an unclouded otaku. I harbour an extreme disdain toward it, especially considering on which time-period the setting is reminiscent on, where Japan might've not even been the mysterious Elysium as the show makes it out to be, not even compared to most of Europe. This was close to some \"Gate-level\" shit in terms of how Japan gets depicted in international affairs.\\n\r\nDevoted and extremely skilled in the swordplay of a seemingly unbreakable Katana, defying the honor (\u201cthis is THEIR honor\u201d) of Europeans as inferior to those of the Japanese in an incredibly cringe-worthy \u201ccultural conflict\u201d type of episode and superior to her devotion to work than any of her co-workers, Samurai \"Chise\" Loli-chan surely is something to be proud of compared to these European scoundrels! It even becomes more evident in how the Japanese depict themselves with their gracious attitude in this borderline new-interpretation of an altered history in Europe, when they all go down to the knees (approximately 50 men) as Albion offers some mean of transportation to the city, basically the standard of every state visit at hand\u2026ever. Gracious attitude can only go that far without it coming off as an unintentional comedy there.\\n\\n\r\nRegarding production-values, there is not that much to be said. It\u2019s pretty decent all along, sometimes the animation quality is a bit shaky, especially during the \u201cepic\u201d Samurai fight in a moving train, where the production-team thought, they could basically re-create the hype surrounding Fate Zero\u2019s fight by using an eerily similar soundtrack but failed pathetically to do so. This made the \u201ccard games on trains\u201d or even \u201con motorcycles\u201d scene in YGO seem like totally believable and even a masterpiece in terms of audiovisual presentation. Adding to the visual aspects, I have to admit, that some of the city and landscape shots harbour a pretty cool steampunk-esque vibe to them, too bad that's way too little to save virtually being messed up in the other sections. Character designs are alright from a visual standpoint, but never manage to feel unique in any way, as we come to see designs as these, which can be classified in one overarching archetype, all the time in modern anime.\\n\r\nThe OP is your standard Engrish song playing behind a pretty well-directed visually-directing intro and also the ED doesn\u2019t break any records, in fact, it is unimpressively generic and so is the OST of Princess Principal in general. Failing to encapsulate any hype during action-scenes, apart from episode 1, and also failing to hit the flair of what a 30\u2019s espionage-thriller would need for an original soundtrack; it hits the mark a few times and is not terrible in the productional-sense, but that's all I can really give it praise for, since most of the time when the soundtrack keeps playing in the background, it strikes me as well as elevator music.\\n\\n\r\nConclusion:\\n\\n\r\nI certainly did not mention many positive aspects about Princess Principal, but maybe due to the reason: There are almost none! It may be considered as one of the best anime in a terribly underwhelming season like this, but that in itself doesn\u2019t mean, that it manages to break the shell of its genericism, oozing from every corner of it. While it was not utterly terrible as some competent directing was going on from time to time, and the conflict of Ange and Princess being pretty meaningful in connection with the main plot, that doesn\u2019t mean it lifts it to great heights at all, as these never managed to surpass the adjective \u201cdecent\u201d for me in its runtime. A very unrewarding experience as a whole.\\n\\n\r\nStory (3.5/10)\\n\r\nArt (6/10), Animation (5.5/10)\\n\r\nSound (6/10)\\n\r\nCharacters (4/10)\\n\r\nEnjoyment (4/10)\\n\\n\r\nOverall (4/10)",

            "content": "From James Bond to the Bourne Identity and John Wick, there is always a point in one's life when we've been intrigued by the mysterious, meticulous, and romantic nature of the cinematic spy. However, anime writers always have a way of answering the questions that nobody ever asks---\r\n\u201cWhat if spies, like James Bond, were replaced with\u2026 lolis?\u201d \r\n\"Thrilling.\"\r\nIn an unusual twist, they created this interesting anime, where a wide array of political spying and assassinating ends up being left in the hands of a group of young schoolgirls (most of whom, actually have legitimate spy training.) If you were expecting a kiddy girl slice oflife drama, you will not find that here. This is a rather well-thought-out spy series that happens to have young girls as the protagonists.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 7/10\\n\r\nOne of the great things about this story is how unusual it is for the anime genre. Princess Principal take you on a journey with unusual young girls as they conduct espionage, all types of spy work, and even engage in assassinations. Under the guise of being students, these young spies are given orders by their superiors that must be completed at all costs, including one\u2019s own life. It features a wide array of character personalities, most of whom are unique. The political climate is unique at this point of the story, as it is a sci-fi enhanced version of 19th-century England. In this setting, steam and coal often powered various mechanical devices. The queen of the nation, who is also a loli and a friend of the spies, is more of a figurehead than a person with actual power and various factions are in the process of deciding whether to either help or dispose of her. \\n\\n\r\nHow will the girls carry out these difficult missions?\\n\r\nWhat, if anything,  will happen to the queen? \\n\r\nWhich factions will align themselves with who?\\n\r\nWhat would happen if they are given an order that they can\u2019t or don\u2019t want to complete?\\n\\n\r\nFind out by watching the show~\\n\\n\r\nThe story initially presents itself as episodic, as most anime spy shows do. The pacing is pretty good, but there is nothing that really felt profound about this series. The storytelling is very good, but it is still relatively bland and lacking profound qualities. Overall I think the story is pretty good and deserves a 7/10.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 7/10\\n\r\nOverall, the characters are unique, but not too unique. They loosely fit some of the popular archetypes in anime. Their background stories were relatively interesting but they weren\u2019t characters that were extremely memorable for any particular reason. I feel if the series had another 12 episodes, they may have been able to create a more memorable series through the characters.\\n\\n\r\nThe most interesting character in this series is undoubtedly Ange, and she is the character that the anime mainly follows. She\u2019s a weird girl who talks in a monotone but likes to tell jokes and lies. For example, her most told joke/lie is \u201cI\u2019m from the Black Lizard Planet\u201d. She\u2019s a very skilled spy and performs amazing feats. \\n\\n\r\nChise is a girl skilled at various ways of fighting and swordsmanship. Her personality is very samurai-like. \\n\\n\r\nThe Queen is a typical queen. She knows many things and is skilled at being nobility, but she also has quite the daring side to her as well.\\n\\n\r\nThere is also the young adult, who uses her charms to seduce men and the queen\u2019s assistant. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 8/10\\n\r\nThe art fits and enhanced the setting very well. The characters were designed well, the animation was fluid, special effects were great as well. I think they did a pretty good job overall and have no complaints in this category. The backgrounds aren\u2019t as detailed as some more ridiculously detailed series, but they are still great backgrounds overall. There is also nothing particularly unique about the art.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8/10\\n\r\nThe background OSTs come from the legendary Yuki Kajiura, my favorite composer. She\u2019s known in the anime community for her works on the music of SAO, Mahou Shoujo Madoka Magica, .hack, Tsubasa Reservoir and many other popular titles. I\u2019ve never heard her do Jazz before, but the music is really good. Voice acting is great, special effects are all great. \\n\\n\r\nEntertainment: 7.5/10\\n\r\nI was very entertained by the uniqueness of the series and the fact that there were young girls doing espionage and spy work LOL. I\u2019ve never seen anything like this and it was a worthwhile experience. I can\u2019t say that I was very excited for each additional episode, but it was pretty interesting.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7.5/10 \\n\r\nThis series was definitely something that I could see myself recommending to some people. The good art and story kept my interest the entire series. There wasn\u2019t anything that particularly stood out to me or was extremely memorable, but it was still something that I don\u2019t regret watching.\\n\\n\r\nShould you watch it?\\n\r\nIf you\u2019re interested in young girls being spies, like action, young girls, spies, 19th-century London, I would give it a shot. \\n\\n\r\nIf you\u2019re looking for a slice of life or yuri series, you\u2019re in the wrong place. \\n\\n\r\nHope this helps you make your decision, let me know if you agree by clicking \u201chelpful~\u201d thanks~\\n\\n",

            "content": "\u201cThis just isn\u2019t a cover anymore, we\u2019re real friends now...\u201d\r\nThe spy. An archetype explored an incalculable amount of times, spanning across all forms of media. Whether it\u2019s the dark and methodical approach of a John la Carre\u2019 novel, or the more mainstream and charismatic James Bond film, each entity produces something that ensnares the senses and transports you into the action. I\u2019ve always been a fan of secret agents and spies in cinema, so it\u2019s no question that this affinity would translate into other mediums such as anime. The 2016 release of Joker Game helped affirm this assumption by offering a unique mix of action,stealth and wit. Now, almost exactly one year later I was introduced to Princess Principal by a dear friend, an original anime directed by Masaki Tachibana (Barakamon, Tokyo Magnitude 8.0)... naturally I was intrigued. Through 12 episodes, PP dazzles with copious amounts of combat, deceit and supernatural elements. It may occasionally come across as muddled and has its fair share of negatives, but it doesn\u2019t disappoint and may go down as one of the most overlooked anime of the year. Spoilers ahead.\\n\\n\r\nFrom the beginning, PP may end up losing much of its target audience from the cast itself. Understandably I had trouble conceptualizing the idea of teenage moe girls acting as spies in 1800\u2019s London (speaking Japanese no doubt), as it\u2019s just not something I would list as believable. It's similar to the feeling I got from watching the dubbed version of Monster, as Tenma is a Japanese man living in Germany that just so happens to speak fluent English. What a total mindfuck. Aside from the acquired taste of the character models, the setting is quite immersive. The anime takes place in an alternative steampunk London, where weapons are rusty and mechanized, and airships rule the skies. In this parallel universe, a wall exists dividing the Albion Kingdom between the lavish capital and the dilapidated, unruly Commonwealth. This in itself pays homage to the Berlin wall, as in PP it can be difficult to discern which side is morally correct. Through the ensuing 12 episodes we follow the story of five female spies, from their relationships, to their loyalty to duty and underlying secrets.\\n\\n\r\nOne important point to note is that Princess Principal\u2019s timeline can render the casual viewer confused. It\u2019s not readily apparent that the anime\u2019s story is told out of order. The writers seem to pen the script in a way that can come across as disjointed because of very minor details here or there that are easily missed. To better explain this, I\u2019ve comprised a chronological ordering of each episode (stolen from MAL forums):\\n\\n\r\nEpisode 2 -> Case 1\\n\r\nEpisode 3 -> Case 2\\n\r\nEpisode 5 -> Case 7\\n\r\nEpisode 4 -> Case 9\\n\r\nEpisode 9 -> Case 11\\n\r\nEpisode 1 -> Case 13\\n\r\nEpisode 7 -> Case 16\\n\r\nEpisode 6 -> Case 18\\n\r\nEpisode 8 -> Case 20\\n\r\nEpisode 10 -> Case 22\\n\r\nEpisode 11 -> Case 23\\n\r\nEpisode 12 -> Case 24 and beyond\\n\\n\r\nWhen done right (which I wouldn\u2019t necessarily say is the case here), non-linear narratives can be effective at showcasing certain qualities of a character or details to enhance the main story. Such is the case in Kurt Vonnegut\u2019s Salughterhouse-Five or the cult classic Memento, one of my favorite films of all time. The main problem in PP is that the characters aren\u2019t developed far enough to extract much from this method. What results is a plot that appears to jump around simply just to do so. I will say the aspect that benefitted the most from this was the relationship of Ange and the Princess, which for obvious spoiler reasons I won\u2019t divulge any further on. Ideally, this method can also be used to better illustrate interactions between the main characters, and I believe that was the intent here. It just didn\u2019t capitalize as well as it could have. An assumption by the writers is also made with regard to the gravity-altering Cavorite material used primarily by Ange throughout the anime. The only reason I even knew what it was, is because of an H.G. Wells novel (The First Men in the Moon) I read some years back. To someone unfamiliar with this sci-fi homage, the supernatural substance can appear as a gaping plot hole that\u2019s never really filled.\\n\\n\r\nAnother point I feel necessary to address is the dramatic change of tone throughout the anime, both with the overall atmosphere and with the characters. From the first episode, I was captivated by the \u201ccloak and dagger\u201d approach the writers utilized with the spies. Ange as a main protagonist was ruthless and cold, sporting a succinct knack for taking out her foes. She also came across as a compulsive liar, assumingly normal for the trope of a spy. However, at certain points in the story her personality can shift from scene to scene and catch viewers off guard. It\u2019s not extremely off-putting, but it\u2019s there. While mostly well paced and envisioned, there are times where the writers spend an entire episode divulging a character\u2019s backstory, and others only a few seconds of a flashback. Some episodes are actioned packed, like the first episode or the train episode while others serve to be endearing and relationship building like the laundromat anecdote. I think this change of tone, juxtaposed with the jumping timeline can make PP seem less cohesive than it really is. Overall it\u2019s a smart show, and often has you sympathizing with the jobs these girls have to take. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters are the absolute best part of the anime. The squad\u2019s unsung leader Ange is relentlessly devoted to duty, and relishes in the secrecy and importance of each mission. She is incredibly diverse with her emotions depending on who she\u2019s addressing. Her relationship with the Princess is undoubtedly the focal point of the entire series, and her backstory is full of heartache and depression. She often quotes herself as being a former member of the fictitious \u201cBlack Lizard Planet\u201d, in order to explain the reason for her peculiar behavior. Ange is an expert of her craft, and is the strongest and most consistent member of the group. The Princess has her fair share of secrets, and often plays the role of messenger or spokesperson for the group. In retrospect, I do wish more time had been given to fully expound upon her past, given the fact it plays such an important role in the show. \\n\\n\r\nDorothy, my favorite character of the entire series, is the oldest of the group and she\u2019s often reminded of that fact. She also probably receives the most backstory, with the writers devoting almost an entire episode to her relationship with her father. She occasionally gets drunk or uses her body to help advance the situation (boobs=imperative to success as a spy), but also internalizes and many of the missions the girls partake in. She's like the mom of the group. Chise, the token Japanese ninja, is actually my least favorite character, though probably for selfish reasons . She undergoes a supreme transformation over the course of the anime and begins to learn the Western culture and the importance of friendship. Last but not least is Beatrice, the meek and often soft spoken friend of the Princess. Her demeanor is jittery, but her backstory (though short) is incredibly sad. Out of the entire main cast, I was impressed by the level of depth and detail put in place for each character.\\n\\n\r\nIf you told me that the same director as Barakamon and Tokyo Magnitude 8.0 also led Princess Principal, I\u2019d be hard pressed to call you a liar. I guess this a concrete indicator of Tachibana\u2019s ability as an anime director, and certainly one that deserves more work. The somber, ominous environment PP exudes, coupled with the uplifting comradery of the main cast crafts a definingly unique atmosphere all around. The art is well visioned, and although the female characters are younger, they are evenly proportioned and attractive. I can\u2019t recall any slip ups with framing during the action heavy scenes and even the still, dialogue heavy moments never seemed to come across as stale. While it may not technically be the best animation, its consistency is something to applaud in today\u2019s anime world, where series are being pumped out left and right. The cinematography is some of the best I've seen in a long time, despite focusing less on atmosphere than other equivalent specimens. The way some of the scenes are constructed, either through POV animation or still impact shots. It also has the benefit of omitting the \u201cunfaithful to the source material\u201d argument so many disgruntled manga fans hurl around with each new adaptation. It\u2019s a refreshing artsyle, contradictory to most of the bright and colorful anime in today\u2019s world.\\n\\n\r\nIf I can make one recommendation, it would be to watch Princess Principal with headphones on. The sound is purely exceptional. The balance of sound effects and their position through the speakers is perfect, and helps add to the realism during some of the missions undergone by the girls. The background music is also fitting of the time period, as nothing is saturated with electronic tones and no chipper techno beats flood your ears. The OP (despite that fugly logo) is one that grew on me, but now exists as one of my favorites for the season. The strong female vocals in conjunction with the smooth animation sequences is pleasing to the eye, and it\u2019s one I don\u2019t think I ended up skipping once. The ending is a strong contrast from the OP, but helps remind the viewers of the minor points of maturity these female characters lack. It\u2019s playful and fun. There aren\u2019t any stand out seiyuu performances in the anime, but certainly nothing hitting below the mark.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I would suggest not judging a book by its cover and jump into Princess Principal with no preconceived notions. It's certainly not what I expected, and although makes some mistakes it is a worthwhile watch. Compared to most of the shows out nowadays, the script is actually given some thought and the characters are developed substantially for their short screen time. I think the show would have benefited significantly if it was doubled in length or had a second season. This would give ample time to fix the timeline issue and also fully explore Ange and Princess\u2019 relationship. The series is plenty exciting, whether with raw action sequences or suspenseful moments of stealth. This is an easy anime to recommend, so if you're looking for something new and exciting, or we're a fan of series like Joker Game I would give it a try. It certainly surprised me and many others, and I look forward to more developments from Tachibana in the future. As always, thanks for reading and be sure to check out some of my other reviews from the season!\\n\\n\r\nStory-5\\n\r\nArt-6.5\\n\r\nSound-8\\n\r\nCharacter-8\\n\r\nEnjoyment-7\\n\r\nOverall-6.85",

            "content": "Originally 4eps in (Ep5 updates) - no spoilers - tl;dr at bottom. \r\nBased on the poster, synopsis, studios involved, it being an original, and so forth, you may be inclined to think this show would be nothing more than a meh \"cute girls doing (violently) cute things\" kinda ordeal - I know I did. Boy, was I wrong.\u00a0\r\nOne look at the staff roster and I went, \"Huh... Wait, for real?!\" So I gave it a chance. I now think this is en route to join the \u201celite\u201d for the year, and that it\u2019s currently criminally underrated. Oh, and \u201cinteresting cute girls doing seriously kickass things(with amazing writing)\u201d may be more accurate.\\n\\n\r\nStory 8/10 ***update after Ep5: 9/10 \\n\r\n-Though Ep1 had me impressed, I was initially concerned this would be more episodic in nature (which I'm usually not particularly fond of), and was dreading another Joker Game, but Ep2-4 put me at ease. This is serious storytelling that knows what it wants, is carefully planned out, and delivers. A captivating tale of unlikely spies, but one which isn\u2019t grounded in reality (or the expectations that come with it) - this is an alternative world and, as such, world-building is key. Think steampunk-esque Victorian era with a dash of magic-like scientific element. On top of that, the show is extremely character-driven (more on this later), even though we\u2019re in the middle of something much bigger - not the easiest thing to pull off properly, considering this is not a \u201cheros saving the world\u201d kind of story. \\n\r\n-They understand the concept of SHOW instead of TELL. There are a few short narrated explanation moments in the beginning, but there's no painfully forced exposition and characters talking to each other as if they're utter idiots for the benefit of the viewer. The world-building is phenomenal because you are given just enough in context to make sense of it all and start putting it together yourself\u2026 and then you want to know more. Pacing has also been on point for the most part, but the \u201cin between\u201d Ep3 to Ep4 leaves a bit to be desired (-1 here because this can set a precedent for future episodes) \\n\r\n***Ep5 update: in context, I retract the previous criticism - the show is playing with chronology of events and very intentional time leaps in both directions, to extremely interesting characterization effects***. \\n\r\n-There are a couple of plot points that seem far-fetched, even for this world (e.g. the ballroom sequence in Ep2) - a stricter viewer may see some substantial fault in those when thinking objectively/realistically. These certainly didn\u2019t pass me by unnoticed, but the series is doing so much more than that, and using these moments in such an interesting way, that I feel compelled to excuse them as a \u201cpoetic license\u201d (nevertheless, -1 here). Of course, as an original, this can go anywhere, but with Ichiro Okouchi (Code Geass, etc) on Script and Series Composition, I do think we're in good hands.\u00a0\\n\\n\r\nArt 9/10\\n\r\nTying in directly with that last point, you can tell a lot of care went into designs and attention to detail. This is what makes the world-building work particularly well. The art really draws you into this world (no pun intended). The choice of color palettes in each scene, the contrast, the attention given to setting\u2026 it's all beautifully done in a way that adds to the storytelling in every instance. Then there are some truly gorgeous moments. And the animation is fluid. An occasional wonkiness here and there, but nothing too serious. Major props to art direction - then again, it's Nobutaka Ike (Paprika, Kara no Kyoukai).\\n\\n\r\nSound 10/10\u00a0\\n\r\nAlright, I barely have anything to say here other than singing it praises (again, no pun intended\u2026 tabun). Yoshikazu Iwanami as Sound Director, and Yuki Kajiura as Composer (both have way too many exceptional credits to list)... what more do you want? Music does a great job in immersing you into this world, so does the sound editing. VAs are solid. Sound mix is top notch. OP is awesome, ED not bad at all. Next!\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 9/10\\n\r\nWe still have a long way to go, but the potential is there. The first episode threw a fair amount of characters at us without even naming many of them. That's actually not a bad thing - they understand that you'd simply not remember everyone anyway, so they focused on what you needed right now for the story - unusually straightforward and intelligent decision. The following episodes are now taking care of the rest in beautiful fashion, with brilliantly paced character (re-)introduction and development - well, for the most part\u2026 not sure I agree with what we have in Ep4, but we\u2019ll only know the effectiveness of certain creative decisions when we place it in context after future episodes come out. I\u2019m just hoping those decisions didn\u2019t come about due to time/budget concerns. ***Ep5 update: as stated above, Ep5 addresses this piece of criticism***. Regardless, I have high hopes for this cast. Ange seems to remain somewhat of a focal point even among the MCs - she already has remarkable depth to her character, while still being enshrouded in mystery, inviting us to be curious and want to know everything about her, as well as Princess. Fortunately, the other characters are not just left to the sidelines either! \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 9/10\\n\r\nIn one word: engaging. This is not your mindless entertainment, but not the kind that requires constant deep thinking either. All of the elements are of such high caliber and come together so effortlessly, that I\u2019ll go as far as saying part of the enjoyment comes from the appreciation of what they\u2019re doing both separately and together. In other words, this is a show where my enjoyment is directly proportional to all the previously made observations. Most importantly, I eagerly look forward to it every week.  \\n\\n\r\nOverall 9/10\\n\r\nI expect this can be one of the best shows of the Summer, but I also recognize there's a lot here that can go wrong. So far, this is extremely high level of storytelling and holds tremendous potential. An overall grade of 9 may be pushing at this point, but that is what I believe the show CAN earn upon its conclusion, from what I've seen so far.\u00a0\\n\\n\r\ntl;dr\\n\r\nA roster of industry heavy-hitters on staff gives us an original with serious potential, boasting impressive technical and artistic elements, but that can still go anywhere at this point. Extremely immersive world-building with promising characters that can drive the story and are being handled well so far. Let's hope they're allowed to develop and that we have a carefully formulated and interesting plot ahead of us - everything is pointing in that direction, but there are still some causes for concern. Still, this can certainly be one of the best shows of the season, and join the \u201celite\u201d for the whole year.",

Remember the \"Sexual Harassment\" I talked Earlier? that's one of the best girls here that serves a good purpose in distraction, not distracting the viewer, but those that needs to be distracted in order to fulfill their missions. it is pretty good and serves well for the Spying job.

            "content": "As a kid, I\u2019ve always been fascinated with stories surrounding spies, most particularly due to the fact that I grew up in a family who exposed me to James Bond at a young age. Cool, suave and sophisticated, capable of carrying off any mission or any feat, James Bond was the type of guy I always wanted to be as a kid, and, as I grew older and into adolescence, Bond\u2019s luck with women only enhanced this idea. Of course, much to the dismay of my eight-year-old self, I grew up to be anything but sophisticated and cool, instead becoming a filthy weeb who spendshis Friday nights fapping to Askua doijins, but I digress! So, when I had learned of the content surrounding the recently aired Princess Principal, visions of my childhood flashed in my mind, and I was genuinely excited for the show, as it seemed to be essentially James Bond, but with all the characters being replaced by lolis. Yes, a dumb idea, but anime has frequently surprised me in the past with its use of strange narratives and concepts to make genuinely good shows, so I thought that perhaps something like Princess Princiaple would also fall into this same mould of strange concepts that were executed well. However, PeePee (yes, it\u2019s immature to refer to the show as such, but I\u2019m going to be doing it from here on out) is perhaps the biggest disappointment I\u2019ve had all year with anime. I really wanted to love this show, I really did, especially since it has so much going for it in regards to what appeals to me personally from a visual standpoint, from the great character designs, wonderful setting and world as well as the rather suave and smooth soundtrack. Unfortunately, PeePee is bogged down by an ultimately weak cast of characters, an aimless narrative and, for the most part, a lot of wasted potential. But, dear reader, allow me to elaborate why I believe this show to be, while not entirely bad, to be extremely lackluster and mediocre. So, let\u2019s grab our top hat, jump into an early 20th century car, and do some spying! (Disclaimer: LIQfilms doesn\u2019t condemn spying; if you\u2019re executed for discovering national secrets, please don\u2019t sue me!)\\n\\n\r\nPeePee\u2019s narrative is set in a fictional 19th century steampunk London in which the West and the East are separated by a massive wall (insert overused Donald Trump joke here), in which five young girls from a prestigious academy are actually spies! The rest of the series sees them on various spy missions in an episodic narrative structure, as we learn more about their pasts and their relationships with each other, and that\u2019s pretty much it as a whole. On paper, this mode of storytelling doesn\u2019t sound bad, but the main problem I have with PeePee\u2019s narrative is just how aimless it is. The show feels as if it doesn\u2019t really know what it wants to do in regards to its story and characters, and instead just relies on ultimately inconsequential episodic spy missions that feel more like they exist solely for padding out the run time of the series. It proves frustrating to watch since I constantly kept expecting the story to do something, or to go somewhere, and I would be more forgiving of the show if its episodic nature actually had any bearing on the world as a whole, or if they were engaging through a personal connection with the characters presented in the slightest. The show just awkwardly jumps between different times in the story, which makes it rather jarring and confusing to watch; it just feels like a bunch of random ideas for stories placed in random succession to each other. This may feel like a rather strange way to describe the structure of the show, but that\u2019s honestly how it feels like. It just feels messy and not planned out well at all, as if the writers were scared to take any risks at all, and instead come up with pointless episodic narratives, to, again, just to fill time.\\n\\n\r\nNowhere is this idea more evident than in episodes nine and seven of the show, in which we don\u2019t learn anything about any of the characters or the world we\u2019re presented with. Episode seven is essentially an episode in which the girls join a laundry cleaners, as they have to find a specific uniform to identify someone in the army who has been using mustard gas. As they work in this place, they eventually transform and rebuild the work system, so everyone can work more efficiently and earn more money, and eventually apprehend the villain of the episode; that\u2019s it. While there is some commentary about the working class of the people living in the Victorian era in London during the 1800s, it\u2019s an ultimately pointless episode and even has many jarring moments that simply make no sense or just feel...odd. Like when all the men happily throw off their clothes to give to some cute underage girls for them to clean, or a scene where one of the spies, whom is fighting off against the villain of the episode, defeats him, and drops a knife to the floor, whereupon another lady who notices it, and walks away, which, I\u2019m guessing, is in shame\u2026? Or maybe she is scared? Does she want to turn her back in respect for the privacy of the spy girl? I don\u2019t know! The anime doesn\u2019t make it clear and the lady\u2019s actions doesn\u2019t make any sense and feels more so jarring than anything else, resulting in one of the many examples in the show where the in-the-moment logic is shoehorned in to create forced and unneeded drama in situations where it doesn\u2019t make any sense. When the lady walks away it clearly hurts little miss loli spy, and it feels unnatural that the woman would do so, considering that the loli spy has just apprehended a man with a knife, whom could have killed one of your workers! This may seem like a redundant thing to talk about, but little things like this that drag me out of the narrative and prove to be distracting, and there are plenty of examples of this.\\n\\n\r\nThe other pointless episode, even more so than the one I just described, is episode nine, in which we see Chise, a Japanese girl trying to adapt to British society, as she recaps her time spent as a spy and basically tells us her relationships and thoughts of the other girls. This is pointless as we already understand at this point the dynamics between each of our characters and repeating it so, is redundant. Not only that, but the episode is also a good case study into another problem with the show and that is that each villain, or any person who belongs to any higher social class, is a complete asshole, one dimensional prick! In this case, we have a rich guy who kills a butterfly, just because he is so EVIL!  This forced dynamic between the higher upper-class as being horrible people, while the lower-class is presented as being kind and considerate, having to work hard to prosper in life is representative of the context of the society in which the show is based on, sure, but people are not this black and white, and it feels silly to present this as such. It doesn\u2019t help either when the show takes to victimisation in a cheap and pathetic attempt to make us feel bad for the characters, with each adult, again, being represented as one dimensional pricks, beating down on our cute and innocent little girls. It\u2019s the same problem I had with Elfen Lied, which also used similar cheap writing to evoke this emotion from us through manipulation, and while PeePee is nowhere near as bad as that show, it still feels lazy. While I do appreciate that the show does attempt to show us the character\u2019s backstories, which does add some more depth onto them, it\u2019s not something you haven\u2019t seen before, nor is it really that effective since the characters are rather dry and boring. It\u2019s hard to care for them on any emotional level and are more akin to cardboard cutouts.\\n\\n\r\nThere is an attempt here at introducing a plot twist into the narrative, but I feel as if it is introduced far too late to do anything substantial with this idea, and not only that, it also felt incredibly predictable too boot. The show constantly hints at greater things in the narrative, but then utilizes the most bare-bones and predictable storytelling to deliver upon these hints, making the entire show feel incredibly uninspired. There are a few attempts at theme exploration, and politics, all of which is never given enough time to breath or develop, and feels more so as afterthought, rather than an intrical part of the story and world. Every theme presented feels like a child\u2019s interpretation of a morally gray world. The show also utilises exposition as well in order to communicate to the audience the state of the world, such as in the first episode where the narrator essentially just tells us everything instead of letting the audience be immersed into the world and setting ourselves, especially since the information we do learn, regarding a wall that divides the East and West, is not really explored all too much in the show, aside from the finale, but, even then, it\u2019s nothing too remarkable. While on the topic of the finale, while I would say it is more engaging than the rest of the show, since things of actual significance and consequence are occurring, it ultimately feels rather anti-climatic and just ends abruptly!\\n\\n\r\nTo be perfectly fair, there was a couple of things in the show\u2019s narrative that I kind of liked. For starters, there is a variety of different missions, which helps to break up the monotony of the story, and various locations and settings which helped to expand the world and make it feel grander. I also liked some of the spy training stuff too, and helped add on this layer of realism to the setting and the world, from seeing the girls learning how to unpick locks, or them performing practices involving tailing someone without their presence being known. Some of the technology used in the show too was pretty fun to see as well, such as a ball that allows the holder to fly, which allowed for more creative scenarios to ensue. In addition, there was a few episodes that could actually be fun, or somewhat emotional in a few places. The best example of this is an episode devoted to Dorothy, and her backstory, and while it too does utilise victimisation too, the episode is fairly emotional, mainly because Dorothy was the only character I found to be somewhat likeable, being that she was easily the most relatable, and her world outlook on life just seemed to be the most admirable amongst the cast. The one thing that ruins the episode however, is that Dorothy\u2019s father, whom after learning does actually care for his daughter, is killed off and is never mentioned ever again! Not even a single passing remark or comment!\\n\\n\r\nAs for the rest of the cast, they\u2019re pretty mediocre character archetypes. Chise\u2019s involvement in the narrative is pretty minimal, and while we do understand her reason for coming to London, all the way from Japan, in a fight between her and her father which carried some narrative weight and emotion, she doesn\u2019t really change or grow much throughout the narrative and her relationships that form between her and the other girls just feels superficial, as if the only reason they exist was because the script dictated it so. She had some charming scenes however, most notably her lack of knowledge surrounding western customs, although some moments felt rather trite, especially the one with the lady in the laundry house I mentioned before. Beatrice also doesn\u2019t have much involvement in the plot either and serves little purpose as a whole. I\u2019m guessing her role is the straight man, in the sense that she is the most normal of the group, having been trained very little in the art of spies, so I guess we\u2019re supposed to latch onto her, but I found her more so annoying than anything else. Undoubtedly the crux of the show, and what most of the emotional weight depends on, is the relationship between Ange, a spy who has essentially cut off all her emotions for her job, and the Princess. Their relationship does actually feel genuine and sweet at times, especially since Ange actually exhibits emotions around her, giving her character some more depth and personality than what we were lead to believe at first, suggesting some personal history and connection between the two. While this relationship is still nothing remarkable, and is as cookie-cutter as they come, the scenes in which they fight, actually have some emotional weight behind it. While I won\u2019t get too much into the plot twist between their relationship (even though it is obvious that even Stevie Wonder could see this coming!) the struggles behind the Princess's life was actually kind of interesting, and one of the few moments I cared for any of these characters.\\n\\n\r\nNow, one positive thing I can say about the characters is that they all have good chemistry between them, and their back-and-fourths as they complete missions can actually be pretty funny and charming sometimes too, especially the scenes in which they are driving in their car, as Beatrice freaks out and screams hysterically, Ange turns off her voice changer (which was installed onto her by her evil father because every adult in this is a one dimmensional ass-hat) and is a clever way of adding some comedy into the show. While the character interactions are good in many regards, it is not enough to salvage the show unfortunately.\\n\\n\r\nIn regards to animation and music, PeePee, handles this the best. The opening is fantastic, and I can\u2019t get enough of it! It captures the spirit the show is aiming for perfectly, and the same thing can be said for the design of the world and the character designs too. The city is mechanic, lifeless, and bleak, and each character design is pretty good, albeit it can be kind of silly looking at times. The soundtrack is also comprised of smooth jazz, adding some suave to the show, and the animation, for the most part, is pretty consistent with some cool looking action sequences. However, CGI is used in some parts of the show, with a jarring use of it in the second episode, where a group of people are dancing with the same posture and fluidity of two robots trying to emulate human movement; it feels really jarring, and many of the backgrounds in the show are comprised of CG models that never fail to look awful and drag me out of the scene.\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion, PeePee was just a mediocre show with no remarkable attributes and  it felt like the writers were holding back and, as I said, kept playing it safe with predictable and tireing stories that have been done a thousands times before to much better effect. It\u2019s a show that is more interested in cinematography and action then it is in having actual characters the audience can feel for, and the strange pacing, as well as the narrative structure makes the show frustrating to watch since it feels as if it is going nowhere and just remaining stagnant. On some level, yes, I did enjoy myself during some moments of the show, but much of that was overpowered by a strong, unyielding feeling of boredom which makes it incredibly hard to recommend as there are so many other shows that are actually worth your time. Don\u2019t bother with this show. Like someone you passed on the street today, you\u2019ll forget the memory of them as soon as you take your eyes away...\\n",

(sades headset ftw)\\n\\n\r\nMy enjoyment for This show is a solid 10/10 and was one of the many thing that i look forward in harsh, dry and lifeless Monday.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "\u201cWhen you create a web of lies, you'll inevitably trap yourself and become everyone's meal instead\u201d- someone, somewhere, sometime\r\nPrincess Principal is an unorthodox title to be sure. Steampunk, non-linear storytelling, and rule of cool. Sounds like it should've been a winner, but it was a case doomed to fail as soon as it set out, exposing itself rather quickly as a fraud and a disaster. It's stupid, it's uncool, and most of all, it's insulting. It tried desperately to confuse you and come off as smart and then it tries to patronize you. \r\nPrincess Principal is the condescending and obnoxious dreck from the same teamthat gave us one of last year\u2019s most crushing disappointments, Izetta the Last Witch. As blasphemous as this sounds, that show was still better than this one in every single way. Keep in mind, Izetta was sort of a train wreck and plenty were hurt by its unkept promises despite the setting and premise. However, it's like this show decided to do it one worse yet still be seen as better. Let the truth be heard, let this series be exposed for its lies, and let it be cannibalized and demonized for ruining my hopes and dreams of having a better Izetta, just like with Youjo Senki only half a year prior! Let me, the man it deceived the cruelest, have my vengeance, for the lies end here!\\n\\n\r\nCase ST 2\\n\\n\r\nWhen a narrative starts out on such an awful foot as to have narrator exposition of the past as the opening scene and then have a bunch of asspull revelations and stupid moments (few of which ever come to make sense later), then your narrative needs to do a lot to make a recovery. It never does. In fact, those asspull revelations are occasionally present, like the ballerina revelation in episode 1. It tries to play itself as smart by creating information (that it claims that we missed) out of thin air; that obviously not smart. It does this a few times and it's annoying every time. The technology doesn't make any sense either and is poorly explained. Apparently, there is this C-ball that the main character has and at one point they try to steal the prototype that was just finished, except they already have the original so that officially makes no sense. Lastly, the factions are insanely difficult to keep up with thanks to how the executed their non-linear storytelling, and we don't even k is which side between the commonwealth and the royals is the east or west side.\\n\\n\r\nAs stated earlier, this show treats you like an idiot. The asspull revelations that never add up aren't the only example of this. Hell, they're not even the most egregious. What\u2019s more egregious is the fact that this show constantly beats you over the head. Every single episode, the show constantly drives home the fact that spies lie and that they're not good people, as well as that everyone always lies. More than 5% of the total dialogue is centered around these three things. The dialogue is so condescending and terrible overall, and with all this thrown in the pot, it's just an especially big insult to the audience's intelligence. \u201cDid you know that spies are liars?\u201d Gee, I sure did, hell, so did everyone watching. You don't have to remind us constantly. Anywhere between 3 and 25 times an episode, especially in the early episodes. Not everyone knows when they're being mocked or patronized but when you realize that it's happening to you, it's aggravating, so a show shouldn't ever do that to the viewer, who is maybe trying to use this as an escape from reality. Instead, Princess Principal, how about you instead focus on telling a coherent story and SHUT THE FUCK U-\\n\\n\r\nLying is bad\\n\\n\r\nThat being said, there are times where you can see a glimmer of hope in the narrative. As predictable as episode 6 is, the finale and tragic irony of the song to the situation at hand is brilliant, almost reminiscent of some of the other works this writer has worked on, specifically the final scene of the 23rd episode of Code Geass, a personal favorite. This series, especially in the second half, starts actually trying to elicit emotion, but it's not always effective at it. Sure there are good moments like episode 7 which was the only really solid episode of the show barring some of 6, but then we get episode 8 which while that did provide context to some scenes from earlier, it actually reveals another problem and missed opportunity in episode 2, one of the worst of the series; this isn't even speaking of the embarrassingly bad and mind-numbingly stereotypical episode 9 which feels like it would normally be a sappy kids show episode that also patronizes the audience. In a way, it's almost trying to be the reverse Izetta where instead of starting off decently and turning to complete shit later on, it starts off horrendously and gets better later, except it stumbles as that hallways through the second half anyway and ends up back where it started. Too little too late comes to mind. Besides, the finale is a sequel bait disaster anyway and anytime the show takes a step forward, it takes a stab back as well.\\n\\n\r\nCase C 2\\n\\n\r\nWith the exception of Ange and Charlotte, none of the characters have any semblance of chemistry. Hell, none of the are memorable. Their personalities are beyond basic and not-fleshed out or progressed at all. There is no one worth giving a damn about, for they are so lifeless and static. If this show I supposed to be a rule of cool series, why does only one character try for this angle (the girl with the tits), and why isn't it one of the more prominent characters? They're so plain and tired, and one of them, names Beatrice, starts out especially bad and hypocritical. She\u2019s the typical \u201cprincess loli bodyguard\u201d trope except more annoying, and then she becomes a mod benign version of this exact same trope with little to no progression. Hell, all of these people are little more than tropes! The two \u201cbest\u201d characters are Ange and Dorothy. Dorothy because she tries at rule of cool and she\u2019s hot (and she actually has an explored past), and Ange because she has this weird thing about the Black Lizard Planet she keeps lying about nonchalantly. Oh, and she and this princess kinda sorta love each other...I suppose. Reasonings loosely related to it are dumb though. Regardless fact that such straws need to be grasped just to say something interesting about these characters is proof of their failure as a cast. This isn't even speaking of the other characters that come later, since they're not worth mentioning and they exacerbate this issue.\\n\\n\r\nCase A 4\\n\\n\r\nThe show\u2019s visuals do not fare much better. Studios Actas and 3Hz did a joint effort for this project, and if nothing else, they were consistent...ly bad.The Light Novel default artstyle aggravates and does not look appealing in the slightest, and the designs range from mediocre to abysmal, with the worst being Chise\u2019s design. The rest of the art looks decent and occasionally pretty detailed, like with the C-ball, and that's the only praise I'll give the visuals. The animation is ok at best, though the fights are pretty badly choreographed. The CGI ranges from mediocre (for the cars) to abysmal (for the people) and there is even a moment with a CGI room for the foreground and background and it causes a long 7 seconds of bad slowdown (what is it with anime that have CGI and slowdown and why are all of them always shitty anime?). When we see rads backgrounds in situations of motion, or any time for that matter, they look terrible, and so does the photorealistic backgrounds of the school garden, which you will see from time to time. Shame since the steampunk-esque setting is an interesting one in terms of potential visuals yet these don't warrant much merit.\\n\\n\r\nCase SO 6\\n\\n\r\nOne of the most renowned composers in the industry, Yuki Kajiura did the music for this anime. This is honestly one of the weaker OSTs I've experimented from her to date. The songs are mostly pretty reserved and thus aren't very memorable, and the few that are more blaring and interesting aren't nearly of the same quality of some of the best tracks of her other works, like the SAO and Fate/Zero OSTs. The tracks are repeated quite often too to make matters worse. The OP, \"The Other Side of the Wall\" by Void_Chords feat.MARU, is easily one of the best of the season. It emphasizes rule of cool and is filled with the frantic energy that makes you pumped to watch each episode of the show, as awful as this show is; it is the only real good thing I could find in this show, which is unfortunate. The ED, \"A Page of My Story\" by Ange (Ayaka Imamura), Princess (Akira Sekine), Dorothy (You Taichi), Beatrice (Akari Kageyama), Chise (Nozomi Furuki), fares nowhere near as well, as contrarian as this apparently sounds. It is an ok enough track on its own but intro in particular gives me major mood whiplash every time I finish an episode. Overall, it was a decent enough repertoire of music but little was special and it was honestly underwhelming on the whole.\\n\\n\r\nCase E 3\\n\\n\r\nThis show was very difficult to enjoy. The action wasn't even that competent, the characters were unbelievably dull and bad, the plot was wrecked beyond belief, and the show treats the audience like a dunce. The most enjoyment I got out of it was listening to the OP theme by you can do that as well as engage in the full version without having to see the show anyway. Not to say that the experience was heinous but it was continually frustrating and I am left bitter for it.\\n\\n\r\nCase O 3\\n\\n\r\nWith that, the case is closed. Princess Principal is hereby found guilty of lying about being a good show, treating its audience like an imbecile, being caught so far up a web of lies and lack of proper establishing that everything is convoluted, and all around being a massive disappointment. For a rule of cool show, this didn't even try that hard in any aspect, even visually or musically, and for a show of emotion, it shot itself in the foot almost every time it tried. It's off to the cellar, Princess Principal; good riddance.",

            "content": "Spy and Espionage media has always been a very popular topic in the West. Besides the ongoing popularity of the James Bond franchse, and the allure of heist movies like the Oceans' series, they've been around enough to be parodied for decades, represented by films like Austin Powers and more recently Kingsmen The Secret Service. Even cartoons like Archer have taken a crack at Spy shows. In the world of anime, consumed by magic high schools, video game worlds, and Moe appeal, spy shows haven't been very common. The most notable example as of late would be last year's Joker Game, which ultimately became acritical flop with its episodic structure and blandly undistinguishable leads.\\n\\n\r\nWhich leads us to today's topic. Studio 3Hz, responsible for last year's cute girl filled yet ambitious Flip Flappers, made this ambitious project, a spy show starring cute girls in a steampunk driven English setting as they embark on a variety of missions for the sake of their government. Did it succeed? Well let's find out. \\n\\n\r\nThe story begins with the setup of a proposed \"London Revolution\", splitting England into two sides, the Kingdom and the Commonwealth, neither of which get fleshed out or distinguished. Our protagonists, the cute girl spies, work for one of these sides on a variety of missions that make up our story. These missions range from infiltration, rooting out traitors, train battles, disguise exploits, heists, retrieving secret codes and many more, in addition to backstory episodes for some of the character relationships in the present.\\n\\n\r\nIn general, these episodes are quite fun to see, with a good amount of Tactical Espionage Action (thumbs up if you get that reference) in almost all of them. While some may accuse the show of more or less pushing the cute girl appeal, from a logical standpoint, having young girls do the spywork would put them away from a lot of suspicion, because the very idea would seem silly to most of the adults and guards around their areas and be unsuspected. One could argue that the silliness bleeds into its own script as well and while that is true, the concept isn't horrible in itself and on their own, most of the episodes are good fun, if including a few logical fallacies and repeated events here and there (the seductive role of Dorothy for instance).\\n\\n\r\nThat said though, there is one thing that prevents these episodes from reaching their full potential, the plot structure.\\n\\n\r\nYou see, the way the show structures itself is quite non-linear. This non-linear plotting has been done in anime like The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya and Baccano, but Haruhi was a meta comedy and Baccano used it to accommodate for way more characters and to keep the pace consistent the whole way through rather than having separate climaxes. Both also had source material already. With PP, it attempts to use different adventures that in many ways feel disconnected from each other to do all the worldbuilding and plotting from scratch, as an original property within 12 episodes. One particular character relationship gets the opportunity to develop and shine but...little else. \\n\\n\r\nQuestions about the world's ideas still remain incredibly open, many episodes lack overall relevance to the worldbuilding or plot lines to jack down the pacing, and while the characters' backgrounds are touched on, most are either done only briefly or takes unneeded time from other elements, looking at you Episode 9.\\n\\n\r\nIn many ways the show, while cool in short bursts, feels less like an overall elaborate story and more like a series of fun ideas the writer wanted to accomplish in this steampunk spy world he created, regardless of care or progression. Two notable examples are Episode 7, in which a laundry exploit exists to reveal backstory but not add any contribution to the overall plot, and ESPECIALLY Episode 9, an awkwardly placed backstory episode that kills the previous episode's pacing for a character who matters nothing in the grand scheme of thing and does nothing in what remains.\\n\\n\r\nEven despite this, Episode 8 is actually great, being a really nicely appreciated look into the intertwining lives of two of the characters and adding a great amount of context. It's a case where an episode actually felt like it was put in a place where it should be, and it was by far the peak of the series. \\n\\n\r\nOther episodes vary between \"fun adventure with a small bit of insight\" or, rushed plot episodes, more specifically at the end of it. The final episodes have very sudden plot revelations to throw the spy unit into apparent disarray, and the Ange/Princess relationship does benefit a lot from their character confrontations around this part, but it still feels like it does little with the world, only introducing a possible antagonist on par with the protagonists at the very end and ending on a sequel hook. Yes, a sequel hook, in an original story. Such a thing shouldn't happen, and if the show had keep more of a focus on its world and kept things consistent rather than trying to be stylistic with a timeline, it might've been able to accomplish far more than its ambitions seemed to imply. It might also have been possible to explain Ange's C-ball. While the substance is, according to a friend, based on a book, it lacks the proper limitations, so they can apparently Magic the characters out of situations without too much thought for how. \\n\\n\r\nIn a sense that's kind of reflective of the plot itself. As I mentioned the action scenes and specific scenarios were often entertaining itself, but the Rule of Cool moves it away from plausibility unfortunately.\\n\\n\r\nOn the plus side, the production is mostly up to par. While the character designs are sadly very typical of light novels, the general look of the world, costumes and action scenes is really well put together. The different uniforms, steampunk architecture around the world, action scenes and car chases all look the part, and made the show incredibly inviting at first as a new and unique show from the same studio as Flip Flappers. Actual animation was good for the most part. In terms of sound, Yuki Kajira made another fairly unique soundtrack similar to her work on ERASED, fitting the vibe of the setting and often being in the right times. The OP is badass, and the ED, while catchy is a pace breaker from the more intense endings.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters range from nicely handled to skimmed over to non-existent. Relatively early on at the start have Ange as the confident serious superspy and Princess as the royal figure wanting to create a revolution and cause a positive change to her nation. This goal isn't original in itself, but following a certain plot twist, it becomes more of a somber reflection that actually works for the plot in the end. Ange's role on her end is nice too as the most competent superspy. The other three of the main group, Chise, Dorothy, and Beatrice get far less. To the show's credit, each of them gets a particular moment when we learn of their basic backstories, followed by having a cool moment in an action scene, not necessarily fleshed out but present and accounted for, while the skills each of them DO feel like necessary pieces to form a competent unit in the spy missions in their own wat. That said, a few of their episodes tend to make the plot go off track. Chise, for instance has her own episode 9 feel incredibly disconnected and pointless in the main scheme of things aside from finding a way to justify in the Token Japanese girl. Other supporting characters are either people to be fooled by the spy group, higher ups who's main role is being higher ups or generally episodic characters who....sadly don't leave much. There is a suitable rival for the group but again, she appears at the very end, once most of the conflict is out of the way. \\n\r\nIn general, the main characters are nicely handled where it counts with some nice character development scenes at certain points, but the show's sidetracking pace and incomplete nature hold them back behind simpleness. \\n\\n\r\nConclusion\\n\\n\r\nIn a few ways, the show reminds me of the writer's previous effort Kabaneri of the Iron Fortress. That was also a 12 episode story that tried to create a world and characters with great production values, and while that show's premise was far less interesting and the faults in that show far more irritating, it kept a coherent story handle and tried to more or less conclude its whole idea in the end. He tried to do more than he could, and while Princess Principal is far from a total bust by virtue of its slick production and generally impressive standalone sequences, it went from a train wreck to a train veering off course only to return yet not reach its destination.\\n\\n\r\nAs far as being a spy show, it mostly succeeds, if not having enough opportunities to turn fate against the young girls. If you're looking for a general rule of cool show with moments of brilliance and fun action atmosphere starring cute girls, you'll get it. However, if you're looking for a well structured narrative with a well realized and fully fleshed out ensemble, you may have to look elsewhere. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 5.5/10 \\n\\n\r\nWhile I did enjoy Princess Principal and it definitely had its high points, it could been so much more if certain decisions didn't break its walls from the inside\\n",

            "content": "There\u2019s something just really dangerously exciting about Princess Principal. Mixing genres of mystery thriller with some bits of science fiction and steampunk, this is a show that proves original anime can still work well with the right talent and creativity. \r\nOriginal anime these days tend to be risky to make despite not falling under adaptation pitfalls. Princess Principal has its risks when it assembles a cast of cute high school girls together in a spy thriller. I have to admit, this show got my adrenaline pumping a bit from the first few episodes. My first impression of this anime started with the setting. It\u2019s innovativeand takes place in a time era of the 19th century in England. A major conflict in the story is about the civil war that separates the Kingdom of Albion into two nations: The Commonwealth and the Kingdom. The female characters consists of high school students working The Commonwealth as undercover spies. In essence, this show is be easily recognizable as a spy thriller fiction. \\n\\n\r\nAccepting the principle cast didn\u2019t take me long but it wasn\u2019t easy to understand them. Remember, they are spies so not everything about them is honest. Not to mention, we don\u2019t get background stories about them in the beginning. However, the show does make time to amplify their personalities. The idea of spies in this show combines elements of espionage, deception, trickery, and even some femme fatale. To be clear, it really brings out what the characters can do as we see how they function as spies. For me personally, I think this anime does a neat job at characterizing the characters\u2019 skill set. The most noticeable spy is Ange with her ability to manipulate others while hiding her true intentions. She\u2019s also adept at changing her personality depending on the situation and highly unpredictable. To be quite honest, she\u2019s pretty much the mastermind of spycraft in this show. Her leadership skills play important roles on missions and I must say, this anime really brings out the most of those abilities. \\n\\n\r\nThe other main characters shouldn\u2019t be underestimated. Dorothy has the feminine charms, firearm skills, and driving talent to carry out her missions. She\u2019s the symbol of the femme fatale and brings out her seductive skills the most. Princess Charlotte serves as the brain of the cast as she is smart and easy to get along with others. Her close friend is Beatrice has the skill to mimic other people\u2019s voices so she should definitely not be underestimated. Finally, Chise serves as the show\u2019s primary fighter with her swordsmanship skills and melee combat abilities. A show with these diverse characters will take the viewers some times to accept as many will find some more likable than others. However, I think the character cast stands out not just by their personalities but also their character relationships. For instance, Ange and Charlotte has a unique relationship that is explored throughout the series. Beatrice\u2019s relationship with the other spies evolves as each episode progresses. By the end of the show, I actually felt like she became a likeable character despite my initial annoyance at her presence. Chise\u2019s relationship is less straightforward with others as she often finds having difficulty expressing herself to others. Despite that, I think the show does a neat job at bringing her character to life by having her work as a spy with Dorothy and Ange. On the other hand, the show\u2019s antagonist roster could really do for some improvement. Hardly any of those are memorable and it feels like the main female grossly overshadow them.\\n\\n\r\nCrafting a show about intelligence activity is no easy task as episode needs to be carefully organized for the story to flow. The show doesn\u2019t take long to get into the mood as it\u2019s eerie and suspenseful. It cleverly tells its background stories for some characters and believe me, they possess a lot of human emotions; some more tragic than others. However, I do have some problems with the pacing on occasions and story structure. It feels out of order at times and some resolutions doesn\u2019t feel as impactful as others. There\u2019s even one episode that I personally thought didn\u2019t develop the story at all around the mid-show. Also, while I like the surprises this anime throws at the audience, it still falls under pitfalls with some generic mystery elements at times. Still, if you toss those drawbacks aside, Princess Principal really stands out as a show that dazzles with what it establishes.\\n\\n\r\nOn the cover, it seems this anime may be misrepresented by the character designs. They look like cute girls so one might wonder how an anime like this can make it into a convincing spy thriller. Make no mistake, this show\u2019s risks pays off with the character designs it works with. From Chise\u2019s assassin style characteristics to the seductive femme fatale of Dorothy, it really does make these characters stand out. It even capitalizes on the characters facial expressions and body language as those are important skill assets for spies. My only problem is with Beatrice as her character look like an immature kid compared to the others. As a spy thriller, also do expect violence to break out although it\u2019s never farfetched to rely shock value to attract the audience. The action has smooth camera angles to showcase what spies can really accomplish. Fan service is minimal with some occasional bath scenes, Dorothy\u2019s feminine charms, and the girls dressing up as spies. Honestly, it\u2019s not distracting. The biggest payoff of the show\u2019s visuals lies with its setting. The steampunk setting of an alternative history really shows creativity from the architectures, vehicles, and innovations.\\n\\n\r\nAnyone who is familiar with Yuki Kajiura will easily recognize her talent in this show with its killer soundtrack. It\u2019s entrancing and hard to ignore by the ears with its every beat. The theme songs has attitude that\u2019s tough and catchy with eerie choreography. The OST relies on its jazz-style and smooth choreography. Finally, I can confess that the main characters\u2019 voice performance is exceptional. Spies are perhaps some of the most difficult characters to portray yet the voice acting all sounds convincing. The ability to change voice tone from one moment instantly to another really bedazzled me. \\n\\n\r\nPrincess Principal ended up as an anime that I surprisingly grew fond of. It took me a little time to accept what it is but it didn\u2019t take long to really get engaged to what it had to offer. Directed by Kazuya Nomura (having previously worked on another spy thriller known as Joker Games), it\u2019s really a show that got me invested time into with its stylish storytelling and psychology. While I admit that not everything flowed perfectly, it didn\u2019t make mistakes that would cause the show to collapse. I can\u2019t say this anime is recommendable for anyone because of what it is. However, it\u2019s definitely an anime to give a chance as it can end up being irresistible. \\n",

            "content": "I remember looking at the summer 17 seasonal charts searching for anime to add on my watch list and the summer 17 season itself had a lot of worthwhile anime such as Made in Abyss, Welcome To the Ballroom, Magical Circle Guruguru, Tsurezure Children and Princess Principal.\r\nBeing a fan of spy genre thanks to the lacks of James Bond, Jason Bourne and other spy anime like Read or Die and of me decided to check out Princess Principal and while I did like the series on my first watch I thought the series wasn't all that special outside of the fight scenes. However, when SentaiFilmworks decided to dub this show a year later I decided to re-watch Princess Principal twice dubbed. One of the re-watches being the chronological order and after re-watching it I went from liking the series to loving it to a point where looking back at the summer 17 season for anime Princess Principal was my favourite anime of that season.\\n\\n\r\nSo what made this series so great you may. Well let's find out, shall we?\\n\\n\r\nStory.\\n\r\nWith the discovery of a mysterious substance called \"Cavorite\", Albion was able to construct a fleet of airships that made Albion the dominant power in the world. However, after the London Revolution, the country was split between the Kingdom and Commonwealth of Albion. The story of Princess Principal follows five girls (Ange, Beatrice, Chise Charlotte and Dorothy) in 19th century London, a city within the Albion Kingdom divided into east and west by a large wall. The girls serve as undercover spies working for the Commonwealth who are enrolled as students at the prestigious Queen's Mayfair school. The girls make use of their individual abilities to remain active in the underground world of disguise, espionage, infiltration, and car chases.\\n\\n\r\nI found the story of Princess Principal to be very fascinating for the most part.\\n\r\nFor starters, the show goes a great job presenting its episodic structure where the first 8 episodes each of the girls would take on cases where either had to defeat set group or steal an important item from set organisation/group. I found all of the case adventures to be all intrusting because not only the series is very intelligent of how the girls deal with the cases but they are all extremely well paced and addicting to watch.\\n\r\nI also really liked how the series was not afraid to into dark territory because some of the cases do not have a happy ending for everyone.\\n\\n\r\nThe one thing that Princess Principal does compare to most modern anime is it has a non-chronological narrative, and the execution was let's just say it was a double-edged sword. While almost all of the problems of Princess Principal get negatived if you watch the show in chronological which I did when watching the dub but if you watched the show when it was airing like most seasonal anime watchers you will start to see the sadly inconsistent directing of the series. One of the many problems that you will encounter when watching the show is episode transitioning where one episode would be balls off the wall action while the next episode it's a full-on slice of life. \\n\r\nThis doesn't there many story elements in Princess Principal as a result ended up being very confusing as the show doesn't do a great job at connecting certain scenes of the series that were very important to the narrative. This is not to say the non-chronological order is all bad though as there's a lot of mystery that plays along with the show narrative and it does pretty nicely for the most part, however, if you're like me who wants to see a consistent narrative I would go with the chronological order. Yes, the non-chronological order may be a fun watch the first time around but it should not be your definitive watch of the series.\\n\\n\r\nFor anyone who is interested in watching the chronological order here's the order in case order.\\n\r\nEpisode 2 > Case 1\\n\r\nEpisode 3 > Case 2\\n\r\nEpisode 5 > Case 7\\n\r\nEpisode 4 > Case 9\\n\r\nEpisode 9 > Case 11\\n\r\nEpisode 1 > Case 13\\n\r\nEpisode 7 > Case 16\\n\r\nEpisode 6 > Case 18\\n\r\nEpisode 8 > Case 20\\n\r\nEpisode 10 > Case 22\\n\r\nEpisode 11 > Case 23\\n\r\nEpisode 12 > Case 24\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe only negative thing I can say about Princess Principal outside the double edge sword non-chronological narrative was the ending. Yes, season 2 is coming this year and all but I felt like show ended in a weak way where it's literally screamed squeal bait.\\n\r\nOverall I really had a blast with Princess Principal Story. Yes, the ending was left to desired as well non-chronological storytelling at times (if you actually decided to watch the show in that order) but other than those shortcomings the story was nicely crafted.\\n\r\n8.5/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacters.\\n\r\nWhen it comes to the characters for Princess Principal, I thought they were all great and memorable.\\n\r\nAnge who despite being mostly emotionless isn't afraid to sacrifice herself just to complete her mission.\\n\r\nDorothy is the most playful and relatable one who uses her feminine charm to get everything that she wants. Also, she is great at driving gateway cars in missions.\\n\r\nCharlotte is the most oddball of the 5 where she uses her powerful connection to get the job done.\\n\r\nBeatrice is the most incontinent out of the bunch and despite her struggling to keep up she has a unique power that allows her to copy anyone voice with her mechanical throat.\\n\r\nLastly, we have Chise who is a strong Japanese sword woman where she is unstoppable as long she has a sword.\\n\\n\r\nDespite the five main girls being clich\u00e9d at first, they are actually great characters who not only developed well but all had the chance to shine on screen. Not to mention the characters interactions with each other was great especially Charlotte and Ange. If I had a favourite out of the five girls, it would be Dorothy as she was the most likeable and relatable character thanks to her fun personality and intriguing backstory.\\n\r\nAs for the villains, I thought they were enjoyable. Yes, some of them were one-note but the one that showed up near the end of the series was pretty interesting.\\n\r\nOverall the characters in Princess Principal are great, and they are easily the main highlight of this anime.\\n\r\n10/10\\n\\n\r\nVisuals.\\n\r\nVisually Princess Principal is great in all areas.\\n\r\nIt does a great job at presenting its world from the far-off Visually where stretches of light contrast with the ever-present darkness that generated a distinctive atmosphere, the old time European designs of roads, buildings, decor, machines to the surprisingly smooth animation that fits well the world that is presented. The charters designs for each of the girls are unique and very appealing to the eye especially the outfits and dresses that they were in the series.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation itself is surprisingly outstanding. The action scenes are well animated, character movement is smooth and the amount of attention to detail thought the series animation is amazing. The series also has some of the best use of CGI as it perfectly fits with the traditional 2D environments.\\n\r\nGreat job Studio 3Hz.\\n\r\n10/10\\n\\n\r\nSound.\\n\r\nThe soundtrack for Princess Principal is pretty great and memorable.\\n\r\nYuki Kajiura once again did a great job with the soundtrack and all of the tracks fit very well the overall Victorian setting of the show.\\n\r\nThe opening theme \"The Other Side of the Wall\" by Void Chords feat MARU where despite being fully in English kickass song that perfectly the setting and tone of the series. Plus it's was sung in full English which was awesome.\\n\r\nThe ending theme A Page of My Story sung by the five main girls of the show is a beautiful ending theme that perfectly closes off the episode of Princess Principal.\\n\r\nNow for sub vs dub.\\n\r\nThe sub is pretty good for what it was that is filled with good Seiyuu performances all across the board however the reason why I didn't release this review back in 2017 is that I wanted to watch/review this show dubbed and I have to now say. Princess Principal is not only the best dubbed from Sentai Filmworks but is also one of the best English Dub I have ever seen. Sentai Filmworks really brought they S game here as every single dub actor was actually British person and they all did a fantastic job with roles that were given especially the five main girls. My favourite dub performance was Elizabeth Bunch as Dorothy. She nailed Dorothy more than the sub counterpart as she actually more Charisma to an already awesome character. Honestly, God bless this dub.\\n\r\n10/10\\n\\n\r\nFinal Thoughts.\\n\r\nOverall I really liked Princess Principal.\\n\r\nDespite the lack of a real ending least as of right now, Princess Principal is a very enjoyable and memorable ride that I enjoyed from start to finish. The story was great and well told, the Victorian London was beautiful, the characters were great and fun to watch and the visuals as well the music was awesome. If you\u2019re looking for a great spy anime that has likeable characters and an engaging story then I strongly recommend Princess Principal.\\n\r\nIt is a fantastic spy anime that no one should miss.\\n\r\nFinal Score 9/10",

            "content": "[THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS]\r\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________\r\n(The Girl from Black Lizard Planet)\r\n\u201cSpy\u201d, whenever I hear that word, I think of James Bond, the Bourne Series, or the Mission Impossible series.  Basically, men with guns with a strong emphasis on action, and less on espionage and infiltration.  However, in this anime, our main characters are not men with guns, rather girls with guns and a lot of wit.  And more emphasis on espionage and infiltration than outright action.  Still get ready for some great spy action, fun and engaging characters, a rocking opening song and intro, and good animation and art.  I certainly enjoyedit, maybe you will too.\\n\\n\r\nSTORY:\\n\\n\r\nUpon reading the MAL synopsis and watching the first two episodes, I had a feeling that this show will be mainly character driven and the episodes will be episodic in nature.  And by the fourth episode, I was correct in my assumption, although having the episodes air non-chronologically was something I had not expected.  Still, for a show that is telling its story non-chronologically, there are certain overarching themes that are addressed.  Some overarching themes that are addressed include: 1) roles, duties, and activities of a spy, 2) the use of deception, and 3) companionship/teamwork.\\n\\n\r\nNow, having said that, the story is good; there are many moments where the technique \u201cshow don\u2019t tell\u201d is cleverly used with minimal use of expositions.  Here are two examples.\\n\\n\r\nExample #1, in the first episode, Ange and Beatrice are tasked to gather intelligence on Eric and to find the younger sister.  While, the exact plans aren\u2019t told to us directly, we, as the viewers, are shown how Ange and Beatrice infiltrate the infirmary, determine which room the young sister might be in, and identify potential counter-agents without one word being spoken nor internal thought.\\n\\n\r\nExample #2, in Episode 4, Ange is tasked with stealing a prototype miniature Cavorite device that the Kingdom had recently developed.  Ange and the others manage to infiltrate the area where the prototype is located.  Ange locates the room where the Cavorite was stored, but is surprised  to find the room is empty.  However, using her own Cavorite and overhearing the guards mention about moving something heavy, she figures out the Cavorite device is being transported on a ship.\\n\\n\r\nOther aspects that I found to be cool, and thus making the story better, were the slick action scenes (e.g. sword fights, gun battles, and hand-to-hand combat), the crazy car chases, and the tension infiltration and scouting missions.  Furthermore, the way each girl, working in a team, used their strengths and abilities to fulfill a mission is gratifying.  \\n\\n\r\nFor example, in Episode 4, the Princess used her strong connections to allow her and the others to infiltrate the ceremony.  Dorothy uses her charm and allure to distract a male guard, thus allowing Ange and Beatrice to sneak pass him.  Beatrice mimics a guard\u2019s voice to avoid be caught by the other guards.  Ange uses her special Cavorite device to fall from high up without taking damage.  And Chise uses excellent sword and hand-to-hand combat abilities to disable multiple guards.\\n\\n\r\nMore aspects that I found to be good is fanservice is not tasteless and random, and the full use of slice of life moments (e.g. working in a morgue, laundry mill, etc) to explore some aspects of the girls\u2019s backstory, explain somethings about the world, or advance some elements of the plot.  And finally, a fantastic ending.  Overall, the story is good.\\n\\n\r\nANIMATION:\\n\\n\r\nThe background design and setting are excellent.  The Victorian era setting is apparent throughout the show from its brick and stone covered streets and buildings to its steampunk technology (e.g. huge airships, steam-powered vehicles, large pipes running on the side of buildings, etc) to its detailed late 19th \u2013 early 20th century fashion.  Moreover, the producers and creators must have done their research for this show, and as it could be seen in the many, variety of vehicles and clothing.  Some vehicles seen include: tourer, Crossley\u2019s, steam-powered boats, trains, and airships, etc.  Some clothing include: maid uniform, laced and wavy ballroom dresses, suits, etc.  And, of course, various types of hats: top hat, flat cap, ascot cap, bowler hat, bonnets, kasa, etc.  Overall, the buildings, cloth design, and vehicles are all drawn very well and are rich in detail.  \\n\\n\r\nThe character designs are very good.  Compared to the male characters, who appear rugged and beardy sometimes, the girls appear cute and very moe-ish, however this is not a detriment, rather it works in the girls\u2019 favor as some of them could use their charm and appeal to allure men into a false sense of security.  As, for the animations, just like its character design, they are great.  In particular, the fight scenes, such as the sword fight on the train, or the use of kicks and hand to hand combat in certain episodes, are fluid and smooth, and have excellent transitions from scene to scene.  There are a few minor problems like animations errors (e.g. Beatrice talking without the mechanical neck device) or some questionable CG characters in the background, still they are negligible.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND:\\n\\n\r\nThe sound design is well-done, especially the voice acting in this show.  For example, the voice actress, Ayaka Imamura, was able to make Ange have a soft and medium pitch voice, however she could use other pitches, such as high (e.g. acting like a schoolgirl) or low (e.g. acting a like a Yankee) to help Ange blend in with her environment/surrounding.  Another example, the voice actress, Akari Kageyama, was able to make Beatrice have a very high pitched voice, but with the assistants of other voice actors (usually male), they could make Beatrice mimic the voices of other characters.  The background songs and noises are excellent and are able to immerse viewers into the world of Princess Principal.  The opening song is sung in English and accompanied with the usually guitars, bass, and drums, but also piano, saxophone, and other instruments.  To me, it sounds like rock music, and not J-Pop, which is a plus in my opinion.  Furthermore, the intro is really cool.  The ending song and intro were okay, but not as good as the opening song.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER:\\n\\n\r\nConsidering that this show is mainly character driven, it\u2019s important for the characters to have some background information, some character development, and some goals and ambitions.  And that we do.  Over the course of twelve episodes, we have learned little bits and pieces about each of our characters.\\n\\n\r\nAnge specializes in infiltration, scouting, disguising, and many more, basically an all-rounder.  And, of course, she tells many lies throughout the series, and is able to change her personality whenever the situation arises.  Her training is shown in Episode 10, where she, Dorothy and another student were the only people to pass the class and officially become spies.  Another important revelation was revealed in Episode 8, which provides evidences as to why Ange is also good in the arts and crafts.  Her main goal is make the Princess\u2019s wish/dream come true.  \\n\\n\r\nChise is a foreign exchange student from Japan, who specializes in assassinations and combat, and has trouble understanding the European culture.  This cultural conflict is perfectly highlighted in Episode 9, where she writes a letter to her sister about her thoughts concerning her colleagues, her school\u2019s meals and curricular activities, and how she\u2019s coping with the new environment.  Her backstory is revealed in Episode 5, where she meets everyone for the first time.  And, while her backstory is somewhat cliched, it showed some principles that she values, such as honor and forgiveness.  Her main mission is to report to Lord Horikawa, and decide whether to side with the Kingdom or Commonwealth.  \\n\\n\r\nBeatrice is a nice and reserved girl, who serves as the Princess\u2019s aid and close friend.  Her ability to mimic the voices of other people is revealed in Episode 3, in the form of a tragic backstory.  And while, how she got her mechanical device is sad, she is able to use it to fool the enemy, thus making missions slightly more easier.  Her main goal is to the protect Princess and to support her cause.\\n\\n\r\nDorothy is a 20-years-old uncover student, who acts as the team\u2019s leader.  It has been shown on numerous occasions that she\u2019s an excellent driver, a master sharpshooter, and adept at the art of seduction.  Her backstory and real name is revealed in Episode 6, where it explores the bleak relationships between her and her father.  Her main goals are unknown.\\n\\n\r\nPrincess has a calm and somewhat strange personality, who uses her connections and diplomatic relation to assist Ange and others in certain missions (e.g. Episode 4 and 7).  A surprising revelation is revealed in Episode 8, which highlights how determined she really is.  Her main goals is to become Queen and to unite the Country.\\n\\n\r\nAll and all, each character (minus some annoyance with Beatrice) is fun and entertaining.  And, I wished a second season was announced, so that we can explore more about who they are, and watch as they go on their crazy spy missions.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT:\\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed this show immensely.  It was a fun ride.  From its engaging, non-chronological story-line to its rich environment and setting to its fun and enjoyable characters.  This was one show I had underestimated, and I\u2019m glad I started to watch this show earlier than later.  I recommend everyone to watch this show, even if you\u2019re not a fan of the genre or moe-ish character design.",

            "content": "Princess Principal is a show I would have been unlikely to put high priority on watching, but the fact that a bunch of people I knew were planning to watch and review it instantly got it on the table for me. While I was far too slow to join them, I nonetheless made sure to push through later, and here we are. And Princess Principal's concept IS interesting enough. You don't really get a lot of anime spy shows, for example. The recent Joker Game anime, which I still need to watch, was one of the first examples to come to my head. Joker Game,from what I saw, looked a bit underwhelming, so I went into Princess Principal hopeful it would be better.\\n\\n\r\nPrincess Principal's chief issue lies in the characters, as there is absolutely no character development throughout its twelve episode run time. Each character gets at least one background one shot story to give you an idea of how they joined the team or got to where they are, but they are essentially never relevant to the plot (Beatrice's in particular is barely even seen, let alone matters) and do not end up driving much of anything or even giving us much more of a sense of the characters. Chise's is the closest and it is still mostly tepid, although it at least has a full and complete self contained story...and then she got another generic focus episode that served solely to show off characters you don't care about who will never appear again and stuff you already knew!\\n\\n\r\nI like the idea of how the background stories were structured, starting us with the team on a mission already and then slowly showing us how they got here while mixing in more present episodes, but the fact that these backstory episodes are totally lacking in substance just kills the concept in the crib. The princess was just about the only character I thought was interesting, although she is a pretty unrealistic character, because her episodes were executed somewhat different than normal via the latter episodes. It was more tied into the overall story than the one shots and offered more character insight in the process. Can't go into too much detail here since it'd be a spoiler, although you will most likely figure out what happened by the end of the second episode.\\n\\n\r\nThe overall series plot is only barely existent, with the series largely consisting of one shots and an ending 2-parter. The 2-parter would have definitely benefited from some foreshadowing. It wouldn't be hard to tie more of the one shots in to it when almost none do. For example the episode about smuggling nerve gas through could have instead been about smuggling through some materials which are used in the final episode. You know, basic stuff. Granted, the finale isn't good either and has one of the goofier villain exits I've seen as they escape the plot after suffering a minor setback.\\n\\n\r\nThe one shots aren't that great either and suffer from an issue that the first episode already kind of tries to spell out (albeit trying to spin it as a good thing) and which is obvious from just watching 1-2 episodes more: Nearly every episode of this show is going to have some kind of plot twist shoehorned into it. Once the viewer understands this, almost every episode becomes painfully predictable as despite the show trying to sell you on \"twists\" it never really tries to be inventive, do anything new or even execute what it does in a manner that advances the characters. I wouldn't mind the lack of inventiveness if not for the last point, as the execution is pretty much boring and expected without using it to enhance the show. Episode 6 was the height of this to me: Unless you either have somehow not gotten what this show is about at that point or have never seen this style of plot before, you will figure out exactly what is going to happen at least halfway through the episode if not sooner. It was extremely disappointing and going for a different ending which could further Dorothy's character would have made it much more engaging.\\n\\n\r\nThis is compounded by the fact that this is one of those series where all of the characters are unbelievably competent and thus makes it difficult to feel tension in scenes. Most of the time, their plots don't even go all that wrong and thus there is not a lot of challenge felt: There are a pair of recurring antagonists so forgettable I don't even remember their names and they always come off as less competent than the show presents them due to repeatedly losing and being foiled in frequently easy ways. When the show tries to end on a stinger of them preparing for future conflicts, it is difficult to take them seriously due to this. For an idea of how unbelievably competent some characters are, the backstory of one says that they cannot read or write, but that they then learned NINE LANGAUGES...without anyone helping them. While also learning about 10 other listed things! It completely destroys any willing suspension of disbelief when it is so outrageous, especially since the setting otherwise plays out as somewhat realistic but with some ill defined magitech.\\n\\n\r\nIf there's one thing Princess Principal did solidly enough, it was the art and sound. All of the girls are reasonably cute, the background art is at times fairly pretty, it has a very victorian feel to it mixed with some industrial stuff, so if nothing else that works. The CGI on the other hand is pretty hit or miss. Stuff like the car is usually fine if sometimes a bit jarring, but the last car chase scene for example looks pretty bad (the CGI train made me laugh for a bit, which is not what you want from your dramatic heart pounding scene usually!). The soundtrack was a bit more forgettable, but there were some decent background tracks and the OP and ED are solid. Overall, this was one area where Princess Principal largely felt reasonable.\\n\\n\r\nI was honestly somewhat surprised by how much I disliked this series by the end of it. It started off fairly standard and I thought it would be some general 4-6 star anime fodder. Instead the complete lack of character progression, lackluster one shot plots, lack of an overarching story and absence of tension completely stifled the show for me and left it a pointless slog. I would recommend avoiding this anime unless you are a hardcore spy fan (although you might even be more annoyed by me at how lackluster it is if you're hardcore into the genre), have some character design or part of the concept really jump out or simply want to watch as much anime as possible.",

            "content": "There are many ways in which a show can be a disappointment. Weak characters, a lackluster plot, the possibilities seem endless. The same goes for Princess Principal. Set in the industrial age of an alternative timeline in which London currently is split into two by a gigantic wall, separating the two main political factions akin to Berlin in the Cold War, the sheer number of possible intriguing storylines is overwhelming. Add to that possible conflict in the inner workings of said factions, espionage,  the gorgeous steampunk aesthetic as well as the kicking soundtrack and you are left with as many possible turn-ons as inthe cockpit of an airplane. While, granted, having a safe flight which means not using all the \u201cturn-ons\u201d is a good thing when talking about your average airplane, this does not translate to anime. However, sadly, this is where the main problem, the main disappointment of this show lies: It doesn\u2019t do anything out of the ordinary and plays it too safe. The political sub-plot is never really expanded upon, the fun espionage of the first two episodes grows stale over time, the potential of the setting is left unutilized.\\n\\n\r\nFair warning: This review contains spoilers!\\n\\n\r\nThe main difference between shows that are just bad and those that are disappointing is at times slim, but it can be condensed to a simple word: Promise. For better or worse, the first two episodes of Princess Principal were actually creative and fun to watch. While episode 1 is a lot more action-centered and investigative, it also sets up future conflict, hinting at the possibility of betrayal in the group of spies and establishing a feeling of distance between the characters. The second episode then first shows the spies really at work in an exhilarating episode brimming with creativity, as they \u201cinfiltrate\u201d a party in the enemy camp and, through clever and inventive usage of their limited repertoire of tools, manage to prevail. This is also the first time that Ange and Princess trick their \u201ccolleagues\u201d, a recurring theme in the show. In the meantime a potential villain, the Duke of Normandy, gets introduced.\\n\\n\r\nWith such a solid build-up, you\u2019d expect the pieces to slowly fall into place. Unfortunately this is not the case for Princess Principal. Instead, the episodic non-chronological format results in the show slowly but drastically losing steam. Because we follow episodic plots, there is no time left to develop the political sub-plot which in turn gets degraded into a mere tool to cause conflict later on. There is no greater reason as to why the creators chose to do so. The non-chronological order, unlike in other series, didn\u2019t really add anything of substance to the story and as a consequence of the episodic plot, the story itself also suffers.\\n\\n\r\nFocus of the episodic plots is more often than not one of the spies of the main group. A lingering feeling of repetition is present throughout all of them. That is, because there is a lot of repetition. Over half of the cast has a tragic father figure as a means of creating a feeling of pity for the character which feels tired and trite. The characters themselves, because of the sheer absence of character development apart from a \"sad\" backstory, end up being flat. Beatrice has only two character traits: her father has implanted a robotic device into her and she likes Princess a lot. This does, however, not only apply to Beatrice, it is instead applicable to all of the \u201cminor\" spies: Chise is kind of an airhead but is very fond of traditional japanese things. Over the course of the show she fights and kills her father. She grows fond of the group and respecting of Princess and her goals. Dorothy is older than the rest of the cast and good at anything \u201cadult\u201d like driving and seducing men. Her father beat her when she was a kid, but when they grow closer again in one of the episodes, her father ends up being killed by an underling of the Duke of Normandy.\\n\\n\r\nThere are only two interesting characters in this show, namely Princess and Ange, the main duo of the show. While it is clear from the beginning that they have some kind of special relationship, the idea that they were friends that through some means \u201cswitched places\u201d sounds like something straight out of a fairy tale, and in a good way. Not only is this turn of events at first inherently interesting as a substitute of the non-existent plot, it also serves to give Princess a reason for her angelic behaviour, her plan to both tear down the physical wall that separates the people as well as the wall in Ange's heart and the hearts of the people, a very heartwarming albeit boring goal and motivation. \\n\\n\r\nBut it isn\u2019t all gold that shines. This central event, this central plot twist entails a number of weak and boring narrative turns. The foreshadowed \u201clying between spies\u201d of episode 1 ends up restricting itself to only this one central \u201clie\u201d. The tearing-down of the wall in the hearts of the people restricts itself to one final episode and the only time we see it in action is when all of the main characters come together in the final episode and Ange opens up to her colleagues. Not only does the plot end up feeling extremely rushed because the main twist was introduced too late, the main twist entails the most boring, the most trite of storytelling. It goes against the idea of seclusion and secrecy and advocates change in favor of more inclusion and a feeling of unity. Friendship prevails and after one admittedly major incident, the conflict in the inner workings of the faction of the Commonwealth, sparked by the military, is instantly resolved. The final timeskip in the last episode further rubs it in: Princess Principal never even tried to tell an engaging story, it was merely satisfied with hinting at one and then following the most conventional storytelling possible. The finale is entirely anticlimactic.\\n\\n\r\nMost of the time is spent on the numerous missions of the main group which take place in various locations which are all admittedly very interesting and different. Working in a morgue, infiltrating the enemy base, close quarters combat on a train, entering an airship. All of the missions sound very different on paper and well, most of them are. However, when Princess Principal falls flat, it really does. Apart from the missions/episodes that focus on one character of the cast, the missions are very stale in nature. This is mainly because none of them feel as smart and creative as the exhilarating episode 2. They end up following a formula that relies on each character\u2019s respective specialty: Princess serves as an entry ticket, Dorothy can drive and divert the attention of male guards, Beatrice can imitate the voice of an officer/guard or the like, Chise can basically fight an army by herself and Ange can fly and do humanly impossible stuff like listening to a two-digit number of audio channels at once. This formula results in both engagement and tension being lost because the missions feel too simple, too easy. It feels like nothing is at stake, and if something goes wrong it feels forced because it doesn\u2019t align with the established formula. Another annoyance is that the main characters can basically not be hit by gunshots unless the plot demands it, eventual hits feel very sudden and out of place, as if they don\u2019t belong. Overall, Princess Principal\u2019s reliance on the specialties of their characters is akin to the narrative shooting itself in the foot.\\n\\n\r\nPrincess Principal at its best looks great, especially Chise\u2019s close-quarter fights look very nice, fluid and are a joy to watch. Personally, I am also a big fan of the steampunk aesthetic, the airships, or all vehicles for that matter, look beautiful and detailed. Anything else however, while never unpleasant, isn\u2019t quite up to par with the near visual spectacle of infiltrating airships or exhilarating car rides. The character designs of the main cast are for the most part distinctive enough, but they aren\u2019t exactly anything noteworthy. What is noteworthy about the character designs as a whole is the usage of preferably round, cutesy moe faces for the female characters which at times clashes with the more realistic character designs of their male counterparts.\\n\\n\r\nThe case of Princess Principal is a peculiar one. The show tries to do something unique with its non-chronological, episodic format, but at the same time it plays it too safe and ends up following both the formulas of screenwriting and its own formulas for spying missions too closely. It tries to both innovate and not do anything out of the ordinary. The aftermath of this discrepancy is a cast of mostly flat characters, repetitive plotlines and formulaic missions. Although the show can be fun at times, it isn\u2019t more than an okay show with poorly structured plot that cannot rise above its own genericness. It was sometimes fun while it lasted, but ultimately I recommend skipping this show.\\n",

            "content": "On the surface, Princess Principal ticks all the boxes for elements I like in anime, Victorian Steampunk, dark gritty environments, intrigue and mystery with a dash of light-heartedness on the side. With Studio 3Hz on board as one of the main studios, how could I pass this up? 3Hz also made my favorite anime of all time, Flip Flappers. So how does it compare? Some minor spoilers follow.\r\nWell, the more keened eye amongst you may notice that Okouchi is head of the writing staff. The guy infamous for his trainwrecks both lovely and grand such as Code Geass or Kabaneri of the Iron Fortress. Ithought that even if the overall story wasn't any good, I'd still be in for a smashing good time. Sadly (or thankfully) the team seemed to have sedated him or placed him under heavy medication, as Princess Principal ended up having a competent story throughout.\\n\\n\r\nNotice that I used the word \"Competent\", not \"Interesting\". I admit, perhaps it was a bit naive of me to enter this with high hopes of it replacing Flip Flappers as my favorite anime, but Princess Principal felted mostly like wasted potential. To elaborate further, while the first two episodes may hint at a series focusing on espionage and drama, Princess Principal is a largely Slice-Of-Life series where cute spy girls do cute spy things. Sure, some episodes may feature slightly more dire stakes than the previous episodes, but this is negated by the fact that Princess Principal, uniquely I may add, jumbles up its episode order for a majority of episodes (with the last two episodes being the major exceptions).\\n\\n\r\nIt's as if the team wanted to make a 24-episode anime but due to whatever reasons, budgetary or creative, they settled with 12 but the individual case episode encompass the range of 1 to 24, exemplified by how the first episode is Case 13 while the second episode is the true starting point chronologically. In spite of (or maybe even due to) this unique way of working around restrictions in episode count, the pacing of the series is greatly crippled. An action-packed episode may follow a slow slice-of-life episode for instance. Adding to the episodic nature of the series, the loose thread connecting the episodes with each other just simply isn't prevalent enough, and you'd be forgiven if you lost the direction the plot is heading into. Worse is how interesting elements  unique to the Princess Principal universe (such as cavorite poisoning, The British Empire being split in half, Normandy belonging to Britain instead of France) don't play any significant role in the plot. The series ends hinting at a continuation in the future, which would sting if the series never gets an extension. If you thought the Cavorite jungle shown in the opening was ever going to make an appearance, you'd be sorely mistaken. And remember the Duke of Normandy? He\u2019s going to appear in a pop quiz at the end of the review. So be prepared!\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of characters, the main cast is quite likable, although Ange\u2019s \u201cBlack Lizard\u201d schtick and Chise\u2019s \u201cFresh off the Boat\u201d gag do get old. One complaint I have is with regards to the antagonists throughout the series. The Duke of Normandy for instance, despite being labelled as a major antagonist on the show\u2019s website, he\u2019s mostly a no-show for most episodes, and it\u2019s not like his devious schemes are of any relevance to the show. He\u2019s just some old guy with glasses. A rival character with abilities rivalling Ange is introduced extremely late into the story, with her appearance essentially being sequel-bait material. She\u2019s by far the most interesting character outside the main cast due to her appearing for over 10 minutes, but her presence is too little too late to elevate the cast of characters to anything special.\\n\\n\r\nThe director once mentioned the focus of the series was on the relationship/romance between Ange and Princess. Ange and Princess are embroiled in a Prince-and-the-Pauper scenario, further intensified after the London Revolution. While I do applaud the writing team at moments for a select choice of scenes starring the two (most notably episode 8), their relationship doesn't come to the forefront that often, and their relationship isn't any more meaningful beyond Princess being a slightly more competent damsel-in-distress. \\n\\n\r\nAnd there's that word again. Competent. Competent is also how I'd describe the writing throughout the series as well. It's generally good and will leave you interested (most of the time), but nothing special. There are also some glaring moments where they want you to feel a certain emotion but regrettably don't have the talents to make such a scene pop. The example I'm using is that dreadful Chise scene in episode 5. Her \"Pain Pain Go Away\" line to that lone orphan  feels tacked on just for this episode, so you just know it\u2019s going to be cruelly twisted at the end . When the plot twist comes and Chise is tearing up, I felt nothing but my head tilting down in shame. And this incident is completely forgotten in subsequent episodes. Classy.  A slightly better way to remedy this is to have the line be part of her characterisation and introduce it in an earlier episode. It's not an elegant solution, but it's better than what we have. That is not to say there aren't moments that elicited a reaction from me, the ending to episode 6, while predictable, left me in goosebumps thanks to its brilliant direction and execution.\\n\\n\r\nI've been complaining a lot about this series, so you might be wondering : Why even bother? Well, Princess Principal is still fairly entertaining as a whole. The animation vividly captures the action and the audio mixing is superb. And as I said earlier, the direction in general is a cut above average and the execution of the scenes ultimately leaves one enthralled. In addition, I do appreciate how the series portrays the Victorian Era as not entirely cog sunshines and metal rainbows, depicting aspects such as poverty and the prevalence of child labor in London, something most media set in this period generally gloss over. It\u2019s not even window dressing either, the themes of wealth disparity even comes into play for a few of the episodes and I do appreciate them for at least trying to depict this otherwise commonplace setting a little differently.\\n\\n\r\nIn the end however, Princess Principal is simply a competent anime. It\u2019s good but not spectacular. If this ever gets a second season, I\u2019d highly recommend you check it out. However, since the survival of this series is still uncertain, it\u2019s difficult to recommend this show on a whim. The series simply doesn\u2019t do anything substantial or unique to warrant a viewing. \\n\\n\r\n6/10\\n\r\nAbove Average, not worth going out of your way to watch.\\n\\n\r\nNow then, remember the Duke of Normandy? You don\u2019t? Me neither. I don\u2019t even remember the question I was about to ask! But I don\u2019t blame you, I didn\u2019t think he was that important anyway.\\n",

Disappointing would be the most accurate description, because the show introduces tempting setting, interesting characters and unconventional story telling while doing nothing with those ideas. Another aspect not working at all (for me), is conjunction of moe elements and mature themes. \r\nSTORY:What story?\r\nPlot of Princess Principal is told out of order, not chronologically. There are shows, which utilized this structure to craft compelling and intriguing stories. PriPri is not one of them. Almost all episodes are stand alone events and are hardly connected by overarching plotlines. A simple case ofthe week show. Furthermore, the show has no mystery elements, the biggest plot twist is spoilered in ep. 2.\\n\r\nPacing is also all over the place. Ep. 6 tried to introduce/develope one protagonist with backstory and interaction with another charakter, ending on an emotional high note. However, this relationship felt rushed and the ending forced. Events like this need more screentime to create an impact, since the themes of Princes Principal are rather dark and mature. On the other hand ep. 7 was a boring sitting with convoluted B-plot.\\n\r\nDespite being a show about spies, there is surprisingly little actual spying going on, like political intrigues. PriPri cannot create moments of genuine urgency or danger, due to strong episodic structure and subpar writing. The last 2 episodes try to create a dramatical finale but fail in a spectacular fashion, because the \"evil\" comes out of nowherer. Looking back, the overall plot did not move a step, if you compare the reall first episode and the last one. The reason for zero plot progression is severe focus on character development.  \\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS: Interessting but underused.\\n\r\n5 main characters are interesting, diverse and have more than one quirk going for them. In general a well balanced cast that is fun to watch. Chise takes the first spot in authenticity, followed by Dorothy. Well, those two got the most interesting arcs. However, those are not spies, but cute girls in a hard world, victimized for the sake of the plot. \\n\\n\r\nARTWORK & ANIMATION: Expensive rag rug.\\n\r\nCharakter models and backgrounds are detailed; animation, especially in all hand to hand combat scenes, is great. Unfortunatelly, the artwork itself, while detailed, is a Frankenstein's monster. ALL women, most notably the main cast, look like charakters from a moe slice of life show, while all men look menacing and grim. And all spy outfits appear rather cutesy than practical. This moe look does not mash well with dark and mature themes of the show and can lower the impact of emotional scenes. As if the artwork is the only way to underline injustice.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND: Good. \\n\r\nMemorable OP and solid voice act are speaking in favor of the show.",

Check\r\nPrincess Principal is my Anime of the Season. When I first heard about it, I didn't come with high expectations. I thought it'll be some generic action/magic anime or a \"Cute Girls Doing Cute Things\" anime.\r\nOh, I was wrong. Princess Principal DOES have only female characters as main characters, and yes, they are pretty cute, but the last thing you'll say about them is that they're doing cute things. (Well, that is of course if you do not consider killing people \"cute things\")\r\nPrincess Principal is an episodic anime,each episode isn't related to the one before, and aren't released chronologically. Some of them show history and background of the characters. Most of the anime is like that, but at some point it airs a few episodes in a row which are also chronologically connected.\\n\\n\r\nI wouldn't want to spoil, but there's some kind of twist we see early on which makes the show a bit more confusing, but a lot more interesting.\\n\\n\r\nOne of the things that amazed is the setting.\\n\r\nThe steampunk setting is presented well. The world, the buildings, the poverty vs the rich, the clothes, the soldiers, the weapons, the cars. All of it looked faithful to the 19th century.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters don't fall into the normal anime tropes. We don't have the \"tsundere\" for example who is just a \"tsundere\" without any traits.\\n\\n\r\nAll of the characters are interesting, likeable and different. All of them are spies (as said in the synopsis) but each has her own fighting style, the way she acts, handles the tasks or her friends and such.\\n\\n\r\nTalking about the art- If you saw screenshots or action sequences you could see that it's a beauty. Looks really good, pleasing to the eye and pretty detailed.\\n\\n\r\nLastly, the music. One of thr stronger aspects of the show. The Opening song is my favorite from this season, and is a good contender for the best Opening song of the year for me. The ED is pretty good as well, soothing after a tense episode.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack (OST) is on point, adds a lot to the viewing experience.\\n\\n\r\nI'm still not sure on my score, I want to give it either 9 or 10. For this review I'll go with 9.5 .\\n\\n\r\nI recommend Princess Principal.\\n\\n\r\nTL;DR Amazing anime, my AOTS. Interesting story, amazing action, music and art. Recommended.",

A wall has been erected, separating the two sides between the Commonwealth, and the Kingdom. \r\nStory- 10\r\nWhile I went in with low expectations, I was greatly surprised by the intricacies of this show and how the plot begins to unravels as the story has progressed. Overall, the plot and animation is solid, and it walks the fine line of leaving us with questions and answering some that comes with a good spy show. I have no doubt it will be one of the most popularshows of the season. \\n\\n\r\nArt- 8\\n\r\nThe art in this show is pretty amazing. I think that the animators went in with a solid vision, and executed it perfectly. Nothing about how this world is set up makes it seem like they didn't have a clear vision in mind, and I appreciate that. \\n\\n\r\nSound-9\\n\r\nPrincess Principal's sound/ost is masterfully done by Yuki Kajiura who is known for doing some of the best ost's out there.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters- 9\\n\r\nWhile we don't know too much about them at this point, episode 3 in particular begins to let you understand the characters more. Because they are both teenage girls and spies, we don't know too much about the individuals, which only adds to their individual appeals. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment- 9\\n\r\nThis may be a little high, but I've always been a big fan of the spy genre, especially set in England (James Bond, anyone?) \\n\\n\r\nOverall- 9 \\n\r\nAt this point, it may seem a little high, but I feel that after these two episodes, I'm invested enough, and left wanting more. A tell-tale sign of a good anime IMO.",

And secondly, I binged watched this in one go, so my experience may differ from the few scathing reviews of this show.\r\nThis is a spoiler-free review. (i hope)\r\nThis anime knows what switch to flip for a binge watcher like me. While the episodes are not in chronological order (episode 1's title is called case 13, 'nuff said), this helps the audience piece together the story behind the girls. That is why the scathing reviews make no sense to me whatsoever. Each episode provides a little nugget of thegirls' day-to-day activities, and each mission the team does, paints an image and offers a deeper understanding on the many aspects of the conflict between the Kingdom and the Commonwealth.\\n\\n\r\nThe episodes are enjoyable - heartwarming even, while others keep one at the edge of suspense, amazement, and awe of the individual character's personalities (loved the end of episode 1). \\n\\n\r\nWhile there are some predictable twists, I do not think that they should affect one's enjoyment of a show. What I seek was character driven plot, and I felt that Princess Principle did it very well.\\n\\n\r\nThe art was very well done too, the background were very captivating and immersive. The girls had nice designs, and were drawn consistently. The show is just simply pleasing to look at.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound is a 10/10 for me. The opening is catchy, and the ending helps to wind the day down. The soundtracks used complements the action in the screen, and really adds to the enjoyment. \\n\\n\r\nAlso, the OST is by Yuki Kajiura, make what you have to with this information.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Princess Principle is one of the hidden gems of the summer season, and one that I enjoyed thoroughly. However, the story is incomplete, and I hope for a second season.",

            "content": "Princess Principal a title that could mislead any viewer. First, you could think that the show is about a school and girls. Then you could start considering any slice of life plot and girls related storytelling and few moments about spying. I must say, it is wrong. \r\nStory: 8/10\r\nPrincess Principal has a very creative plot with an impressive storytelling that could surprise a lot of spectators. The story deals with espionage in a divided nation, nothing to do with a slice of life plot. The spies are young girls that use their student status as a cover. During the day, they are typical students andwhen the duty calls they transform into dangerous and very skilled spies with particular abilities.  \\n\\n\r\nOne of the possible issues found in the forums and some reviews is the lack of a plot sequence that changes between some episodes. I want to say that the storytelling focuses on \"file cases\" so each episode is a different mission and the principal idea (espionage) remains. This method helps with the pacing because the story is always advancing and changing. Also, the show doesn't need a sequence to connect the story. Furthermore, each episode keeps adding information to the main arc, and the characters background. I consider that constant additions a plus. \\n\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9/10\\n\r\nThe art is \"steampunk.\" It is stunning and formidable that goes well with the color palette, the mechanical design, and the character's concept. You can notice that some areas don't have the standard lighting because they like to create a dark ambient. Also, the art helps a lot with the storytelling, timeline, and the possible fantastic ideas such us the use of the mineral \"Cavorite.\" For experience, someone could find the steampunk art weird or not attractive. However, it isn't a reason to drop the anime. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 8/10\\n\r\nThe sound is great. They elaborated a complex sound mix with a delightful soundtrack. The sound of each action sequence adds emotion to the plot and is played at the right time. The songs are good. For me, the OP is excellent, and the ED isn't bad.  \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 8/10 \\n\r\nWe have five main characters. I decided to give them nicknames. Dorothy \"The face,\" Agne \"The liar,\" Beatrice \"The voice,\" Chise \"The stranger,\" and Princess \"The usurper.\" With that original nickname, you can start guessing about their background. \\n\\n\r\nIn more detail, Dorothy is the leader of the group but is the one that enjoys the freedom; she is more the \"sempai\" of all them. \\n\\n\r\nAgne. We don't know when she is lying or telling the truth but is a character that will give up everything for someone or the mission. She has some hidden secrets. \\n\\n\r\nChise has high values for her tradition and displays her unsatisfaction when she isn't considered as a useful part of the group. \\n\\n\r\nBeatrice is the most insecure member of the team, but her skills are convenient on every mission.  \\n\\n\r\nFinally the Princess, she is more an actress but with a defined goal. \\n\\n\r\nFor me, each character is different and not generic. These girls have their problems, a painful past, they have secrets, and they take their own decisions to complete an objective. In other words, the characters have a spy profile that works with the plot.  \\n\\n\r\nSomething I enjoyed is the extra background information given. On each episode, we could have more details about each character. I know that some of the outcomes could be predictable but not all them. Additionally, the characters emotions evolve during the story, and we could see unexpected decisions that indicate a proper background build. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9/10\\n\r\nIn summary, I have few negative aspects about this anime and are insignificant for this review. Each episode left me a good sensation and entertained a lot. I enjoyed this animation. The pacing, the storytelling, the art, the sound blended well and created a show that deserves to be watched and repeated in the future. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9/10\\n\r\nFinally, the character design is stunning. We can't find this art quality (steampunk) in the recent original animations. The sound mix complements each episode.  The story isn't weird and doesn't need a complicated plot to capture our attention. I consider this anime very attractive and unique. For example, the character backgrounds and the file cases weren't repetitive, and the extra additions to background keep the viewers hooked all the time. You should give the first episode a try. You won't be disappointed. Actas and Studio 3Hz did a splendid job. \\n",

            "content": "Princess Principal oddly enough is kinda reminiscent of a popular cartoon, which gained popularity in all of the Western world\u2019s kids\u2019 programmes in one way or another and I\u2019m sure you know which series I mean if you ever watched one episode of both shows. \u201cHere we go again, we\u2019re going on the road, till\u2019 we stop. And then we\u2019ll shop\u201d might be the biggest clue I am giving you here, but if this lyrical masterpiece of an opening theme might still not manage to draw your attention to what I\u2019m talking about, I might just spill the beans right here: Totally Spies. An alreadypretty stupid kids\u2019 show, mainly targeting a female audience with the estimated age of 10-14, gets its \u201canime adaptation\u201d in a now pretty promising setting, leaving loads of potential to set up an intriguing political thriller including the spy-mechanisms unutilized. It fails to pack any sort of punch in this very serious setting, but unlike a kids' show like Totally Spies, its presentation does indicate that Princess Principal does not leave the slightest clue during the entire runtime, that it is even aware of how stupid it actually is, making me consider to put bitchin' Totally Spies as the superior work comparing these two with one another. So, what exactly did go wrong in the story which plays out in the split superpower of Albion, located in Europe and divided into the Commonwealth and the Kingdom of Albion, setting its border right in the city of London?\\n\\n\r\nMinor spoilers, mostly about the first half ahead.\\n\\n\r\nAs the setup itself practically screams \u2018promising\u2019 right into your face regarding the potential a country-conflict like this could have regarding a literal \u201cwar of spies\u201d, it makes it even more disappointing, that it would\u2019ve been shut down by loads of conveniences one after another. It only appears decent on paper, rather than in the actual conversion of it. While we get a big info drop right at the start, explaining how Albion grew to be the powerhouse of Europe now riddled by lots of riots and an actual split of countries in terms of interest and territory in kind of a cool way, it more or less takes a huge backseat to the character conflicts our main team faces during their missions in an episodic fashion. This in itself can be great if executed correctly, but oh boy it sure doesn\u2019t know how to do so, but we\u2019ll get to that aspect later in this review. The core complain I have regarding the matter here is, that it basically betrays the idea we get from episode 1, which might\u2019ve been riddled with inconsistencies in terms of writing writing all over the place (Ange literally silencing a patient by hand and drugging them dressed as a nurse, while the other patients not even trying to say anything about it in an open room, only leading to a hilarious reaction face by the woman lying in bed in vis-\u00e0-vis position) and the core conflict being cookie-cutter at best, it still gave me a somewhat thrilling ride to enjoy. My enjoyment for this probably only issued from some flashy choices in the presentation during the action scenes and a neat colour-palette though, which left the show any way in later episodes.\\n\\n\r\nNagging about the conveniences the team of spies faces in their individual missions, making the facade of this work crumble in almost every episodic conflict the characters face, wouldn't do me any good if I did not offer some more examples, which can be narrowed down to some general ideas on writing-mistakes made during the production. The first general complaint I have is, that the characters in the show are depicted as being in another league of intelligence when they finesse their opposing counterparts as e.g. several guards, but that\u2019s mostly because those are almost always depicted as generally retarded from my point of view. Falling more than 5 times to the likes of a woman with exposed bosom, is just a sign that the writers were too lazy to think of anything else, leading to me not appreciating on how the team does things, but rather to me not being able to wrap my head about how easy their job is in hindsight. That doesn\u2019t only apply to mere guards, core participants in the normally overshadowed political conflict act that way and seem to have no intelligence of their own. I\u2019m aware that this is something a lot of works covering espionage fail to deliver well, but there\u2019s such a thing as \u201cgoing too far\u201d with it for me. On the other side of things, there definitely are characters that know way more about what the spies are planning as they should and get the information the audience is getting too, from whatever source that is, as the show doesn\u2019t bother to explain that. A good example for this is the devotee of the Kingdom of Albion, disguised as a soldier of the Commonwealth, experimenting with neurotoxins and eventually going full-rampage-mode against the company which does the laundry to hide his secret, as his uniform got picked up accidentally against his own will. Where he even should know that they\u2019re doing chemical tests to find him here is beyond my knowledge, as there was nothing or even a hint that this paranoid fellow did know so.\\n\\n\r\nThe second big complaint I harbour towards the work is, that the gadgets of the team and insane fighting capability of our samurai loli just outmatch those of their opponents by a landmile, making thoughts like \u201cwow, they\u2019re not gonna make it for once\u201d practically impossible. There\u2019s one such as having a lipstick with an implemented laser in it or a Swiss Army Shoe (better watch The Naked Gun instead) to give the spies a little advantage, but in Princess Principle we have a \u201cC-Ball\u201d, that gives you power to literally control gravity to your will and a lot of other conveniences, depending on whether direction the plot wants to progress. Additionally, the series has no chill regarding its presentation, which leads it to make a fool out of itself most of the time. Victimization is omnipresent and trying too hard to make you feel engaged (Dorothy\u2019s backstory, Ange\u2019s meeting with the girl on the streets), leading to it trying to hammer the message of \u2018the world is so cruel!!\u2019 laughably hard into your head and failing at virtually every single attempt. Also, following up a supposedly meaningful commentary about political conflicts, basically referencing the Latin quote of \u201chomo homini lupus\u201d, with a casual talk about what name would fit a girly team of spies well during tea-time might not be the best of ideas in terms of presentation:\\n\\n\r\n\u201cThis world isn\u2019t black and white, only black and grey. And the princess is grey. Keep a constant watch on her\u201d. *eerie music in the background*\\n\r\nFollowed up by more precedent matters as \u201clet\u2019s name ourselves team carrot\u201d \u2013 \u201cI don\u2019t like carrots\u201d. Welp, this might really by the espionage-version of K-ON, they even dress the same way during their missions and concerts.\\n\\n\r\nI already highlighted the problems surrounding these main character conflicts during its episodical storytelling, but these conflicts aren\u2019t much to write home about either, ranging from pretty decent (Ange\u2019s and Princess\u2019 relation) to utterly terrible and clich\u00e9 (almost anything else), which gets me even more salty about the fact, that they sacrificed the pretty promising set-up for it. These are mostly ruined by the constant victimization and the black-and-white style they\u2019re presented by, sometimes redeeming itself through its somewhat creative ending, as we did with Dorothy\u2019s conflict of her past. But even though these might\u2019ve been executed pretty well through some evident skill direction-wise, they were by no means unpredictable or either very good from my point of view, as the series tried to hit you with a \u201cplot twist\u201d right into your face, even though all of it could\u2019ve been gathered from the behaviour of the characters during said key moments leading up to the ending. The show mostly doesn\u2019t know how to show emotions without the characters defining themselves as distinctive rage, happiness or sadness at the moment. Also, another thing I can't really wrap my head around is, why the show even bothered to implement the big mental strain Princess faces with the triple amount of work she has to do (serious spy work, school, and royal duties), when missions as the ones she's participating in time-wise shouldn't even be possible in the first place (especially the Laundry one), nobody in the family would smell the rat if the Princess of a powerful nation would willingly work full-time in a laundry shop, am I right? If the show didn't depict that as a noteworthy problem, I wouldn't have to hit at that fact, but sadly it did.\\n\\n\r\nAdditionally, what we gathered from her pasts doesn\u2019t reflect on their behaviour when not confronted by it or how they formed them during the test of time, the creators rather just trying to serve the fans of a certain archetype of a girl more than anything else, making the experience of these backstories even more forgettable. We have the apathetic girl, the devoted girl, the more mature and way more experienced girl (in both, a supposedly sexual and work-related way) and last but not least, the Loli samurai of Japan, combining both of their supposedly greatest achievements all in one character, as it is surely been seen through the eyes of an unclouded otaku. I harbour an extreme disdain toward it, especially considering on which time-period the setting is reminiscent on, where Japan might've not even been the mysterious Elysium as the show makes it out to be, not even compared to most of Europe. This was close to some \"Gate-level\" shit in terms of how Japan gets depicted in international affairs.\\n\r\nDevoted and extremely skilled in the swordplay of a seemingly unbreakable Katana, defying the honor (\u201cthis is THEIR honor\u201d) of Europeans as inferior to those of the Japanese in an incredibly cringe-worthy \u201ccultural conflict\u201d type of episode and superior to her devotion to work than any of her co-workers, Samurai \"Chise\" Loli-chan surely is something to be proud of compared to these European scoundrels! It even becomes more evident in how the Japanese depict themselves with their gracious attitude in this borderline new-interpretation of an altered history in Europe, when they all go down to the knees (approximately 50 men) as Albion offers some mean of transportation to the city, basically the standard of every state visit at hand\u2026ever. Gracious attitude can only go that far without it coming off as an unintentional comedy there.\\n\\n\r\nRegarding production-values, there is not that much to be said. It\u2019s pretty decent all along, sometimes the animation quality is a bit shaky, especially during the \u201cepic\u201d Samurai fight in a moving train, where the production-team thought, they could basically re-create the hype surrounding Fate Zero\u2019s fight by using an eerily similar soundtrack but failed pathetically to do so. This made the \u201ccard games on trains\u201d or even \u201con motorcycles\u201d scene in YGO seem like totally believable and even a masterpiece in terms of audiovisual presentation. Adding to the visual aspects, I have to admit, that some of the city and landscape shots harbour a pretty cool steampunk-esque vibe to them, too bad that's way too little to save virtually being messed up in the other sections. Character designs are alright from a visual standpoint, but never manage to feel unique in any way, as we come to see designs as these, which can be classified in one overarching archetype, all the time in modern anime.\\n\r\nThe OP is your standard Engrish song playing behind a pretty well-directed visually-directing intro and also the ED doesn\u2019t break any records, in fact, it is unimpressively generic and so is the OST of Princess Principal in general. Failing to encapsulate any hype during action-scenes, apart from episode 1, and also failing to hit the flair of what a 30\u2019s espionage-thriller would need for an original soundtrack; it hits the mark a few times and is not terrible in the productional-sense, but that's all I can really give it praise for, since most of the time when the soundtrack keeps playing in the background, it strikes me as well as elevator music.\\n\\n\r\nConclusion:\\n\\n\r\nI certainly did not mention many positive aspects about Princess Principal, but maybe due to the reason: There are almost none! It may be considered as one of the best anime in a terribly underwhelming season like this, but that in itself doesn\u2019t mean, that it manages to break the shell of its genericism, oozing from every corner of it. While it was not utterly terrible as some competent directing was going on from time to time, and the conflict of Ange and Princess being pretty meaningful in connection with the main plot, that doesn\u2019t mean it lifts it to great heights at all, as these never managed to surpass the adjective \u201cdecent\u201d for me in its runtime. A very unrewarding experience as a whole.\\n\\n\r\nStory (3.5/10)\\n\r\nArt (6/10), Animation (5.5/10)\\n\r\nSound (6/10)\\n\r\nCharacters (4/10)\\n\r\nEnjoyment (4/10)\\n\\n\r\nOverall (4/10)",

            "content": "From James Bond to the Bourne Identity and John Wick, there is always a point in one's life when we've been intrigued by the mysterious, meticulous, and romantic nature of the cinematic spy. However, anime writers always have a way of answering the questions that nobody ever asks---\r\n\u201cWhat if spies, like James Bond, were replaced with\u2026 lolis?\u201d \r\n\"Thrilling.\"\r\nIn an unusual twist, they created this interesting anime, where a wide array of political spying and assassinating ends up being left in the hands of a group of young schoolgirls (most of whom, actually have legitimate spy training.) If you were expecting a kiddy girl slice oflife drama, you will not find that here. This is a rather well-thought-out spy series that happens to have young girls as the protagonists.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 7/10\\n\r\nOne of the great things about this story is how unusual it is for the anime genre. Princess Principal take you on a journey with unusual young girls as they conduct espionage, all types of spy work, and even engage in assassinations. Under the guise of being students, these young spies are given orders by their superiors that must be completed at all costs, including one\u2019s own life. It features a wide array of character personalities, most of whom are unique. The political climate is unique at this point of the story, as it is a sci-fi enhanced version of 19th-century England. In this setting, steam and coal often powered various mechanical devices. The queen of the nation, who is also a loli and a friend of the spies, is more of a figurehead than a person with actual power and various factions are in the process of deciding whether to either help or dispose of her. \\n\\n\r\nHow will the girls carry out these difficult missions?\\n\r\nWhat, if anything,  will happen to the queen? \\n\r\nWhich factions will align themselves with who?\\n\r\nWhat would happen if they are given an order that they can\u2019t or don\u2019t want to complete?\\n\\n\r\nFind out by watching the show~\\n\\n\r\nThe story initially presents itself as episodic, as most anime spy shows do. The pacing is pretty good, but there is nothing that really felt profound about this series. The storytelling is very good, but it is still relatively bland and lacking profound qualities. Overall I think the story is pretty good and deserves a 7/10.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 7/10\\n\r\nOverall, the characters are unique, but not too unique. They loosely fit some of the popular archetypes in anime. Their background stories were relatively interesting but they weren\u2019t characters that were extremely memorable for any particular reason. I feel if the series had another 12 episodes, they may have been able to create a more memorable series through the characters.\\n\\n\r\nThe most interesting character in this series is undoubtedly Ange, and she is the character that the anime mainly follows. She\u2019s a weird girl who talks in a monotone but likes to tell jokes and lies. For example, her most told joke/lie is \u201cI\u2019m from the Black Lizard Planet\u201d. She\u2019s a very skilled spy and performs amazing feats. \\n\\n\r\nChise is a girl skilled at various ways of fighting and swordsmanship. Her personality is very samurai-like. \\n\\n\r\nThe Queen is a typical queen. She knows many things and is skilled at being nobility, but she also has quite the daring side to her as well.\\n\\n\r\nThere is also the young adult, who uses her charms to seduce men and the queen\u2019s assistant. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 8/10\\n\r\nThe art fits and enhanced the setting very well. The characters were designed well, the animation was fluid, special effects were great as well. I think they did a pretty good job overall and have no complaints in this category. The backgrounds aren\u2019t as detailed as some more ridiculously detailed series, but they are still great backgrounds overall. There is also nothing particularly unique about the art.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8/10\\n\r\nThe background OSTs come from the legendary Yuki Kajiura, my favorite composer. She\u2019s known in the anime community for her works on the music of SAO, Mahou Shoujo Madoka Magica, .hack, Tsubasa Reservoir and many other popular titles. I\u2019ve never heard her do Jazz before, but the music is really good. Voice acting is great, special effects are all great. \\n\\n\r\nEntertainment: 7.5/10\\n\r\nI was very entertained by the uniqueness of the series and the fact that there were young girls doing espionage and spy work LOL. I\u2019ve never seen anything like this and it was a worthwhile experience. I can\u2019t say that I was very excited for each additional episode, but it was pretty interesting.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7.5/10 \\n\r\nThis series was definitely something that I could see myself recommending to some people. The good art and story kept my interest the entire series. There wasn\u2019t anything that particularly stood out to me or was extremely memorable, but it was still something that I don\u2019t regret watching.\\n\\n\r\nShould you watch it?\\n\r\nIf you\u2019re interested in young girls being spies, like action, young girls, spies, 19th-century London, I would give it a shot. \\n\\n\r\nIf you\u2019re looking for a slice of life or yuri series, you\u2019re in the wrong place. \\n\\n\r\nHope this helps you make your decision, let me know if you agree by clicking \u201chelpful~\u201d thanks~\\n\\n",

            "content": "\u201cThis just isn\u2019t a cover anymore, we\u2019re real friends now...\u201d\r\nThe spy. An archetype explored an incalculable amount of times, spanning across all forms of media. Whether it\u2019s the dark and methodical approach of a John la Carre\u2019 novel, or the more mainstream and charismatic James Bond film, each entity produces something that ensnares the senses and transports you into the action. I\u2019ve always been a fan of secret agents and spies in cinema, so it\u2019s no question that this affinity would translate into other mediums such as anime. The 2016 release of Joker Game helped affirm this assumption by offering a unique mix of action,stealth and wit. Now, almost exactly one year later I was introduced to Princess Principal by a dear friend, an original anime directed by Masaki Tachibana (Barakamon, Tokyo Magnitude 8.0)... naturally I was intrigued. Through 12 episodes, PP dazzles with copious amounts of combat, deceit and supernatural elements. It may occasionally come across as muddled and has its fair share of negatives, but it doesn\u2019t disappoint and may go down as one of the most overlooked anime of the year. Spoilers ahead.\\n\\n\r\nFrom the beginning, PP may end up losing much of its target audience from the cast itself. Understandably I had trouble conceptualizing the idea of teenage moe girls acting as spies in 1800\u2019s London (speaking Japanese no doubt), as it\u2019s just not something I would list as believable. It's similar to the feeling I got from watching the dubbed version of Monster, as Tenma is a Japanese man living in Germany that just so happens to speak fluent English. What a total mindfuck. Aside from the acquired taste of the character models, the setting is quite immersive. The anime takes place in an alternative steampunk London, where weapons are rusty and mechanized, and airships rule the skies. In this parallel universe, a wall exists dividing the Albion Kingdom between the lavish capital and the dilapidated, unruly Commonwealth. This in itself pays homage to the Berlin wall, as in PP it can be difficult to discern which side is morally correct. Through the ensuing 12 episodes we follow the story of five female spies, from their relationships, to their loyalty to duty and underlying secrets.\\n\\n\r\nOne important point to note is that Princess Principal\u2019s timeline can render the casual viewer confused. It\u2019s not readily apparent that the anime\u2019s story is told out of order. The writers seem to pen the script in a way that can come across as disjointed because of very minor details here or there that are easily missed. To better explain this, I\u2019ve comprised a chronological ordering of each episode (stolen from MAL forums):\\n\\n\r\nEpisode 2 -> Case 1\\n\r\nEpisode 3 -> Case 2\\n\r\nEpisode 5 -> Case 7\\n\r\nEpisode 4 -> Case 9\\n\r\nEpisode 9 -> Case 11\\n\r\nEpisode 1 -> Case 13\\n\r\nEpisode 7 -> Case 16\\n\r\nEpisode 6 -> Case 18\\n\r\nEpisode 8 -> Case 20\\n\r\nEpisode 10 -> Case 22\\n\r\nEpisode 11 -> Case 23\\n\r\nEpisode 12 -> Case 24 and beyond\\n\\n\r\nWhen done right (which I wouldn\u2019t necessarily say is the case here), non-linear narratives can be effective at showcasing certain qualities of a character or details to enhance the main story. Such is the case in Kurt Vonnegut\u2019s Salughterhouse-Five or the cult classic Memento, one of my favorite films of all time. The main problem in PP is that the characters aren\u2019t developed far enough to extract much from this method. What results is a plot that appears to jump around simply just to do so. I will say the aspect that benefitted the most from this was the relationship of Ange and the Princess, which for obvious spoiler reasons I won\u2019t divulge any further on. Ideally, this method can also be used to better illustrate interactions between the main characters, and I believe that was the intent here. It just didn\u2019t capitalize as well as it could have. An assumption by the writers is also made with regard to the gravity-altering Cavorite material used primarily by Ange throughout the anime. The only reason I even knew what it was, is because of an H.G. Wells novel (The First Men in the Moon) I read some years back. To someone unfamiliar with this sci-fi homage, the supernatural substance can appear as a gaping plot hole that\u2019s never really filled.\\n\\n\r\nAnother point I feel necessary to address is the dramatic change of tone throughout the anime, both with the overall atmosphere and with the characters. From the first episode, I was captivated by the \u201ccloak and dagger\u201d approach the writers utilized with the spies. Ange as a main protagonist was ruthless and cold, sporting a succinct knack for taking out her foes. She also came across as a compulsive liar, assumingly normal for the trope of a spy. However, at certain points in the story her personality can shift from scene to scene and catch viewers off guard. It\u2019s not extremely off-putting, but it\u2019s there. While mostly well paced and envisioned, there are times where the writers spend an entire episode divulging a character\u2019s backstory, and others only a few seconds of a flashback. Some episodes are actioned packed, like the first episode or the train episode while others serve to be endearing and relationship building like the laundromat anecdote. I think this change of tone, juxtaposed with the jumping timeline can make PP seem less cohesive than it really is. Overall it\u2019s a smart show, and often has you sympathizing with the jobs these girls have to take. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters are the absolute best part of the anime. The squad\u2019s unsung leader Ange is relentlessly devoted to duty, and relishes in the secrecy and importance of each mission. She is incredibly diverse with her emotions depending on who she\u2019s addressing. Her relationship with the Princess is undoubtedly the focal point of the entire series, and her backstory is full of heartache and depression. She often quotes herself as being a former member of the fictitious \u201cBlack Lizard Planet\u201d, in order to explain the reason for her peculiar behavior. Ange is an expert of her craft, and is the strongest and most consistent member of the group. The Princess has her fair share of secrets, and often plays the role of messenger or spokesperson for the group. In retrospect, I do wish more time had been given to fully expound upon her past, given the fact it plays such an important role in the show. \\n\\n\r\nDorothy, my favorite character of the entire series, is the oldest of the group and she\u2019s often reminded of that fact. She also probably receives the most backstory, with the writers devoting almost an entire episode to her relationship with her father. She occasionally gets drunk or uses her body to help advance the situation (boobs=imperative to success as a spy), but also internalizes and many of the missions the girls partake in. She's like the mom of the group. Chise, the token Japanese ninja, is actually my least favorite character, though probably for selfish reasons . She undergoes a supreme transformation over the course of the anime and begins to learn the Western culture and the importance of friendship. Last but not least is Beatrice, the meek and often soft spoken friend of the Princess. Her demeanor is jittery, but her backstory (though short) is incredibly sad. Out of the entire main cast, I was impressed by the level of depth and detail put in place for each character.\\n\\n\r\nIf you told me that the same director as Barakamon and Tokyo Magnitude 8.0 also led Princess Principal, I\u2019d be hard pressed to call you a liar. I guess this a concrete indicator of Tachibana\u2019s ability as an anime director, and certainly one that deserves more work. The somber, ominous environment PP exudes, coupled with the uplifting comradery of the main cast crafts a definingly unique atmosphere all around. The art is well visioned, and although the female characters are younger, they are evenly proportioned and attractive. I can\u2019t recall any slip ups with framing during the action heavy scenes and even the still, dialogue heavy moments never seemed to come across as stale. While it may not technically be the best animation, its consistency is something to applaud in today\u2019s anime world, where series are being pumped out left and right. The cinematography is some of the best I've seen in a long time, despite focusing less on atmosphere than other equivalent specimens. The way some of the scenes are constructed, either through POV animation or still impact shots. It also has the benefit of omitting the \u201cunfaithful to the source material\u201d argument so many disgruntled manga fans hurl around with each new adaptation. It\u2019s a refreshing artsyle, contradictory to most of the bright and colorful anime in today\u2019s world.\\n\\n\r\nIf I can make one recommendation, it would be to watch Princess Principal with headphones on. The sound is purely exceptional. The balance of sound effects and their position through the speakers is perfect, and helps add to the realism during some of the missions undergone by the girls. The background music is also fitting of the time period, as nothing is saturated with electronic tones and no chipper techno beats flood your ears. The OP (despite that fugly logo) is one that grew on me, but now exists as one of my favorites for the season. The strong female vocals in conjunction with the smooth animation sequences is pleasing to the eye, and it\u2019s one I don\u2019t think I ended up skipping once. The ending is a strong contrast from the OP, but helps remind the viewers of the minor points of maturity these female characters lack. It\u2019s playful and fun. There aren\u2019t any stand out seiyuu performances in the anime, but certainly nothing hitting below the mark.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I would suggest not judging a book by its cover and jump into Princess Principal with no preconceived notions. It's certainly not what I expected, and although makes some mistakes it is a worthwhile watch. Compared to most of the shows out nowadays, the script is actually given some thought and the characters are developed substantially for their short screen time. I think the show would have benefited significantly if it was doubled in length or had a second season. This would give ample time to fix the timeline issue and also fully explore Ange and Princess\u2019 relationship. The series is plenty exciting, whether with raw action sequences or suspenseful moments of stealth. This is an easy anime to recommend, so if you're looking for something new and exciting, or we're a fan of series like Joker Game I would give it a try. It certainly surprised me and many others, and I look forward to more developments from Tachibana in the future. As always, thanks for reading and be sure to check out some of my other reviews from the season!\\n\\n\r\nStory-5\\n\r\nArt-6.5\\n\r\nSound-8\\n\r\nCharacter-8\\n\r\nEnjoyment-7\\n\r\nOverall-6.85",

            "content": "Originally 4eps in (Ep5 updates) - no spoilers - tl;dr at bottom. \r\nBased on the poster, synopsis, studios involved, it being an original, and so forth, you may be inclined to think this show would be nothing more than a meh \"cute girls doing (violently) cute things\" kinda ordeal - I know I did. Boy, was I wrong.\u00a0\r\nOne look at the staff roster and I went, \"Huh... Wait, for real?!\" So I gave it a chance. I now think this is en route to join the \u201celite\u201d for the year, and that it\u2019s currently criminally underrated. Oh, and \u201cinteresting cute girls doing seriously kickass things(with amazing writing)\u201d may be more accurate.\\n\\n\r\nStory 8/10 ***update after Ep5: 9/10 \\n\r\n-Though Ep1 had me impressed, I was initially concerned this would be more episodic in nature (which I'm usually not particularly fond of), and was dreading another Joker Game, but Ep2-4 put me at ease. This is serious storytelling that knows what it wants, is carefully planned out, and delivers. A captivating tale of unlikely spies, but one which isn\u2019t grounded in reality (or the expectations that come with it) - this is an alternative world and, as such, world-building is key. Think steampunk-esque Victorian era with a dash of magic-like scientific element. On top of that, the show is extremely character-driven (more on this later), even though we\u2019re in the middle of something much bigger - not the easiest thing to pull off properly, considering this is not a \u201cheros saving the world\u201d kind of story. \\n\r\n-They understand the concept of SHOW instead of TELL. There are a few short narrated explanation moments in the beginning, but there's no painfully forced exposition and characters talking to each other as if they're utter idiots for the benefit of the viewer. The world-building is phenomenal because you are given just enough in context to make sense of it all and start putting it together yourself\u2026 and then you want to know more. Pacing has also been on point for the most part, but the \u201cin between\u201d Ep3 to Ep4 leaves a bit to be desired (-1 here because this can set a precedent for future episodes) \\n\r\n***Ep5 update: in context, I retract the previous criticism - the show is playing with chronology of events and very intentional time leaps in both directions, to extremely interesting characterization effects***. \\n\r\n-There are a couple of plot points that seem far-fetched, even for this world (e.g. the ballroom sequence in Ep2) - a stricter viewer may see some substantial fault in those when thinking objectively/realistically. These certainly didn\u2019t pass me by unnoticed, but the series is doing so much more than that, and using these moments in such an interesting way, that I feel compelled to excuse them as a \u201cpoetic license\u201d (nevertheless, -1 here). Of course, as an original, this can go anywhere, but with Ichiro Okouchi (Code Geass, etc) on Script and Series Composition, I do think we're in good hands.\u00a0\\n\\n\r\nArt 9/10\\n\r\nTying in directly with that last point, you can tell a lot of care went into designs and attention to detail. This is what makes the world-building work particularly well. The art really draws you into this world (no pun intended). The choice of color palettes in each scene, the contrast, the attention given to setting\u2026 it's all beautifully done in a way that adds to the storytelling in every instance. Then there are some truly gorgeous moments. And the animation is fluid. An occasional wonkiness here and there, but nothing too serious. Major props to art direction - then again, it's Nobutaka Ike (Paprika, Kara no Kyoukai).\\n\\n\r\nSound 10/10\u00a0\\n\r\nAlright, I barely have anything to say here other than singing it praises (again, no pun intended\u2026 tabun). Yoshikazu Iwanami as Sound Director, and Yuki Kajiura as Composer (both have way too many exceptional credits to list)... what more do you want? Music does a great job in immersing you into this world, so does the sound editing. VAs are solid. Sound mix is top notch. OP is awesome, ED not bad at all. Next!\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 9/10\\n\r\nWe still have a long way to go, but the potential is there. The first episode threw a fair amount of characters at us without even naming many of them. That's actually not a bad thing - they understand that you'd simply not remember everyone anyway, so they focused on what you needed right now for the story - unusually straightforward and intelligent decision. The following episodes are now taking care of the rest in beautiful fashion, with brilliantly paced character (re-)introduction and development - well, for the most part\u2026 not sure I agree with what we have in Ep4, but we\u2019ll only know the effectiveness of certain creative decisions when we place it in context after future episodes come out. I\u2019m just hoping those decisions didn\u2019t come about due to time/budget concerns. ***Ep5 update: as stated above, Ep5 addresses this piece of criticism***. Regardless, I have high hopes for this cast. Ange seems to remain somewhat of a focal point even among the MCs - she already has remarkable depth to her character, while still being enshrouded in mystery, inviting us to be curious and want to know everything about her, as well as Princess. Fortunately, the other characters are not just left to the sidelines either! \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 9/10\\n\r\nIn one word: engaging. This is not your mindless entertainment, but not the kind that requires constant deep thinking either. All of the elements are of such high caliber and come together so effortlessly, that I\u2019ll go as far as saying part of the enjoyment comes from the appreciation of what they\u2019re doing both separately and together. In other words, this is a show where my enjoyment is directly proportional to all the previously made observations. Most importantly, I eagerly look forward to it every week.  \\n\\n\r\nOverall 9/10\\n\r\nI expect this can be one of the best shows of the Summer, but I also recognize there's a lot here that can go wrong. So far, this is extremely high level of storytelling and holds tremendous potential. An overall grade of 9 may be pushing at this point, but that is what I believe the show CAN earn upon its conclusion, from what I've seen so far.\u00a0\\n\\n\r\ntl;dr\\n\r\nA roster of industry heavy-hitters on staff gives us an original with serious potential, boasting impressive technical and artistic elements, but that can still go anywhere at this point. Extremely immersive world-building with promising characters that can drive the story and are being handled well so far. Let's hope they're allowed to develop and that we have a carefully formulated and interesting plot ahead of us - everything is pointing in that direction, but there are still some causes for concern. Still, this can certainly be one of the best shows of the season, and join the \u201celite\u201d for the whole year.",

Remember the \"Sexual Harassment\" I talked Earlier? that's one of the best girls here that serves a good purpose in distraction, not distracting the viewer, but those that needs to be distracted in order to fulfill their missions. it is pretty good and serves well for the Spying job.

            "content": "As a kid, I\u2019ve always been fascinated with stories surrounding spies, most particularly due to the fact that I grew up in a family who exposed me to James Bond at a young age. Cool, suave and sophisticated, capable of carrying off any mission or any feat, James Bond was the type of guy I always wanted to be as a kid, and, as I grew older and into adolescence, Bond\u2019s luck with women only enhanced this idea. Of course, much to the dismay of my eight-year-old self, I grew up to be anything but sophisticated and cool, instead becoming a filthy weeb who spendshis Friday nights fapping to Askua doijins, but I digress! So, when I had learned of the content surrounding the recently aired Princess Principal, visions of my childhood flashed in my mind, and I was genuinely excited for the show, as it seemed to be essentially James Bond, but with all the characters being replaced by lolis. Yes, a dumb idea, but anime has frequently surprised me in the past with its use of strange narratives and concepts to make genuinely good shows, so I thought that perhaps something like Princess Princiaple would also fall into this same mould of strange concepts that were executed well. However, PeePee (yes, it\u2019s immature to refer to the show as such, but I\u2019m going to be doing it from here on out) is perhaps the biggest disappointment I\u2019ve had all year with anime. I really wanted to love this show, I really did, especially since it has so much going for it in regards to what appeals to me personally from a visual standpoint, from the great character designs, wonderful setting and world as well as the rather suave and smooth soundtrack. Unfortunately, PeePee is bogged down by an ultimately weak cast of characters, an aimless narrative and, for the most part, a lot of wasted potential. But, dear reader, allow me to elaborate why I believe this show to be, while not entirely bad, to be extremely lackluster and mediocre. So, let\u2019s grab our top hat, jump into an early 20th century car, and do some spying! (Disclaimer: LIQfilms doesn\u2019t condemn spying; if you\u2019re executed for discovering national secrets, please don\u2019t sue me!)\\n\\n\r\nPeePee\u2019s narrative is set in a fictional 19th century steampunk London in which the West and the East are separated by a massive wall (insert overused Donald Trump joke here), in which five young girls from a prestigious academy are actually spies! The rest of the series sees them on various spy missions in an episodic narrative structure, as we learn more about their pasts and their relationships with each other, and that\u2019s pretty much it as a whole. On paper, this mode of storytelling doesn\u2019t sound bad, but the main problem I have with PeePee\u2019s narrative is just how aimless it is. The show feels as if it doesn\u2019t really know what it wants to do in regards to its story and characters, and instead just relies on ultimately inconsequential episodic spy missions that feel more like they exist solely for padding out the run time of the series. It proves frustrating to watch since I constantly kept expecting the story to do something, or to go somewhere, and I would be more forgiving of the show if its episodic nature actually had any bearing on the world as a whole, or if they were engaging through a personal connection with the characters presented in the slightest. The show just awkwardly jumps between different times in the story, which makes it rather jarring and confusing to watch; it just feels like a bunch of random ideas for stories placed in random succession to each other. This may feel like a rather strange way to describe the structure of the show, but that\u2019s honestly how it feels like. It just feels messy and not planned out well at all, as if the writers were scared to take any risks at all, and instead come up with pointless episodic narratives, to, again, just to fill time.\\n\\n\r\nNowhere is this idea more evident than in episodes nine and seven of the show, in which we don\u2019t learn anything about any of the characters or the world we\u2019re presented with. Episode seven is essentially an episode in which the girls join a laundry cleaners, as they have to find a specific uniform to identify someone in the army who has been using mustard gas. As they work in this place, they eventually transform and rebuild the work system, so everyone can work more efficiently and earn more money, and eventually apprehend the villain of the episode; that\u2019s it. While there is some commentary about the working class of the people living in the Victorian era in London during the 1800s, it\u2019s an ultimately pointless episode and even has many jarring moments that simply make no sense or just feel...odd. Like when all the men happily throw off their clothes to give to some cute underage girls for them to clean, or a scene where one of the spies, whom is fighting off against the villain of the episode, defeats him, and drops a knife to the floor, whereupon another lady who notices it, and walks away, which, I\u2019m guessing, is in shame\u2026? Or maybe she is scared? Does she want to turn her back in respect for the privacy of the spy girl? I don\u2019t know! The anime doesn\u2019t make it clear and the lady\u2019s actions doesn\u2019t make any sense and feels more so jarring than anything else, resulting in one of the many examples in the show where the in-the-moment logic is shoehorned in to create forced and unneeded drama in situations where it doesn\u2019t make any sense. When the lady walks away it clearly hurts little miss loli spy, and it feels unnatural that the woman would do so, considering that the loli spy has just apprehended a man with a knife, whom could have killed one of your workers! This may seem like a redundant thing to talk about, but little things like this that drag me out of the narrative and prove to be distracting, and there are plenty of examples of this.\\n\\n\r\nThe other pointless episode, even more so than the one I just described, is episode nine, in which we see Chise, a Japanese girl trying to adapt to British society, as she recaps her time spent as a spy and basically tells us her relationships and thoughts of the other girls. This is pointless as we already understand at this point the dynamics between each of our characters and repeating it so, is redundant. Not only that, but the episode is also a good case study into another problem with the show and that is that each villain, or any person who belongs to any higher social class, is a complete asshole, one dimensional prick! In this case, we have a rich guy who kills a butterfly, just because he is so EVIL!  This forced dynamic between the higher upper-class as being horrible people, while the lower-class is presented as being kind and considerate, having to work hard to prosper in life is representative of the context of the society in which the show is based on, sure, but people are not this black and white, and it feels silly to present this as such. It doesn\u2019t help either when the show takes to victimisation in a cheap and pathetic attempt to make us feel bad for the characters, with each adult, again, being represented as one dimensional pricks, beating down on our cute and innocent little girls. It\u2019s the same problem I had with Elfen Lied, which also used similar cheap writing to evoke this emotion from us through manipulation, and while PeePee is nowhere near as bad as that show, it still feels lazy. While I do appreciate that the show does attempt to show us the character\u2019s backstories, which does add some more depth onto them, it\u2019s not something you haven\u2019t seen before, nor is it really that effective since the characters are rather dry and boring. It\u2019s hard to care for them on any emotional level and are more akin to cardboard cutouts.\\n\\n\r\nThere is an attempt here at introducing a plot twist into the narrative, but I feel as if it is introduced far too late to do anything substantial with this idea, and not only that, it also felt incredibly predictable too boot. The show constantly hints at greater things in the narrative, but then utilizes the most bare-bones and predictable storytelling to deliver upon these hints, making the entire show feel incredibly uninspired. There are a few attempts at theme exploration, and politics, all of which is never given enough time to breath or develop, and feels more so as afterthought, rather than an intrical part of the story and world. Every theme presented feels like a child\u2019s interpretation of a morally gray world. The show also utilises exposition as well in order to communicate to the audience the state of the world, such as in the first episode where the narrator essentially just tells us everything instead of letting the audience be immersed into the world and setting ourselves, especially since the information we do learn, regarding a wall that divides the East and West, is not really explored all too much in the show, aside from the finale, but, even then, it\u2019s nothing too remarkable. While on the topic of the finale, while I would say it is more engaging than the rest of the show, since things of actual significance and consequence are occurring, it ultimately feels rather anti-climatic and just ends abruptly!\\n\\n\r\nTo be perfectly fair, there was a couple of things in the show\u2019s narrative that I kind of liked. For starters, there is a variety of different missions, which helps to break up the monotony of the story, and various locations and settings which helped to expand the world and make it feel grander. I also liked some of the spy training stuff too, and helped add on this layer of realism to the setting and the world, from seeing the girls learning how to unpick locks, or them performing practices involving tailing someone without their presence being known. Some of the technology used in the show too was pretty fun to see as well, such as a ball that allows the holder to fly, which allowed for more creative scenarios to ensue. In addition, there was a few episodes that could actually be fun, or somewhat emotional in a few places. The best example of this is an episode devoted to Dorothy, and her backstory, and while it too does utilise victimisation too, the episode is fairly emotional, mainly because Dorothy was the only character I found to be somewhat likeable, being that she was easily the most relatable, and her world outlook on life just seemed to be the most admirable amongst the cast. The one thing that ruins the episode however, is that Dorothy\u2019s father, whom after learning does actually care for his daughter, is killed off and is never mentioned ever again! Not even a single passing remark or comment!\\n\\n\r\nAs for the rest of the cast, they\u2019re pretty mediocre character archetypes. Chise\u2019s involvement in the narrative is pretty minimal, and while we do understand her reason for coming to London, all the way from Japan, in a fight between her and her father which carried some narrative weight and emotion, she doesn\u2019t really change or grow much throughout the narrative and her relationships that form between her and the other girls just feels superficial, as if the only reason they exist was because the script dictated it so. She had some charming scenes however, most notably her lack of knowledge surrounding western customs, although some moments felt rather trite, especially the one with the lady in the laundry house I mentioned before. Beatrice also doesn\u2019t have much involvement in the plot either and serves little purpose as a whole. I\u2019m guessing her role is the straight man, in the sense that she is the most normal of the group, having been trained very little in the art of spies, so I guess we\u2019re supposed to latch onto her, but I found her more so annoying than anything else. Undoubtedly the crux of the show, and what most of the emotional weight depends on, is the relationship between Ange, a spy who has essentially cut off all her emotions for her job, and the Princess. Their relationship does actually feel genuine and sweet at times, especially since Ange actually exhibits emotions around her, giving her character some more depth and personality than what we were lead to believe at first, suggesting some personal history and connection between the two. While this relationship is still nothing remarkable, and is as cookie-cutter as they come, the scenes in which they fight, actually have some emotional weight behind it. While I won\u2019t get too much into the plot twist between their relationship (even though it is obvious that even Stevie Wonder could see this coming!) the struggles behind the Princess's life was actually kind of interesting, and one of the few moments I cared for any of these characters.\\n\\n\r\nNow, one positive thing I can say about the characters is that they all have good chemistry between them, and their back-and-fourths as they complete missions can actually be pretty funny and charming sometimes too, especially the scenes in which they are driving in their car, as Beatrice freaks out and screams hysterically, Ange turns off her voice changer (which was installed onto her by her evil father because every adult in this is a one dimmensional ass-hat) and is a clever way of adding some comedy into the show. While the character interactions are good in many regards, it is not enough to salvage the show unfortunately.\\n\\n\r\nIn regards to animation and music, PeePee, handles this the best. The opening is fantastic, and I can\u2019t get enough of it! It captures the spirit the show is aiming for perfectly, and the same thing can be said for the design of the world and the character designs too. The city is mechanic, lifeless, and bleak, and each character design is pretty good, albeit it can be kind of silly looking at times. The soundtrack is also comprised of smooth jazz, adding some suave to the show, and the animation, for the most part, is pretty consistent with some cool looking action sequences. However, CGI is used in some parts of the show, with a jarring use of it in the second episode, where a group of people are dancing with the same posture and fluidity of two robots trying to emulate human movement; it feels really jarring, and many of the backgrounds in the show are comprised of CG models that never fail to look awful and drag me out of the scene.\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion, PeePee was just a mediocre show with no remarkable attributes and  it felt like the writers were holding back and, as I said, kept playing it safe with predictable and tireing stories that have been done a thousands times before to much better effect. It\u2019s a show that is more interested in cinematography and action then it is in having actual characters the audience can feel for, and the strange pacing, as well as the narrative structure makes the show frustrating to watch since it feels as if it is going nowhere and just remaining stagnant. On some level, yes, I did enjoy myself during some moments of the show, but much of that was overpowered by a strong, unyielding feeling of boredom which makes it incredibly hard to recommend as there are so many other shows that are actually worth your time. Don\u2019t bother with this show. Like someone you passed on the street today, you\u2019ll forget the memory of them as soon as you take your eyes away...\\n",

(sades headset ftw)\\n\\n\r\nMy enjoyment for This show is a solid 10/10 and was one of the many thing that i look forward in harsh, dry and lifeless Monday.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "\u201cWhen you create a web of lies, you'll inevitably trap yourself and become everyone's meal instead\u201d- someone, somewhere, sometime\r\nPrincess Principal is an unorthodox title to be sure. Steampunk, non-linear storytelling, and rule of cool. Sounds like it should've been a winner, but it was a case doomed to fail as soon as it set out, exposing itself rather quickly as a fraud and a disaster. It's stupid, it's uncool, and most of all, it's insulting. It tried desperately to confuse you and come off as smart and then it tries to patronize you. \r\nPrincess Principal is the condescending and obnoxious dreck from the same teamthat gave us one of last year\u2019s most crushing disappointments, Izetta the Last Witch. As blasphemous as this sounds, that show was still better than this one in every single way. Keep in mind, Izetta was sort of a train wreck and plenty were hurt by its unkept promises despite the setting and premise. However, it's like this show decided to do it one worse yet still be seen as better. Let the truth be heard, let this series be exposed for its lies, and let it be cannibalized and demonized for ruining my hopes and dreams of having a better Izetta, just like with Youjo Senki only half a year prior! Let me, the man it deceived the cruelest, have my vengeance, for the lies end here!\\n\\n\r\nCase ST 2\\n\\n\r\nWhen a narrative starts out on such an awful foot as to have narrator exposition of the past as the opening scene and then have a bunch of asspull revelations and stupid moments (few of which ever come to make sense later), then your narrative needs to do a lot to make a recovery. It never does. In fact, those asspull revelations are occasionally present, like the ballerina revelation in episode 1. It tries to play itself as smart by creating information (that it claims that we missed) out of thin air; that obviously not smart. It does this a few times and it's annoying every time. The technology doesn't make any sense either and is poorly explained. Apparently, there is this C-ball that the main character has and at one point they try to steal the prototype that was just finished, except they already have the original so that officially makes no sense. Lastly, the factions are insanely difficult to keep up with thanks to how the executed their non-linear storytelling, and we don't even k is which side between the commonwealth and the royals is the east or west side.\\n\\n\r\nAs stated earlier, this show treats you like an idiot. The asspull revelations that never add up aren't the only example of this. Hell, they're not even the most egregious. What\u2019s more egregious is the fact that this show constantly beats you over the head. Every single episode, the show constantly drives home the fact that spies lie and that they're not good people, as well as that everyone always lies. More than 5% of the total dialogue is centered around these three things. The dialogue is so condescending and terrible overall, and with all this thrown in the pot, it's just an especially big insult to the audience's intelligence. \u201cDid you know that spies are liars?\u201d Gee, I sure did, hell, so did everyone watching. You don't have to remind us constantly. Anywhere between 3 and 25 times an episode, especially in the early episodes. Not everyone knows when they're being mocked or patronized but when you realize that it's happening to you, it's aggravating, so a show shouldn't ever do that to the viewer, who is maybe trying to use this as an escape from reality. Instead, Princess Principal, how about you instead focus on telling a coherent story and SHUT THE FUCK U-\\n\\n\r\nLying is bad\\n\\n\r\nThat being said, there are times where you can see a glimmer of hope in the narrative. As predictable as episode 6 is, the finale and tragic irony of the song to the situation at hand is brilliant, almost reminiscent of some of the other works this writer has worked on, specifically the final scene of the 23rd episode of Code Geass, a personal favorite. This series, especially in the second half, starts actually trying to elicit emotion, but it's not always effective at it. Sure there are good moments like episode 7 which was the only really solid episode of the show barring some of 6, but then we get episode 8 which while that did provide context to some scenes from earlier, it actually reveals another problem and missed opportunity in episode 2, one of the worst of the series; this isn't even speaking of the embarrassingly bad and mind-numbingly stereotypical episode 9 which feels like it would normally be a sappy kids show episode that also patronizes the audience. In a way, it's almost trying to be the reverse Izetta where instead of starting off decently and turning to complete shit later on, it starts off horrendously and gets better later, except it stumbles as that hallways through the second half anyway and ends up back where it started. Too little too late comes to mind. Besides, the finale is a sequel bait disaster anyway and anytime the show takes a step forward, it takes a stab back as well.\\n\\n\r\nCase C 2\\n\\n\r\nWith the exception of Ange and Charlotte, none of the characters have any semblance of chemistry. Hell, none of the are memorable. Their personalities are beyond basic and not-fleshed out or progressed at all. There is no one worth giving a damn about, for they are so lifeless and static. If this show I supposed to be a rule of cool series, why does only one character try for this angle (the girl with the tits), and why isn't it one of the more prominent characters? They're so plain and tired, and one of them, names Beatrice, starts out especially bad and hypocritical. She\u2019s the typical \u201cprincess loli bodyguard\u201d trope except more annoying, and then she becomes a mod benign version of this exact same trope with little to no progression. Hell, all of these people are little more than tropes! The two \u201cbest\u201d characters are Ange and Dorothy. Dorothy because she tries at rule of cool and she\u2019s hot (and she actually has an explored past), and Ange because she has this weird thing about the Black Lizard Planet she keeps lying about nonchalantly. Oh, and she and this princess kinda sorta love each other...I suppose. Reasonings loosely related to it are dumb though. Regardless fact that such straws need to be grasped just to say something interesting about these characters is proof of their failure as a cast. This isn't even speaking of the other characters that come later, since they're not worth mentioning and they exacerbate this issue.\\n\\n\r\nCase A 4\\n\\n\r\nThe show\u2019s visuals do not fare much better. Studios Actas and 3Hz did a joint effort for this project, and if nothing else, they were consistent...ly bad.The Light Novel default artstyle aggravates and does not look appealing in the slightest, and the designs range from mediocre to abysmal, with the worst being Chise\u2019s design. The rest of the art looks decent and occasionally pretty detailed, like with the C-ball, and that's the only praise I'll give the visuals. The animation is ok at best, though the fights are pretty badly choreographed. The CGI ranges from mediocre (for the cars) to abysmal (for the people) and there is even a moment with a CGI room for the foreground and background and it causes a long 7 seconds of bad slowdown (what is it with anime that have CGI and slowdown and why are all of them always shitty anime?). When we see rads backgrounds in situations of motion, or any time for that matter, they look terrible, and so does the photorealistic backgrounds of the school garden, which you will see from time to time. Shame since the steampunk-esque setting is an interesting one in terms of potential visuals yet these don't warrant much merit.\\n\\n\r\nCase SO 6\\n\\n\r\nOne of the most renowned composers in the industry, Yuki Kajiura did the music for this anime. This is honestly one of the weaker OSTs I've experimented from her to date. The songs are mostly pretty reserved and thus aren't very memorable, and the few that are more blaring and interesting aren't nearly of the same quality of some of the best tracks of her other works, like the SAO and Fate/Zero OSTs. The tracks are repeated quite often too to make matters worse. The OP, \"The Other Side of the Wall\" by Void_Chords feat.MARU, is easily one of the best of the season. It emphasizes rule of cool and is filled with the frantic energy that makes you pumped to watch each episode of the show, as awful as this show is; it is the only real good thing I could find in this show, which is unfortunate. The ED, \"A Page of My Story\" by Ange (Ayaka Imamura), Princess (Akira Sekine), Dorothy (You Taichi), Beatrice (Akari Kageyama), Chise (Nozomi Furuki), fares nowhere near as well, as contrarian as this apparently sounds. It is an ok enough track on its own but intro in particular gives me major mood whiplash every time I finish an episode. Overall, it was a decent enough repertoire of music but little was special and it was honestly underwhelming on the whole.\\n\\n\r\nCase E 3\\n\\n\r\nThis show was very difficult to enjoy. The action wasn't even that competent, the characters were unbelievably dull and bad, the plot was wrecked beyond belief, and the show treats the audience like a dunce. The most enjoyment I got out of it was listening to the OP theme by you can do that as well as engage in the full version without having to see the show anyway. Not to say that the experience was heinous but it was continually frustrating and I am left bitter for it.\\n\\n\r\nCase O 3\\n\\n\r\nWith that, the case is closed. Princess Principal is hereby found guilty of lying about being a good show, treating its audience like an imbecile, being caught so far up a web of lies and lack of proper establishing that everything is convoluted, and all around being a massive disappointment. For a rule of cool show, this didn't even try that hard in any aspect, even visually or musically, and for a show of emotion, it shot itself in the foot almost every time it tried. It's off to the cellar, Princess Principal; good riddance.",

            "content": "Spy and Espionage media has always been a very popular topic in the West. Besides the ongoing popularity of the James Bond franchse, and the allure of heist movies like the Oceans' series, they've been around enough to be parodied for decades, represented by films like Austin Powers and more recently Kingsmen The Secret Service. Even cartoons like Archer have taken a crack at Spy shows. In the world of anime, consumed by magic high schools, video game worlds, and Moe appeal, spy shows haven't been very common. The most notable example as of late would be last year's Joker Game, which ultimately became acritical flop with its episodic structure and blandly undistinguishable leads.\\n\\n\r\nWhich leads us to today's topic. Studio 3Hz, responsible for last year's cute girl filled yet ambitious Flip Flappers, made this ambitious project, a spy show starring cute girls in a steampunk driven English setting as they embark on a variety of missions for the sake of their government. Did it succeed? Well let's find out. \\n\\n\r\nThe story begins with the setup of a proposed \"London Revolution\", splitting England into two sides, the Kingdom and the Commonwealth, neither of which get fleshed out or distinguished. Our protagonists, the cute girl spies, work for one of these sides on a variety of missions that make up our story. These missions range from infiltration, rooting out traitors, train battles, disguise exploits, heists, retrieving secret codes and many more, in addition to backstory episodes for some of the character relationships in the present.\\n\\n\r\nIn general, these episodes are quite fun to see, with a good amount of Tactical Espionage Action (thumbs up if you get that reference) in almost all of them. While some may accuse the show of more or less pushing the cute girl appeal, from a logical standpoint, having young girls do the spywork would put them away from a lot of suspicion, because the very idea would seem silly to most of the adults and guards around their areas and be unsuspected. One could argue that the silliness bleeds into its own script as well and while that is true, the concept isn't horrible in itself and on their own, most of the episodes are good fun, if including a few logical fallacies and repeated events here and there (the seductive role of Dorothy for instance).\\n\\n\r\nThat said though, there is one thing that prevents these episodes from reaching their full potential, the plot structure.\\n\\n\r\nYou see, the way the show structures itself is quite non-linear. This non-linear plotting has been done in anime like The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya and Baccano, but Haruhi was a meta comedy and Baccano used it to accommodate for way more characters and to keep the pace consistent the whole way through rather than having separate climaxes. Both also had source material already. With PP, it attempts to use different adventures that in many ways feel disconnected from each other to do all the worldbuilding and plotting from scratch, as an original property within 12 episodes. One particular character relationship gets the opportunity to develop and shine but...little else. \\n\\n\r\nQuestions about the world's ideas still remain incredibly open, many episodes lack overall relevance to the worldbuilding or plot lines to jack down the pacing, and while the characters' backgrounds are touched on, most are either done only briefly or takes unneeded time from other elements, looking at you Episode 9.\\n\\n\r\nIn many ways the show, while cool in short bursts, feels less like an overall elaborate story and more like a series of fun ideas the writer wanted to accomplish in this steampunk spy world he created, regardless of care or progression. Two notable examples are Episode 7, in which a laundry exploit exists to reveal backstory but not add any contribution to the overall plot, and ESPECIALLY Episode 9, an awkwardly placed backstory episode that kills the previous episode's pacing for a character who matters nothing in the grand scheme of thing and does nothing in what remains.\\n\\n\r\nEven despite this, Episode 8 is actually great, being a really nicely appreciated look into the intertwining lives of two of the characters and adding a great amount of context. It's a case where an episode actually felt like it was put in a place where it should be, and it was by far the peak of the series. \\n\\n\r\nOther episodes vary between \"fun adventure with a small bit of insight\" or, rushed plot episodes, more specifically at the end of it. The final episodes have very sudden plot revelations to throw the spy unit into apparent disarray, and the Ange/Princess relationship does benefit a lot from their character confrontations around this part, but it still feels like it does little with the world, only introducing a possible antagonist on par with the protagonists at the very end and ending on a sequel hook. Yes, a sequel hook, in an original story. Such a thing shouldn't happen, and if the show had keep more of a focus on its world and kept things consistent rather than trying to be stylistic with a timeline, it might've been able to accomplish far more than its ambitions seemed to imply. It might also have been possible to explain Ange's C-ball. While the substance is, according to a friend, based on a book, it lacks the proper limitations, so they can apparently Magic the characters out of situations without too much thought for how. \\n\\n\r\nIn a sense that's kind of reflective of the plot itself. As I mentioned the action scenes and specific scenarios were often entertaining itself, but the Rule of Cool moves it away from plausibility unfortunately.\\n\\n\r\nOn the plus side, the production is mostly up to par. While the character designs are sadly very typical of light novels, the general look of the world, costumes and action scenes is really well put together. The different uniforms, steampunk architecture around the world, action scenes and car chases all look the part, and made the show incredibly inviting at first as a new and unique show from the same studio as Flip Flappers. Actual animation was good for the most part. In terms of sound, Yuki Kajira made another fairly unique soundtrack similar to her work on ERASED, fitting the vibe of the setting and often being in the right times. The OP is badass, and the ED, while catchy is a pace breaker from the more intense endings.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters range from nicely handled to skimmed over to non-existent. Relatively early on at the start have Ange as the confident serious superspy and Princess as the royal figure wanting to create a revolution and cause a positive change to her nation. This goal isn't original in itself, but following a certain plot twist, it becomes more of a somber reflection that actually works for the plot in the end. Ange's role on her end is nice too as the most competent superspy. The other three of the main group, Chise, Dorothy, and Beatrice get far less. To the show's credit, each of them gets a particular moment when we learn of their basic backstories, followed by having a cool moment in an action scene, not necessarily fleshed out but present and accounted for, while the skills each of them DO feel like necessary pieces to form a competent unit in the spy missions in their own wat. That said, a few of their episodes tend to make the plot go off track. Chise, for instance has her own episode 9 feel incredibly disconnected and pointless in the main scheme of things aside from finding a way to justify in the Token Japanese girl. Other supporting characters are either people to be fooled by the spy group, higher ups who's main role is being higher ups or generally episodic characters who....sadly don't leave much. There is a suitable rival for the group but again, she appears at the very end, once most of the conflict is out of the way. \\n\r\nIn general, the main characters are nicely handled where it counts with some nice character development scenes at certain points, but the show's sidetracking pace and incomplete nature hold them back behind simpleness. \\n\\n\r\nConclusion\\n\\n\r\nIn a few ways, the show reminds me of the writer's previous effort Kabaneri of the Iron Fortress. That was also a 12 episode story that tried to create a world and characters with great production values, and while that show's premise was far less interesting and the faults in that show far more irritating, it kept a coherent story handle and tried to more or less conclude its whole idea in the end. He tried to do more than he could, and while Princess Principal is far from a total bust by virtue of its slick production and generally impressive standalone sequences, it went from a train wreck to a train veering off course only to return yet not reach its destination.\\n\\n\r\nAs far as being a spy show, it mostly succeeds, if not having enough opportunities to turn fate against the young girls. If you're looking for a general rule of cool show with moments of brilliance and fun action atmosphere starring cute girls, you'll get it. However, if you're looking for a well structured narrative with a well realized and fully fleshed out ensemble, you may have to look elsewhere. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 5.5/10 \\n\\n\r\nWhile I did enjoy Princess Principal and it definitely had its high points, it could been so much more if certain decisions didn't break its walls from the inside\\n",

            "content": "There\u2019s something just really dangerously exciting about Princess Principal. Mixing genres of mystery thriller with some bits of science fiction and steampunk, this is a show that proves original anime can still work well with the right talent and creativity. \r\nOriginal anime these days tend to be risky to make despite not falling under adaptation pitfalls. Princess Principal has its risks when it assembles a cast of cute high school girls together in a spy thriller. I have to admit, this show got my adrenaline pumping a bit from the first few episodes. My first impression of this anime started with the setting. It\u2019s innovativeand takes place in a time era of the 19th century in England. A major conflict in the story is about the civil war that separates the Kingdom of Albion into two nations: The Commonwealth and the Kingdom. The female characters consists of high school students working The Commonwealth as undercover spies. In essence, this show is be easily recognizable as a spy thriller fiction. \\n\\n\r\nAccepting the principle cast didn\u2019t take me long but it wasn\u2019t easy to understand them. Remember, they are spies so not everything about them is honest. Not to mention, we don\u2019t get background stories about them in the beginning. However, the show does make time to amplify their personalities. The idea of spies in this show combines elements of espionage, deception, trickery, and even some femme fatale. To be clear, it really brings out what the characters can do as we see how they function as spies. For me personally, I think this anime does a neat job at characterizing the characters\u2019 skill set. The most noticeable spy is Ange with her ability to manipulate others while hiding her true intentions. She\u2019s also adept at changing her personality depending on the situation and highly unpredictable. To be quite honest, she\u2019s pretty much the mastermind of spycraft in this show. Her leadership skills play important roles on missions and I must say, this anime really brings out the most of those abilities. \\n\\n\r\nThe other main characters shouldn\u2019t be underestimated. Dorothy has the feminine charms, firearm skills, and driving talent to carry out her missions. She\u2019s the symbol of the femme fatale and brings out her seductive skills the most. Princess Charlotte serves as the brain of the cast as she is smart and easy to get along with others. Her close friend is Beatrice has the skill to mimic other people\u2019s voices so she should definitely not be underestimated. Finally, Chise serves as the show\u2019s primary fighter with her swordsmanship skills and melee combat abilities. A show with these diverse characters will take the viewers some times to accept as many will find some more likable than others. However, I think the character cast stands out not just by their personalities but also their character relationships. For instance, Ange and Charlotte has a unique relationship that is explored throughout the series. Beatrice\u2019s relationship with the other spies evolves as each episode progresses. By the end of the show, I actually felt like she became a likeable character despite my initial annoyance at her presence. Chise\u2019s relationship is less straightforward with others as she often finds having difficulty expressing herself to others. Despite that, I think the show does a neat job at bringing her character to life by having her work as a spy with Dorothy and Ange. On the other hand, the show\u2019s antagonist roster could really do for some improvement. Hardly any of those are memorable and it feels like the main female grossly overshadow them.\\n\\n\r\nCrafting a show about intelligence activity is no easy task as episode needs to be carefully organized for the story to flow. The show doesn\u2019t take long to get into the mood as it\u2019s eerie and suspenseful. It cleverly tells its background stories for some characters and believe me, they possess a lot of human emotions; some more tragic than others. However, I do have some problems with the pacing on occasions and story structure. It feels out of order at times and some resolutions doesn\u2019t feel as impactful as others. There\u2019s even one episode that I personally thought didn\u2019t develop the story at all around the mid-show. Also, while I like the surprises this anime throws at the audience, it still falls under pitfalls with some generic mystery elements at times. Still, if you toss those drawbacks aside, Princess Principal really stands out as a show that dazzles with what it establishes.\\n\\n\r\nOn the cover, it seems this anime may be misrepresented by the character designs. They look like cute girls so one might wonder how an anime like this can make it into a convincing spy thriller. Make no mistake, this show\u2019s risks pays off with the character designs it works with. From Chise\u2019s assassin style characteristics to the seductive femme fatale of Dorothy, it really does make these characters stand out. It even capitalizes on the characters facial expressions and body language as those are important skill assets for spies. My only problem is with Beatrice as her character look like an immature kid compared to the others. As a spy thriller, also do expect violence to break out although it\u2019s never farfetched to rely shock value to attract the audience. The action has smooth camera angles to showcase what spies can really accomplish. Fan service is minimal with some occasional bath scenes, Dorothy\u2019s feminine charms, and the girls dressing up as spies. Honestly, it\u2019s not distracting. The biggest payoff of the show\u2019s visuals lies with its setting. The steampunk setting of an alternative history really shows creativity from the architectures, vehicles, and innovations.\\n\\n\r\nAnyone who is familiar with Yuki Kajiura will easily recognize her talent in this show with its killer soundtrack. It\u2019s entrancing and hard to ignore by the ears with its every beat. The theme songs has attitude that\u2019s tough and catchy with eerie choreography. The OST relies on its jazz-style and smooth choreography. Finally, I can confess that the main characters\u2019 voice performance is exceptional. Spies are perhaps some of the most difficult characters to portray yet the voice acting all sounds convincing. The ability to change voice tone from one moment instantly to another really bedazzled me. \\n\\n\r\nPrincess Principal ended up as an anime that I surprisingly grew fond of. It took me a little time to accept what it is but it didn\u2019t take long to really get engaged to what it had to offer. Directed by Kazuya Nomura (having previously worked on another spy thriller known as Joker Games), it\u2019s really a show that got me invested time into with its stylish storytelling and psychology. While I admit that not everything flowed perfectly, it didn\u2019t make mistakes that would cause the show to collapse. I can\u2019t say this anime is recommendable for anyone because of what it is. However, it\u2019s definitely an anime to give a chance as it can end up being irresistible. \\n",

            "content": "I remember looking at the summer 17 seasonal charts searching for anime to add on my watch list and the summer 17 season itself had a lot of worthwhile anime such as Made in Abyss, Welcome To the Ballroom, Magical Circle Guruguru, Tsurezure Children and Princess Principal.\r\nBeing a fan of spy genre thanks to the lacks of James Bond, Jason Bourne and other spy anime like Read or Die and of me decided to check out Princess Principal and while I did like the series on my first watch I thought the series wasn't all that special outside of the fight scenes. However, when SentaiFilmworks decided to dub this show a year later I decided to re-watch Princess Principal twice dubbed. One of the re-watches being the chronological order and after re-watching it I went from liking the series to loving it to a point where looking back at the summer 17 season for anime Princess Principal was my favourite anime of that season.\\n\\n\r\nSo what made this series so great you may. Well let's find out, shall we?\\n\\n\r\nStory.\\n\r\nWith the discovery of a mysterious substance called \"Cavorite\", Albion was able to construct a fleet of airships that made Albion the dominant power in the world. However, after the London Revolution, the country was split between the Kingdom and Commonwealth of Albion. The story of Princess Principal follows five girls (Ange, Beatrice, Chise Charlotte and Dorothy) in 19th century London, a city within the Albion Kingdom divided into east and west by a large wall. The girls serve as undercover spies working for the Commonwealth who are enrolled as students at the prestigious Queen's Mayfair school. The girls make use of their individual abilities to remain active in the underground world of disguise, espionage, infiltration, and car chases.\\n\\n\r\nI found the story of Princess Principal to be very fascinating for the most part.\\n\r\nFor starters, the show goes a great job presenting its episodic structure where the first 8 episodes each of the girls would take on cases where either had to defeat set group or steal an important item from set organisation/group. I found all of the case adventures to be all intrusting because not only the series is very intelligent of how the girls deal with the cases but they are all extremely well paced and addicting to watch.\\n\r\nI also really liked how the series was not afraid to into dark territory because some of the cases do not have a happy ending for everyone.\\n\\n\r\nThe one thing that Princess Principal does compare to most modern anime is it has a non-chronological narrative, and the execution was let's just say it was a double-edged sword. While almost all of the problems of Princess Principal get negatived if you watch the show in chronological which I did when watching the dub but if you watched the show when it was airing like most seasonal anime watchers you will start to see the sadly inconsistent directing of the series. One of the many problems that you will encounter when watching the show is episode transitioning where one episode would be balls off the wall action while the next episode it's a full-on slice of life. \\n\r\nThis doesn't there many story elements in Princess Principal as a result ended up being very confusing as the show doesn't do a great job at connecting certain scenes of the series that were very important to the narrative. This is not to say the non-chronological order is all bad though as there's a lot of mystery that plays along with the show narrative and it does pretty nicely for the most part, however, if you're like me who wants to see a consistent narrative I would go with the chronological order. Yes, the non-chronological order may be a fun watch the first time around but it should not be your definitive watch of the series.\\n\\n\r\nFor anyone who is interested in watching the chronological order here's the order in case order.\\n\r\nEpisode 2 > Case 1\\n\r\nEpisode 3 > Case 2\\n\r\nEpisode 5 > Case 7\\n\r\nEpisode 4 > Case 9\\n\r\nEpisode 9 > Case 11\\n\r\nEpisode 1 > Case 13\\n\r\nEpisode 7 > Case 16\\n\r\nEpisode 6 > Case 18\\n\r\nEpisode 8 > Case 20\\n\r\nEpisode 10 > Case 22\\n\r\nEpisode 11 > Case 23\\n\r\nEpisode 12 > Case 24\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe only negative thing I can say about Princess Principal outside the double edge sword non-chronological narrative was the ending. Yes, season 2 is coming this year and all but I felt like show ended in a weak way where it's literally screamed squeal bait.\\n\r\nOverall I really had a blast with Princess Principal Story. Yes, the ending was left to desired as well non-chronological storytelling at times (if you actually decided to watch the show in that order) but other than those shortcomings the story was nicely crafted.\\n\r\n8.5/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacters.\\n\r\nWhen it comes to the characters for Princess Principal, I thought they were all great and memorable.\\n\r\nAnge who despite being mostly emotionless isn't afraid to sacrifice herself just to complete her mission.\\n\r\nDorothy is the most playful and relatable one who uses her feminine charm to get everything that she wants. Also, she is great at driving gateway cars in missions.\\n\r\nCharlotte is the most oddball of the 5 where she uses her powerful connection to get the job done.\\n\r\nBeatrice is the most incontinent out of the bunch and despite her struggling to keep up she has a unique power that allows her to copy anyone voice with her mechanical throat.\\n\r\nLastly, we have Chise who is a strong Japanese sword woman where she is unstoppable as long she has a sword.\\n\\n\r\nDespite the five main girls being clich\u00e9d at first, they are actually great characters who not only developed well but all had the chance to shine on screen. Not to mention the characters interactions with each other was great especially Charlotte and Ange. If I had a favourite out of the five girls, it would be Dorothy as she was the most likeable and relatable character thanks to her fun personality and intriguing backstory.\\n\r\nAs for the villains, I thought they were enjoyable. Yes, some of them were one-note but the one that showed up near the end of the series was pretty interesting.\\n\r\nOverall the characters in Princess Principal are great, and they are easily the main highlight of this anime.\\n\r\n10/10\\n\\n\r\nVisuals.\\n\r\nVisually Princess Principal is great in all areas.\\n\r\nIt does a great job at presenting its world from the far-off Visually where stretches of light contrast with the ever-present darkness that generated a distinctive atmosphere, the old time European designs of roads, buildings, decor, machines to the surprisingly smooth animation that fits well the world that is presented. The charters designs for each of the girls are unique and very appealing to the eye especially the outfits and dresses that they were in the series.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation itself is surprisingly outstanding. The action scenes are well animated, character movement is smooth and the amount of attention to detail thought the series animation is amazing. The series also has some of the best use of CGI as it perfectly fits with the traditional 2D environments.\\n\r\nGreat job Studio 3Hz.\\n\r\n10/10\\n\\n\r\nSound.\\n\r\nThe soundtrack for Princess Principal is pretty great and memorable.\\n\r\nYuki Kajiura once again did a great job with the soundtrack and all of the tracks fit very well the overall Victorian setting of the show.\\n\r\nThe opening theme \"The Other Side of the Wall\" by Void Chords feat MARU where despite being fully in English kickass song that perfectly the setting and tone of the series. Plus it's was sung in full English which was awesome.\\n\r\nThe ending theme A Page of My Story sung by the five main girls of the show is a beautiful ending theme that perfectly closes off the episode of Princess Principal.\\n\r\nNow for sub vs dub.\\n\r\nThe sub is pretty good for what it was that is filled with good Seiyuu performances all across the board however the reason why I didn't release this review back in 2017 is that I wanted to watch/review this show dubbed and I have to now say. Princess Principal is not only the best dubbed from Sentai Filmworks but is also one of the best English Dub I have ever seen. Sentai Filmworks really brought they S game here as every single dub actor was actually British person and they all did a fantastic job with roles that were given especially the five main girls. My favourite dub performance was Elizabeth Bunch as Dorothy. She nailed Dorothy more than the sub counterpart as she actually more Charisma to an already awesome character. Honestly, God bless this dub.\\n\r\n10/10\\n\\n\r\nFinal Thoughts.\\n\r\nOverall I really liked Princess Principal.\\n\r\nDespite the lack of a real ending least as of right now, Princess Principal is a very enjoyable and memorable ride that I enjoyed from start to finish. The story was great and well told, the Victorian London was beautiful, the characters were great and fun to watch and the visuals as well the music was awesome. If you\u2019re looking for a great spy anime that has likeable characters and an engaging story then I strongly recommend Princess Principal.\\n\r\nIt is a fantastic spy anime that no one should miss.\\n\r\nFinal Score 9/10",

            "content": "[THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS]\r\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________\r\n(The Girl from Black Lizard Planet)\r\n\u201cSpy\u201d, whenever I hear that word, I think of James Bond, the Bourne Series, or the Mission Impossible series.  Basically, men with guns with a strong emphasis on action, and less on espionage and infiltration.  However, in this anime, our main characters are not men with guns, rather girls with guns and a lot of wit.  And more emphasis on espionage and infiltration than outright action.  Still get ready for some great spy action, fun and engaging characters, a rocking opening song and intro, and good animation and art.  I certainly enjoyedit, maybe you will too.\\n\\n\r\nSTORY:\\n\\n\r\nUpon reading the MAL synopsis and watching the first two episodes, I had a feeling that this show will be mainly character driven and the episodes will be episodic in nature.  And by the fourth episode, I was correct in my assumption, although having the episodes air non-chronologically was something I had not expected.  Still, for a show that is telling its story non-chronologically, there are certain overarching themes that are addressed.  Some overarching themes that are addressed include: 1) roles, duties, and activities of a spy, 2) the use of deception, and 3) companionship/teamwork.\\n\\n\r\nNow, having said that, the story is good; there are many moments where the technique \u201cshow don\u2019t tell\u201d is cleverly used with minimal use of expositions.  Here are two examples.\\n\\n\r\nExample #1, in the first episode, Ange and Beatrice are tasked to gather intelligence on Eric and to find the younger sister.  While, the exact plans aren\u2019t told to us directly, we, as the viewers, are shown how Ange and Beatrice infiltrate the infirmary, determine which room the young sister might be in, and identify potential counter-agents without one word being spoken nor internal thought.\\n\\n\r\nExample #2, in Episode 4, Ange is tasked with stealing a prototype miniature Cavorite device that the Kingdom had recently developed.  Ange and the others manage to infiltrate the area where the prototype is located.  Ange locates the room where the Cavorite was stored, but is surprised  to find the room is empty.  However, using her own Cavorite and overhearing the guards mention about moving something heavy, she figures out the Cavorite device is being transported on a ship.\\n\\n\r\nOther aspects that I found to be cool, and thus making the story better, were the slick action scenes (e.g. sword fights, gun battles, and hand-to-hand combat), the crazy car chases, and the tension infiltration and scouting missions.  Furthermore, the way each girl, working in a team, used their strengths and abilities to fulfill a mission is gratifying.  \\n\\n\r\nFor example, in Episode 4, the Princess used her strong connections to allow her and the others to infiltrate the ceremony.  Dorothy uses her charm and allure to distract a male guard, thus allowing Ange and Beatrice to sneak pass him.  Beatrice mimics a guard\u2019s voice to avoid be caught by the other guards.  Ange uses her special Cavorite device to fall from high up without taking damage.  And Chise uses excellent sword and hand-to-hand combat abilities to disable multiple guards.\\n\\n\r\nMore aspects that I found to be good is fanservice is not tasteless and random, and the full use of slice of life moments (e.g. working in a morgue, laundry mill, etc) to explore some aspects of the girls\u2019s backstory, explain somethings about the world, or advance some elements of the plot.  And finally, a fantastic ending.  Overall, the story is good.\\n\\n\r\nANIMATION:\\n\\n\r\nThe background design and setting are excellent.  The Victorian era setting is apparent throughout the show from its brick and stone covered streets and buildings to its steampunk technology (e.g. huge airships, steam-powered vehicles, large pipes running on the side of buildings, etc) to its detailed late 19th \u2013 early 20th century fashion.  Moreover, the producers and creators must have done their research for this show, and as it could be seen in the many, variety of vehicles and clothing.  Some vehicles seen include: tourer, Crossley\u2019s, steam-powered boats, trains, and airships, etc.  Some clothing include: maid uniform, laced and wavy ballroom dresses, suits, etc.  And, of course, various types of hats: top hat, flat cap, ascot cap, bowler hat, bonnets, kasa, etc.  Overall, the buildings, cloth design, and vehicles are all drawn very well and are rich in detail.  \\n\\n\r\nThe character designs are very good.  Compared to the male characters, who appear rugged and beardy sometimes, the girls appear cute and very moe-ish, however this is not a detriment, rather it works in the girls\u2019 favor as some of them could use their charm and appeal to allure men into a false sense of security.  As, for the animations, just like its character design, they are great.  In particular, the fight scenes, such as the sword fight on the train, or the use of kicks and hand to hand combat in certain episodes, are fluid and smooth, and have excellent transitions from scene to scene.  There are a few minor problems like animations errors (e.g. Beatrice talking without the mechanical neck device) or some questionable CG characters in the background, still they are negligible.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND:\\n\\n\r\nThe sound design is well-done, especially the voice acting in this show.  For example, the voice actress, Ayaka Imamura, was able to make Ange have a soft and medium pitch voice, however she could use other pitches, such as high (e.g. acting like a schoolgirl) or low (e.g. acting a like a Yankee) to help Ange blend in with her environment/surrounding.  Another example, the voice actress, Akari Kageyama, was able to make Beatrice have a very high pitched voice, but with the assistants of other voice actors (usually male), they could make Beatrice mimic the voices of other characters.  The background songs and noises are excellent and are able to immerse viewers into the world of Princess Principal.  The opening song is sung in English and accompanied with the usually guitars, bass, and drums, but also piano, saxophone, and other instruments.  To me, it sounds like rock music, and not J-Pop, which is a plus in my opinion.  Furthermore, the intro is really cool.  The ending song and intro were okay, but not as good as the opening song.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER:\\n\\n\r\nConsidering that this show is mainly character driven, it\u2019s important for the characters to have some background information, some character development, and some goals and ambitions.  And that we do.  Over the course of twelve episodes, we have learned little bits and pieces about each of our characters.\\n\\n\r\nAnge specializes in infiltration, scouting, disguising, and many more, basically an all-rounder.  And, of course, she tells many lies throughout the series, and is able to change her personality whenever the situation arises.  Her training is shown in Episode 10, where she, Dorothy and another student were the only people to pass the class and officially become spies.  Another important revelation was revealed in Episode 8, which provides evidences as to why Ange is also good in the arts and crafts.  Her main goal is make the Princess\u2019s wish/dream come true.  \\n\\n\r\nChise is a foreign exchange student from Japan, who specializes in assassinations and combat, and has trouble understanding the European culture.  This cultural conflict is perfectly highlighted in Episode 9, where she writes a letter to her sister about her thoughts concerning her colleagues, her school\u2019s meals and curricular activities, and how she\u2019s coping with the new environment.  Her backstory is revealed in Episode 5, where she meets everyone for the first time.  And, while her backstory is somewhat cliched, it showed some principles that she values, such as honor and forgiveness.  Her main mission is to report to Lord Horikawa, and decide whether to side with the Kingdom or Commonwealth.  \\n\\n\r\nBeatrice is a nice and reserved girl, who serves as the Princess\u2019s aid and close friend.  Her ability to mimic the voices of other people is revealed in Episode 3, in the form of a tragic backstory.  And while, how she got her mechanical device is sad, she is able to use it to fool the enemy, thus making missions slightly more easier.  Her main goal is to the protect Princess and to support her cause.\\n\\n\r\nDorothy is a 20-years-old uncover student, who acts as the team\u2019s leader.  It has been shown on numerous occasions that she\u2019s an excellent driver, a master sharpshooter, and adept at the art of seduction.  Her backstory and real name is revealed in Episode 6, where it explores the bleak relationships between her and her father.  Her main goals are unknown.\\n\\n\r\nPrincess has a calm and somewhat strange personality, who uses her connections and diplomatic relation to assist Ange and others in certain missions (e.g. Episode 4 and 7).  A surprising revelation is revealed in Episode 8, which highlights how determined she really is.  Her main goals is to become Queen and to unite the Country.\\n\\n\r\nAll and all, each character (minus some annoyance with Beatrice) is fun and entertaining.  And, I wished a second season was announced, so that we can explore more about who they are, and watch as they go on their crazy spy missions.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT:\\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed this show immensely.  It was a fun ride.  From its engaging, non-chronological story-line to its rich environment and setting to its fun and enjoyable characters.  This was one show I had underestimated, and I\u2019m glad I started to watch this show earlier than later.  I recommend everyone to watch this show, even if you\u2019re not a fan of the genre or moe-ish character design.",

            "content": "Princess Principal is a show I would have been unlikely to put high priority on watching, but the fact that a bunch of people I knew were planning to watch and review it instantly got it on the table for me. While I was far too slow to join them, I nonetheless made sure to push through later, and here we are. And Princess Principal's concept IS interesting enough. You don't really get a lot of anime spy shows, for example. The recent Joker Game anime, which I still need to watch, was one of the first examples to come to my head. Joker Game,from what I saw, looked a bit underwhelming, so I went into Princess Principal hopeful it would be better.\\n\\n\r\nPrincess Principal's chief issue lies in the characters, as there is absolutely no character development throughout its twelve episode run time. Each character gets at least one background one shot story to give you an idea of how they joined the team or got to where they are, but they are essentially never relevant to the plot (Beatrice's in particular is barely even seen, let alone matters) and do not end up driving much of anything or even giving us much more of a sense of the characters. Chise's is the closest and it is still mostly tepid, although it at least has a full and complete self contained story...and then she got another generic focus episode that served solely to show off characters you don't care about who will never appear again and stuff you already knew!\\n\\n\r\nI like the idea of how the background stories were structured, starting us with the team on a mission already and then slowly showing us how they got here while mixing in more present episodes, but the fact that these backstory episodes are totally lacking in substance just kills the concept in the crib. The princess was just about the only character I thought was interesting, although she is a pretty unrealistic character, because her episodes were executed somewhat different than normal via the latter episodes. It was more tied into the overall story than the one shots and offered more character insight in the process. Can't go into too much detail here since it'd be a spoiler, although you will most likely figure out what happened by the end of the second episode.\\n\\n\r\nThe overall series plot is only barely existent, with the series largely consisting of one shots and an ending 2-parter. The 2-parter would have definitely benefited from some foreshadowing. It wouldn't be hard to tie more of the one shots in to it when almost none do. For example the episode about smuggling nerve gas through could have instead been about smuggling through some materials which are used in the final episode. You know, basic stuff. Granted, the finale isn't good either and has one of the goofier villain exits I've seen as they escape the plot after suffering a minor setback.\\n\\n\r\nThe one shots aren't that great either and suffer from an issue that the first episode already kind of tries to spell out (albeit trying to spin it as a good thing) and which is obvious from just watching 1-2 episodes more: Nearly every episode of this show is going to have some kind of plot twist shoehorned into it. Once the viewer understands this, almost every episode becomes painfully predictable as despite the show trying to sell you on \"twists\" it never really tries to be inventive, do anything new or even execute what it does in a manner that advances the characters. I wouldn't mind the lack of inventiveness if not for the last point, as the execution is pretty much boring and expected without using it to enhance the show. Episode 6 was the height of this to me: Unless you either have somehow not gotten what this show is about at that point or have never seen this style of plot before, you will figure out exactly what is going to happen at least halfway through the episode if not sooner. It was extremely disappointing and going for a different ending which could further Dorothy's character would have made it much more engaging.\\n\\n\r\nThis is compounded by the fact that this is one of those series where all of the characters are unbelievably competent and thus makes it difficult to feel tension in scenes. Most of the time, their plots don't even go all that wrong and thus there is not a lot of challenge felt: There are a pair of recurring antagonists so forgettable I don't even remember their names and they always come off as less competent than the show presents them due to repeatedly losing and being foiled in frequently easy ways. When the show tries to end on a stinger of them preparing for future conflicts, it is difficult to take them seriously due to this. For an idea of how unbelievably competent some characters are, the backstory of one says that they cannot read or write, but that they then learned NINE LANGAUGES...without anyone helping them. While also learning about 10 other listed things! It completely destroys any willing suspension of disbelief when it is so outrageous, especially since the setting otherwise plays out as somewhat realistic but with some ill defined magitech.\\n\\n\r\nIf there's one thing Princess Principal did solidly enough, it was the art and sound. All of the girls are reasonably cute, the background art is at times fairly pretty, it has a very victorian feel to it mixed with some industrial stuff, so if nothing else that works. The CGI on the other hand is pretty hit or miss. Stuff like the car is usually fine if sometimes a bit jarring, but the last car chase scene for example looks pretty bad (the CGI train made me laugh for a bit, which is not what you want from your dramatic heart pounding scene usually!). The soundtrack was a bit more forgettable, but there were some decent background tracks and the OP and ED are solid. Overall, this was one area where Princess Principal largely felt reasonable.\\n\\n\r\nI was honestly somewhat surprised by how much I disliked this series by the end of it. It started off fairly standard and I thought it would be some general 4-6 star anime fodder. Instead the complete lack of character progression, lackluster one shot plots, lack of an overarching story and absence of tension completely stifled the show for me and left it a pointless slog. I would recommend avoiding this anime unless you are a hardcore spy fan (although you might even be more annoyed by me at how lackluster it is if you're hardcore into the genre), have some character design or part of the concept really jump out or simply want to watch as much anime as possible.",

            "content": "There are many ways in which a show can be a disappointment. Weak characters, a lackluster plot, the possibilities seem endless. The same goes for Princess Principal. Set in the industrial age of an alternative timeline in which London currently is split into two by a gigantic wall, separating the two main political factions akin to Berlin in the Cold War, the sheer number of possible intriguing storylines is overwhelming. Add to that possible conflict in the inner workings of said factions, espionage,  the gorgeous steampunk aesthetic as well as the kicking soundtrack and you are left with as many possible turn-ons as inthe cockpit of an airplane. While, granted, having a safe flight which means not using all the \u201cturn-ons\u201d is a good thing when talking about your average airplane, this does not translate to anime. However, sadly, this is where the main problem, the main disappointment of this show lies: It doesn\u2019t do anything out of the ordinary and plays it too safe. The political sub-plot is never really expanded upon, the fun espionage of the first two episodes grows stale over time, the potential of the setting is left unutilized.\\n\\n\r\nFair warning: This review contains spoilers!\\n\\n\r\nThe main difference between shows that are just bad and those that are disappointing is at times slim, but it can be condensed to a simple word: Promise. For better or worse, the first two episodes of Princess Principal were actually creative and fun to watch. While episode 1 is a lot more action-centered and investigative, it also sets up future conflict, hinting at the possibility of betrayal in the group of spies and establishing a feeling of distance between the characters. The second episode then first shows the spies really at work in an exhilarating episode brimming with creativity, as they \u201cinfiltrate\u201d a party in the enemy camp and, through clever and inventive usage of their limited repertoire of tools, manage to prevail. This is also the first time that Ange and Princess trick their \u201ccolleagues\u201d, a recurring theme in the show. In the meantime a potential villain, the Duke of Normandy, gets introduced.\\n\\n\r\nWith such a solid build-up, you\u2019d expect the pieces to slowly fall into place. Unfortunately this is not the case for Princess Principal. Instead, the episodic non-chronological format results in the show slowly but drastically losing steam. Because we follow episodic plots, there is no time left to develop the political sub-plot which in turn gets degraded into a mere tool to cause conflict later on. There is no greater reason as to why the creators chose to do so. The non-chronological order, unlike in other series, didn\u2019t really add anything of substance to the story and as a consequence of the episodic plot, the story itself also suffers.\\n\\n\r\nFocus of the episodic plots is more often than not one of the spies of the main group. A lingering feeling of repetition is present throughout all of them. That is, because there is a lot of repetition. Over half of the cast has a tragic father figure as a means of creating a feeling of pity for the character which feels tired and trite. The characters themselves, because of the sheer absence of character development apart from a \"sad\" backstory, end up being flat. Beatrice has only two character traits: her father has implanted a robotic device into her and she likes Princess a lot. This does, however, not only apply to Beatrice, it is instead applicable to all of the \u201cminor\" spies: Chise is kind of an airhead but is very fond of traditional japanese things. Over the course of the show she fights and kills her father. She grows fond of the group and respecting of Princess and her goals. Dorothy is older than the rest of the cast and good at anything \u201cadult\u201d like driving and seducing men. Her father beat her when she was a kid, but when they grow closer again in one of the episodes, her father ends up being killed by an underling of the Duke of Normandy.\\n\\n\r\nThere are only two interesting characters in this show, namely Princess and Ange, the main duo of the show. While it is clear from the beginning that they have some kind of special relationship, the idea that they were friends that through some means \u201cswitched places\u201d sounds like something straight out of a fairy tale, and in a good way. Not only is this turn of events at first inherently interesting as a substitute of the non-existent plot, it also serves to give Princess a reason for her angelic behaviour, her plan to both tear down the physical wall that separates the people as well as the wall in Ange's heart and the hearts of the people, a very heartwarming albeit boring goal and motivation. \\n\\n\r\nBut it isn\u2019t all gold that shines. This central event, this central plot twist entails a number of weak and boring narrative turns. The foreshadowed \u201clying between spies\u201d of episode 1 ends up restricting itself to only this one central \u201clie\u201d. The tearing-down of the wall in the hearts of the people restricts itself to one final episode and the only time we see it in action is when all of the main characters come together in the final episode and Ange opens up to her colleagues. Not only does the plot end up feeling extremely rushed because the main twist was introduced too late, the main twist entails the most boring, the most trite of storytelling. It goes against the idea of seclusion and secrecy and advocates change in favor of more inclusion and a feeling of unity. Friendship prevails and after one admittedly major incident, the conflict in the inner workings of the faction of the Commonwealth, sparked by the military, is instantly resolved. The final timeskip in the last episode further rubs it in: Princess Principal never even tried to tell an engaging story, it was merely satisfied with hinting at one and then following the most conventional storytelling possible. The finale is entirely anticlimactic.\\n\\n\r\nMost of the time is spent on the numerous missions of the main group which take place in various locations which are all admittedly very interesting and different. Working in a morgue, infiltrating the enemy base, close quarters combat on a train, entering an airship. All of the missions sound very different on paper and well, most of them are. However, when Princess Principal falls flat, it really does. Apart from the missions/episodes that focus on one character of the cast, the missions are very stale in nature. This is mainly because none of them feel as smart and creative as the exhilarating episode 2. They end up following a formula that relies on each character\u2019s respective specialty: Princess serves as an entry ticket, Dorothy can drive and divert the attention of male guards, Beatrice can imitate the voice of an officer/guard or the like, Chise can basically fight an army by herself and Ange can fly and do humanly impossible stuff like listening to a two-digit number of audio channels at once. This formula results in both engagement and tension being lost because the missions feel too simple, too easy. It feels like nothing is at stake, and if something goes wrong it feels forced because it doesn\u2019t align with the established formula. Another annoyance is that the main characters can basically not be hit by gunshots unless the plot demands it, eventual hits feel very sudden and out of place, as if they don\u2019t belong. Overall, Princess Principal\u2019s reliance on the specialties of their characters is akin to the narrative shooting itself in the foot.\\n\\n\r\nPrincess Principal at its best looks great, especially Chise\u2019s close-quarter fights look very nice, fluid and are a joy to watch. Personally, I am also a big fan of the steampunk aesthetic, the airships, or all vehicles for that matter, look beautiful and detailed. Anything else however, while never unpleasant, isn\u2019t quite up to par with the near visual spectacle of infiltrating airships or exhilarating car rides. The character designs of the main cast are for the most part distinctive enough, but they aren\u2019t exactly anything noteworthy. What is noteworthy about the character designs as a whole is the usage of preferably round, cutesy moe faces for the female characters which at times clashes with the more realistic character designs of their male counterparts.\\n\\n\r\nThe case of Princess Principal is a peculiar one. The show tries to do something unique with its non-chronological, episodic format, but at the same time it plays it too safe and ends up following both the formulas of screenwriting and its own formulas for spying missions too closely. It tries to both innovate and not do anything out of the ordinary. The aftermath of this discrepancy is a cast of mostly flat characters, repetitive plotlines and formulaic missions. Although the show can be fun at times, it isn\u2019t more than an okay show with poorly structured plot that cannot rise above its own genericness. It was sometimes fun while it lasted, but ultimately I recommend skipping this show.\\n",

            "content": "On the surface, Princess Principal ticks all the boxes for elements I like in anime, Victorian Steampunk, dark gritty environments, intrigue and mystery with a dash of light-heartedness on the side. With Studio 3Hz on board as one of the main studios, how could I pass this up? 3Hz also made my favorite anime of all time, Flip Flappers. So how does it compare? Some minor spoilers follow.\r\nWell, the more keened eye amongst you may notice that Okouchi is head of the writing staff. The guy infamous for his trainwrecks both lovely and grand such as Code Geass or Kabaneri of the Iron Fortress. Ithought that even if the overall story wasn't any good, I'd still be in for a smashing good time. Sadly (or thankfully) the team seemed to have sedated him or placed him under heavy medication, as Princess Principal ended up having a competent story throughout.\\n\\n\r\nNotice that I used the word \"Competent\", not \"Interesting\". I admit, perhaps it was a bit naive of me to enter this with high hopes of it replacing Flip Flappers as my favorite anime, but Princess Principal felted mostly like wasted potential. To elaborate further, while the first two episodes may hint at a series focusing on espionage and drama, Princess Principal is a largely Slice-Of-Life series where cute spy girls do cute spy things. Sure, some episodes may feature slightly more dire stakes than the previous episodes, but this is negated by the fact that Princess Principal, uniquely I may add, jumbles up its episode order for a majority of episodes (with the last two episodes being the major exceptions).\\n\\n\r\nIt's as if the team wanted to make a 24-episode anime but due to whatever reasons, budgetary or creative, they settled with 12 but the individual case episode encompass the range of 1 to 24, exemplified by how the first episode is Case 13 while the second episode is the true starting point chronologically. In spite of (or maybe even due to) this unique way of working around restrictions in episode count, the pacing of the series is greatly crippled. An action-packed episode may follow a slow slice-of-life episode for instance. Adding to the episodic nature of the series, the loose thread connecting the episodes with each other just simply isn't prevalent enough, and you'd be forgiven if you lost the direction the plot is heading into. Worse is how interesting elements  unique to the Princess Principal universe (such as cavorite poisoning, The British Empire being split in half, Normandy belonging to Britain instead of France) don't play any significant role in the plot. The series ends hinting at a continuation in the future, which would sting if the series never gets an extension. If you thought the Cavorite jungle shown in the opening was ever going to make an appearance, you'd be sorely mistaken. And remember the Duke of Normandy? He\u2019s going to appear in a pop quiz at the end of the review. So be prepared!\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of characters, the main cast is quite likable, although Ange\u2019s \u201cBlack Lizard\u201d schtick and Chise\u2019s \u201cFresh off the Boat\u201d gag do get old. One complaint I have is with regards to the antagonists throughout the series. The Duke of Normandy for instance, despite being labelled as a major antagonist on the show\u2019s website, he\u2019s mostly a no-show for most episodes, and it\u2019s not like his devious schemes are of any relevance to the show. He\u2019s just some old guy with glasses. A rival character with abilities rivalling Ange is introduced extremely late into the story, with her appearance essentially being sequel-bait material. She\u2019s by far the most interesting character outside the main cast due to her appearing for over 10 minutes, but her presence is too little too late to elevate the cast of characters to anything special.\\n\\n\r\nThe director once mentioned the focus of the series was on the relationship/romance between Ange and Princess. Ange and Princess are embroiled in a Prince-and-the-Pauper scenario, further intensified after the London Revolution. While I do applaud the writing team at moments for a select choice of scenes starring the two (most notably episode 8), their relationship doesn't come to the forefront that often, and their relationship isn't any more meaningful beyond Princess being a slightly more competent damsel-in-distress. \\n\\n\r\nAnd there's that word again. Competent. Competent is also how I'd describe the writing throughout the series as well. It's generally good and will leave you interested (most of the time), but nothing special. There are also some glaring moments where they want you to feel a certain emotion but regrettably don't have the talents to make such a scene pop. The example I'm using is that dreadful Chise scene in episode 5. Her \"Pain Pain Go Away\" line to that lone orphan  feels tacked on just for this episode, so you just know it\u2019s going to be cruelly twisted at the end . When the plot twist comes and Chise is tearing up, I felt nothing but my head tilting down in shame. And this incident is completely forgotten in subsequent episodes. Classy.  A slightly better way to remedy this is to have the line be part of her characterisation and introduce it in an earlier episode. It's not an elegant solution, but it's better than what we have. That is not to say there aren't moments that elicited a reaction from me, the ending to episode 6, while predictable, left me in goosebumps thanks to its brilliant direction and execution.\\n\\n\r\nI've been complaining a lot about this series, so you might be wondering : Why even bother? Well, Princess Principal is still fairly entertaining as a whole. The animation vividly captures the action and the audio mixing is superb. And as I said earlier, the direction in general is a cut above average and the execution of the scenes ultimately leaves one enthralled. In addition, I do appreciate how the series portrays the Victorian Era as not entirely cog sunshines and metal rainbows, depicting aspects such as poverty and the prevalence of child labor in London, something most media set in this period generally gloss over. It\u2019s not even window dressing either, the themes of wealth disparity even comes into play for a few of the episodes and I do appreciate them for at least trying to depict this otherwise commonplace setting a little differently.\\n\\n\r\nIn the end however, Princess Principal is simply a competent anime. It\u2019s good but not spectacular. If this ever gets a second season, I\u2019d highly recommend you check it out. However, since the survival of this series is still uncertain, it\u2019s difficult to recommend this show on a whim. The series simply doesn\u2019t do anything substantial or unique to warrant a viewing. \\n\\n\r\n6/10\\n\r\nAbove Average, not worth going out of your way to watch.\\n\\n\r\nNow then, remember the Duke of Normandy? You don\u2019t? Me neither. I don\u2019t even remember the question I was about to ask! But I don\u2019t blame you, I didn\u2019t think he was that important anyway.\\n",

            "content": "Princess Principal is a serviceable show; not a msterpiece, but not a total failure either. Disappointing would be the most accurate description, because the show introduces tempting setting, interesting characters and unconventional story telling while doing nothing with those ideas. Another aspect not working at all (for me), is conjunction of moe elements and mature themes. \r\nSTORY:What story?\r\nPlot of Princess Principal is told out of order, not chronologically. There are shows, which utilized this structure to craft compelling and intriguing stories. PriPri is not one of them. Almost all episodes are stand alone events and are hardly connected by overarching plotlines. A simple case ofthe week show. Furthermore, the show has no mystery elements, the biggest plot twist is spoilered in ep. 2.\\n\r\nPacing is also all over the place. Ep. 6 tried to introduce/develope one protagonist with backstory and interaction with another charakter, ending on an emotional high note. However, this relationship felt rushed and the ending forced. Events like this need more screentime to create an impact, since the themes of Princes Principal are rather dark and mature. On the other hand ep. 7 was a boring sitting with convoluted B-plot.\\n\r\nDespite being a show about spies, there is surprisingly little actual spying going on, like political intrigues. PriPri cannot create moments of genuine urgency or danger, due to strong episodic structure and subpar writing. The last 2 episodes try to create a dramatical finale but fail in a spectacular fashion, because the \"evil\" comes out of nowherer. Looking back, the overall plot did not move a step, if you compare the reall first episode and the last one. The reason for zero plot progression is severe focus on character development.  \\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS: Interessting but underused.\\n\r\n5 main characters are interesting, diverse and have more than one quirk going for them. In general a well balanced cast that is fun to watch. Chise takes the first spot in authenticity, followed by Dorothy. Well, those two got the most interesting arcs. However, those are not spies, but cute girls in a hard world, victimized for the sake of the plot. \\n\\n\r\nARTWORK & ANIMATION: Expensive rag rug.\\n\r\nCharakter models and backgrounds are detailed; animation, especially in all hand to hand combat scenes, is great. Unfortunatelly, the artwork itself, while detailed, is a Frankenstein's monster. ALL women, most notably the main cast, look like charakters from a moe slice of life show, while all men look menacing and grim. And all spy outfits appear rather cutesy than practical. This moe look does not mash well with dark and mature themes of the show and can lower the impact of emotional scenes. As if the artwork is the only way to underline injustice.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND: Good. \\n\r\nMemorable OP and solid voice act are speaking in favor of the show.",

Check\r\nPrincess Principal is my Anime of the Season. When I first heard about it, I didn't come with high expectations. I thought it'll be some generic action/magic anime or a \"Cute Girls Doing Cute Things\" anime.\r\nOh, I was wrong. Princess Principal DOES have only female characters as main characters, and yes, they are pretty cute, but the last thing you'll say about them is that they're doing cute things. (Well, that is of course if you do not consider killing people \"cute things\")\r\nPrincess Principal is an episodic anime,each episode isn't related to the one before, and aren't released chronologically. Some of them show history and background of the characters. Most of the anime is like that, but at some point it airs a few episodes in a row which are also chronologically connected.\\n\\n\r\nI wouldn't want to spoil, but there's some kind of twist we see early on which makes the show a bit more confusing, but a lot more interesting.\\n\\n\r\nOne of the things that amazed is the setting.\\n\r\nThe steampunk setting is presented well. The world, the buildings, the poverty vs the rich, the clothes, the soldiers, the weapons, the cars. All of it looked faithful to the 19th century.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters don't fall into the normal anime tropes. We don't have the \"tsundere\" for example who is just a \"tsundere\" without any traits.\\n\\n\r\nAll of the characters are interesting, likeable and different. All of them are spies (as said in the synopsis) but each has her own fighting style, the way she acts, handles the tasks or her friends and such.\\n\\n\r\nTalking about the art- If you saw screenshots or action sequences you could see that it's a beauty. Looks really good, pleasing to the eye and pretty detailed.\\n\\n\r\nLastly, the music. One of thr stronger aspects of the show. The Opening song is my favorite from this season, and is a good contender for the best Opening song of the year for me. The ED is pretty good as well, soothing after a tense episode.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack (OST) is on point, adds a lot to the viewing experience.\\n\\n\r\nI'm still not sure on my score, I want to give it either 9 or 10. For this review I'll go with 9.5 .\\n\\n\r\nI recommend Princess Principal.\\n\\n\r\nTL;DR Amazing anime, my AOTS. Interesting story, amazing action, music and art. Recommended.",

And secondly, I binged watched this in one go, so my experience may differ from the few scathing reviews of this show.\r\nThis is a spoiler-free review. (i hope)\r\nThis anime knows what switch to flip for a binge watcher like me. While the episodes are not in chronological order (episode 1's title is called case 13, 'nuff said), this helps the audience piece together the story behind the girls. That is why the scathing reviews make no sense to me whatsoever. Each episode provides a little nugget of thegirls' day-to-day activities, and each mission the team does, paints an image and offers a deeper understanding on the many aspects of the conflict between the Kingdom and the Commonwealth.\\n\\n\r\nThe episodes are enjoyable - heartwarming even, while others keep one at the edge of suspense, amazement, and awe of the individual character's personalities (loved the end of episode 1). \\n\\n\r\nWhile there are some predictable twists, I do not think that they should affect one's enjoyment of a show. What I seek was character driven plot, and I felt that Princess Principle did it very well.\\n\\n\r\nThe art was very well done too, the background were very captivating and immersive. The girls had nice designs, and were drawn consistently. The show is just simply pleasing to look at.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound is a 10/10 for me. The opening is catchy, and the ending helps to wind the day down. The soundtracks used complements the action in the screen, and really adds to the enjoyment. \\n\\n\r\nAlso, the OST is by Yuki Kajiura, make what you have to with this information.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Princess Principle is one of the hidden gems of the summer season, and one that I enjoyed thoroughly. However, the story is incomplete, and I hope for a second season.",

            "content": "[SPOILERS]\r\nPrincess Principal is a grand affair that uses mostly anachronological 'cases' to weave a narrative of deceit, espionage, and politics - all through the perspective of high school girls. The expectations one might form from this premise are quickly surpassed with an outstanding balance in many aspects: the girls' more lighthearted interactions are never too far from being juxtaposed with coldhearted violence. The impressive setting, aesthetically and politically, is carefully never over-revealed. The large scale of the main arc never requires sacrifices in detail. This consistent balance makes enjoying the ride of Princess Principal entirely effortless.\r\nThe spies themselves are, for the most part, well developedcharacters. Princess Principal does a good job of making these five girls much more interesting as the show goes on. It is here that the abandonment of chronology is used most effectively, with episodes dedicated to revealing a characters' backstory and motivations outside of the overarching narrative. Although it can be jarring at times to have the order of events jumbled like this, it could add some rewatch value to the series, especially if watched in chronological order over episodical. Beatrice struck me as the only one-dimensional character, and even she has mentions of a fairly interesting backstory that could be explored further in the upcoming sequel.\\n\\n\r\nThe character work of Princess Principal truly outdoes itself in the side characters that mostly exist for no more than one episode. Side characters like Eric Anderson, Marilla, Dorothy's father, and 'Prefect,' to name a few, are always shockingly complex and well thought out for how minor a role they play in the grander scheme. There are often moving moments in these subplots that work well to enhance the stakes of the main plot - another example of the balance Princess Principal achieves with clear self-awareness.\\n\\n\r\nThe one area where this balance felt lacking, however, is the emotional investment necessary to make 'Princess' and Ange's arc work as intended. Princess Principal keeps its cards close to the chest in all things, and its characters follow suit, leading to the underdevelopment of this crucial relationship. Although enough time is allotted to depicting the childhood connection they share, Ange and Princess simply aren't given the scenes necessary in the current day to give enough meaning to what happens in later episodes. Interactions after ten years of living each others' lives and fighting to find the other are left largely unexplored other than the initial reunion, leaving the childhood events as the only driving force behind their chemistry.\\n\\n\r\nThe art of Princess Principal is given plenty of opportunity to show off in this royal steampunk setting. The diverse tones of the show are always perfectly matched by dark cobblestone streets clouded with fog, a bright sunny courtyard trimmed with sun-soaked flowerbeds, or a grand ballroom with regal furnishings. The detailed designs of cars, guns, and Victorian fashion all somehow add to the distinct feel of intrigue that the show commands so well.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Princess Principal is a very enjoyable experience. The careful pace of its exposition keeps you wondering all the way, and the ambitious world it takes place in holds unlimited opportunities to subvert your expectations as a potentially jaded viewer. Maybe its only because I'm still very new to this medium, but Princess Principal felt fresh to me and I'm looking forward to its future instalments.",

            "content": "Have you ever watched an anime that had such a shocking plot twist that it made your heart stop, which was then revived by heart-racing epic action scenes, and then killed again by heart-rending feels? Well, Princess Principal is one of those anime.\r\n(This review will be spoiler-free because I am a strong believer in heart-stopping plot twists being experienced the way the creators intended.)\r\nAs weird and misleading as the title may be, Princess Principal has little to do with slice-of-school life or educational administrators. Rather, it is a show about spies and espionage in early 20th century London, and is executed in such a waythat seems believable, and frankly, real. Though that isn't to say it is a show devoid of comedy; despite having its share of dark moments, the writers found a way to insert lines that made me laugh out loud, felt natural, and didn't interfere with the core essence of the story.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of which, the story is not told in the order of events as they happen, but rather on a case-by-case basis, with each episode focusing on a particular task the main characters are assigned, usually with a spotlight on one of the main characters' backgrounds. I found that this mode of story-telling worked surprisingly well. It didn't make the story incoherent, as one may think it would, but actually benefitted the flow of the story and made reveals more exciting than if it was told in chronological order. \\n\\n\r\nFortunately, as an original anime, Princess Principal wasn't bogged down by inherent adaptation issues; the pacing didn't feel rushed, and this allowed the creators to fully control the way in which the story was presented. Unfortunately, as an original anime, the show doesn't have a pre-existing fanbase that would watch the anime just because it was based off a popular light novel or manga, resulting in a highly underrated, overlooked, and under-viewed gem (though I hope that this review will help to change this).\\n\\n\r\nThe five main characters were all magnificent, and I thought their seiyuus were all perfectly fitting, even for one character whose voice instinctively made my cursor gravitate towards the volume button. They all received a good amount of screen time, and I didn't feel as if any one character was underdeveloped throughout the show, like I sometimes do when watching other anime.\\n\\n\r\nThe art style is subtle and beautiful, the character designs were outstanding and unique (I especially loved Ange's design), and everything was executed in a classy manner. Personally, excessive fanservice is often the make-or-break factor for me when watching an anime, to the point where I drop a show because I simply can't handle the frequency at which boobs are being thrown around. Fortunately, Princess Principal isn't one of those anime. Though it does have a few instances that I can recall (and by a few I mean I can probably count them on one hand), the writers made it so that it was actually relevant to the story.\\n\\n\r\nThe OP is hype and the ED is catchy, and not to mention the soundtrack was very well done by Yuki Kajiura. 10/10 for sound, too.\\n\\n\r\nWith its strange and over-the-top title, Princess Principal seems to be fated to be overshadowed by countless other mainstream anime, not unlike one of Studio 3Hz's other masterpieces, Flip Flappers. However, if you can get past the initial roadblock of a title, what's waiting is a wonderful, immersive gem of a show that you'll not soon forget.",

            "content": "Princess Principal was a good show, but beeing a cute-girls-do-cute-things show stopped it from beeing a great show.\r\nStory (6/10)\r\nWhile the world is well built and defined, the actual story, a political intrigue surrounding a spy team, was all over the place. It starts out straightforward, stating our characters main goal (one of them wants to throw over the governement and become queen), with the others left to decide where their loyaltys will be. Interesting enough, a good setup, and a well developed world that made me hope for a decend thriller. Sadly, most episodes only focus on the girls backstorys, wheter this is relevant tothe plot or not. Especially the japanese girls backstory was annoyng; while the culture crossing was fun to watch, cshe could have been taken out of the show entirely, and NOTHING would have changed. Every other character at least had a story more or less bound to the plot, and be it just an unskilled girl getting into the world of spies in order to help the viewer understand that world. It was infuriating.\\n\\n\r\nArt  (7/10)\\n\\n\r\nThe world design was typical steampunk, but it was woven into every aspect of the show; the clthing, the gadgets, the food; it felt very well rounded, and the designs fit very well together. The side charcters designs were also quite distinct and varied. Only the main girls designs bothered me. They were so generic, when to of them kept talking about how similiar they looked, and how only they could perform a id-switch, i nearly loughed out loud, because they all looked so similiar. It was really sad, espeacially because most of the other charcters in the show had quite distinct faces....\\n\\n\r\nSound (6/10)\\n\\n\r\nOp was nice and different enough to actually remember it, backround music ranged from generic to actually good and some songs, like the spy-theme have at least some recognition value. The voice acting was mostly ...ok. Typical cute girl anime stuff. The only one whose performence stood out was Ange's VA, who could switch between deadpan and cute girl, which was well done and a good gag.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter (6/10) \\n\\n\r\nThe five main girls are introduced in unnecessary detail, wether their storys further tho plot or not, so i will review each of them.\\n\\n\r\nBeatrice: at first the most annoing of the group, unskilled and at first a bit tsundere, her story is mostly used to introduce the viewer to the world, wich works pretty well. She (thankfully) drops the tsun-tsun act and turns into an actually useful, though still unskilled ally. Mostly there for emotional support, but at least no longer annoing and useful.\\n\\n\r\nChise: Japanese Samurai(?); while her interaction with western culture is handeld really well, it doesn't add to the story at all. One could leave her out and nothing would change. She doesn't have any noteworthy relationships with the other charcters, she doesn't have a real arch, she isn't needed as the muscle of the group because wo other girls already fill that role, even the maybe-double-agent threat goes nowhere. Easily the most frustrating charcter\\n\\n\r\nDorothy: Leader of the spy team, and both the most competend and well developed charcter, despite not beeing the main girl. Her backroundstories introduce you to the world, help expand the relations between the girls, and make her a 3-dimensional character, even though she's the boob girl. It feels like she is the only one who actualy has to sacrifice in order to proceed, which makes her a lot more the other girls.  \\n\\n\r\nPrincess: She is basicly the plot charcter; her desires, her story her will is what drives the show, and i really wish she would have gotten more attention. Whenever she revealed more about her goals or past, the story moved along AND we sympathised more with her. From a story telling standpoint, she would have been an ideal main charcter.\\n\\n\r\nAnge: the quiet, wierd girl. A very capabel spy and the muscle of the group; while she was a fine charcter, i don't think she made a good main charcter; her iner workings weren't explored in enough detail to make her intersting, eventhough they tried to make her the emotional core. She would hvae been better of as a mysterious charcter seen through another persons eyes, like f.e, princess\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (7/10)\\n\\n\r\nCute spy drama with some good charcters and well build world. The action was always fun, even though the story was side lined way too often. Still fun to watch.\\n\\n\r\nOverall (5/10)\\n\\n\r\nA few tweaks like a different MC, getting rid of unnecessary plots (chise) and beeing willing to go dark when necessary would have made this show great. It would have propably been enough to focus more on the (actually good) story they had going. Tho they might have needed 24 eps to make that work propably without loosing all the worldbuilding they did... hard to tell.... \\n\\n\r\nThey way it was now, it was entertaining, but full of unfullfilled potential, and therefore just mediocre. \\n",

            "content": "Slight spoilers for Episode 6\r\nMoe and Spies are not exactly two tropes you would put together. Moe can often be found in a relaxing Slice of Life that usually contains lots of Comedy, while Spies takes a more Action/Adventure filled route packed with Drama. No one would ever look at these two very different ideas and consider putting them together would make a great anime, yet here we are. Princess Principal is our latest Cute Girls Doing Cool Things, (CGDCT) and its ability to integrate these contrasting themes as if they were made for each other is praiseworthy in itself.\r\nPrincess Principal follows an episodic formula,where only the beginning and end arcs span over more than a single episode. The rest is just a selection of missions and daily antics used to explore our characters. Now the curious thing is that most of the anime is not in chronological order. If you look at the episode list on MAL, you can see that each one has a case number set for them ranging from 1-24. But wait, you say with a confused expression on your face! If the highest case number is 24 and the episode count is only 12, where are the remaining 12 cases? Well, they just don't exist. The only real reason I can say about why the creators made it this way is that they just decided to. You aren't really given much of an answer for why they decided to air their show like this, but since it is episodic, the mixed up order and the other supposedly missing cases aren't that big of a deal, although with more episodes the show could've fleshed its world out more.\\n\\n\r\nSo putting aside the confusing stuff, we follow a team of 5 spies consisting of Ange le Carr\u00e9, a master of lies that can use a device to manipulate gravity, Dorothy, the getaway driver and mistress of seduction, Chise, an expert sword-wielding exchange student from Japan, Beatrice, a friend of the Princess who can mimic voices and sounds due to family circumstances, and the Princess herself, someone with an obvious amount of influence which she uses in her favour. This group of girls work together to complete missions every episode, and they're actually really good at their job. There is no ragtag bunch of misfits who need to become the best spies in the world, almost every member are already experts in their fields and the ones that aren't exactly spy-worthy quickly learn how to properly contribute to their team, making them all click together like cogs in a steampunk anime. Each one gets their time in the spotlight to either do what they do best or have their character explored. No member feels left out as we get to see what each one is like through revealments of their pasts, and their interactions with each other allow us to actually see them as somewhat real people with feelings of their own, while also providing some comedy and emotional scenes that don't feel out of place or unnatural.\\n\\n\r\nThe actual missions they are given are either about solving mysteries or finding confidential items/information. The action and other spy scenes for the show look great and really express how badass each character is, and the occasional moe scene that reminds us they're cute girls don't overstay their welcome while actually adding some extra layers to their personality. However, the main focus of Princess Principal is the drama that surrounds most cases. Although you are able to guess how an episode might go most of the time, it doesn't matter at all as they portray them with such emotion that you can't help but get engaged with each scene. For example, one episode has them getting a job at a morgue to find a confidential message hidden in one of the corpses, and one of the spies meet their Dad for the first time in ages. It's a classic story of abuse separating a family, a man broken by an industrial accident who took his anger and stress out onto their daughter, causing her to run away from home. We watch as they get to understand why their life fell apart and try to restart their family as a way to make amends, but sadly it just doesn't work out and the show moves on to the next episode. Of course, it sounds like a pretty standard piece of drama that we've seen done many times over, but the show manipulates the characters dialogue and actions to actually make you care for a scene where we had already predicted what would happen, like having Beatrice mimic the father's singing voice to greatly enhance the impact of the previous events. You can see similar examples of this done throughout the anime, allowing Princess Principal to really tug at your heartstrings and pull out the feelings they want you to experience. However, an episode will fail to hit the mark and cause it to feel a little lacking when compared to the rest of the series, but this happens only once or twice so it doesn't significantly lower your enjoyment of the show.\\n\\n\r\nAlthough it's obvious to assume otherwise, there is, in fact, an overarching story that focuses on Operation Changeling, the team's main mission to replace the Princess with a spy that looks like her, allowing them to take control of the royal family. Now you may remember that near the start of my review, I mention the Princess as part of the spy team, so you might be curious about why they need to go through with this if they already have her on their side. Well, the story progression makes things more clear as the show goes on. It is given to us bit by bit due to the episodic non-chronological episodes, but it actually works in their favour as they are able to slowly reveal secrets behind the Princess and some of the other team members that change the way the plot develops, creating a final climax arc that is able to successfully finish off the series on a high note.\\n\\n\r\nNow if there was one thing I really had to call out as a major flaw, it would be the lack of exploration in the side characters and villains. The show sets up some characters that seem important to the story, but fail to really do anything but make them appear once or twice. The villains look intriguing enough but they're only there to occasionally do something evil and slip back into the void of lost potential. We also have a group of higher-ups that give orders to the team, but again they are only there for that one reason. We get the occasional dialogue between them as they sit together at a table talking about how the episode is going, and that's as much screen time we get for them. If these characters had been given a more involving role throughout the entire story and not just for the final arc, their uselessness could have been avoided and would have significantly improved an already great anime.\\n\\n\r\nI can proudly say that Princess Principal is my Anime of the Season for Summer 2017, but there are still problems that could have probably be fixed if the show had been given an extra cour to really shine some light on the parts that didn't get touched on much. Putting that problem aside, this was one of the seasonals I truly looked forward to watching every week, which is why I hold it in such high regard. If you had doubts about how well this anime can mix cute girls with espionage, I highly recommend that you pick it up and experience this for yourself.\\n\\n\r\nThanks for Reading, Send Feedback if You Have Any!",

            "content": "(This review has been adapted from my blog/reddit thread. Spoilers ahead!)\r\nWhen I first started learning about cybersecurity, we talked about notable cases and the importance of hashes. We also discussed one of the earliest forms of encryption: Caesar\u2019s Cipher.\r\nNamed after Julius Caesar, he would take his writing, apply his secret code, and jumble up his words. Simple yet effective (for that age at least). To crack it? Just shift the alphabet over three times to the right.\r\nWithin Princess Principal, the leading ladies likely encrypt their own correspondences. So, I will do the same here to describe this project: mofkzbpp mofkzfmxi fp x sbov dlla xkfjb.\r\nSTORY\r\nTakingon a semi-episodic format, Princess Principal delivers to its audience singular segments that peer into the lives of a group of normal high-school girls. However, while they adhere to such studious roles, they use them more as a fa\u00e7ade, a misdirection for their true purpose: full-fledged spies.\\n\\n\r\nAs spies, the characters go about manifesting Operation: Changeling to the best of their abilities with each new case file. Sneaking their way into enemy territory. Tailing important figures. Hiding their motivations. Changing out body doubles. Using underhanded tactics. They breathe the spy lifestyle with coercion and deception aplenty, and the various events they take part in back up that claim with ease.\\n\\n\r\nTo give Princess Principal more of an edge, though, the narrative focuses on other interesting elements to boost its possibilities. It sets up a steampunk setting, giving their espionages a believable foundation while also permitting fictional ideas like the gravity-bending cavorite. In turn, the show also ups the ante with crazier sequences in dual trains and harsher outcomes.\\n\\n\r\nThe show isn\u2019t afraid to balance out this darker content with lighter happenings, too. Specifically speaking, it channels comedy and cuteness even during dire moments. Dorothy may make a joke about Princess\u2019s (false) crossdressing fetish, or Beatrice may dance in-place out of anxiety over the current situation. No matter the slight amount of fun, these instances do not derail Princess Principal but rather prove its capabilities at switching between both sides without any hiccups.\\n\\n\r\nMost notably, the show takes on a non-chronological structure for its story. Unfortunately, it acts as a double-edged sword (or perhaps a double-ended pistol pen given the context). On the one side, mixing up events coincides with the spy motif at large since such shuffling induces mystery as to the progression and the sequence of events.\\n\\n\r\nBut it also introduces unwanted problems. For instance, the tension and the stakes for over half the episodes subside as the designated, out-of-order case numbers spoil the audience on whether a specific spy still fights on. The anime also fails to take advantage of the jumbled nature of these events. Such a disjointed layout does not matter to each episode since they rarely influence or mean much to one another when reconnected.\\n\\n\r\nIntermixed throughout the non-chronological structure, Princess Principal hints at an overarching political battle involving the Princess, the Duke, and the warring nations. However, not only does the anime somewhat finish abruptly but also the separate cases do not materialize as anything too worthwhile on a plot level. Despite stopping plans and outing enemies, the characters fail to resolve this main throughput let alone get any closer to succeeding in their goal.\\n\\n\r\nMoreover, this stilted progress hinders the anime\u2019s thematic ideas on equality and necessity for freedom. Yes, the anime has the giant wall, some of the class struggles, and miniscule exposition to rely on. These parts do not form a cohesive unit, though, but rather a hodgepodge of tangentially related pieces. Thus, they do not provide enough context for the spy work carried out and therefore do not establish a tangible reason why any of this tale matters in the first place.\\n\\n\r\nThese problems across both the structure and the plot hold Princess Principal back in some regard, but it still stands quite well as a thrilling story. The premise, the focus, and the adaptability within attest to that argument.\\n\\n\r\nART & ANIMATION\\n\\n\r\nPrincess Principal showcases an awesome set of visuals that bring about high-tier execution.\\n\\n\r\nIt puts most of its effort into the locations and the background artistry. The old-fashioned setting allows for cobbled streets and worn-down buildings, and the steampunk spin sees mechanical creations complementing the smoggy city. Tons of detail goes into these places, too. From the flower gardens of the academy to the classy d\u00e9cor of a ballroom, the anime oozes with a pleasing aesthetic.\\n\\n\r\nThe anime takes the visuals further by rounding out its approach through more refined elements. Darker color variations of browns, reds, greens, blacks, and blues match the tone of the events portrayed. Lighting also plays a major role, keeping the atmosphere clouded for a downcast mood or adding contrast with brighter yellow hues from hanging lamps. And the cinematography does not falter. It\u2019ll rotate the camera during certain gravity-defying scenes, and it follows the car chases, gun fights, and sword duels without any troubles whatsoever.\\n\\n\r\nBy extension, the strict movement within Princess Principal remains consistent and in tiptop shape, too. While the characters do their fair share of collaborating in their clubroom and talking about the situation during a mission, they take part in all manner of actions. Sneaking, jumping, running, punching, twirling, parachuting, fighting.\\n\\n\r\nAnge\u2019s light jog while moving to the front of a blown-up train in episode five demonstrates the strong level of animation presented. Yet Chise\u2019s cricket swing in episode nine particularly claims a notable spot with its over-the-top quality for such one-off scene (hence the joke). Regardless, almost everything has a fluidity to it, so the visuals improve upon their execution once again.\\n\\n\r\nRivaling even the best of what the art and the animation offer, the designs of the characters shine, for they range in appeal and descriptors. Dorothy is sexy. Chise is refined. Beatrice is cute. Ange is tomboyish. Princess is elegant. Plus, they switch outfits regularly: school attire, casual clothes, dresses.\\n\\n\r\nBut, perhaps obviously, their spy looks give them their most interesting portrayals. Dorothy shows off her best assets with utility in tow. Chise dons her cultural items. Beatrice puts on unassuming garb. Ange becomes a magician of sorts. And Princess hides beneath a black-hooded cloak. They talk the talk and walk the walk \u2013 and look stylish while doing so.\\n\\n\r\nEven the ending track\u2019s presentation \u2013 with the cute paper-cutout style, the light-versus-dark influence, and the engine which controls the world\u2019s rotation \u2013 highlights just how much care went into the visuals. On top of the immense detail, the cool aesthetic, the lovely character designs, and the nice actual animation throughout, the artistic direction represents the greatest (if not the best) part to this anime.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS\\n\\n\r\nAs Princess Principal depicts, a ginormous wall divides a war-torn land resembling WWII Europe, separating the nation of Albion into two parts: the Kingdom and the Commonwealth. While both sides bicker and quarrel through military might, the ground game decides the biggest turnarounds.\\n\\n\r\nThat\u2019s where Ange, Dorothy, Beatrice, Chise, and Princess arrive.\\n\\n\r\nAlthough not quite medium in size, the anime must still juggle all five girls simultaneously throughout the season. Arguably, it does not divvy up equal time to each character, for Beatrice and Chise appear to have less focus in total when compared to the other three. Nevertheless, Princess Principal does more than okay at building and characterizing these ladies into intriguing, believable people.\\n\\n\r\nAnge hails from the \u201cBlack Lizard Planet,\u201d and, if it\u2019s not apparent already, she loves to lie. Combined with her deft abilities, keen awareness, and cavorite usage, she\u2019s also the ultimate spy. Hidden somewhere within her constant fibbing, though, lays a softer side to this unyielding girl. She cares about her close friends, demonstrated regularly by the help she offers them. It\u2019s almost impossible to tell what she may be thinking in any given moment, but one thing is clear: She will do whatever it takes to see the current mission through.\\n\\n\r\nDorothy is the femme fatale of the group, using her busty body and killer looks to sway the hearts of men (weak-willed or otherwise). But she\u2019s also the most fun as she jokes a bit and keeps the mood from becoming too serious. The designated driver (despite a drink or two or even twenty-one) and the appointed leader of their spy band (despite ranking lower skill-wise), she is the oldest of the bunch, but she doesn\u2019t like to be reminded of such trivial matters. Instead, she wishes to do what\u2019s right \u2013 both by the team and by herself.\\n\\n\r\nBeatrice is the caretaker. A worrywart, her queasy stomach and lack of physical strength often hold her back from direct involvement. However, the unique audio device which controls her speech turns her into a communications and imitations specialist. With a knack for tea here and a tad amount of luck there, she proves invaluable to the team\u2019s success.\\n\\n\r\nChise is a foreigner when compared to the others, but she takes that description to heart. Wielding a blade of steel and honor of an even tougher material, she usually brings the fight to the enemy with dexterity and class. Her mastery of English isn\u2019t quite there yet, and she sometimes feels as though she isn\u2019t contributing as much as she would prefer. Even so, her admirable attitude proves to be a stout backbone that they cannot do without.\\n\\n\r\nAs for Princess, she is the kingpin (or soon-to-be queenpin) of the group thanks to her (perceived) royalty status. Super kind and perfection practically incarnate, she betrays the Kingdom and sides with the Commonwealth as a spy. All in the hopes of one day overthrowing her own warped government and ushering in a new age of equality. Unlike everyone else, she is not fit for this lifestyle, but her openness with them and her willingness to take risks grants her the clout she needs among this elite troupe.\\n\\n\r\nThese characterizations for Ange, Dorothy, Beatrice, Chise, and Princess unravel across each episode of Princess Principal, giving them their individual worth within the story. They also work potently as a group. Each has a part to play to make up the whole, but their forced closeness also leads to better insights and stronger parallels between them. They bond over similar upbringings. They respect each other\u2019s prowess. They appreciate confidence in the face of danger. They share feelings for dear friends. And they go to unorthodox lengths to remind them of their homeland.\\n\\n\r\nThey\u2019re a tightknit group, but that does not mean they go without conflict of their own. Ange finds her selfishness challenged. Dorothy must contend with the relationships she holds. Beatrice deals with trust issues. Chise contemplates her devotion to the cause. And Princess proves her perseverance.\\n\\n\r\nGiven that this anime coalesces as an introductory season of sorts, these characters shape up as a positive asset. Their individual characterizations, their group affinity, and their notable conflicts present them not only as strong, able spies but also as interesting, worthwhile people.\\n\\n\r\nMUSIC & SOUND\\n\\n\r\nPrincess Principal continues its audiovisual wizardry with more excellence from the first half of that six-syllable word. And it begins with both the ending track and the opening track. They feature all-English lyrics, and they also somewhat diverge from the serious, spy-centric story.\\n\\n\r\nThe ED, titled \u201cA Page of My Story\u201d, softens the mood with a laidback approach. A slower pace, some tuba, rhythmic clapping, graceful chimes. Such a combination gives the track a light, almost whimsical feel to achieve that lackadaisical mood. Furthermore, it embodies the fun and the camaraderie the group of girls have together. Dancing xylophone notes add a small yet playful section. Multiple vocalists get at that togetherness. And the catchiness overall makes it difficult not to bob and whistle along to.\\n\\n\r\nGoing the opposite direction, the OP, titled \u201cThe Other Side of the Wall\u201d, inflates the scope of its sound. Trumpets and violins guide the groundwork made by the drums and the guitars to create a dynamic, rousing composition. However, the bass, the piano, and the vocals impress the most. The quick bassline adds a subtle groove. The cascading piano keys form frantic feelings which mirror the emotions within the anime. And both a strong lead vocal performance and background harmonizing keep up with this varied, intriguing instrumentation, injecting extra power into an already very powerful piece.\\n\\n\r\nThe rest of the original soundtrack likewise earns praise with its ambient tunes and notable variance. Both psychedelic and charged pieces exist for the subdued and the direct sneaking segments. Piano melodies accompany sincerer moments, and xylophone-laden acoustic pieces support the laidback downtime. Foreboding, menacing tracks exist alongside a couple of cultural ones, too. Altogether, the OST slithers forward with finesse and flair as expertly as the girls deceive their foes.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of the girls, their voice-acting performances give Princess Principal yet another positive under its belt. Even more impressive is the fact that they are considered relative newcomers to this medium. You Taichi as Dorothy soothes the ear with a sexy, alluring tone. Nozomi Furuki as Chise refuses to waver from absolute discipline. Akari Kageyama as Beatrice keeps the cuteness going. Akira Sekine as Princess carries a calm elegance when she speaks. And Ayaka Imamura switches between poised, high-pitched, and even gruff, depending on the situation.\\n\\n\r\nWith pretty much everything audio-wise hitting a high note (in a figurative sense), it\u2019s no wonder that the music and the sound within Princess Principal competes with the art and the animation for the number-one aspect of this show.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT\\n\\n\r\nStrike another tally in the \u201cwin\u201d column for original, non-source anime.\\n\\n\r\nThe immediate sign that I was thoroughly entertained by this show a bunch comes from my appreciation and liking of every main character. Dorothy being darn attractive with her bombshell looks and happy personality. Chise zipping around with sword in hand. Ange reiterating her affiliation with the \u201cBlack Lizard Planet.\u201d Princess declaring that they are, in fact, spies. Beatrice, who I honestly found annoying at first, turning out to be a cute addition to the cast with her driving \u201cskills.\u201d They\u2019re moe, and they\u2019re fun, so I\u2019m a fan of theirs for sure.\\n\\n\r\nMany moments within the show also got laughs or smiles out of me, too. When Ange told Beatrice to be quiet during their speedy car maneuvering and turned off her throat device to make it happen, I was chuckling so much. Doubly so when Beatrice appeared dead after they finally came to a stop. Chise\u2019s whole personal episode was awesome given its letters-home-as-narration style and its wealth of comedic scenes. Not to mention that, if I wasn\u2019t wolf whistling from behind a computer screen, I\u2019d be caving to Dorothy\u2019s seductive advances without a doubt.\\n\\n\r\nBesides the characters, I also quite liked many other parts of the series. The setting\u2019s old-timey take with an industrial spin appealed to the history man within me. The oh-so-subtle hints of yuri floating about caught my attention on more than one occasion. And, despite my ambivalence towards the action genre, I found myself partial to their different skirmishes if only because they were flashy while still grounding themselves in realism.\\n\\n\r\nTo be fair, this anime isn\u2019t one that swept me off my feet, and I wouldn\u2019t describe it as a personal favorite of mine. But that in no way stops it from receiving the commendations and handshakes it deserves for a job very well done.\\n\\n\r\nPrincess Principal sneaks its way to the front of the line. Thrilling elements, fantastic production values, nice characters, and entertaining content create a project that (perhaps ironically) makes itself known with a ton of execution all around. pfjmiv mrq, qexq cfopq bkzlaba jbppxdb eliap qorb.\\n\\n\r\nSUMMARY\\n\\n\r\nStory: Fine, this spy-centric, steampunk tale features entertaining sequences and mysterious cases, but the non-chronological format works against the narrative, and it doesn\u2019t have enough reasoning behind its progress\\n\\n\r\nArt & Animation: Great, immense detail in the cool setting, in the different movements, and in the interesting designs lead to a wonderful set of visuals that impress from start to finish\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Good, Ange, Dorothy, Beatrice, Chise, and Princess simultaneously have strong characterizations, a tight group affinity, and notable conflicts\\n\\n\r\nMusic & Sound: Great, a playful ED, a rousing OP, a finesse-filled OST, and strong VA performances grant the audio the opportunity to work its wizarding ways\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Good, everybody in the cast is likable, certain moments do not go underappreciated, and other traits round out the experience\\n\\n\r\nFinal Score: 8/10",

            "content": "Princess Principal is a good example of why you shouldn\u2019t judge a book by its cover, at least for me. While the spy war sounds interesting the visuals and main cast kinda made me feel that it\u2019s not aiming to deliver on the premise. I didn\u2019t really care for this show until my trustworthy friend with good taste pitched it as \u201cHitman but with cute anime girls\u201d and was he ever on point.\r\nFor the most part Princess Principal focuses on episodic plots that have something to do with all sorts of spy related activities you could think of. Assassination, stealing blueprints or technology, infiltration, sabotage,cracking double agents, it\u2019s all here and it\u2019s fun as hell. \\n\r\nPrincess Principal heavily leans on the romanticized view of spies. They\u2019re athletic, observant, smart and are always two or three steps ahead of everything that\u2019s going on. This might sound boring because normally the interesting part is watching characters struggle to overcome difficulties  but what PP lacks in that department it compensates for with a lot very varied and interesting scenarios. One of the episodes for example is a train on train battle with samurai, which fits into a show set in steampunk 20th century england way better than you\u2019d think. Not all episodes are this pompous however, every now and then show switches between bombastic to more character focused plots that do a decent job of adding some humanity to an otherwise pretty basic cast.\\n\r\nThe main group we spend time with can\u2019t boast complexity or depth but there\u2019s still more than meets the eye to most of them. Ange is very cold and distant but as the show goes on you learn that the spy thing is just a very strong front she had to adapt and her deadpan humor makes her stand out on top of that. Similarly Charlotte is appears as very optimistic, diplomatic and gentle character yet you quickly learn that\u2019s also a facade her life forced on her. Dorothy is the oldest one on the crew and generally acts as an extroverted seductress yet part of her is frustrated with the lack of real personal connections and honesty within the group because sharing personal information goes against the principles of being a spy. Beatrice and Chise are relatively simple even to others but they have a good chemistry with the rest of the crew and their interaction is one of the appealing parts of the show. That\u2019s not to say they don\u2019t get any attention but their backstories are very inconsequential and don\u2019t add that much to their character.\\n\\n\r\nWhat adds to Princess Principle on top of all this is a great production. The show is damn good looking and it does a great job of selling you on the setting. The visuals are a combination of Victorian era england with a healthy dose of steampunk mixed in. The London streets are densely packed, grimy and covered in fog. The factories are densely packed with exaggerated machinery and higher class establishments are usually very intricate and grand. \\n\r\nThe show also utilizes some 3D assistance for very cool and dynamic camera shots that let you get a good feel for the environments characters are. I can\u2019t say that CG elements always blend in perfectly but for a TV show it\u2019s used very tastefully and adds more than it detracts. \\n\r\nAnimation department is not slacking either, I think pretty much every episode has some really good looking sakuga moments. They don\u2019t stick out too much but that\u2019s a compliment to overall quality of show more than anything. The only complaint I can leverage against it is that choreography is not always up to snuff but most of that is centered around episode 5 which features quite a bit of swordplay. It might be just my hangup cause I have a problem with quite a few swordfights in media in general but it does this dumb thing of supposedly masterful swordmen just hitting each other\u2019s sword a bunch in attacks that are either clearly going to miss even if they weren\u2019t blocked or would obviously be blocked to begin with. However most of action either features gunplay or hand to hand combat where this problem is non-existent and those usually look pretty damn good.\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately same can\u2019t be said about the music. While the visuals and scenarios are fairly creative the music is competent but very generic. Think of some music you associate with spy fiction or a certain British detective and I\u2019m sure your imagination will be in line with what you\u2019ll hear in this show. A lot of it is the same old orchestral tunes, some chorus and on occasion a bit of jazz. It\u2019s not bad per se but hardly noteworthy.\\n\\n\r\nNow this is all quite good but there\u2019s one thing that keeps this from being a genuinely good show. That\u2019s story. It doesn\u2019t play that big of a part in the show outside of brief flashbacks and short segments that attempt to tie episodic plots into overall narrative which is fine but when the focus shifts to it the show kind falls apart. \\n\r\nTo really care about what happens in the last two episodes you need to get a good feel for the world and the main characters. One of them wants to become a Queen and remove the wall that separated her and many others from her loved ones and caused nothing but trouble for the people of England. Almost all episodic plots tie into this theme of people\u2019s lives being ruined due to separation caused by the revolution and political conflict but it all culminates in a revolution that wasn\u2019t built up whatsoever, introduces characters that have nothing to them and is resolved by the end of episode 12 in a very anticlimactic way with no repercussions whatsoever. On top of that development being rendered pointless there\u2019s the problem of the show never doing a good job to establish to two sides of conflict. You got Kingdom and Commonwealth but there\u2019s little discernible difference between them. You never learn about the characters in Control which is a group of people that gives out cases to our protagonists and you never learn about \u201cgeneral\u201d who takes over at the end of episode 10 I think and there\u2019s a duke of Normandy and his spies which try to do something and it\u2019s never properly fleshed out. It\u2019s not at all a satisfying conclusion and in the end it doesn\u2019t even conclude the overarching plot.\\n\\n\r\nSo, while the story part of the show is poor, everything that surrounds it is quite well done. If you\u2019re interested in cute girls doing over the top spy things then I think you\u2019ll enjoy this. It\u2019s worth noting that there are 6 movies coming next year so if you like it, there\u2019s more to come.",

            "content": "Princess Principal can possibly be one of the most underrated anime this season, or possibly this year. The premise around spy girls performing tactical espionage (or cute girls doing bad things) is pretty unique for this season, and something I didn't expect from Studio 3hz. The setup of 2 spy networks working for opposing factions on the brink of war, is pretty intriguing. Our main characters also face confilict, with each of them having goals in mind.\r\nArt is pretty fantastic, there's much detail to just about everything. It's not to the level of animation like Made in Abyss, but it's one of the better lookinganime this season. \\n\\n\r\nThe BGM is pretty unforgettable, but the opening, \"The Other Side of the Wall\" by Void_Chord is purely hype, and its pretty much a sin for me to skip the engrish opening.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters themselves are likeable, and they all have a power that helps the group during a mission. Every character (except one at the time of the review) are introduced properly and gives more detail to the characters themselves. \\n\\n\r\nI've been really enjoying the work of Studio 3hz and Actas, and I can't wait to see where they go on with this show. If you're willing to break the bank for the laughable \"Anime Strike\" service by Amazon, then by all means watch this show. If you would like to use \"other\" ways to watch the show, then go right ahead. It would be a shame to miss out on this anime.\\n",

            "content": "Princess Principal opens with a disorienting first episode that is in the wrong place in an otherwise fantastic series. It\u2019s about five girls who are a spy team in steam-punk Victorian London. You\u2019d think with a premise like that the show would jump out and catch your attention immediately, but more than anything I was left confused about what the story would be about, it could go in a million different directions and the first episode even attempts to. Cute girls doing cute things? A SoL with some light action? A heavily threaded espionage story? Or maybe even a mixture of all these things? Theanswer is that it\u2019s an episodic series with each episode containing a strong standalone narrative that feeds into the overarching story, while the chronological order of the episodes are all jumbled up. Is it at all what I expected? No. But is it good? Very.\\n\\n\r\nThe reason episode 1 is so bamboozling (Although there are other issues) is that it\u2019s chronologically set at Case 13 and drops you straight into the action with little explanation as to who the girls are or anything about them, it focuses on the most confusing character on the team who by nature is not meant to be understood and leaves you to work out the mess it makes. It starts with a car chase, suddenly cuts to school with a very SoL tone then ventures into the heavily threaded espionage I mentioned earlier. \\n\r\nHowever episode 2, which is chronologically set at Case 1 rectifies all of this, It introduces one by one 4/5 members of the team, how they got working together, establishes the premise and world, keeps its plot simple but leaves you with a mystery and more to be discovered, you want to find out what happens next. From here the show steps into a magnificent stride.\\n\r\nI can\u2019t stress how amazing the rest of this show is, and for that reason I strongly recommend that you either skip straight to episode 2 (With the option to always watch 1 later because of how the chronology jumps around anyway) or atleast bear in mind that it\u2019s not a fair example of the rest of the show. Seriously, if you stopped watching after episode 1 I really couldn\u2019t blame you, but if you give it another go from episode 2 onwards it is really worth it. \\n\\n\r\nThe team and how well they work off each other is what makes the show. It\u2019s a joy to watch them both in the action scenes and day to day scenes. Their spy team is a well-oiled machine and each of the girls plays a different cog. They often feels overpowered in their world with just how smoothly things go, the action is always slick and makes it feel like stealing some blueprints off a plane is the same to these girls as drinking a cup of tea. All members of the team get good development and episodes focused around them, though Ange and Princess feel slightly more important with their significance to the plot they also aren\u2019t overly focused on. It\u2019s fun to watch them progress, the missions are varied and with the focus not just being on one character every episode is able to be something new or a fresh perspective and give you lots to digest.\\n\\n\r\nDorothy stood out to me as a favourite, because she just has so much damn fun whatever she does. Even though it feels like things are always against her she never bats an eye and constantly stays moving forward. Ange is colder than Dorothy, though it\u2019s this pair that are the teams veterans and most skilled. On her own Ange is lifeless, but her relationship with Princess makes her character - as when these two are alone Ange acts so shy, smitten and alive. This secret relationship they have also adds another layer to the lying and deception, spies within spies. Princess is the most mysterious member of the team, she's so unpredictable - between her and Ange you never really know what they\u2019re thinking. I also like the grace that she has, and how she carries herself highly without looking down on others. Chise has a good deal of quirk to her and the cultural differences between her and the rest of the team are the butt of lots of jokes and amusing, also she's a ninja. Beato is the team\u2019s unofficial mascot, also she\u2019s good at impersonating people\u2019s voice, she does a good job of grounding what the rest of the team do, because she\u2019s always slightly behind and trying to keep up with them. But to be honest she's mainly there to act cute, still I like her!\\n\\n\r\nI liked the steam-punk aesthetic and thought it fit well into the greens and greys of murky London suburbs, the missions are often set against this grimy backdrop and then there\u2019s the bright and colourful school that the girls meet at as their cover and the more scenic gardens and buildings that they go to on some missions that just breathe life. I really liked the costumes and character design too, the spy gear isn\u2019t overdone but just what\u2019s practical. When the girls put on their spy gear they all disguise themselves so they can\u2019t be recognised, Ange and Chise wear masks, Princess a veil, Dorothy ties up her hair and then Beato looks exactly the same and totally recognisable, except she has these black baubles on her hair buns so they\u2019re hidden. I can tell the design team enjoyed themselves and they have a really good attention to detail with some things, each episode there are a few little things that are easy to miss like the stake out montage with a few second long clip involving what looks like Beato scolding Dorothy for bringing drinks with her and Chise bringing a coat on the second night because she was cold on the first. \\n\\n\r\nThe music is simply superb, the opening song in particular oozes style and blows you away, you\u2019re left full of excitement for the upcoming episode. The ending is also a classic and is a nice way to relax after the episode ends, especially as the video that goes with it is really cute! The theme for missions and different variations of said theme were also very memorable and my favourites in the show definitely gave the show an extra boost. If you enjoy the opening song then check out the full 5minute version, it gives me chills every time.\\n\\n\r\nWhat\u2019s so strange about Princess Principal is that it doesn\u2019t have much to do about being spies. This isn\u2019t to say that the idea isn\u2019t well utilised but rather that it\u2019s more to do with the team itself and each of the girls in it. You could have replaced being spies with them all being fencers for instance or professional football players and both the core fundamentals and the parts that make the show good remain. I personally thought all of the action in this was really well done and snappy and it almost never dragged, but equally if you replaced all of those action scenes with scenes of the team playing sports matches together I would have still watched it. So am I saying Princess Principal is a sports Anime? Lol no but it shares in common what all great shows, books and films have and that is how well they portray and relate the scene to the viewer. If you\u2019re successfully invested in the characters and the struggles that they\u2019re facing then does it matter if the struggle is an outward one such as trying to weed out a spy or something that they are battling with themselves internally? What I find often in spy stories is that they focus on only the outside, where the characters are often portrayed as faceless and just a tool. This is what Princess Principal excels at though, it humanises the characters and strikes a good balance where they\u2019re able to act more secretive and uptight for the missions while just being themselves the rest of the time.\\n\\n\r\nAnd that\u2019s what I enjoyed about Princess Principal, it has tonnes of emotional moments. It has the fun and more light-hearted sections with the team and the great dynamic the five girl\u2019s share, the little jokes and things they say to each other. Then it has serious moments, often involving something of one of the girls past or relating to why they became a spy and these scenes can be real tear-jerkers. Death is a common occurrence in the show\u2019s universe and it only ever feels a second away. It gives the narrative a really bittersweet feeling, once you know that character X\u2019s mom died two episodes ago but that she\u2019s talking to the team like nothing happened. And you know what? The show sells it, it\u2019s constantly showing (One character in particular) that being a spy is all about being able to lie and being able to mask your true feelings, even if someone they knew had just died that the mission is still important and you\u2019d have to put your personal feelings to aside. Princess Principal does flirt with this idea more than committing to it full on and in the feel-good moments you could easily forget that thing about masking emotions and being the most secretive spies ever and instead see that the girls are just enjoying working together as a team. \\n\r\nIt\u2019s this juggling act between the two sides of the story that somehow makes everything stick together and I must say the writing does a fantastic time of smoothly jumping between them. My favourite episode was 10 and I felt like this was the pinnacle of the style as it kept flipping back and forth between spy mode/everyday mode to great effect. \\n\\n\r\nSpeaking about back and forth, I\u2019ll address the chronology which comes with mixed results. It isn't ever used as a plot device (Only one or two moments where I wondered what happened between/before what I know). It does add a stylistic effect though, you feel like you\u2019re being moved around at random, you don\u2019t know what the next episode might contain and you know it won\u2019t be related to the one you just watched. The real hidden benefit however is that it allows the writer to skip over cases, as episode 1-12 each cover a case, the highest which is named case 24 and the lowest being case 1, so in total 12 cases are missing from the narrative. This is good in a number of ways, one it works as a smokescreen in some episodes, so the writer doesn\u2019t have to write out what events follow on from an episodes end in the next one which if the series was in a regular chronological order (1-2-3-4) they would have to. This might seem lazy to you but I think it helps keep the story snappier and also allows you to fill it in yourself. It also gives the impression that there\u2019s more going on than we see and it leaves room to potentially make these missing cases as episodes later, which is neat.\\n\\n\r\nFor criticisms one is that the show takes on too much, it tries to complete a heavily threaded espionage story in three episodes. The first of these (Episode2) is fantastic and does a good job of setting things up nicely with a heavy antagonist that is introduced. Then come episodes 11 and 12, which attempt to pick up where 2 left off. Not only do episode 11/12 horribly rush and try to force some sort of conclusion to the series (despite the fact even the conclusion is left open for a second season). The antagonist only plays a minor role and is overshadowed by the most annoying villain of the week ever, which I\u2019ll talk about later. Overall it felt crappy and lacklustre although the last two scenes with Ange and Princess and the beach at least took away the bad taste in my mouth before it ended. I'm sad that they weren't bold enough to just replace the half cooked plot here with the episodic formula that worked previously.  \\n\\n\r\nMy next is that though side characters in the world are often in danger, the team rarely are. I mentioned earlier how they feel overpowered with how smooth most missions go and while this is fun to watch it doesn\u2019t put me on the edge of my seat. Part of the problem is that I know by watching episode 1 that all of the girls will be safe until after case 13, or that after watching episode 6 \u2013 case 18 I can apply the same rule. The last two episodes are full of tension because it takes place at case 23 and 24 and I was unable to apply that same rule I had come to rely on, this is one of the things the final two episodes does get right and if they hadn\u2019t rushed so much I probably would have liked them more. For arguments sake you could say that this was done intentionally by the writers, to try and lull you into a false sense of security but the problem is by giving me that rule in the first place you\u2019ve still weakened the tension in the early episodes, that doesn\u2019t go away. \\n\\n\r\nThe more glaring issue though is that the tension the show gives us often just sucks. The rare moments when a characters life are in danger I used the rule above, but most often things just wrap up neatly. There\u2019s someone that the team need to capture? Then they do it without any trouble. They need to sneak past some dogs and around a mansion? They get past easily. Anytime there is some kind of obstacle or resistance it resolves too quickly before the team start to struggle. This is a pitfall with having overpowered characters, but the show actually shows itself how to deal with this situation. It\u2019s in my favourite part of episode 2, when the big bad is on the verge of discovering the spy\u2019s identities. Ange and Dorothy are backed into a corner and have to think their way out fast. They pull off this on-the-fly plan thinking up the next step right as they finish the last, creating distractions to buy themselves time, swapping things without anyone noticing and all throughout this it feels like they\u2019re a second away from being caught. They act as incredible spies while the scene also has lots of tension and I would have loved to have seen more of this. Also the threat of their identity being discovered was great and I think it could\u2019ve been used in a few more places.\\n\\n\r\nI also thought that the antagonist wasn\u2019t used enough. Episode 2 introduces him as such a competent, cold bastard of a character and I was looking forward to seeing him clash against the team again. Despite this, from here until the finale he is only ever been mentioned in passing and feels as a vague threat. Gazelle, the spy who works for the antagonist only appears for a total of 2/3 times in acting out his will, though she never comes face to face with the team either. This is definitely a missed opportunity, I would have loved so much to see a showdown between for instance Gazelle and Dorothy. Then in the finale, when the antagonist finally starts to get into the spotlight and it looks like things are heating up he is side-lined by the most frustrating villain of all time. \\n\\n\r\nThe villain drops in at episode 11 and succeeds in all of her plans while magically pushing aside any resistance. Ange for instance goes to great lengths to try and stop her and devises these clever plans, and in each case the only way the villain finds out is because the plot demands it, because there\u2019s no reasonable way she would. She basically does what the team do to the majority of their missions and breezes through, though this is even worse because I at least enjoyed watching the team succeed. There are some shows that are just meant to make you feel good and in some episodes of Princess Principal it\u2019s just that, there may be a lack of stakes but I\u2019m still enjoying myself with the rich characters and setting, the music and action scenes that are just plain fun. The same cannot be said when this villain is present because I\u2019m just frustrated by how untouchable she is which she doesn\u2019t earn it at all.\\n\\n\r\nWhen the team finally defeated her it didn\u2019t feel like they\u2019d faced off but more that her powers of being unstoppable had just been turned down, she was suddenly made an even match. It lead to a very \u201cThat\u2019s it?\u201d feeling. What made it worse was that the plot that was going on between Ange and Princess was really interesting and I thought it carried the finale, with moments from each team member chipping in at just the right time. The best way to summarise the finale is that it felt like drinking spoilt milk, because I knew it had the potential to be really good and the villain was the biggest cause of spoiling it.\\n\\n\r\nOn the whole I really enjoyed Princess Principal and I think it\u2019s something that\u2019s likely to have flown under most people\u2019s radar because of the flawed first episode. I think the finale is just plain average and somewhat feels like it belongs in a different show, which makes it feel like a let-down in comparison to the greatness that\u2019s around it. I would still 100% recommend it though, as a fan of episodic shows this really scratched an itch for me, I had lots of fun watching it and its exact blend is so unique I\u2019m not sure I\u2019ll see something like it again. I\u2019d say lots of creativity, care and love was put into this, because that\u2019s what shows when you watch one of the episodes. We need a season 2. 8.5/10\\n",

The story is well-structured enough such that you aren't lost even if its out of chronological order, which serves no purpose to anything deeper, but is a great display of Ichiro Okouchi's ability to do entertainment pacing. I felt like the episode that stretched things a bit too far from me (and I'm a person who feels like I can suspend my disbelief very easily) is episode seven - but that episode makes up for it by having a chock full of moegirls.\\n\\n\r\nThe ending peters out a bit too. It feels to clean, since there's a great change that occurs extremely vast, and is resolved just as fast. Really, it's there to incite quick emotions and give a sense of triumph to the ending. \\n\\n\r\nAnimation is stellar. Setting looks cool as hell. Sound is Yuki Kajiura.\\n\\n\r\nIf you want crazier spy stuff, just watch the 1967 TV series called The Prisoner - which is actually great, as well as entertaining.",

Let's begin the review:\r\nTo start it off, the first scenes were badass, truly enjoyable and action packed anime. It was indeed worth watching at first then here comes the background story of each characters which is worth to know. Everything went fine then everything went downhill. It is later some episodes became confusing in the middle.No sense of the timeline whether if it is the past or present. The story is repetitive, still not bad. It became a drama anime instead of action which is a big minus for me. And the last scenes were amazing again.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are OK. Good character development. The animation is amazing.  The enjoyment like I said earlier it went downhill and repetitive. Although I recommend this anime to everyone. I suggest lower your expectations and you might enjoy it.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:6/10",

It still gives you the usual hopeful future stuff butit had a good balance with the real stuff.\\n\r\nThe show offered solid action, a decent amount of comedy and some feels giving you a nicely packaged anime\\n\\n\r\nCharacters (8/10):\\n\r\nThe characters were well established. Every single character was presented in a nice way and had their background explained giving them depth and a reason behind their actions and motivations.\\n\r\nAll the main characters were lovable and down to earth, nothing really outrageous or funky just simple girls affected by their pasts and experiences and acting upon their beliefs \\n\\n\r\nArt and Animation (8/10):\\n\r\nThe characters looked beautiful and cute and the environments were well made it was a good representation of industrial London with how the coloring and art were maded\\n\r\nThe animations were extremely good. movements were well executed which made the action scenes look more intense and fun\\n\r\nit was really visually appealing\\n\\n\r\nMusic & VA (8/10):\\n\r\nGotta love that jazz soundtrack it really helped with setting the mood of the show and made it more enjoyable. The OP was fantastic and the ED was not half bad\\n\r\nThe Voice acting was good as well the voices suited the character and there was no annoying sounding characters\\n\\n\r\nEffectiveness (8/10):\\n\r\nThis is definitely a new show to be added to my favorite list. i actually watched the whole thing in one sitting because i enjoyed it so much. The ending was kind of predictable and I am a little sad that they didn't finish up the story but i am also a little happy that i will get to watch more if it gets a new season (hopefully it gets one and it get executed right and not disappoint)\\n\\n\r\nOverall (8/10)",

            "content": "Steampunk is one of my all time favourite styles and settings for a story beaten out only by perhaps Tolkienesque fantasy so when I saw that we'd get an anime with a steampunk aesthetic that was aiming to combine spy action with cute girls I instantly jumped on board. And, I thought, since it's an anime original then at least we will get a conclusive ending.\r\nPrincess Principal seemed almost too well suited to my taste to be true. So now, after twelve episodes and a few months what did I think of it?\r\nIn short, it was pretty good. However, you may want to hear morethan just that if you're reading a review so here we go:\\n\\n\r\nAs mentioned above the setting of Princess Principal is a heavily stylised and steampunk Victorian Era London. Now this is not your regular version of London either, it's a city caught inbetween two warring nations with a big wall in the middle to serve as a divider. Think something along the lines of the real life Berlin wall.\\n\r\nIn this city we follow a rather colourful cast of characters that sticks out like a sore thumb among most of the other inhabitants of the city, nevermind the fact that they're supposed to be spies. The show mostly carries itself on these two points: the characters and the setting. There is an overarching plot, but the show is told in a very episodic manner with each episode being a particular case that the girls tackle and the semi-random case numbers we get for these give a pretty good indication that there's really not supposed to be much of a connection between these.\\n\r\nSome reoccuring characters and the above mentioned overarching plot do pop up in almost every episode, but they're never the main focus and as I'll talk about later they don't quite serve a purpose either.\\n\\n\r\nMoving on to the characters, I feel that as an ensemble of varied personalities, skills and backgrounds they work quite well. The show tries to dedicate entire episodes to the characters fleshing them out as best it can while also giving you an interesting episode to watch and moving the plot forward by a little. If you don't like flashbacks you might not have a lot of fun with a couple of the episodes in the show which are almost entirely flashbacks.\\n\r\nThe main cast consists of the \u201ealien\u201d Ange, the prim and proper Princess, the no-nonsense ninja Chise, bubbly Beatrice and the voluptuous vixen Dorothy. Your enjoyment of the show is largerly going to depend on whether or not you like any of these characters. And I did like them. Now, like a lot of other moe shows the characters are somewhat shallow, even after getting flashbacks and emotional sequences with some of them I couldn't really relate to them or see them as full human beings. They're abstractions of human beings not meant to have deep personalities or relatable personas. And because of this they're just slightly above average. I'll probably forget about them soon enough.\\n\r\nHowever, I do have to praise the character designs for being extremely good. From the clothing to the faces and hair everything fits with the characters' personalities and looks really good. I especially love Ange in her cloak and top hat.\\n\\n\r\nNow as mentioned above the show is light on plot, opting to go for a more episodic approach where each episode, aside from maybe the final two are standalone stories which could be viewed out of order just fine. I do not have problem with this setup. I think it gives the show a chance to showcase each of the main girls in an environment which suits them without being constrained by having to follow a linear plot. There's something for everyone in the show's eclectic mix of situations, from helping a laundromat stay afloat in an episode that plays out mostly like any other slice of life show to trainhopping trying to stop Japanese assassins at two hundred kilometers per hour.\\n\r\nThe overarching plot that does get showcased deals with the Princess and Ange's backstory and future in trying to unite the country. Only the last couple of episodes really deal with this head on while the rest mostly shove it to the side. It's basically like playing an RPG and ignoring the main questline until the very end just so you can do all the sidequests. That's really what the show feels like. With maybe the exception that you get tired of doing the main quest partway through and just stop. I want to talk about the ending a bit here, and don't worry I won't spoil anything major. The ending seems to setup for a second season, but since the show barely finished airing and there is no second season announcement in sight I can only go off of what we have which is a rather incomplete anime. This is a shame since I genuinely thought that with it being an anime original we would get a conclusive and final ending. Now if a second season does ever come this point is moot, but until then it will bug me.\\n\\n\r\nFrom a visual standpoint the show looks quite impressive at times. The steampunk setting certainly helps, with designs and locations that are really well done and fit the theme like wind-up smoke grenades, huge steam-powered airships and early twentieth century cars. I already praised the character designs for the show above and they're just about as good for most of the side-characters as well, at least the women. The men in the show all share the same basic look and frankly just look bland compared to their female counterparts.\\n\r\nThe animation is looks good for the most part, even in the action scenes where they use some CG it still looks good. However I have an issue with how clean and sterile everything feels, we're supposed to be in a grimy and impoverished London yet almost every major character is squeaky clean and positively glowing. This is where I feel like the art style and setting clash. On the one hand you can't have a show about cute girls without also having a vibrant and clean artsyle, on the other you also want that vibrant and clean artstyle to portrai a dark and serious world. The show tries to have its cake and eat it too, but it doesn't quite make it. Something simply feels off in the way the show is presented.\\n\\n\r\nOverall I felt like Princess Principal was a fun romp through a steampunk world teeming with evildoers and cute spies. It's not the best show of Summer 2017 but it is up there and I definitely recommend it to anyone who is curious about it. It's worth watching not only for its rather unique setting, but also for the characters and action present here. Just be ready to be left in the dark by the ending. Unless you're reading this way into the future and a season two has already come out that is.",

            "content": "Cute girls show that actually takes itself seriously? Well....anything works I guess? Who would have thought this show would work so well? This is easily one of the most surprising anime of the year! This show was a joint project between studios Studio 3Hz and Actas. This series is directed by Masaki Tachibana who is best known as the director of Barakamon. He has also worked on shows such as Flip Flappers and Ghost in the Shell Stand Alone Complex and 2nd Gig. This is his second director gig. The writing for the series is handled by Ichir\u014d \u014ckouchi who is best known for hiswork on the Code Geass series. \\n\\n\r\nPrincess Principal is one of the few CGDT shows to get something right that many of the shows of this genre don't do. \u00a0What is that? Well to put it simply, it's the characters and writing. \\n\\n\r\nBefore I jump into the meat of this review, I just wanted to explain my main complaint with CGDT (Cute Girls Doing Things) shows. My main problem with shows like these is how the characters lack depth, and their no clear end goal. It just feels like 12 or 24 episodes of them checking off a list of anime tropes and clich\u00e9s. There is no attempt to make the characters stand out besides being a whatever anime archetype they are. \\n\\n\r\nThankfully, Princess Principal is one of the few shows to get this right. A show like Princess Principal doesn't need to be just cute for their concept to work. What it does do is show you, that giving a character an episode to flush them out can pay off in the long run. We start to like the character for who she is and not because she is cute. Cute can be an aspect of liking a character, but when it is pretty much their whole character. There is nothing. \\n\\n\r\nNow, let's get onto the review. I know that is what you have been waiting for. I'm happy to give you what you want. We are going to Black Lizard Planet. \\n\\n\r\nStory (8 out of 10): Our story takes place in the fictional world of Albion, England. During the 20th century of the Kingdom of Albion has control and monopolized this mysterious substance. This has led to unrest among the citizens of Albion. So, a couple of years later, the Commonwealth launches an operation known as Changeling in an attempt to replace the current ruling class in power with Ange. A girl that have chosen due to how she looks like the princess. The princess catches wind of their plan and offers to help them with their plans if the Commonwealth promises her that she can become Queen of the Kingdom. \\n\\n\r\nThe story of PP (Princess Principal) isn't an overarching plot but\u00a0more so episodic plots that end up connecting later. They make sure each character gets their moments in the spotlight to shrine. Mr. \u014ckouchi really makes sure every character is flushed out to the best of his abilities. But he doesn't do the same for the villains of the show as they are barely around. He does a good job framing them as a threat, but they rarely cross paths with our main heroines making them seem like wasted potential. \\n\\n\r\nBesides that, it also can be unfocused sometimes with focusing on things that are not important to the plot. For example, in episode 7, it feels like more of a side mission in an open world game than am an actual meaningful episode to advance the plot and characters. The same can be said for some missions they go on. I am always asking myself, \"What does this have to do with the plot?\" Like there is one mission at the end of the series that felt out of place to me. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, the story is good but lacks a good villain to oppose our girls. So, you're left with cute, interesting girls beating up grown men. I really like the beginning of the series as it serves as a good introduction to our cast. I also like the direction they went with the ending leaving it open for a season two since a season two was only as they were really going to fully realize their vision for what they want to do. \\n\\n\r\nArt (9 out of 10): As stated before Studio 3Hz and Actas were done the animation for this project. And they both really come out swinging. Actas doesn't always have the best animation, but they really surprised me here with this show. I can tell Studio 3Hz handle majority of the action scenes as each one is unique and different. I think Actas handled the big booming perspective shots. All of them are exciting and intense. So, they knew what they were doing in that department. \\n\\n\r\nThe character designs were done by Kouhaku Kuroboshi. Who I know from his illustration work from Kino's Journey. First off, I would like to tip my cap to Mr. Kuroboshi for his unique designs for all the female characters. He really makes every girl in the show look different. You can tell who is the oldest and youngest among our five main girls. He really gives them expressions through their clothes, that can really tell who they are as a character. He also makes sure their eyes are designed. When you look at the girls you can tell how each of them looks different. Ange\u2019s eyes have a sharper and darker look while Beatrice\u2019s eyes are a lighter color. \\n\\n\r\nThough, I feel this is lacking when it comes to the male character designs. Every guy in the show looks bland and boring. No one really stands out even the boss of the girl has a mediocre design. The same goes for our villain. I can say overall, he really nails the 20th century Victorian London style. I think my favorite designs of the show are Ange, Dorothy, and Gazelle. So, overall, I think the artwork and animation are really good. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter (10 out of 10): Now onto my favorite part of this show. this show is really driven by its amazing characters. The characters of this show are nothing less than fantastic. I am talking about the main characters of course. Let's down the line and talk about how effective each of them is. \\n\\n\r\nAnge: The queen of Black Lizard Planet. Ange is just a lot of fun. One of her main concepts and calling cards is her ability to lie and tell when someone is lying. She also has the ability to change her personality depending on the situation. You can never tell when she is being honest unless it involves one of the other major characters in the show. She is very laid back and is very aware of her surrounds. Ange never tells you who she is unless she uses the cover of \"Black Lizard Planet\" to tell someone about herself. \u00a0Yes, she can use the anti-gravity machine she carries, but I feel her power to outsmart everyone around her is even better. She is the all-around member of the group if you ask me. \\n\\n\r\nBeatrice: She joins the team later. She is the younger member of the group but has a very dark backstory that involves her father using her as an experiment. So, she now has a voice box. With this voice box, she is able to change her voice to match any voices she hears. This is very helpful when they\u2019re on missions. It's a really unique ability. She isn't the best fighter of the team, but combat isn't her focus. She plays more of the role of gathering intel. I love her expression and how she really keeps herself calm when on these missions since she is the most likely to die. Great character, and really has her heart in the right place. She only joins because the person serves joins. So, she is very loyal. \\n\\n\r\nChise: Up next is the only Japanese member of the group. Oh, I forgot to mention everyone is British in this show. Anyway, Chise is the samurai of the group. She is the main the hand to hand fighter of the group. \u00a0So, she takes care of any bad guys that get close. Her character reminds of a rule 63 loli Goemon. That doesn't mean she is bad. Her backstory in her first episode it was okay. The other episode she got was really cool. I do wish they went more into the reckless side of her. Overall, she is just a solid character being the typical samurai. Her costume is really cool. \\n\\n\r\nDorothy: Now time to talk about my favorite character of the show! Dorothy is the femme fatale of the group while also being the leader. She is the most level-headed of the girls and is cool under pressure. \u00a0Dorothy never really does enough to much of a whore. She knows how to use her body right. She really plays the role of the femme fatale. Dorothy is very sexy and a very strong female character. She always knows what to do. Her backstory is not a bad angle with her being abused by her father. Her real name is Daisy. She changed it to Dorothy. In her episode, you really got to see how she became the strong and powerful woman she is today. It's very well done. \\n\\n\r\nPrincess: The last member of this group and one of the most interesting. She is the public figure of the group. Princess is also the only reason Beatrice joined the team. She is the only one that can freely move around without having to hide her image. Princess is the most inexperienced in being a spy (same goes for Beatrice) but she proves to be very clever. She isn't one for combat, so just like Beatrice and a little bit of Ange. Her best ability is to be able to outsmart her foes. Now there is a huge plot twist involving her and Ange that I won't spoil, but I will say it was amazing and really will make you like Princess and Ange even more.\\n\\n\r\nLastly, I want to talk about Gazelle. I really wanted to see more of her because I felt she could have been a good foe for the girls. When she is on the screen she is really making her presence known. She is evil and very brutal. Episode six is one of the best examples of her being outright brutal to someone. She along with the other guy really needed more screen time. I hope they get more in a second season. \u00a0I do think she has a great design though. \\n\\n\r\nSound (9 out of 10: The opening theme is solid getting that spy theme perfect, but I feel the ED really nails the moe factor with a cute upbeat song with some really good animation. I also felt the voice acting all over was solid. I felt the voice actors really did a good job of being the characters than just being an archetype. I think the strongest performances of the show were Ange and Dorothy if you ask me. Lastly, I felt the sound effects for the guns and explosions were nice and didn't feel stock. So, I feel the show has some good sound design. \\n\\n\r\nOverall (9 out of 10): Princess Principal is easily one of the most underrated shows of the year. This show was such a treat to watch. I really like how they made the character the center focus, and we could take what they're doing seriously. This wasn't cute girls playing kickball. These young girls working deep undercover as spies and acting like spies. I highly recommend shows for anyone who is a huge Lupin the Third fan and those that have wanted more depth when it comes to moe shows.",

            "content": "\u201cThose who know how to tell a good lie are the ones who survive in this world\u201d \r\nAn original production from studio 3 HZ and Actas , Princess Principal features  5 girls as the main cast into the world of spies full of lies. With badass and beautiful girls , with a catchy opening song that fits the overall jazzy atmosphere and a lot of action in the spy world Princess Principal does  everything how is supposed to be done:RIGHT!  . \u201cLet\u2019s begin our mission!\u201d.\r\nI mentioned that this anime does everything right , why? Well we have everything that is supposed tosee in an action packed  anime about spies: car chasing, infiltrations , disguise, assassination missions , plot twists that happen during a mission and many more , all is done with the 5 main girls who take advantage of their  special abilities to survive and get results  into this world of spies . The pace in this anime is exactly what defines the life of a spy: During the day you blend amongst  the commoners and carry out your relaxing and mundane lifestyle and during the night you put on your \u201ccoat\u201d and \u201cgloves\u201d and carry out the missions you\u2019re entrusted with . A life with accomplishments  which will never come to the day light a whole life living in the  shadows  losing your humanity and individuality by each day.\\n\\n\r\nThe unorthodox  storytelling  makes Princess Principal more captivating and exciting for its audience.The first episode presents the overall image of what this anime offers , it introduces its audience to the 20th century England atmosphere , to our 5 main girls and  doesn\u2019t waste any time cutting corners and dives directly into the  world of spies full of action and lies. The main story is like a jigsaw puzzle which is filled by  the mystery revealed in each episode giving born to the whole image of the puzzle known as Princess Principal. Set in a 20th century  fictional analogue of England called Albion the story manages to maintain its nostalgic atmosphere of those times throughout all 12 episodes  . A big contribute to that are the classical architecture of the buildings ,  the steam train and finally the lifestyle of the people from  those times.\\n\\n\r\nThe 5 main girls blend perfectly into the spy world  making it more easy for the viewer to get  accustomed  to the anime main plot and story. Since the story is episodic each girl has her own spotlight to shine and conquer the heart of the audience. That\u2019s the main purpose of a character into a story to be fleshed out and get a emotional or moral attachment from the viewers. The personalities and unique quirks of each girl is what makes them stand out  and with a little drama added to their background stories their characters became a firm foundation for the story. I like how natural they act in each situation according to their own age and experience. We have Chise who acts exactly as an Asian when visiting a foreign country , misunderstanding a lot of the local habits but the same can be said about those around her who aren\u2019t familiar with her country traditions and habits. Beatrice the  youngest  among the 5 girls , despite being a crybaby  she offers a lot of support in each mission despite being just a beginner as a spy. Dorothy  the oldest from the 5 girls and their leader , let\u2019s say that she is the most essential member for the team to work as a whole. She knows how to use her best weapon(femininity) to make any mission a success. Ange who always carry out a mission and dirty her hands for the success of it  and finally the Princess who pulls a lot of strings from the shadows .\\n\\n\r\nBut in Princess Principal is not all about badass girls kicking the ass of the bad guys in each mission, the anime also focuses on the current lifestyle of the people from the 20th century Albion.  Their stories carry a lot of emotion and  the hardships they must overcome to survive during those times steal a tear from its audience.  The mysterious and beautiful bond between Ange&Charlotte which the story focuses on  is brilliant handled across the 12 episodes  revealing a piece of the puzzle in each episode  as the story  progresses. When the final piece is revealed and the mystery  solved the overflowing  emotions  are visible in the form of tears streaming down your cheeks. \\n\\n\r\nThe opening song and the animation  is brilliant done having a connection to the whole plot , atmosphere and characters from the anime. It portrays exactly the personalities of the  5 main girls , Beatrice a crybaby, Ange a badass , Dorothy fearless of each situation, Chise taking upon each challenge that comes in her sight and finally the Princess who is saved by Ange implying the bond and past .\\n\\n\r\nPrincess Principal is an enjoyable anime overall with a lot of fights who give you a bump of adrenaline ,  with beautiful and badass girls who are damn capable and know how to conquer your attention  and finally with a well handled transition between the jazzy tense atmosphere and the  emotional one. Don\u2019t be fooled by the unorthodox order of the episodes they are released with a purpose  so it\u2019s worth your time this anime.\\n\r\n\u201cMission Accomplished\u201d\\n",

            "content": "As at the start of every review I do. I will say that I look at and review a show/film from a professional/critical point of view. This means taking into account even the smallest details of every scene through the show's running time which ultimately lead up to my conclusion of the shows overall score. Due to this fact, I will not be using my opinions as argument points, nor will they have an effect on the score.\r\nIf I were to write something personal (it would be written like this inside of some brackets)\r\nNow, let's get started shall we?\r\n[Misunderstandings] - The show's title really makesthe viewer think its about a different thing, most people I've talked to about this think the same thing. The title is a bit misleading, and that is nor a good or bad thing. Many people (including myself) thought that this was going to be another school, slice of life anime set in a victorian esk steampunk world. In fact it is about something completely different. I'll leave the synopsis to do my job for me there.\\n\r\nWith this out of the way, we can get into the meat of the review.\\n\\n\r\n[Story] 6/10 - Having, to re-watch episodes to understand the plot is a bad thing. I've had to rewatch several episodes. Though not the whole series. To find and identify the plot. A way of putting how the show makes it's plot is a per episode system. Kinda like how every episode is like a different \"Adventure\" for the characters. The creators also thought that spreading the story's plot over several \"Case files\" is a bit weak and shows that they couldn't connect the plot over the whole series. There are around 4 episodes, that connect chronologically but the rest of the anime's \"case files\" are scattered around chronologically. Forcing the viewer to make connections from a previous episode that took place some time before the episode you were watching. To make this more clear im going to use an example, this has nothing to do with spoilers to don't worry. (If i accidentally connect the episodes without knowing I will fix it). You are watching episode 7 and the \"case file\" number is 24. Though in episode 6 the \"case file\" number was 35. Meaning you have to eventually either connect them all chronologically without having all of the case numbers. Which is bad plot design, it would've been better if they designed the show chronologically somehow. But that is a minor fix to the problem. The plot is very convoluted, it makes you think which is a good thing if done right, and it keeps the show fresh. Making different settings and episode feel better or worse than the previous one.\\n\\n\r\n[Art/Animation] 10/10 - Fresh and creative design choices are a key factor into making something great. This is probably the best part about the show overall. It's Art style is breath taking and amazingly animated. Making every action scene fun and amazingly creative. You could tell the creators had fun making each scene, as it looks as if they poured their hearts and souls into it. It's fluid and rarely bad. (There is one or two scenes that are a bit spotty but it took me a while to notice them and when I did it wasn't that bad of a mistake either). Now the design of the world could have been a bit less gloomy, but that's what makes a mood for a show. It fleshes out it's world and setting almost instantly too. Showing off exactly what the animators and designers are capable of.\\n\\n\r\n[Sound] 9/10 - Sound/Music choice can make or break a scene. (I say this in almost every review in this section). Staring off with music choice, let's hit two birds with one stone shall we? The OP and ED are amazing, a fully english OP really caught me off guard. But some other anime do the same thing and it's just plain bad. This anime's OP is Amazing. It's creatively a masterpiece. The ED takes on a different style from the rest of the show but it doesn't seem out of place. Now... scenes either do or don't have music in them. It's a choice that the creators have full control over. But many creators need to know that no music at all can make a scene much much better, increasing the mood a ton. An example would be if two characters were arguing and loud almost battle like music was playing it would take away from the scene. But if you didn't have any music and focused on the characters voices and the sound of their movements. It can make an argument scene super intense. In this anime there are a bunch of scenes with out of place music. Which is why this isn't a perfect 10. Sound, this is basically the sound of all of the movements, footsteps, weapon noises, metal, objects, etc. (I think you get it.) Is pretty well done, the sounds of everything don't take away from any of the scenes. Which is a good thing. If you show has horrible sound design it can make scenes horrible. Just by the minor sounds.\\n\\n\r\n[Character] 7/10 - The character design is amazing and creative. That's all that there is too it. Nothing negative to say about the design. But there is one problem. Character Development. In this department it lacks a bit. It seemed as if the show used it's plot as an excuse to to not develop characters. Near the later-half of the show it starts to develop characters and maybe one or two episodes are set aside for minor development of character, but it should've found a way to develop the characters throughout the whole series. Start to finish.\\n\\n\r\n[Enjoyment] 10/10 - This is a personal section of the review so I will not be using brackets here. I had an absolute BLAST watching this show, it was so flipping awesome I cannot describe how cool some of the action scenes are. When I wasn't distracted by trying to piece together the plot I was watching it with a huge grin on my face, almost every episode made me smile and get a little giddy from how awesome it is. This is a perfect show to watch with friends as I guarantee you will have a good time. \\n\\n\r\n[Overall Score] 8/10 - Even with the shotty plot and horribly fleshed out characters, this is a great anime. Both in the technical and the enjoyment factor. This show wasn't afraid to jump directly into the action with was one of it's strong points. Throughout the whole shows running time, it had decently good episode. Like above, some episodes were really good while some were bad. Not really bad. But just bad. Do I recommend this anime? YES Absolutely yes! If you want to get into the action genre this is a great place to start. While other anime's are better for getting it, this is definitely one you should check out. Give it the good ole 3 episode chance. If I was able to review the show in its whole (which means using spoilers and per episode reviews) I would be able to further express how amazing this show is.\\n\\n\r\nThanks for tuning in! Hope you found this review helpful",

            "content": "Princess Principal is a beautiful hidden gem, the more you look at it, the more mesmerizing and elegant it becomes.\r\nThere's just something subtle about this show that entices you to keep watching.\r\nWhether it may be the 1890s vibe, James Bond spy feel or how every episode is a rollercoaster, Princess Principal is, similar to the cute girl spies, a clandestine masterpiece.\r\nTo start off, many complain about the atrocious and unsatisfying ending. That it doesn't \"work\" for them. Maybe Princess should have perished in the last scene or how Sentai played it too safe. \r\nHowever, I beg to differ.\r\nI believe the ending was expertly paved fora season 2. \\n\\n\r\nIf one really take the time to logically think, it's a brilliant set-up as it allowed for a new set of antagonists (Zelda and Gazelle), a clear goal (getting Princess to be queen) and ultimately, the fulfillment of Operation: Changeling (what this anime was about).\\n\\n\r\nLet's not forget to mention how the anime took the effort to masterfully give us a Suzumiya Haruhi feel with each episode set in the past or future. Extra shoutout for the rhythm and alliteration.\\n\\n\r\nEp 1- Case 13 Wired Liar\\n\r\nEp 2 - Case 1 Dancy Conspiracy\\n\r\nEp 3 - Case 2 Vice Voice\\n\r\nEp 4 - Case 9 Roaming Pigeons\\n\r\nEp 5 - Case 7 Bullet and Blade's Ballad\\n\r\nEp 6 - Case 18 Rouge Morgue\\n\r\nEp 7 - Case 16 Loudly Laundry\\n\r\nEp 8 - Case 20 Ripper Dipper\\n\r\nEp 9 - Case 11 Pell-mell Duel\\n\r\nEp 10 - Case 22 Comfort Comrade\\n\r\nEp 11 - Case 23 Humble Double\\n\r\nEp 12 - Case 24 Fall of the Wall\\n\\n\\n\r\n\u203b STRENGTH \u203b\\n\\n\r\n\u25ba Strong individual characters. If you think of Ange, what words come to mind? How about Charlotte? Or Princess? That is the power of individuality. Where the characters have their own sets of personality that solely define who they are as a human being in which they stand out from others. That is strong character creation done well.\\n\\n\r\n\u25ba Enemy of my enemy is my friend. The art of deception and deceit. Getting the result even when the tactics may be dirty. Espionage and reconnaissance with a hint of betrayal at any given moment. The vibe of unpredictability. Acting differently to get the optimal results. What more can you ask for from a spy anime?\\n\\n\r\n\u25ba There is something to take away in every episode. This just really shows you how carefully crafted each story and character development is in each segment. Which ultimately led up to the big plot twist and the continuation of Operation: Changeling paired with some slight emotional rollercoasters along the railway.\\n\\n\r\n\u25ba That plot twist. Yes. You know which one. I, and many others, didn't see it coming but that development just boosts the anime up to another tier.\\n\\n\r\n\u25ba Relatable. There is bound to be one person you are rooting for in the spy team. You do that because you feel for them. Somehow you empathize and relate. That is an epitome of an anime done well.\\n\\n\r\n\u25ba Each character has their own story. There is no leaving a story untold. It offers an answer to your questions throughout the journey. And you fill in the blanks yourself afterwards.\\n\\n\r\n\u25ba Music. Art. Transitions. Sceneries. Take the time and go back. See how every tiny detail adds up to give that 1900s feel. A lot of anime can do it but not a lot can do it right.\\n\\n\\n\r\n\u203b WEAKNESS \u203b \\n\\n\r\n\u25ba Yuri. Girl on girl. Although this is not specifically portrayed but the indication is there. This may be uncomfortable and turn off some viewers. I personally don't mind as a ship has already sailed.\\n\\n\\n\r\nWould I recommend? Hell YES!!!!!!\\n\\n\r\nWould I rewatch? No doubt at it, already planning it with a friend.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, this show caught me off guard first episode in as the spies quickly took me down then carried me along in their missions. Through those objectives, I laughed and felt the emotional impact they left as the show came to an end.\\n\\n\r\nThere's nothing more that needs to be mentioned besides the announcement of season 2. \\n\\n",

            "content": "\"Princess Principal\" \r\nWhat do you think when you hear those words for the first time? I made an assumption it was another typical school anime and skipped it for over a month but then one day I happened to come across it when I had nothing to watch so I checked it out. I couldn't have been any more wrong, and what was in store for me over the course of 12 episodes was beyond me at the time.\r\n\u265aStory: 10/10\r\n-Princess Principal is unique, creative, and really draws you in the more you watch. It starts out action-packed, and goes through many different levels in termsof spy missions and interactions. The story itself is about a secret spy war between the Kingdom and Commonwealth of Albion.\\n\\n\r\n-The main characters are a group of spies who pose as regular students by day, dangerous spies with particular diverse skills by night. The story never really dips in quality, so it really keeps you wanting more the entire time. Overall, out of my current 1,600+ anime episodes watched I haven't found another story like this one and it's brilliant.\\n\\n\r\n\u265aArtwork: 9/10\\n\r\n-The art in this anime is made of a \"steampunk\" theme, and it definitely shows through the technology, factories, and overall colors of the background and everything. It's clean, very fitting for the anime, and the animation is great during fight scenes and all as well.\\n\\n\r\n\u266bSound: 9/10 \\n\r\n-The OP is amazing, and sets up the stage for each and every episode quite nicely. It's one of those openings that goes especially well with the climatic final episodes! The ED is alright, I find it funny that it gives off that hopeless, tired feeling that Konosuba's season 2 ending gives off~ \\n\\n\r\n-The overall soundtracks played through the anime are also decent, and all do their job as needed. Nothing super extraordinary like Haikyuu, but still pretty decent.\\n\\n\r\n\u265aCharacter: 9/10\\n\r\n-The characters of this anime are what really make this show memorable. On top of the already unique story and uncommon artwork/soundtracks, each character has a \"spy side\". It's like how everyone has that part of themselves they don't want to show to others, but in this anime that side takes over and actually creates a sort of inner conflict from within. The actual complexity and beauty of the characters and what makes them so amazing can't be described with words, however that being said this is a little preview:\\n\\n\r\n-Dorothy is essentially the big sister of the group, and she tries to keep it real as much as possible. She's also at the root of a lot of the group's humor, and definitely keeps them all together as a sort of \"leader.\"\\n\\n\r\n-Ange is a double agent to herself, and this takes on multiple meanings throughout the show. She almost always lies, and it's clear if she were to give in to the truth she would lose herself in the emotions. Lies are a way of her keeping herself together, and in different situations of her lying you can really understand what she's feeling and the emotions that run from within her. She is definitely the yin to Dorothy's yang.\\n\\n\r\n-Chise is the foreigner of the group, it's funny how in a Japanese anime, she is displayed as a Japanese foreigner and actually seems more \"Japanese\" than most characters in pretty much any other anime. Like Dorothy, much of the humor and also the sense of unknowing and diversity stems from her character. At first she seems like the new girl that comes in and quickly fits in, but then you see that just like all the others, she too has that second drastically different emotional side.\\n\\n\r\n-Princess is what lies over the \"wall\" blocking Ange's heart. She represents everything bright, but also a distant melancholy almost as if she's calling out to someone.. She helps to further prove that the spies do more than just follow orders, they follow the orders with EMOTION. This builds up meaning throughout the anime.\\n\\n\r\n-Beatrice is \"the voice\" of the show. She ties into all the other characters and pulls them together. She displays the most emotion and is seemingly least cut out for the job, but like the others in the group her place there is so much more than what she looks like to start out with.\\n\\n\r\n\u265aEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\r\n-In conclusion, each and every episode fills you with different warm and powerful feelings and is very entertaining. I thoroughly enjoyed how the characters developed, the soundtracks, the way the story is structured, the artwork, and how the sound created something that I think new anime coming out need. Something unique, giving off a new feeling and really showing what you can do especially in only 12 episodes!\\n\\n\r\n\u265bOverall: 9/10\\n\r\n-In the end, actual appreciation for this beautiful work of art comes down to the person. The way everything in this show is set up makes it brilliant and unique, and for that I can confidently say that the producers and everyone who helped to create it did an amazing job. To anyone that reads this review and decides to then watch the anime, I hope you find every bit as much enjoyment as I did in it!~\\n\\n\\n",

Interesting story, music note 10, and ambience very well done. Somehow captivating characters. Highly recommend to anyone who wants something different, but be warned beforehand that there are holes in the history, which may perhaps disappoint some.\r\nThat is all",

            "content": "For starters I believe this anime is strongly underrated and that it deserves a worth audience that will praise it. If you are a fan of steampunk, a Sherlock Holmes, detective, spy-like kind of show, you'll enjoy this anime trust me.\r\nStory: The Kingdom of Albion is brought back into another original anime. This isn't the first anime I've seen mentioning this domain. It's the 19th century and what makes the case for this story known is the wall that divides the East and West of the capital of Albion. Five high school girls, who enroll in the prestigious Queens May Fair School are involved inheavily activities that is considered spy work. Disguise, infiltration, car chase, and more. What happens next is how the girls use that advantage in this kind of world to fly high. \\n\\n\r\nTo me, this story plot left me confused the first 6 EP's. To put it blunt, I didn't think strongly of the anime at first. The unchronological story telling. It would focus one week on the story and the next EP would tell how it came to be. Now this indeed would make most think that's how it's post to be. But aren't you post to tell a story in order instead of all over the place? I was unsure of myself if I'd even get through this. I am even stated soon on Twitter. Once I got by EP 6 though I accepted what the studio was trying to do. This original may require patience for some. Others will be snatched on the very first EP. I got the feeling when reading comments about the series from my pals on twitter which led me to speak up, \"Why\". Anyway, the story is quite entertaining with the dividing of two sides. The Commonwealth and of course, the kingdom itself. I was never a big fan of Spying or being stealthy because it's my weakest link when playing video games that way or trying to steal something when hungry. *sighs*. You have to admire the way the anime plays this all out and how it treats the characters. As rough it may be, so is life. Ouch. I give the story a 7/10.\\n\\n\\n\r\nNext up is Art: An 8/10 for me. Just like mecha. I'm a big fan of steam punk or unique setting like the 18th or 19th century like this anime has. I was amazed. It felt realistic. Watching the anime kind of reminded me heavily of Sherlock Holmes/London type setting. That's how heavy the art impacted me. The design for the characters was real classy. The way it should. Watch for yourself, you may get a different feel than I did. \\n\\n\r\nSound: I want dive into this section much. lol. I was too focus on enjoying than listening in on sound. I'll give it an 8 for well timed sound organization. Not to mention for making my ears ring at times. \\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacter/Characters: An 8 here but let me tell why. \\n\\n\\n\r\nAnge: The most cold hearted character out of the 5 girls. At least at first. She acts strongly on being a spy. Liars have their part it feels like coming from her. She's emotionless. Her face will not show it due to her past. She's good at what she does. Could she be a better example? Yes, I believe she can if the show ever receives more. Doubt it. \\n\\n\r\nPrincess: Obviously it shows that she and Ange have a past together. A cruel one. Panned out to turn this plot/story into a real ride down memory lane. Painful or not. The princess over the 10 year period really learns to love the country she's in. Wants to rid the walls that divide the land of Albion. I admire a leader like that. Young even. However, problems can't be solved easily. She'll learn this over the course of the 12 EP's. Watch this series and you'll find out what I mean. \\n\\n\\n\r\nChise: Don't we always love our Japanese girls? Ha, ha. Well, Chise I really felt was a strange girl. Obviously has a past like the other 4 girls in the group and doesn't wish to talk about it unless it's the right moment. Most do. Her lord from the land of East Japan commands her to go to Queens May to learn about the operation/and decide what to do going further. Chise has skills that she learned from her dad and I respect her for doing what she does in this series. Just being there despite the outsider tag slapped on her. I will go into this no more. Try to watch this anime for yourself. I feel they could've done more with her if the series was longer than 12 EP's. \\n\\n\r\nDorothy: I believe she was the oldest. Anyway, she acts more like an older sister 3/4 of the time. Very mature. I could easy respect her if I was listening in on taking advise. However, like the other girls her past plays a part too. It certainly does hold her back for a time until she learns to overcome it. I think Dorothy ended up being my favorite character at the end of this anime for her encouraging words she relayed to Ange. Dorothy learns it the hard way like the rest of the group does. Watch, find out for yourself if you enjoy Dorothy's presence or not. I sure did. \\n\\n\\n\r\nBeatrice: I am not even going to bring up the ridiculous word we call loli. That would be cruel to her. I like how she's very loyal to the princess in the start and is weary of Ange especially. Can't blame her with Ange's way of expressing things. Difficult. When finding out she has a mechanical implant that affects her vocal cords, I could do nothing but shake my head. This is the only thing I will reveal that's strongly impacts her influence for this group of 5 wonderfully strong girls. She doesn't give in though. Please watch for yourself and enjoy. She too was great to behold. \\n\\n\r\nPrincess Principal had a strong batch of characters. I feel a war could break out on who to love, like or trust more. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: I am pleased to give this an 8. For a very underrated anime and one that I asked myself, would it be worth it? It surely was. I had a blast watching this. Spy work is the most dangerous road but an interesting one to learn and share. I loved the atmosphere in this show. Very intense. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8/10. Not an anime to overlook at all anymore. Still not well known yet. I really do hope whoever reads this tries this series for themselves. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

The overall aesthetic of the show is great with cool set pieces, appealing and highly original character designs, and excellent action choreography/animation. The soundtrack fits the show perfectly and adds to the immersion.\r\nThe story is interesting and has actually managed to surprise me a few times. Also, the way the early episodes are often not in chronological order is very effective in letting us know the information we need when we need it as viewers.\r\nIn terms of characters and characterization, I feel this is another of the show's strengths. Each character has a memorablepersonality and background, and all of them are fleshed out quite a lot for a 12-episode show.\\n\\n\r\nReally, my only major complaint is that the show is only 12 episodes long. The middle of the season could easily have been drawn out into several full seasons worth of adventures, and I wouldn't have been bored.\\n\\n\r\nAssuming the final episode doesn't disappoint me, this is a show that I will certainly be recommending to friends and hoping gets spin-offs and sequels.\\n\\n\r\n**Edit now that the final episode has aired**\\n\\n\r\nFantastic. Just a great series. Leaves itself very open to sequels, and really needs one. I want to see what happens to this world and these characters. I hope this is a sign of great things to come.",

            "content": "Edit: I only want to add I hope for a sequel. It ends on a good note with personal relationships, but they truly left it open for further development among the characters. Especially with the lore in regards to the government, and their affairs. \r\nI wanted to wait until we had at least a few episodes to write a review, and after this week's episode, episode 6, then I can safely assure this is shaping up to be a great show. Granted, I will probably edit this review when the show ends since a good start could falter halfway through. Having said that, as ofnow this is a must-see show for most anime fans.\\n\\n\r\nTo start off the premise is a steampunk Victorian England. The art direction capturing this steampunk industrial revolution London is breathtaking at times. There are quite a few moments the direct does a wide angle shot when they are driving to show you the scale of the city, and it's amazingly beautiful as well. Obviously this being a work of fiction, then there are many sci-fi elements from the tools they use to how unique technology throughout the show. Meanwhile the character designs are great, and so are the action scenes. Overall the animation is top notch.\\n\\n\r\nMeanwhile the basic premise of the story is we follow a series of spies in London where two major factions control the area. There is some political aspects here, but overall they aren't too confusing or convoluted. As of now only one's own personal motivations has been revealed, and each main character feels unique. In fact almost every character so far has had good character development, and after episode 6 we even have character specific episodes. As of now it truly feels like all of the main characters will get ample air time for their own development. \\n\\n\r\nOverall I don't want to go into more details since I feel like the premise and characters after a couple of episodes should suck many in. The only question is we are unsure if this is a 12 episode show, or a 24 episode show.",

            "content": "This will be my first anime review ever that I'm posting so I apologise in advance if I overstep any boundaries in this review.\r\nAs an appreciator of anime, having watched 100+ anime over the course of ~1.5 years (as of November 2018), I began to raise my expectations of anime that I consider to be enjoyable after experiencing the various overused anime gags and cliches. However, this superb anime proved to surpass all of my set expectations by a very wide margin. \r\nStory: 10/10\r\nWhen I first saw this anime being telecasted on Animax, I was expecting a story plot resembling typical shounen anime filled withfanservice solely catered to the male audience (meaning boob-shots and beach episodes). Little did I know that I was in for a rollercoaster ride of emotions and deeply captivating story. We, the audience, are transported back to a fictional timeline set in the midst of the industrialization age of western Europe. In this fictional timeline, we are shown firsthand the conflicts between the various fictional world powers and socio classes in modern Europe through the perspectives of the diverse cast of characters consisting of royals, spies, nobles and even samurai. We get to see life in the upper classes and lower classes of modern Europe and the harshness of each livelihood accompanied with each lifestyle without any sugar coating. All I can say now without spoiling the story is that it's great and something you don't find in a lot of anime nowadays where the story isn't that complex and all-encompassing. Also, there's quite a bit of grit in the story which can serve to be a huge plus if you desire a rich story. Be prepared for a story filled with hardships and heart-wrenching emotions. Also, absolutely no fanservice.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 7/10\\n\r\nThe art style of this anime by itself does not warrant much praise as I find it to be just good. However, the real game-changer is not the art style but the setting of this anime where the characters are found in. Instead of the atypical modern setting most anime are found in, we are instead fed with gothic style architecture and classy style of clothing we often associate with the upper classes of society. The animation of this anime is also quite good; fighting scenes are considerably well executed. Although I didn't give the art such a high score, I thought that the art aspect of this anime was the most minor attribute when it came to grading this anime as I felt that there was a far stronger emphasis on the story and music, hence perhaps the lack of flair in the art style and thus found it easily overlooked when it comes to enjoying the anime. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 10/10 \\n\r\nWords cannot express the degree of enjoyment I found in this anime's soundtrack. The music was fantastic in every regard in my opinion. Which goes to credit the one and only Yuki Kajura for her fantastic quality of work. The combination of jazz and string ensemble when it came to the provision of background music served only to reinforce the setting of an industrial age Europe which also complemented the fighting scenes of this anime. The OP of this anime provides you with an energetic feel before immersing you in the anime itself while the peaceful ED leaves you pondering over the intricacies of the story and leaves with you excellent music for you to ponder in deep thought. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter 9/10\\n\r\nLike the story, character development and the background is superbly executed and just plain enjoyable. We get to learn about the background of our main cast of characters and how it led to where they are. We learn to emphasize with them on a personal level. My only issue about this anime is that two of our characters don't get a lot of background story that they justly deserve. Because of that, I didn't get to appreciate these characters as much as I wished. In spite of this, the character development of the other characters helped to overshadow this small failure a great deal. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\r\nPersonally, I always put the story as the highest priority when it comes to enjoying an anime series. You can give me an anime with fantastic art and even soundtrack (I still consider soundtrack as a major factor when it comes to enjoying anime) but if the story is weak, then I'm sorry but all you're left with is a mediocre anime, above average at best. But with a fantastic story, soundtrack and cast of characters, you'll be left with an excellent anime in my opinion.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 10/10",

            "content": "Princess Principal is essentially a cute girls become friends and do stuff together anime, except the cute girls are all spies entwined in a war set in an incredibly dark steampunk setting. With amazing character designs, incredible directing, interesting construction, and use of use of both happy and incredibly dark tones this show has a lot to offer.\r\nAnge, the main character of the show, has one of coolest anime costumes i've ever seen. She sports a black top hat with a slightly curved bill that exposes a crimson bottom. Matching the crimson and black pattern she wears a black cape that is crimson on theinside and wears black gloves that are crimson on the palm side of the hand. Under her cape she wears a black skin tight long sleeve top that looks like it's a turtle neck with some leather looking black stripes running up it, except the bottom part is a very short frilly tutu (also black). Lastly she has a brown leather strap fastened at her chest that wraps around her shoulders and black furry poofs wrapping around her neck and wrists.\\n\\n\r\nThe top hat, red undertones, and skin tight body suit, either intentionally or incidentally,  symbolize what this show has to offer excellently: the top hat reflects the steampunk setting, the red reflects the incredibly dark places this show goes, and the body suit reflects the functionality of a mobile spy outfit while at the same time showing off the body of one of many of this shows cute girls. Even the tutu could represent the happy slice of life interactions that happen in between the girls. \\n\\n\r\nThe best part about this is that it isn't even Ange's only outfit and every character in the show has multiple amazing outfits that differ depending on the setting and it feels like an incredible amount of care was put into making the girls look great.\\n\\n\r\nThe direction of this show is particularly impressive because the show has conflicting tones of it being a dark spy drama while at the same time being a cute girls do things show and it manages to do this without either feel really breaking the other. All of the dark scenes that happen hit hard and fast and are never overplayed so when the show goes back to happier interactions between the girls it doesn't feel strange. This show manages to make great cute girls do laundry together scenes work in the same show where those same girls brutally murder people and it's amazing. Even with such a contrast in tone the action scenes where nicely choreographed, with Ange flying around with her gravity defying device, car chases, and Chise's sword play in particular with her fight in episode 5.\\n\\n\r\nPrincess Principal has an interesting structure in how it sort of feeds the viewer individual episodes that aren't always in the present that allows each of the primary characters backstories slowly be pieced together. The most gratifying part of the show for me was learning about each of the characters and how they came to their current situation and it helped that it was done non linearly because every jump back to the present after learning a backstory made the dynamic of the group feel different. The show doesn't really fully jump into a non episodical piece the story together mode into the last 2 episodes where it tries to put put together a finale, which ended up being my least favorite part of the show.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the music in the show the opening is fun and bombastic which really sets the mood for the show with a powerful female singer mirroring the powerful female characters in the show. The most rememberable ost from this show to me was Shadows and Fog, which is an atmospheric saxophone blasting combined voices chanting which manages combine the feel of spies and sabotage with the fun action of this show. Other than that there is a good track that has an SAO feel to it that plays during the episode 5 sword fight.\\n\\n\r\nThe only major negative feelings I have about the show are about it's story. The politics with the war and the command that order the girls around are not very interesting to me and it feels like they only exist to create an interesting setting. It's certainly not the worst executed story it's just that I don't feel particularly strongly about it whereas many other elements of the show I loved.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all Princess Principal is a really fun show that I would recommend watching if you are into stylish atmosphere, cute girls, incredibly dark moments, interesting characters, and fun action.\\n\\n\r\n8/10",

            "content": "This is my first review but I really wanted to make this show my first one. I started watching this anime because I wanted a small break from studying since it looked interesting. And damn, has it been a ride. \r\nI will now just go through the different points I've given and explain why I did so.\r\nStory: 10/10\r\nThe story in Princess Principal is not chronological as it jumps back in time several times to explain how the different characters met and learned how to work together. This can be confusing at times but the series does somewhat help you by giving you the \"Case numbers\"at the start of each episode. \\n\r\nWhile the episodes (cases) don't necessarily look connected, the anime does have an overarching plotline. This anime is definitely not a Moe SOL like K-on! Like what the artstyle might make you believe. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 10/10\\n\r\nI'm a very big fan of the artstyle. I like the setting, steampunk London, and the generally dark backgrounds. The anime does a great job contrasting the rich parts of London with the poor industrial parts with it's colour schemes. The animation in the action scenes is just great and incredibly fluent. The artists really did a magnificent job. The character design is very nice too, the style does resemble K-on, Sora No Woto and other \"cute girl\" anime a lot (which in my opinion isn't a bad thing at all) \\n\\n\r\nSound: 10/10\\n\r\nI'm not a big specialist on the sound department but everything I've heard didn't bother me and the soundtrack is amazing, I'm especially a big fan of the intro, the ending is a complete different style but definitely not bad either.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10/10\\n\r\nThe character backstories are amazing, every girl has her own unique reasons why they are banding together and why they became spies. The character backstories of the characters play a big role in the overarching plotline of the anime, it's just incredibly well-integrated. My personal favourite is \"Dorothy\", the oldest of the spies, her nature and even her chosen name get explained in her own backstory episode,  which each character has. There's nothing much for me to say about this except that I'm speechless about how well they covered this part, totally unexpected. The anime I've seen generally don't do this. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\r\nI've been sucked into the story completely, from the first episode I was entirely sold. There's not one single moment at which I felt bored or uninterested, I was almost on the edge of my seat the entire time.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 10/10\\n\r\nI know this isn't a nuanced opinion at all, but I really enjoy watching this show so much that I can't find anything bad to say about it. I've been recommending this anime to my friends almost non-stop and I will do the same here. If you like spy-shows, steampunk, intrigue, good character development, original anime, or just a show you can sit down for and relax, please do check out this anime. I'm sure you won't regret it!",

The tone that one can expect was established straight from the onset. The way how the story was structured, the unresolved plot points clearly indicate that there the is a second season planned. However, the way how the story feels all over the place may be upsetting to some. \r\nThe art was good and the moe art style didn't detract much from the tone of the anime. The animation when it came down to the action in the show, whether it was the carchases, the fights or anything else was excellent. The soundtrack was stellar and it's one of those that is memorable and sticks out every time you hear one of the tracks. The characters were great and while we got insight to many of the main cast, I still feel there is room for them to get more development than they have received so far.\\n\r\nThe story for Princess Principal ended nicely enough but it would be great if we can get a continuation someday to fully flesh out the story.",

Princess Principal!!!!!  \r\nPrincess Principal is a dark and fluffy semi steam-punk adventure that bounces around but never makes an impact. The animations is nice, the characters are interesting, fun, mesh well and have very interesting backstories. The plot is absent of many cliches, which is a good thing and the concept leaves you wanting more but the 12 episode format almost certainly killed this shows potential. I watched this show as a Sub and enjoyed the voice actors performance, but I will say a british english dub would definitely take this show toanother level. The only thing that I cant get past is the short non linear plot that seems to jump around all over the place, and As soon as you get pulled in its over.  Its not a waste of time though, think of it as  an anime appetizer.",

            "content": "Story: Overall I thought they would make more use of the steampunk vibe and culture they were living in, but at times it was just a regular crime/spy anime. I thought the first episode was really well done. While i wasn't a fan of the different cases at times, they did a good job delivering the story to the viewers.\r\nArt and Animation: Sloppy at times but really well done. The fight scenes were amazing especially the Sword fights with Chise.\r\nSound and Voice: The opening and ending were two of the best of the Summer 2017 season in my opinion. Add in an awesome BGM andI barely had any problems. The VA's were great. Not masterful but great. If anything Ange's VA did a spectacular job going back and from from a serious voice to a more girlish voice.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Really awesome cast of females and real original. Ange is such an awesome character. Obviously my favorite especially with her being from the Black Lizard Planet, I loved that about her. Dorothy was great, Beatrice was annoying at points but she had her moments. Chise was freaking awesome. And the Princess was the Princess not the best character but a necessity.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: There were times where I would miss an episode, watch it about a week later and say \"Damn how could I miss this episode?!?!\" That proved to me how much I enjoyed this anime and caught it every day it came out. Really good and underrated anime.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: I know this anime is not for most people. People who enjoy a more serious Spy anime won't enjoy it but I think this is the best Spy anime made so far. Yes better then Joker Game. I feel with the Inception and actually doing infiltration by disguise was a step up from Joker Game. Plus after episode one I was blown away by how serious this anime could get at times.\\n\\n\r\nDefinitely and underrated anime, and I think that blame falls on the company who licensed Princess Principal for not pushing it as much as they should have.",

            "content": "Espionage has always been an intriguing look into people who essentially needs to hide everything about themselves and still get information out of people. Some do this in boring fashion like Joker Game, Princess Principal on the other hand does this in spades AND makes it interesting!.\r\nThe first thing LA would like to address is that the cute girls doing things, well in Princess Principal's case is that at first looks like this but very quickly you will realize that Princess Principal is more focused on it's clandestine missions that links to prior missions and dialogue that's clever and always keeps you on your toesis all the more important in this anime.\\n\\n\r\nPrincess Principal may look like the daily lives of spies in a steampunk alternative 19th century London, however it has deeper meaning when it comes to our two main characters of this anime Ange voiced by Ayaka Imamura and Princess voiced by Akira Sekine. The rest of the Princess Spy Team consisting of Dorothy voiced by You Taichi the leader, Chise voiced by Nozomi Furuki an exchange student from Japan and a literal ninja spy tasked in observing the main cast and Beatrice voiced by Akari Kageyama, the Princess' aide and close friend. Dorothy gets a bit of character development during one of the missions that involves her father and it's \"tragic\" to say the least but nonetheless she becomes a better character from it and what kind of upbringing she came from. Her character development also helps Beatrice as at first she was a really clingy character to Princess and was very pushy but her opening up to Dorothy as well as having similar upbringings did help her case. Chise on the other hand gets the most development outside of Ange and Princess, from her getting used to London to her own personal mission the first time we see her brought alot out of her. Ange is LA's favourite character without a doubt, from her badassness in how she deals with missions to her entire backstory with the Princess that however leads into spoilers, but you see her plight either way. Nonetheless Ange was probably the best thing about this anime and is truly a great counterintelligence spy and a great liar no matter what way you look at her.\\n\\n\r\nPrincess Principal's plot format has an anachronic order of missions that presents itself, such as the very first episode being case 13, not 1 and etc etc. This does help shake up things in the long run as it gives us context to certain missions that occurred before or after certain other missions meaning that by majority the missions are linked in certain situations of the anime through cameos or certain characters showing up who were villains previously or afterwards. Yes Princess Principal did the entire Haruhi Suzumiya route for anachronic storytelling but you know what?, they still did it to great effect. The only problem LA saw from this was that Princess Principal case goes up to 24 yet there is only 12 episodes in total for this anime. What LA wanted to see was ALL 24 episodes shown but LA could say that even managing this anime to go on for 24 episodes would have been difficult from a storytelling stand point but LA would wanted to see all 24 cases nonetheless.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation done by Actas and Studio 3Hz was amazing right down to the aesthetics of the anime's atmosphere of a steampunk 19th century alternative London espionage anime. It's gritty yet elegantly steampunk all at the same time and Actas and Studio 3Hz has done amazing with this. The fights scenes were fluid and amazingly bombastic at times and even the standoffs the Princess team faces off with gets gripping. The character designs are amazing if anything having the sense and aesthetics of where they are as well, with props going to Chise and Ange, though the entire cast goes through this.\\n\\n\r\nThe voice acting, well there are two voice actors LA really needs to talk about Ayaka Imamura and Akira Sekine as Ange and Princess respectively, Ayaka Imamura for showing off her various differing vocal ranges from moe, to deadpan to delinquent and even more from that. Akira Sekine also gets it merely due to the dramatic turn her character goes through and Akira's acting chops were up to snuff for it and LA commends this. The rest of the voice cast from You Taichi and Nozomi Furuki were great additions as well though Beatrice's Akari Kageyama got a bit of time to get used to, her being a semi-squeaker at the start of the anime and all and Beatrice's personality not helping her character's case.\\n\\n\r\nPrincess Principal's finale however is one LA was skeptical about to say the least, as it felt slightly rushed and everything that occurred in the finale was \"washed away\" rather quickly. Because of this, LA did think Princess Principal had to be 24 episodes long so that all the pieces could have been done better and given us a more bombastic climax than what we have gotten. LA was expecting more from this ending is the best way to say it and as much the final arc is projected itself rather easily, LA was just expecting more really. On speaking of flaws, as much as it's anachronic order was a great idea to Princess Principal, LA also wanted to rest of the cases that were missing in the anachronic order to be shown to us, you know, like the audience able to find all the pieces to see them fit, instead we have a jigsaw puzzle that's half complete. LA thinks the only flaw LA WILL defend about Princess Principal is their backstory, as yeah they are spies, thus they really shouldn't have much backstory about them and even then Princess Principal manages to subtly give backstory and character development to the Princess Team through the missions they go through and heck even the member's mannerism and behavior towards each other reflect many of the characters in question as well, Ange being an exception at times because we could never get a hold of what's she's thinking right now which is ALSO a plus to the plot progression of Princess Principal.\\n\\n\r\nPrincess Principal is by all means for LA, a great espionage anime, sure it has cute girls doing spy things but it's cute girls doing spy things done right especially when it concerns spying and the like. Princess Principal is a very solid show from it's aesthetics pulling you into the world of Princess Principal, plot progression even in it's anachronic order, intriguing characters and dialogue through deception and always wanting to know what these characters are thinking at ALL times, it's fluid yet amazing fight choreography, world building through the missions Princess team goes through and although LA is skeptical about the ending, it was a still an amazing show to watch, if anything it's LA's second favourite anime of Summer 2017.\\n\\n\r\nIf only Princess Principal could show the rest of the missing 12 cases...C'est la vie, C'est la vie.",

            "content": "Spoilers are inferred! It won\u2019t necessarily spoil the story too much although it could affect your experience, so just read with discretion.\r\nFirstly, I would like to say that this show seems to be episodic if you were watching this show whilst its airing like me, because there is a chronological order of every episode that happens (just look it up fam) - it\u2019s just that \u2013 the \u2018chronological order\u2019 is not in the order the episodes are aired; just a little something for those who want to do a re-watch. \r\nIt\u2019s not until like the last three episodes is when shit really starts hitting thefan, and because of that, episodic or \u2018episodic until about half or more your way in\u2019 sort of shows will only be saved if there are good characters \u2013 otherwise there\u2019s like no substance at all. \\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of characters, the moe aesthetic might put off some people and I was a victim of this at first, because I didn\u2019t really give a shit about it when I was looking for the pre-summer AniCharts (it\u2019s moe - what did you expect \u2013 I\u2019m not Digibro), and having remembered being how much hype there was with a previous spy show called Joke Game (although I do admit it had a way darker atmosphere) the characters do ultimately come off as flat and forgettable. Lackluster characters are not too much of an issue with this spy show, since all the main cast are given at least some kind of backstory and development \u2013 with Dorothy being the best girl because an entire episode was dedicated to her, and it was just really good if I were to spoil nothing about it. Though I do admit some of them could be a bit flat: the relationship between Ange and Princess in particular does feel quite forced and stretches the boundaries within your suspension of disbelief (or am I just getting some Madoka X Homura vibes over here?). Overall, the characters do come off as a mix-bag in some places, but you might not find any complaints that could bug you.\\n\\n\r\nBecause the \u2018plot\u2019 doesn\u2019t really start moving until you get quite close to the end, the characters really are the best part of the whole series. The London Steampunk setting is definitely rare in anime, since the only notable steampunk show I could think of is that piece of shit I have yet to watch called Steam Boy. Most of the show consists of slightly edgy moe girls just fucking around on cool-ass espionage shit. And I like that!\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of the \u2018main plot\u2019 near the end, it does keep you over the edge of your seat with all the plot twists and potential drama happening, so I can\u2019t really say anything else here unless if I had to spill some spoilers. On the other hand, the world building is much to be desired: the whole gist with Cavorite is mostly left to the imagination unless if you (were not like me) have read H.G. Wells; the warring nations between the Kingdom and Commonwealth is nothing more than a plot device because there is literally no history as to how this war even happened, and any details regarding the massive wealth inequality and the \u2018class war\u2019 is just left there for sequel-bait.\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion, Princess Principal\u2019s moe aesthetic really shouldn\u2019t be undermined. From the amount of anime I have seen so far, I was yet to come across a spy show that I would genuinely enjoy both critically and personally, until now.\\n\\n\r\nA 7/10 is very well deserved indeed.\\n",

            "content": "I'm trying to be critical here, I really am. But it's so damn hard to do so on a show that you enjoyed so much from start to finish.\r\nThe premise is crazy enough as it is: An alternate steampunk Victorian London, with our main cast being cute girls acting as Spies. The characters are what really make this show outstanding to me. Our main cast consists of  Dorothy, the playful leader; Chise; the Japanese transfer student and resident Goemon, Beatrice; the meek, naive rookie (and my personal favorite); Princess Charlotte, whose kind nature hides a darker past; and Ange, the stoic badass who hasa deep connection to the Princess. What really makes me like them so much is their well-thought out backstories and the little things they do in their lives, such as Beatrice scolding Dorothy for buying alcoholic drinks or Chise's distaste for western food. Since I loved the cast so much, I got really invested in moments of danger, sadness, or action. \\n\\n\r\nI think the most controversial part of PrinPrin is the achronological episodic storyline. It gives the anime a very Slice of Life feel, and more often than not the episodes are largely separated from each other, leading into a finale where the bulk of the show's plot is pushed into 2-3 episodes. It's very much like Cowboy Bebop in that respect. For me, it reminds me that life isn't one overarching story: it's made of smaller, separate stories that shape who we are as people. So while other people may cry afoul of this episodic formula, I embrace it with open arms. \\n\\n\r\nThe achronology of the story can also throw people off. Throughout the 12 weeks of airing, I was constantly guessing which episode would come next in the order. Often times I would rewatch episodes for references to previous episodes and hints for future ones. Episode 1 I watched at least 6 times before being satisfied. \\n\\n\r\nThe animation is quite good, though at times I was a bit thrown off by the eye outlines showing through the characters' hair. The characters themselves have excellent designs, and the sound-ok, so the sword clanging sfx is questionable at best, but the sound in general is amazing. The OP is hype as hell and it has quickly become one of my favorites in anime.\\n\\n\r\nPrincess Principal is not a show that everyone will enjoy or even view in a positive light. People will dislike the story layout and the rather absurd premise and find flaws in the finale. But I truly loved every single moment of the show, and I have not felt this much enjoyment in watching an anime in a long time. As of such, I give it a 9/10.",

It is one of those anime that you would rarely see because of how unique the sub genre is. From the very start to the very end, this anime was able to get me hooked into less than halfway through it. \r\nThe characters I believe  in this anime are 'not' suppose to be realistic, and in my perspective, the characters in this story are all necessary. You might 1 or 2 really not needed, but as the story goes on,it will make sense. Backstories for all characters are carefully explained to give reason for them to take on their roles in story.\\n\\n\r\nI would rather think of it as a alternate 19th century as there was never an actual revolution that took place in England/London. The story's progresses at a moderate pace, as there aren't really any build episodes. But some part of the story might let you down, because of how little may have happened. There isn't really any mild plot holes that would leave you pondering with questions, as most of what is ongoing in the story is explained very well.\\n\\n",

            "content": "Please note this review assumes that you have already finished watching Princess Principal and though care has been taken to minimize story related spoilers there will be some spoilers in character analysis.  \r\nIn a hidden war between spies four young girls defy an empire with their impressive skills in combat, intel gathering and lying and proves that with teamwork and friendship anything is possible. These four are the true spy kids of legend.  \r\nEvery anime season there is a very high chance that you would encounter an anime that brings to the table something that is completely new and unknown but rather thanbeing something that is already in existence as a source it\u2019s completely original and not tied to existing source material. In this season, this is princess principal the newest and perhaps the best spy anime I seen for some time. \\n\\n\r\nAs premises go the one that Princess Principal has is probably one of the most unique ones that I seen for some time. Set in alternate reality in the early 19th century in a heavily fictionalized version of the United Kingdom where the discovery of a new unknown substance Cavorite has revolutionized the Albion empire that has allowed it to introduce a new means of imposing its will on the world not with warships or vast naval fleets but with the next best thing a fleet of airships. This new development however is not without its disadvantages however as existing disagreements and differences that existed long before its discovery only deepened and resulted in a revolution that created a division of the kingdom with it now split between the Albion kingdom and the more democratic Albion Commonwealth. The newly formed Albion Commonwealth inferior to the kingdom in everything from military power to technology prowess compensates by making use of highly trained female operatives trained in everything from seduction, hazardous driving, combat and voice impersonation, disguise and infiltration that even the odds that are arrayed against them. \\n\\n\r\nThe overall story for Princess Principal follows the life and activities of four young girls each with unique talents and skills that they combine as they work as a team in missions against the Albion kingdom and in a war of shadows that no one but themselves and their commanders know about. In a ruthless and fierce battle waged in the shadows the girls can only count on their skills and their friends as they try to accomplish a variety of missions that range from escort to infiltration where sometimes simply obeying objectives and denying your feelings may not be the best way forward. \\n\\n\r\nAnge \\n\\n\r\nAnge played by veteran seiyuu Ayaka Imamura of Hundred fame is one of the main characters of the series and serves as one of the central characters of the series. A young teenage girl that like the rest of the team attends the prestigious Queens may fair school Ange is someone that can be seen as the ideal spy on account of her skill at lying to others and concealing her identity and mission even from her allies. A calm, logical and professional person that can be rather cold and unforgiving to others Ange can be considered by many to be the ideal spy as she is shown to excel in not just all the skills that a spy is expected to know being particularly adept at assuming different persona\u2019s and disguises that her mission requires while also remaining focused on the mission objectives. While on the surface Ange may be quiet and generally unapproachable Ange can be surprisingly chatty at times and able to respond with sarcasm and smart retorts when pressed by people which is something that I find surprising about her character.  As a spy Ange is not used to working with large groups of people preferring instead to work alone or be paired with other experienced agents like Dorothy and as such it can be hard for her to work with people that are unknown to her. This aspect of her personality meant that she had a bit of a difficulty when learning to work with new members such as Beatrice or Chise.  \\n\\n\r\nAs the series progresses Ange\u2019s personality changes quite a bit as she encounters more and more allies and in the process forge bonds and friendship with many of them something that would have been rare had she stayed in her old personality. While still remaining, quiet and preferring to offer her opinion only when called for Ange noticeably becomes more proactive and willing to provide advice to others when she sees them in trouble even when it would have been better to leave them alone. Ange also become more understanding and kind as the series went on willing to help those that are not able to take care of themselves normally with the best example in her helping out a street orphan who had resorted to pick pocketing to survive on the streets. In the beginning of the series Ange\u2019s quiet and cryptic manner of behavior made her very difficult to get to know by the newer members of the team such as Beatrice and Chise which was made worst by the fact that Ange did not think highly of them as well. However, as the series went on and after seeing their worth on the field it can be seen that Ange\u2019s behavior regarding them as a result of them defying her initial assessments. While still loyal to the mission itself Ange is shown to also become very loyal to both her team and its members taking great care to teach them and ensure that they are protected from harm when on missions. Ange\u2019s most prominent trait is without a doubt her ability to assume any form of disguise and mannerisms that go with it as easily as it is in throwing a switch something that I feel is essential for a spy.  \\n\\n\r\nBeatrice \\n\\n\r\nBeatrice voiced by new seiyuu Akari Kageyama is one of the main characters of the show and is one of Ange\u2019s main allies and fellow team member of the teenage spy squad. Initially Beatrice was the handmaiden of Princess and acted as both her assistant and maid and accompanied her whenever she went. After Princess decided to work with the commonwealth to achieve her plan Beatrice decided to follow due to her loyalty to her. A teenager like the rest of the spy team Beatrice is a positive, kind, sweet and dutiful person whose most prominent trait is her loyalty first to the princess and then to the team itself. In the beginning of the series Beatrice while very loyal to her princess behaved more like a rookie in the beginning due to not having as many skills in spy craft as Ange did or the close combat skills that Chise had and as a result was mostly relegated to support roles. However, as the series goes on Beatrice through her diligence and determination to be of help to her liege the princess starts to mature both in terms of skills and in terms of personality. In terms of personality Beatrice as the series goes on noticeably becomes braver as the series goes on willing to put her life on the line to ensure that missions go smoothly. A key part of Beatrice\u2019s personality development was her acceptance of her enhanced voice that was put in by her father a mechanical genius that in the beginning caused her a great grief and shame. Though at first reluctant and scared to make use of it Beatrice eventually mustered the courage to accept it and use it as it allowed her to not just have her own unique skill but also allow her to help her friends and her princess in the missions that they do. \\n\\n\r\nIn the beginning of the series Beatrice as a result of her quiet and meek personality had great trouble in making friends with her only friend being the princess. In the beginning of the series Beatrice also had a noticeably dislike of Ange and the world of spies as she felt that the spy world had no real friends and that everyone that worked in the world was a liar. Her dislike of Ange at first was also a result of the loyalty that she has towards princess where truthfulness is seen as the quality that maids such as she should exhibit. However, as the series goes on and she got to see how Ange and the others worked in the world this opinion of hers began to change as she came to trust the team which caused her to eventually try and form friendships with them. In this the manner of how Ange and Beatrice formed their friendships I felt was cute. As a result of being a maid that serves royalty Beatrice is shown to be someone that is observant of protocol and as such she gets angry rather easily when people notably Ange ignores them a fact that I find quite amusing to see. Without a doubt, the most prominent trait of Beatrice is her loyalty to not just her team mates but also to princess herself. The manner of how Beatrice met princess and how they eventually become such great friends that ensured Beatrice\u2019s loyalty to her I felt was really sweet and really put in perspective in understanding why Beatrice is so dedicated to both her welfare and safety. As a character, I felt that Beatrice was a really interesting character that while cute and innocent at first proved that with hard work and a will to be of service to someone dear to you really can become an asset to them. Akari Kageyama I felt really did an excellent job portraying Beatrice in one of the first main roles that I seen her in and I wish her continued success in the future. \\n\\n\r\nChise \\n\\n\r\nChise voiced by veteran seiyuu Nozomi Furuki of High School Fleet fame is one of the main characters of the series and is one of the main members of the teenage spy squad. Unlike the rest of the team Chise herself is not actually from Albion and rather she originates from the island country of Japan which makes her rather unique when considering the other members of the team. A teenage girl like the rest of the spy squad Chise is a quiet, calm and composed person that initially was even more quiet than Ange was on the outset. Similar to Ange Chise is someone that does not trust people that easily even when they appear to be allies but once she does she is shown to immensely loyal to them. A unique aspect of Chise\u2019s personality is the fact that she is very loyal to the warrior culture of Japan which considering the time period does indicate that she\u2019s very loyal to the samurai code Bushido. In her personality, this manifests in the form of how strict she is about herself regarding to the way of the sword which also creates frustration for her when she can\u2019t use it in missions. As the series goes on Chise\u2019s closed off personality starts to gradually unravel as she gets used to her duties as not just as a member of the teenage spy squad but also as a person as well showing that beneath that composed and strict persona that she makes use of Chise is also an observant person and has shown to also have very good deduction skills and able to tell what someone\u2019s personality is like by a glance. Chise is also shown to be a very kind person at heart and is shown to show sympathy towards people that she feels did not deserve their fate such as the kids that she encounters on the streets. \\n\\n\r\nDue in part to Chise being deployed in a country that is unknown to her both in terms of language and culture a large part of her story arc is spent on her getting to grips with it. This particular arc which while simple was actually quite interesting as we get to see her get confused with the simplest of things like the fact that in Albion the pencil is sued to write instead of the ink brush and that when someone offers to teach you swordplay you accept rather than throw a vegetable at them. Of this arc, arguably the most interesting part was the dual between some bullies which despite the advantage lying with her opponents Chise was able to gracefully win with the most unorthodox dual I ever seen. As a character Chise actually was more of an outsider than Beatrice and Princess was and though She and Ange and Dorothy did not have the best of first encounters I felt that her gradual acceptance of her role both as an observer and as a member of the team was well done. Chise\u2019s attempts to try and understand the culture of Albion better with the help of Beatrice I felt was also quite hilarious. I felt that her seiyuu Nozomi Furuki really did a great job in portraying her. \\n\\n\r\nDorothy \\n\r\nDorothy voiced by veteran seiyuu You Taichi of Tsugumomo fame is one of the main characters of the series and is the overall leader of the teenage spy squad that the girls are part off. Unlike the rest of the spy squad that she commands Dorothy is actually an adult already that due to the fact that she looks younger than what her true age suggests is able to still pull off a convincing disguise as a teenage girl. An old classmate of Ange that graduated from the same training class back in the past Dorothy at first was the only person that Ange actually had complete trust and faith in. A responsible, calm and intelligent person Dorothy acts as the overall leader of the spy team and as a result is well versed in a number of field crafts that spies would know.  When out on the field Dorothy is someone that is professional and serious though no less focused on their missions that Ange is. However, while Ange has a habit of being overly focused on the mission Dorothy is someone that is the opposite in that she will only do the best that she and the rest of her team can while taking care not to push them too hard. In this we can see that Dorothy also includes as an aspect of her personality the older sister type personality in that she cares a great deal about her juniors and tries to protect them the best that she can. As a result of this personality Dorothy is able to easily bond with people and connect with them far more easily than Ange can. \\n\\n\r\nIn addition to having excellent leadership and driving skills Dorothy has been noted to make use of the drunk maiden trick as her main method of distraction a lot in the series which I felt considering her looks is actually a great use of her charm. This manner of approach for her I felt was interesting and I was surprised at how often that actually works. Outside of missions however it can be seen that Dorothy is a rather playful person that loves to drink and joke with others something that I felt contrasts well with her more serious personality that she uses out on the field. Given the black and white nature of the world that they fight in being able to allow your team to unwind is something that I think is quite important for that morale. As a character, I felt that Dorothy was a great character that did a great job of keeping the individual team members on track with their missions while also allowing a certain level of flexibility to them. The fact that she cares a great deal about her friends and allies as a result of her older sister like personality I felt was something that was well suited to her character. I felt that her seiyuu You Taichi really did a great job portraying her. \\n\\n\r\nPrincess \\n\\n\r\nPrincess voiced by new seiyuu Akira Sekine is one of the main characters of the series and is a member of the teenage spy squad. Despite the nickname Princess is actually a real-life princess of the Albion kingdom that has decided for reasons of her own to help the squad in their missions. A teenage girl like the rest of the team\u2019s members Princess is a kind, caring and gentle person that has all the base traits that a princess should have. However, princess in addition to being kind is also a cunning and crafty person skills that she learned after years of interacting with politicians and relatives that seek to use her due to her status as a princess of the kingdom. In the beginning of the series princess\u2019s position within the team was somewhat of an enigma as she was both part of the team but also a person that the team protected. In these first days Princess\u2019s initial personality as can be expected was one that was guarded and defensive but even in these unusual circumstances she retained her positive and cheerful nature. As the series progresses and Princess\u2019s personality is gradually developed we can see that while she\u2019s kind and compassionate princess is also someone that is hardworking and determined to achieve her overall goal which hints at her true ambition in the story as well. As shown in her first encounter with Ange and Dorothy Princess is also shown to be a very intelligent and crafty person that oddly enough also likes to gamble hinting at the fact that her perception skills are not something that\u2019s to be underestimated either. Though she was wary of the members of the spy team at first which in turn was felt by the members of the teams themselves Princess gradually came to trust them and become fast friends with them much to both of their surprises. As the series progresses Princess though still an important person within the team gradually takes on a much larger and more active role within the team playing an active part in their missions demonstrating both her bravery and a willingness to take a more direct role in actions that leads to fulfillment of her dream and ambition. Of princess\u2019s personality, I believe the more prominent trait about her is her ambition which rather than coming from her desire to become queen from selfish reasons like it\u2019s her birth right or something actually stems from both what she has seen in the kingdom and what she herself has experienced in the past. Unlike most princesses that are shown in media Princess is someone that due to her compassionate and kind nature is able to sympathize with many different people and understand the things that they go through as they try to stake out an existence in the often-harsh poorer areas of the kingdom. Seeing both this and the grief and pain that the infamous wall has created for this serves as the primary reason for Princess\u2019s ambition something that I find myself quite in agreement with. \\n\\n\r\nAs a character, I felt that princess was a character that was pretty well designed as though a princess she was someone that didn\u2019t behave like a typical royal being both compassionate, kind and not looking down at people lower in status than her unlike others. This meant that as a character it was far easier to bond with and connect with her which is something that I liked. Her most prominent trait which was her ambition was also something that I liked as rather than having a selfish reason for being so her reasons were a result of her own experiences and beliefs that she developed from seeing things first hand which in my book made her a hero already. Overall I felt that her seiyuu Akira Sekine really did a great job for one of her first main roles and I wish her well in the future. \\n\\n\r\nArts and animation \\n\\n\r\nIn terms of arts I felt that the character designs for each of the main characters were pretty well done and each of the girls while also looking pretty also fit the part of someone that lived in 19th century London. The scenery for each of the locations that the main cast visit and explore in the series I felt was also well designed and varied and you can tell that they really put a lot of thought into putting in the different types of areas that 19th century London would have that range from rich noble mansions to laundry mills in the slums. In terms of animation I felt that it was smooth and clear with the combat animation and the fights that make use of them being amazing. The contrast in colors that are used to show a more subtle difference as the cast move through different class areas is something that I thought was well designed as it showed an obvious cue that the cast were in different social areas within the kingdom. \\n\\n\r\nMusic \\n\\n\r\nIn terms of music Princess principal made use of two pieces of major music which included an opening theme which in this case was The Other Side of the Wall by Void_Chords feat Maru and an ending theme which was A Page of My Story which was sung by the seiyuu\u2019s of the four main characters. The opening theme for the series I felt was interesting as it helped convey a sense of racing for freedom on the other side which resonated well with the overall theme of the series of working to eliminate the barriers that divide a country. The opening theme also did a great job of drumming a sense of anticipation into mind as well as if each episode will feature an important mission for the team. The ending theme for the series I felt was quite cute and had a really relaxing feel to it which was helped greatly by the visuals that it made use of. This ending when used in conjunction with the usually heavy episodes actually helped in making the viewer relax after going through such heavy events in the episode. The scene music for the series was another thing that I thought was well done especially the dramatic effect that plays when the girls are executing the mission over the heads of their enemies. \\n\\n\r\nVoice acting \\n\\n\r\nThe voice acting for the series I felt were relatively strong with particular praise going to Ayaka Imamura who portrayed Ange, You Taichi who portrayed Dorothy, Nozomi Furuki who portrayed Chise, Akari Kageyama who portrayed Beatrice and Akira Sekine who portrayed Princess. Each of these five characters despite being relatively new to voice acting I felt really did an excellent job in portraying their respective characters. \\n\\n\r\nOverall conclusion \\n\\n\r\nIn overall Princess Principal was a really strong anime that thanks to its unique setting and premise ensured that among this anime season it will be regarded as one of the best animes that had premiered. Princess Principals main strong points that made it such an enjoyable anime in my view was its unique premise, a well thought out story, interesting characters, unique take on missions and excellent voice acting and the bond of friendship and unity that the members forged with each other. The music for the series I felt was also one of its strong points. Within the anime industry anime\u2019s that make use of the spy theme are very rare and indeed the only one that stands to mind on the time of writing was Joker game an anime that premiered during the second anime period of last year. The reason for this is because it\u2019s very hard to create a setting where spies can be seen as something that is necessary when for example someone with a sword might be more useful and flashier. This has the effect of making this type of anime even harder to get right as countless things need to be tweaked to ensure that they all work correctly. The theme and setting that Princess Principal chose to use as a result is one setting that I thought was well conceived as 19th century London that was divided by a wall after a revolution split the country sounded perfect for a place where spies would operate as each side needs to know what the other is doing. The commonwealth widely seen as weaker than the kingdom in both tech and manpower can also be seen as the underdog that needs to maintain its strength continuously by stealing ideas and rescuing people from the other side. These reasons help in justifying why the setting and premise was unique and why it gave a setting where spies from both sides could operate in their little shadow war. \\n\\n\r\nThe overall story for the series of featuring a spy squad of mostly teenage girls who despite their age have abilities that are on par with veteran adults was something thought outlandish at first was something that I soon saw the merit of after seeing their first missions. Who in their right mind I ask would think that the pretty teenage girl that you saw two minutes ago ducking into your alley was a highly trained spy that can take you out in two minutes flat without batting an eye lid. The combination of surprise and unexpected opponents ensured that the teams opponents are surprised every time something that tells of how good of an idea the teenage spy squad turned out to be. Each of the missions that make up the overall plot line I thought were all unique and well-designed that in addition to showing creative uses of mission types for the girls also allowed them to showcase the developments that they had in their character and personality. The act of tying in princess\u2019s character and her motivation and growth and ultimately her ambition in with the main plot line was something that I felt was an excellent move as it helped instill a more personal side on the story which is helped greatly by perhaps by one of the greatest twists in an anime that I seen so far. \\n\\n\r\nOverall Princess Principal was an anime that I really enjoyed and one that brought a lot of fresh air to both the spy genre but also to anime in general thanks to its take on a unique setting that was married with an excellent storyline and well-designed characters that were played by new but highly capable seiyuu\u2019s. In overall for final score I can easily give Princess Principal a 10/10 a score that I think it easily deserves. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Princess Principal is a steampunk, spy anime set in Victorian London. This anime is an anime you didn't know you want until you see it. Every episode has its own mission. Each with their own story, world building. It doesn't really have an overarching plot but every episode has some minor connection to a bigger story. Though there are a few missions that span multiple episodes. \r\nIts presentation was good. Everything was animated well and everything moved fluidly. The music was good and really fit their scene.\r\nBut what really makes this anime good is the characters. All of the main cast is interesting in theirown way. They all have a different way to approach their situation with their own traits and skills. Early on you always think, how will they take care of this situation? Later you know how the characters think and how they will take care of it. The side characters were alright. Some were more interesting than others.\\n\\n\r\nOverall I recommend it to everyone to everyone even remotely liking character-focused stories.",

            "content": "This has to be one the best anime this season that is going under a lot of people radar. Add to the fact that this is an original anime, it definitely surprised me on just how good it gets as the series progressed.\r\nStory-8\r\nPrincess Principal plot and story are great for the most part. You might find some point it gets dark in the world espionage, then some episode it just let loose. I thought this would be a moe spy anime but I am proven wrong on just the first few episodes.\r\nArt-9\r\nThe design theme characters and environment are cohesive, it brings out a damped-steam-punk-London vibeto it. And it works! The animation are great and fluid for the most part. The fight choreography and shot selection are fantastic! I am reminded once again what a good fight scene is supposed to look like!\\n\\n\r\nSound-8\\n\\n\r\nWatching this series with a headphone would be a good idea. Because I can pick out some environment sound on the scene as well. That is pretty rare consider most choose to overlay it with ost. It is also great for choosing not to use the ost on some scenes to bring out the tension. Even with ost it is unique as well, most of the theme is jazz and blues. Princess Principal and Kakegurui are the top 2 anime that does this for the current season.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter-8\\n\\n\r\nWe sometime get an entire episode for a character past which helps to develop them. It doesn't slow down the pace for me, as I'm very curious why they decided to be what they are. Its more mature than what I thought too. Each character has some form of flaw or alternative motives which makes it difficult to guess where is it heading.\\n\\n\r\nOver all I highly recommend this gem even at only 9 episode in. No matter what your preference may be when it comes to anime, I think this is a series that deserves your watch!",

With 5 female main characters with differing personalities, you are bound to find some or all that you like and want to know more about.\r\nIf you are all about action, you might want to reconsider this one. Although there is decent amount of action throughout, this show doesn't rely heavily on it's action sequences to carry it. The show will take time to show you character backstories as well as go on some missions that involve little no action.\r\nIf you require good animation than you will want to includeit in your lists. Although I would say the animation is pretty par for the course when compared to other shows around this time. Where the animation really shines is in any fast moving vehicle scenes. I wont get specific as to not spoil anything.\\n\\n\r\nIf you like settings involving early turn of the century, or steam punk, or Europe, then  this is a must. Examples of these setting are everywhere in every episode. It doesn't really get overbearing if you don't really like it, but it's awesome if you do.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, i think this a hidden gem this season. It is a lot of fun to watch, it is not afraid to get dark and heavy at times, and all the characters' relationships, motivations and dialogue feel very believable and appropriate for the setting and plot.",
