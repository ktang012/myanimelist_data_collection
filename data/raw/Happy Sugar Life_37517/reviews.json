            "content": "For as long as I\u2019ve been watching anime, there has always been a considerable amount of the community who can find so much entertainment in shows that are \u201cso bad, they\u2019re good.\u201d Whether it be the pandering fan service of shows like Eromanga Sensei, the comically overdone plot of shows like In Another World With My Smartphone, or the laughably edgy situations in shows like Magical Girl Site, the community always seems to find something to enjoy in shows that are simply, undeniably, and blatantly trash. But as the saying goes, \u201cone man\u2019s trash is another man\u2019s treasure\u201d, and it looks like I\u2019ve found mytreasure in the trash that is Happy Sugar Life.  \\n\\n\r\nLet me be clear that this exact brand of trash was thrown aside just so a degenerate like myself could come and fish it out of the gutter. If you\u2019re not messed up in the same exact ways that I am then you should stay away from this shitshow, so I\u2019ll just cut to the chase. If you don\u2019t like yuri romance, age-gap romance, or cute girls and lolis, then take your leave. This show is abjectly terrible, so just save yourself while you still can. If you DO like that kind of thing, then let\u2019s get into this shit. \\n\\n\r\nHappy Sugar Life is in the \u201chorror comedy\u201d genre of anime that are technically horror thrillers, but that are so bad that they just become funny. Everyone and everything is comically over-the-top edgy for no reason, there\u2019s murder, rape, extramarital affairs, any overused bullet point on the edge checklist gets checked. Everything looks like shit, the animation is god-awful, the character designs are beyond basic, the OST is either boring or actively unfitting, the cinematography is almost exclusively flat-panning shots with 60% of every episode being still frames, and I could honestly keep going because this is a bottom of the barrel production from a nobody studio and staff that looks and runs terrifically bad.  \\n\\n\r\nThat said, the main character is a cute yandere girl with pink hair, buns, and is somehow voiced by Kana Hanazawa, who is in love with a literal elementary school loli with whom she shares a home, bath, and bed. I am fucking sold; This show is perfect. Watching this week by week was hysterical. The show is worst of the worst, but we all got to be reminded that there is a real show, that is actually being made in real life, that features a yuri age-gap romance about a psychotic sex-craved schoolgirl who murders and blackmails anyone who threatens to interrupt her life living with a loli that she literally kidnaped and locked in her apartment. I don\u2019t need to elaborate on the concept because only one single thing of note happened throughout the entire show, and I don\u2019t think that just because there\u2019s a decent five minute scene at the end of episode nine you should go and watch the show, because the remaining two hundred and fifty nine minutes were pure garbage. Any mature person that happens to come across this review can see that this show is nothing but mindless self indulgence, so if it sounds like something you can indulge in like I did, give it a watch. \\n\\n\r\nThat\u2019s it. Done. Ten out of ten, would watch again. \\n\\n\r\nThank you for reading. (I know my other reviews are more serious than this, but this show was just far too much for me XD.)",

            "content": "THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS\r\nMahou Shoujo Site was a fun series from last season. It went so overboard and above what is acceptable that it became nothing less than great series to watch, and in the mean time, managed to offend lots of people -- which is always a plus. I expected the same from Happy Sugar Life, and while it hasn't been exactly as over the top nor has it managed to make people lose their self-control in similar fashion, it did deliver.\r\nOur story focuses around two characters: Satou Matsuzaka, a psychotic lesbian pedophile, voiced by Hanawaza Kana (Hype, ikr). And this assumably 4-5 years-oldchild. Satou used to be into guys and also didn't suffer from several different mental illnesses back then. However, now she is really into this 4-5 years-old girl with whom she lives with (and whom she kidnapped), and they together form this supposedly pure and innocent lesbian romance. Real haato waamingu stuff. \\n\\n\r\nHowever, there is more to life than living in a relationship with a 4 years-old child. At day time, Satou is a working-class citizen, doing real normo shit. In this series universe, normo shit includes reverse-raping men, bullying co-workers, threatening people with murder and torture and of course, serving customers in a restaurant. I know, pretty sick stuff, yuck!\\n\\n\r\nThe series values the comfy and aesthetic side of life -- with what I identify personally pretty hard with. My favorite scenes include stuff like Satou decorating the house. Who needs paint and a brush, lol only nobs use such things. Machete and a living person, do some well timed choppity chops and oh my, the walls look like new. Such a pretty look to it. Definitely a real home feel right there. I have heard the saying \"paint the mirrors black\" but I guess \"chop the walls red\" isn't too bad either. \\n\\n\r\nThe OST consist of nothing but fantastic decisions. Practically these are songs that sound a lot like any random piece from Youtube audio library which people can use for free in their videos. Practically any of the songs could be used by a random content creator who makes guides on how to change a light bulb to your microwave. Imaging this has only added to the experience.\\n\\n\r\nAs a conclusion, this is not a series I would recommend to just anyone.Those who have the tendency of finding beauty from stories that were inspired by madness, will have significant chances of liking Happy Sugar Life there were other will only experience bitterness. heh pun\\n",

            "content": "It\u2019s only stupid if it doesn\u2019t work.\r\nNowadays, the shows I fight to defend are highly misunderstood because their appeal is too specific, causing the general audience to flaunt their standards around like they\u2019re supposed to mean anything.  Past examples include Mahou Shoujo Site, Jashin-chan Dropkick and Hand Shakers.  Yet, Happy Sugar Life is a different sort of\u2026 thing, whose plot setup is about as logically sound as riding a lawnmower during a hurricane, seemingly leaving not but a select, niche appeal for the sickos like me.\r\nA high school girl is basically holding a little girl hostage in a populated apartment complex; she hidesthis among her normal daily life of going to school and working part-time jobs.  You know, like all teenagers do.  If this is your first time reading the synopsis, then you\u2019re probably asking a lot of questions like \u201cHuh?\u201d or \u201cWhat?\u201d  because the basic rules and structure of society suggest that this shouldn\u2019t even be possible.  And for me, knowing that much is what made this story interesting--HOW these characters are living such lives, and what will happen when it inevitably shatters.  Because there\u2019s just no way it won\u2019t--and the very first scene of the anime suggests that it very much will. \\n\\n\r\nHappy Sugar Life makes use of its own flaws.  The sugar-coated scenes of the main characters in their unnatural habitat are not just for show; they\u2019re presented as a true illusion from reality.  The conflict is all the outsiders learning more about their lives and trying to tear it down, a plot that snowballs as the situation becomes more and more complicated.  A situation known as \u201creality\u201d. \\n\\n\r\nWhat\u2019s more, is that the aforementioned little girl doesn\u2019t even seem to be a real character.  Shio Koube lives and breathes, but her actual personality is baffling.  She\u2019s constantly happy and cheery and trying to do the best she can to help her caretaker.  She doesn\u2019t question the life she lives or the outside world she\u2019s prevented from seeing.  She is simply \u201ca daughteru\u201d:  the ideal child anyone would want to have--no, scratch that.  Megumin and Chtholly are daughterus to me, but that\u2019s because they actually seem like real characters, because real characters have flaws.  Shio Koube does not.  Shio Koube is not a real character, nor a daughteru--she is a pet. A Shia pet, if you will.  She exists to be cute and fluffy; you feed her and play with her a bit, and if you can do those two things, then she\u2019s not gonna be a bother to you outside of the occasional natural fuck-up.  That\u2019s cool and all, but that\u2019s not how a human child actually acts.\\n\\n\r\nBut what\u2019s smart about the anime is that it actually addresses this.  Shio\u2019s personality is the result of past trauma that\u2019s she\u2019s forgotten; and as she learns more and more about herself, it starts to crack a little.  By the end of the series, Shio outright states that she\u2019s meant to be more than a living object used to draw mental security from, practically breaking the fourth wall by stating she\u2019s a real character who has a functional and realistic train of thought that accurately feeds into her personality.\\n\\n\r\nIn other words, Happy Sugar Life was only pretending to be retarded.\\n\\n\r\nBecause, with the way it handles its plot by addressing its flaws and nailing its appeal with few problems, I can\u2019t help but think that Happy Sugar Life is actually pretty clever.  As dumb and over-the-top it may seem, it was in full control of itself and did what it set out to do.  \\n\\n\r\nSuffering, violence, trauma and psychosis.  Of course an anime called \u201cHappy Sugar Life\u201d would be about anything but.  Characters have very specific, intricately detailed mental issues, so much so that I can\u2019t guarantee the anime doesn\u2019t take place in some sort of high-tech asylum that simulates society as therapy for its patients.  The way they\u2019re presented are interesting on their own for what they are, but the main character herself acts in a surprisingly grounded manner.  \\n\\n\r\nIn the first episode, she verbally beats down her employer over a payroll cut, explaining how she was fully aware of the manager\u2019s schemes but played along for the sake of being nice, only to still be punished.  She completely dismantles this person mentally and challenges her, but her tone of voice is what sells the scene.  She doesn\u2019t scream or shout, the soundtrack is dark but sparse with details, and the visual direction is simple but effective.  It\u2019s not dynamic, over-acted, or over-the-top.  This scene could\u2019ve easily been a screaming match between two idiots, but\u2026 that would just be silly and unnecessary.  Quiet words speak louder than loud words.  That\u2019s totally how the saying goes.\\n\\n\r\nSatou Matsuzaka, aka \u201cHoly Shit Is That A Motherfucking Mirai Nikki Reference???\u201d is fully in control of herself, able to function like a normal person in most circumstances.  And by \u201ccontrol\u201d, I mean she seems to be keeping a deeper anger pent up within her, choosing not to do any more than what\u2019s necessary.  It\u2019s a contrast from the manager in episode one, who fights back with shouting and more body language, among other characters that I\u2019ll get into later.  The stability of Definitely Not Yuno\u2019s mental condition is part of the snowballing conflict--as her Title of The Anime becomes harder and harder to keep, her psyche decays, and as her psyche decays, she becomes more and more dangerous.\\n\\n\r\nBasically, if you know what the fuck a yandere is, you know what\u2019s up.\\n\\n\r\nWatching Pink Yandere fall further into despair as the story progressed, as well as her drastic shifts in attitude, are a blast to watch.  Hana Kanazawa delivers one of the best performances in her incredibly prolific career, at times sounding completely unrecognizable to me.  She\u2019s not just using her Akane Tsunemori serious drama voice, she\u2019s speaking in a tone FAR lower than almost every anime she\u2019s been cast in.  And, as a huge fan of Mirai Nikki, you bet your ass I loved episode 11 when she tied her hair back to look exactly like Yuno.  Praise be.\\n\\n\r\nThe other characters in the series are in various stages of sanity, for better or for worse.  The most notable is Satou\u2019s Aunt, who hoardes trash and lets weirdos beat the shit out of her for pleasure.  You know, like all loving aunts do.  But, like Satou, she\u2019s fully in control of her actions.  Rather, this is a matter of one being so deluded of themselves that they believe their behavior to be healthy.  AILF (aunt i\u2019d like to fuck) even convinces herself to have a fulfilling role within society, accepting hostility and fucking it out of them.  She is indeed quite over-the-top, but the long dialogues she provides make her believable enough to be enjoyable.\\n\\n\r\nAnd then there\u2019s the lolicon guy\u2026 oh boy.  This fuckin\u2019 guy.  As a result of things happening that cause him to distrust adults, he becomes so fully attached to Shio that he takes passionate inhalations of her missing poster flyers.  THIS is the over-the-top character that you\u2019d expect to see from a full edgelord show, and really, your opinion of him just depends on how much you\u2019re into that kinda stuff.  To me, this character is no more than a punchline--more like a punching bag, actually, given all the shit he goes through.  A full display of maximum disparity and lack of self-control, his actions are so cartoonish and ridiculous that all he ends up doing in the series is suffering. A lot.  He\u2019s just a dumping ground for all the negative consequences brought on by the other characters.  Overall, not a character to be taken seriously; he stands at the border between Happy Sugar Life being a completely serious drama and a goofy, edgy comedy.  I like the mixture of both worlds.\\n\\n\r\nBut the crowning jewel of this anime are some of the more psychologically-based scenes.  For as weird and silly as the anime can be, there are scenes of actual genius scattered throughout--most notably, the first half of episode eight.  It explores the backstory of Satou\u2019s and Shio\u2019s apartment through the eyes of its former resident.  All of it is in first-person view with no music, and the resident never speaks.  Instead, their moments of \u201cdialogue\u201d are replaced with a glitchy audio clip over a fluctuating black line.  The pauses before these clips make noise and their varying intensity fill in the blanks of Satou\u2019s conversations perfectly.  It\u2019s a tremendously well-done scene that I would recommend to anyone, even if you haven't seen the rest of the anime.\\n\\n\r\nSound manipulation is a motif in this series; characters\u2019 voices will become static-y and distorted in key moments to intensify their dark expressions.  Several different visual tricks are used for similar reasons--glowing eyes, static, reflections, scratchy lines, lighting, shadows, tactful shot compositions and other things are all deployed for the show\u2019s depraved, depressing and dark moods without overdoing any of them.  Meanwhile, happier moments are shown with sparkles, bubbles, clouds and bright, poppy colors; so corny that they\u2019re almost vomit-inducing, and I mean that in the best way possible.  Happy Sugar Life doesn\u2019t necessarily excel with animation, set pieces or character designs, but the various tricks it uses to communicate its feelings are excellent.\\n\\n\r\nSimilarly, the soundtrack doesn\u2019t particularly stand out, but the sound design is quite good, I\u2019ll say again.  Rising violins, static, vocal manipulation and prestigious voice acting get the job more than done.  The OP is one of my favorites of the entire year, using a song perfectly toned to this anime with its siren-like guitar riffs and optimistic, upbeat tone, shifting in and out of muttered, paranoid passages.  Bizarre, photographed objects float about in the background; a Shio-like angel flies over shadowy figures of the characters, and various trappings by glass jars and thorns lay over Satou as the video glitches with inconsistent timing.  It\u2019s easy to see what\u2019s going on in the OP based on a few episodes of the show itself, but it\u2019s communicated in so many incredible ways that the OP never got skipped.  The ED is good\u2026 for an ED, that is, which is to say not much, but the animation of Satou and Shio is cute, and the song itself is quite touching.\\n\\n\r\nIf you\u2019ve read my reviews before, you know that I\u2019m completely and 100% serious in all of my reviews, and I never make any jokes whatsoever, so when I say this is a 9/10 anime, I mean that it should be watched by all eyes, no matter what.\\n\\n\r\nNow, if you\u2019ve ACTUALLY read my reviews before, you\u2019d know I like to play around, that I don\u2019t really care about ratings, that I\u2019m not all that interested in seeing a fully-serious, masterfully-crafted story.  But with its combination of surprise turnarounds, smart directing and just the right amount of silliness, I\u2019d truly say that Happy Sugar Life is a quality anime; not just by my standards, but for drama and psychological anime as a whole.  Indeed, it is not perfect--some people will be unhappy with some of the characters or not be willing to see how the anime fixes itself down the line.  In fact, I myself have room to complain about the teacher not having any real exploration to his character, as well as some scenes that simply would not happen in the real world, such as Satou's Aunt seducing the police officer, as good as it was.  A lot of it is conveniently written.  The characters aren\u2019t particularly deep and more idealized than realized.  But, overall, Happy Sugar Life is FUN.  It is an exciting series that takes little time to light its first match, and once it gets going it doesn\u2019t let up until it has burned everything down.\\n\\n\r\nI dearly recommend this anime to anyone who\u2019s into not just edgy comedies, but anyone who\u2019s interested in a kinda wacky psychological drama that even manages to unnerve you a little bit.  Perhaps it is not the most effective at what it is, but it is, nonetheless, effective.\\n\\n\r\nStory - 8/10\\n\r\nArt - 8/10\\n\r\nSound - 8/10\\n\r\nCharacters - 7/10\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 9/10\\n\r\nYandere - 10/10\\n\r\nOverall - 9/10\\n\r\nFavorite episode - 8\\n\r\nFavorite character - Satou.

            "content": "\"MUHAHAHA, lookie look how crazy I am -- I'm wheezily drooling over a little girl's picture and screaming like a complete idiot!\"\r\nThat's pretty much the best way to describe this anime.\r\nStory: 3\r\nThe writing is below the level of both David Cage and Uwe Boll's work. \"You're less stable than the other girls. I'm an adult. I'm sure I can help you.\" This is a literal line a character has delivered in this series. Not only does composition repeatedly get dumped in our faces, it has to be in the most awkward ways imaginable. \r\nHappy Sugar Life is anime about a girl named Satou. She hada past of banging random fuckboys and until she stumbled upon a rare wild loli. She caught it and now she oughta protecc it and attacc random badly written losers from capturing it, but most of all, she doesn't give a fucc about everyone else. In fact, she invariably feels the need to state this.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 1\\n\r\n\"Oh wow, these type of characters have never been represented before! This is SO edgy!\"\\n\r\nLast time I heard that line it was a reaction to \"13 Reasons Why\". Just like that series, HSL takes the piss out of mental health, but this is on a whole other level. Each character is constantly forced to state their true nature in the most cringe-worthy ways possible. Now I know anime shouldn't be viewed as film, but this anime just buries the 'Show not Tell' rules in ten meters of diarrhea. One of the characters (NO SPOILERS) is a borderline pedophile, but instead of revealing his nature by his actions they have him immediately drool over the loli's picture without any buildup. Although his way of handling is eventually shown, it gets completely destroyed with crank ass straightforward monologue that makes everything feel cheesy and overexaggerated. \\n\r\nThis is something you'd see frequently in a Thomas the Tank Engine episode since the mono- and dialogue is that bleak. If you play around with ADULT themes like these, write this series in a way ADULTS can enjoy (and no, I'm not talking about you angsty teenagers).\\n\\n\r\nWhat did I miss..? Oh yeah, the main female character is a joke. We get it, she is a strong deranged woman who don't need no men. No need to make her constantly repeat that. I can't believe they wasted such a good voice actress like Kana Hanazawa for this bullshit.\\n\r\nThe teacher is a plain imbecile; how does that impulsive moron still have a job and isn't locked up somewhere. I guess the loli is the only character that isn't so hyperbolically written. Well maybe because it is a child, but I can give the writers some props for her.\\n\r\nBut then again, every character is written like an incongruous child.\\n\\n\r\nMisc - Art: 6 | Sound: 5\\n\r\nAnimation-wise, it's plenty for whatever this series requires. The art and character design, namely the combination of grey tones and vibrancy, decently manage to convey the offsetting atmosphere this series is trying to portray -- nothing wrong with those. Its opening animations and song are probably the best assets this series has to offer. Apart from the opening song, the OST is pretty mediocre.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 5\\n\r\nAside from the bruises on my forehead I constantly get from slapping it, this series is somewhat enjoyable. It still has you questioning yourself what the fuck will happen next with these poorly written chunks of clay characters my 7-year-old cousin could replicate (figuratively speaking). \\n\\n\r\n(tl;dr)\\n\r\nOverall Final Score: 3\\n\r\nThe audiovisual aspects maybe great, but the context of its plot just pisses me the fuck off. I firmly believe that this series just presents character tropes instead of actual characters. The writers misrepresent real mental disorders to make this show seem as edgy as possible. And finally, as the cherry on top of the cake, they don't possess the skill level to handle such themes.\\n\r\nIf you want to see an excellent anime with godly written themes regarding mental health, go watch 3-Gatsu No Lion. That's all there is to it.",

            "content": "Once upon a time, there was a girl who didn\u2019t know what love really is. She seemingly had no goals in life with a rootless understanding about love. Sleeping with guys and not truly knowing what her life is about, she didn\u2019t know if there was a place to belong. Wondering around the end of abyss of life and not knowing who she can really be with. Then, a child appeared. An innocent child with a face full of life and sugar. Is this a chance to truly discover love? Is it a chance to live a happy sugar life?\r\nAs a show that combines elementsof psychological horror, suspense, and thriller, Happy Sugar Life looked deceptive at first glance. Now I admit, I\u2019m a bit of a sucker when it comes to shows where we have an anti-hero protagonist. I mean, the first episode speak for itself once you realize Matsuzaka Satou\u2019s personality. She is essentially living a double life \u2013 one that is of a normal girl and other being overly obsessive of Shio Kobe. This devotion to Shio is so strong that she is willing to kill others to \u201cprotect\u201d her from harm. In Satou's mind, being with Shio equates to happiness.\\n\\n\r\nDespite the complex nature of the plot, the setup of the story is actually very simple. We got Satou who pretty much takes Shio as a partner and isolates her in a place where she feels is safe. It\u2019s an apartment that looks normal on the inside and outside until you realize there may be something much darker going on behind the scenes. The first few episodes is rather cryptic about Satou\u2019s actions including parts where she takes questionable content in and out of the house. Meanwhile, there\u2019s definitely character chemistry going on between Satou and Shio. The duo shares an innocent love chemistry and ritual-like marriage ceremonies on a frequent basis. On most parts, the show seems fluffy during those segments while masking the suspenseful thriller storytelling. Throughout the series, we discover just how far from normal Satou actually is. The show also makes it clear that she will go to any length to protect Shio even if it means murder. Anyone who is familiar with the term \u2018yandere\u2019 will easily dedicate her character as such. In essence, Satou is a complex character who sees her idea of love in a twisted way. Regardless of consequences, she will do anything to protect that love. This puts Shio on the opposite end of the spectrum as she is an innocent child. Despite that, she seems to adore Satou and always values their relationship. It\u2019s the sort of child behavior you\u2019d expect from this show.\\n\\n\r\nThe more I watched Happy Sugar Life, the more I realized how this show depicts human behavior in some of the worst ways possible. Characters such as Taiyou displays borderline pedophile behavior towards Shio. Others such as Daichi and Satou\u2019s aunt also demonstrate their psychological tendencies in several episodes. With the exception of Shio, only one other character came to my mind who I can say is normal. Her name would be Shouko Hida but I wouldn\u2019t get attached to her easily. In fact, try to refrain from getting attached to most of the characters in this series because their real personalities are incredibly disturbing. Another reason is that some characters will not make it alive. I\u2019m not going to mention it as it\u2019s spoiler but let\u2019s just say that death isn\u2019t uncommon in the story. \\n\\n\r\nAs the majority of the series adheres to psychological horror, it\u2019s hard to really root for any single character. The characters Satou deals with are often evil as she is with some being even more twisted. However, I think some of her past can be sympathetic. Satou wasn\u2019t born with evil intentions but events shaped her to become what she is now. The past explores her character in depth and there\u2019s even one episode that explains how Satou ends up where she is now. Narratives in this series is incredibly important as it fishes out a character\u2019s personality to the fullest. Satou is the primary example of this as we see a journey to understanding love in her words. There\u2019s also a character named Asahi Koube in the show with a deep desire to reunite with Shio as a family. But unlike Satou, he doesn\u2019t go to measures such as killing to achieve his happiness. It\u2019s a bit sugarcoated but he is more of a hero than Satou will ever be. \\n\\n\r\nBy the time you reach the conclusion of the first episode, I think it\u2019ll become obvious whether or not it\u2019s worth following this anime. Are you the type that love suspenseful horror? Do you favor a story with twisted inhumane characters? Do you want to see if characters such as Satou or Shio really find love in each other in the end? If these are some of the questions in mind, then definitely give this anime a shot. Otherwise, it\u2019s going to be a sluggish ride as every episode builds more and more into the suspense. I personally find this anime unique in the sense that it isn\u2019t truly deceptive yet always makes me anticipate on what to expect next. The character cast wants you to hate them and they succeed without jeopardizing the plot. And to me, that\u2019s a feat that I admire.\\n\\n\r\nLike the title suggests, Happy Sugar Life has a sugary and sweet coloring to its animation style. Studio Ezo\u2019la (one that I never heard of before until this series) bought out its ideas to fullest. It\u2019s vibrant and full of life during moments when we see happiness. Then, there are those dark eerie scenes that brings out the horror of the story. It\u2019s often moody especially in Satou\u2019s apartment where questionable content lies in the dark. As you should expect, this show contains violence that includes murder. The TV version seems to have tone it down a bit as some of the graphic content is done behind the scenes rather than shown directly on screen. Satou is the main culprit of this but there are some other characters that commit sinful deeds. Oh and be prepared for some uncomfortable scenes from the main cast. Taiyou is a guy that I deeply regret watching for his pedophilic tendencies. Good God, erase him from the show. Other character expressions in the series are disturbing to watch such as with Satou\u2019s red predatory eyes or her aunt\u2019s mentally unstable behavior. The light in the dark tunnel is Shio as she brings in sugar, spice, and everything nice. \\n\\n\r\nIf you want psychology in this series, you need the characters to be convincing. Thanks to the modern talent of Kana Hanazawa, that is achieved. She\u2019s known for a variety of heroine roles and to play a yandere in this series truly bought out her talent to full. Misaki Kuno is also able to step into the shoes of a child to portray her character\u2019s innocence. The theme songs contain an upbeat mood that contrasts with the tone of the show. It\u2019s very playful and bubbly while the ED theme contains a more melodramatic feeling.\\n\\n\r\nHappy Sugar Life tells the tale of love that isn\u2019t the typical romantic story you\u2019re familiar with. Instead, it crafts psychological horror with a cast of degenerate characters. There are some that you\u2019ll find to be abominations of our society. Yet, this series is far from an abomination. It\u2019s a psychological horror done right with a clear set of intentions at its heart and soul.",

            "content": "Happy Sugar Life is a psychological horror starring Satou Matsuzaka as our main heroine. It is revealed early in the first episode that she lives with Shio Koube, who Satou considers to be her \"special someone\". Satou did horrible things to live with Shio, and as you might have read already on MAL's synopsis, Satou will do everything in her capabilities to protect her life with Shio, her Happy Sugar Life. Of course, Satou and Shio are not the only characters here. This anime is one to watch if you want to see a lot of psychologically scarred characters.\r\nA theme going on in the animeis about 'love' and the characters' different 'love'. The story is centered on Satou and Shio's relationship with what Satou believes is pure love. The atmosphere usually changes back and forth between Satou's sugar life and all the bitterness of the outside world. Scenes showing the sugar part of Satou's life will mostly be when she is alongside Shio. The bitterness is from characters that threaten Satou's status quo. Satou prefers to not interact with anyone else, but that is not possible. She has to work to support her life, keeping facades in school and her workplace. This leads to her feeling bitter when other characters are intrusive with their 'love'. Examples of this are when Satou started getting trouble from the likes of her manager and her teacher early in the show.\\n\\n\r\nHappy Sugar Life handles their characters very well. Most of the important characters are introduced early in the show, leaving time to explore them and for character development. There are only a few characters who feels like 'disposable characters'. Most characters are also screwed up in the head, almost everyone has some trauma or psychological disorder. This leads to interesting interactions between the characters, or rather psychos. With each characters comes different interactions, with Satou taking different approaches to keep them away from her relationship with Shio. Furthermore, every character does get their own bit of spotlight, showing their motives, their past, or how they got traumatized.\\n\\n\r\nThe story relies heavily on mystery and suspense. Feelings of unease can be felt during the calmer parts of the show. Satou's expressions are not always clear, leaving you wondering on what she might do. You are left not knowing most of the truth, and it keeps making you curious about what will happen next. When you thought you know what was going on, the anime revealed a different answer, and you are back in the mystery. Even during the 'sugar' scenes, just not knowing what is brewing without you knowing is enough to keep the suspense going. The music (or lack of) supports the atmosphere really well. All that said, some situations are so weird and absurd, you might feel disgust or get a chuckle out of it.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Happy Sugar Life is an anime filled with mentally scarred characters, with Satou and Shio in the middle bringing these characters inevitably bumping with each other. Happy Sugar Life uses its characters well without freely disposing them. It also does a good job delivering suspense. Scenes switch around 'sugar' and 'bitter' parts, with the suspense still intact. On the bad side, at times, it feels like the anime is just dragging out the mystery, and the situations might seem too unrealistic.",

            "content": "This anime scared the shit out of me like how Mahou Shoujo Site was, but thankfully it didn't try to be as edgy AF, but im my opinion, Happy Sugar Life is at heart a psychological horror yet decent drama-based show that I'm actually quite contented (and secretly excited...?) to see what mysteries and miseries does this series put us through the overall setting.\r\nHappy Sugar Life follows its aforementioned manga adaptation (which is fully caught up at the time of this review), and shows us the \"love\" of a broken high school girl (Matsuzaka Satou) and her victim of a broken yet naive understanding, ShioKoube. The title of the show is very misleading (just like Asobi Asobase, only more darker and sinister), but it creates a good context for all of the characters who are broken and/or blind-sided in many ways:\\n\\n\r\nMatsuzaka Satou, the pink-haired Yandere, voiced by the goddess Hana Kanazawa (and damn does she ever do a great job defining Satou's character). Spoilt out of love in her own family, which consists of her brain-washed of a wreck aunt, Satou has been mislead growing up, and asking about the concoction of love, to which her aunt shows her that love is everything of pleasure and desires, if she so wishes. And to that, her own experience of messing around and sleeping with boys serve as the catalyst of \"Do I really want to keep this love?\", and to that, her own heart is like a sweet, sweet jar, the happiness-filled jar that was once full is shattered into pieces, and in order to retain her love, she'll stop at nothing to make sure that she sees this towards the end.\\n\\n\r\nThe Koube family, of Shio and Asahi. Ah...the family conflict, someone gets drunk and accuses the significant other of upbringing the children in a bad way. Both characters have suffered under the demise of their wrecking ball of a father, so much so that the only link holding them both is their mum, to which her sanity could not be contained further, and Shio was kicked out of the house, abandoned by her mum. It was then and there that Satou found her and their Happy Sugar Life starts from there, maintaining the love jar and filling with sweet memories, while na\u00efve that Satou didn't kidnap nor harm her in the process, and strives to protect Satou in her weakest. The brother however, is kinda of a bad brother, as both him and Shio part ways to help their mum survive, and now he's back to take her home, with the realism that Satou \"kidnapped\" her for her own pleasure. A hidden character always that doesn't stand out, he is left to fend for himself.\\n\\n\r\nSatou's workmate and close friend, Taiyou Mitsuboshi the pedophile and Shouko Hida, the friend who promises of kept secrets and wants the best for everyone. For Taiyou himself, I don't really need to explain his character because it is what it is: his madly-deeply driven forbidden love for children that he's pretty much a psychopath and a lunatic at that, often taken advantage of in precarious situations. Shouko on the other hand, is pretty much a barebones character who often plays the best-close friend troupe, always concerning for others and helping them in need. If you haven't been paying close attention much, she is the ONLY sane character out of everyone, until her demise in Satou's vicious hands calls out her presence to save those still in the trap of trauma.\\n\\n\r\nDon't think for a millisecond that you're watching this show just to shit trash on it, its characters will turn you upside down to the point of misconception and stunning acting.\\n\\n\r\nNewcomer studio Ezo'la's art and animation really was off-putting to say the least, but for the balance between the real world and the various horror scenes that enclosed the vibes from the manga, it was a pretty good adaptation overall. For once, there were a lot of things going for it, such as the art degradation towards the comic feel (such as the static screens of horror) and the psychological aspect which plays a big part into making this series feel like reality that hits us in the face when we least expected it. The unique feel for the new studio just blew my mind at how the staff directorials punch in what is arguably the best part of the show: the unsteady visuals.\\n\\n\r\nThe music is also another area that best explicits the foreshadowing of the series to come. Many scenes with the horror vibes are actually used at the correct moments of storytelling in time, and not just for show. Just like Asobi Asobase (yet again, musically), the OST was a definite surprise for me as both the OP and ED nailed at whatever exposition the series storyline has going for it. Not to mention that the ED presents ReoNa's debut single, and its heart-warming tonality makes it the perfect ending IMO (and one of the best EDs of the season).\\n\\n\r\nHappy Sugar Life, we knew ye, we kinda understand ye. Horror is very subjective, that pertains to your own tastes of how you see it. As for personal takeaway, the real world complications exemplify the need for all of us to have the sense of the \"Happy Sugar Life\" jar in our hearts, even when bogged down by trauma. It's the same with trying to understand someone's life and what they have went through that culminates the core hypocrisy of all men, and this series did that for me.\\n\\n\r\nSo unless you have an affinity of finding out what your Happy Sugar Life is, watch this show to find out (and it's a recommendation too), ONLY if you're a sane person. (And yes, I'm definitely still sane after this).",

Because I only have seen the first episodes, so let's see if the story stays interesting.\r\nThe art is a mixture of bright colors with a gloomy shadow over it.

            "content": "Happy Sugar Life is a tragedy. I mean this in both literary and quality terms. Despite how interestingly and enticingly crafted this tragic tale is, and how effectively some of its presentation is, this show has one fatal flaw: overemphasis. One wouldn\u2019t think that this is so catastrophic, but Happy Sugar Life proves why \u201cshow, don\u2019t tell\u201d is a thing.\r\nThere are two forms of this devastating lingering. The first one is the monologuing. This is what damages Satou as a character and drags this anime down and out beyond belief. Her personality is interesting, almost as if you put a mary sue and a yanderein a blender and watched them eat away at each other in the process of having an overprotective pedo lesbian try to keep her image and ideal life intact. It\u2019s hard to care when the majority of her screen time is spent in her headspace, as she monologues about damn near everything. Regardless of what anyone thinks of this tragic hero on a moral level, it\u2019s easy to see how this can feel grating and unnecessary. These scenes of her expositing her thoughts on any given situation can go on for minutes on end when almost every single time, her expressions alone are enough to tell us next to, if not everything she is thinking and feeling. \\n\\n\r\nShrinking it all down to a sentence or two maximum to clarify something or truly encapsulate a scene for her, and letting the visuals do the rest would have been far more rewarding. It would have truly taken advantage of the imaginatively disturbing directing and presentation, both making Satou a far more interesting lead to follow, and making several scenes to be far more impactful and dramatic. It would have also kept a myriad of scenes from dragging out to more than double the length they needed to convey everything properly. Keep in mind that this applies to several scenes from several characters later on as well. You could cut down entire episodes worth of monologuing and probably improved the pacing dramatically, both in terms of an episode structure and scene-by-scene basis. The worst part of all is that the show understands this to an extent, with some of the most critical and stylistic scenes in the latter half of the show truly showcasing how powerful this approach can be.\\n\\n\r\nThe second devastating, drawn-out form of overemphasis is a more gratuitous, self-indulgent kind. It\u2019s what destroys practically everyone else in this show. It\u2019s no secret that the vast majority of the characters in this show are damaged, mostly reprehensible people. You can show that off while keeping the audience engaged and disturbed in a proper way. This show takes the worst approach possible with this. Whenever a character is established doing something fucked up, we linger on them licking something, drooling, and/or panting after sniffing something for extended periods of time or interacting with their target in some way. At that point, it\u2019s more tiresome than creepy, and more aggravating than repulsive. It\u2019s even worse when the show constantly reminds you of this with small moments and scenes that add nothing and could be cut out entirely. It\u2019s bad enough that the progression of certain characters\u2019 descent into pedophilic or stalker-like madness is utterly nonsensical, but when that becomes their defining trait, and when the show just lingers on about it, it becomes a nightmare to sit through for the worst reasons imaginable. \\n\\n\r\nTo really paint a picture of how bad this can get, a male police officer is sexually assaulted for minutes on end, with several characters watching, and it takes his partner so long to intervene. On top of that, all they do is leave, rather than arrest the perpetrator or do anything for committing a crime of sexual assault on an on-duty police officer. It\u2019s beyond wild how bad the gaps in logic are, and how much this show just wants to linger on the more disturbing elements for its own self-indulgent, narrative and character-damaging purposes. I\u2019m not sure if any of this was the fault of the material, the director/screenwriter, or both.\\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s a pity, really. Outside of all of this, there\u2019s an interesting, enticing tragedy at play, with some truly potent moments, both sweet and sour. The reveals are paced out well and tend to be brutal. The core narrative is theoretically engaging without too many glaring issues in terms of logic or consistency. On the audiovisual side, the visuals by newcomer studio Ez\u03ccla can be incredibly imaginative, even if their background and CGI endeavors are sometimes distracting and needless. The disconcerting feel the directing and imagery go for is a sight to behold. The music is generally good at bolstering emotional scenes with their own melancholic and beautiful tunes. The ED theme -\"SWEET HURT\" by ReoNa- deserves special mention in that regard. If the show just showed more restraint and used its artistic flair to more consistently tell its story properly, I genuinely believe this would have been one of the better shows I\u2019ve seen all year. Alas, the sweet that interested me was a tad too bitter.",

            "content": "This was pretty dreadful. Sure it was creepy you can like that stuff, but unlike decent anime I've watched that do give you chills like Higurashi, this was shock value. Pure shock value. It had no weight to it and it was incredibly boring and plain, besides the scenes where she goes scary yandere, I was SO surprised(sarcasm). You never feared that she was going to get caught, she had nothing to lose besides her precious loli that we all knew she would just end up murdering everyone for. Many of the characters were an eyesore, the art had no special qualities, it was stablebut that was all.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: They characters were SHIT. Ok, so the loli girl(Shio), was alright. She had what looked like a mental disorder which can explain a few of her actions and made me genuinely sad when I saw her being mistreated. And then, we have our MC. Satou. She was incredibly fucked up, which is not a bad thing in general, but all we see is an emotionless husk walking around, unless she's with Shio, or protecting her. I know there can be Villain Protagonists, but I at least want to see her get what she deserves every now and then. She can literally get away with EVERYTHING, because the police in this world don't give a shit. She has no personality, and even though it's supposed to be a don't judge a book by its cover kind of series, when she's happy, she's cardboard. When she's angry, she's copy and paste yandere girl. She never is really approached with a challenge, and when she is, she has to refrain herself from MURDERING PEOPLE as a solution. Her relationship with Shio is a love relationship, but I'm not sure if it's a romantic relationship or platonic which gives me an uncomfortable thought every now and then. The fact that she could be in love with a girl who's acts under 10 is unsettling. Asahi is a generally good guy looking for his sister Shio, but from what I've seen, is probably going to be killed for wanting her in the first place(just saying). And then literally, everyone else has some sort of edgy backstory and poorly written mental disorder as a plot device, so they will go after Shio/Satou, and Satou will have a 'justified' reason to kill them, or look like a total badass beating them up. Satou is actually a bit likable, with her intense love for Shio, how she's willing to work hard day and night to provide for the both of them, that brought a smile to my face.\\n\\n\r\nStory: Ah, where do I begin? There are many questions that never seemed to be answered or given an excuse. This makes the writing seem lazy and boring. Even certain characters are brought up just so that they can get in Satou's way, for example the creepy teacher masochist who wanted to molest her, or a generally good guy who wanted to find Shio, his smaller sister. The police are never fucking useful in this world, they practically only exist when needed, and from what I've heard so far, they're only used once. They seem to used the abused backstory card, as Satou is somehow justified of her behavior because her (Spoiler)  not gonna say their name** taught her a twisted love. Sure this explains her actions but doesnt justify them. I can't say Satou is even on the same page as the world she's in, she gets away with everything and the story doesn't care because it's supposed to send chills down your spine. I had to use the 'anime logic card' because it was so incredibly stupid. Every time our MC is about to kill someone, it's just boom, there dead. We never truly cared about what was happening, because nothing made sense. The concept of kidnapping out of love isn't unique, and is dealt with poorly, because all Satou has to do is to place a lock on the door from the outside, and done! Our blind loli hostage can't escape. No I don't mean the girl is physically blind but just taken advantage over. The story throws happy moments out of nowhere being hooked on the creepy on the inside happy on the outside that it feels really out of character. For example, when she's jealous because Asahi had said vows to Shio, she's goes a little insane, which is acceptable. But then she just goes happy go lucky because it apparently means her love for Shio makes her jealous, and mentally thanks her for that. It didn't evoke any emotion out of me because the story just puts it in my lap and waits for me to go, \"Awwww, cute!\".\\n\\n\r\nArt: The art was ok, the opening was the best example of what was supposed to look like a simple moe theme. But for the rest of the show, the characters look half-baked besides Satou who literally looks like a carbon copy of Yuno Gasai from Mirai Nikki. The backgrounds seemed like any other basic anime, and Satou's apartment has no character in it whatsoever. Even in the place they sleep there is no desk with textbooks to describe that Satou is a student, no toys or anything to convey that Shio is a child. Their apartment has no character, and is plain and an eyesore. There is actually one overview shot of Satou sitting at a table in a room, and I can't even tell what room it is in because there was literally nothing else but Satou, a chair, and a table. It could have been anywhere. When Satou goes crazy however, it has a decent art effect on her eyes which in my opinion, makes her look cool, rather than scary and insane. The art also does a good job portraying their struggle for money, as Shio's meals look just enough to fill her hunger, and are not overly polished. Her character design also do a good job on displaying a small child and an average teenager.\\n\\n\r\nSound: The sound was pretty decent. The songs were average, she being pretty bland, but the OST was actually ok. There's nothing remarkable but there was something.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: I didn't really enjoy it from an analytical standpoint but I did enjoy it when I turn my brain off. Watching Satou nearly murdering people got me excited and seeing the two live happily day to day was heart warming. Unless I looked into it further, I always would see Satou as a cool intelligent schoolgirl who would kick ass. But as soon as I looked deeper, it all went downhill.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: If you don't care about story and character elements, jump right in, enjoy the shock value. But if you've already seen some messed up creepy horror anime that had genuinely scared you, you might have second doubts, this could be just a boring anime with lame action scenes. If you can't turn your brain off, then just find a better show, the characters are hardly enjoyable and the story has lots of giant, gaping plot holes.\\n\\n",

This show tries waay to hard to be one of those \"its not what it appears to be on the surface\" kinda material shows. At first the artwork and character designs drew me in but the amount of pandering to try to seem \"edgy\" and \"dark\" is making me want to quit. Literally every character is deranged in some way or another which makes it infuriating to watch. I'll end up finishing it anyway, but at this point its not for enjoyment. Hopefully some questionsget answered before its over.",

            "content": "All\u2019s fair in love and war. It\u2019s an expression that I\u2019ve heard a million times. It\u2019s so cliche that I kind of just take it for granted. The idea that anything is permissible if you do it for love seems fair enough on the surface. I never really questioned the validity of that cliche until I watched Happy Sugar Life. All\u2019s fair in love and war feels like it should be right, but if I really think about it I start to run into some problems. What sort of actions truly are permissible in the pursuit or defence of love? If two loves are competingwith each other then which one is just? Do the reasons or justifications behind someone\u2019s feelings of love matter or is the love defensible regardless? Happy Sugar Life explores all these questions and it does so while maintaining a high entertainment value. The moral questions present themselves naturally in the show through the interesting and compelling actions of the characters and how they conflict with each other. The artstyle of the show helps to enhance the themes, especially the general feeling of dread that persists throughout. Overall, Happy Sugar Life puts my thoughts and feelings in conflict with each other. While I might think certain actions are universally wrong I end up feeling like they are justified in the specific events of the show because they are done for love.\\n\\n\r\nHappy Sugar Life is about a pink haired psycho bitch (Satou) who abducts an innocent cute little blue haired girl (Shio) and basically uses her as an emotional support animal. On the surface it might seem like Satou and Shio have a shallow relationship but due to their past traumas we can see that isn\u2019t the case. The relationship between Satou and Shio is by far the most emotionally substantive relationship that either one has ever experienced in their lives. Their relationship can accurately be described as \u201clove.\u201d \\n\\n\r\nSatou has spent most of her life up until this point trying to find out what love is. Satou was orphaned as a child and ended up living with her Aunt who is an extreme pleasure seeker. Satou\u2019s Aunt\u2019s concept of love is very twisted and extreme. She pursues love through means of physical pleasure. This has lead to her becoming damaged, both physically and mentally. Satou\u2019s Aunt\u2019s pursuit of pleasure transcends any sort of common sense. She seeks physical love despite any cost, happily accepting beatings from random men. \\n\\n\r\nBecause of Satou\u2019s upbringing she didn\u2019t have a good understanding of love. Satou ended up spending a lot of time engaging in sexual relationships with men however she did not derive pleasure from these relationships. The relationships were very shallow and focused in physical pleasure only, this did not satisfy Satou\u2019s deep rooted emotional needs. Satou tolerated these shallow sexual relationships because they offered her a place to spend the night at a time when she was trying to escape her Aunt\u2019s putrid apartment. Satou was alone in the world and had to use her own wits to survive.\\n\\n\r\nUnlike Satou, Shio could not survive on her own. Shio is an innocent cute young girl who is filled with boundless energy and a childlike optimism that is cheerful and inspiring. Despite all that, she was treated terribly by her mother. Shio\u2019s Mother was heavily abused and the trauma from the abuse lead to her becoming extremely paranoid and eventually hostile towards Shio. She ended up abandoning Shio on the street, running away her responsibilities as a mother, leaving Shio alone to suffer.\\n\\n\r\nOn the night that Shio was abandoned she ended up being found by Satou. Satou took her in. Shio\u2019s presence had a calming effect on Satou. Satou was experiencing a happiness like she never had before. Perhaps she didn\u2019t yet realize that this feeling was love. Satou\u2019s boyfriend at the time had never seen her so emotionally satisfied before. As his extreme jealousy of Shio boiled over, he attempted to strangle her to death. This lead to Satou committing her first murder. \\n\\n\r\nSatou\u2019s first murder was defensive in nature. It wasn\u2019t premeditated, it was simply a spontaneous and necessary action to defend Shio. Unfortunately this murder would lead Satou down an irreversible path, where anything to protect Shio is permitted.\\n\\n\r\nThis is the point that the first episode starts at. Our first introduction of Satou and Shio is of them living alone together in secret. Satou goes to school during the day and works in the evening. She puts on a facade to get through the day. Shio stays home alone in their heavily locked apartment. When Satou returns at the end of the evening she is greeted warmly by Shio and they spend the night together. Satou is shown to be completely obsessed with Shio. Every action she takes is for the purposes of protecting her status quo situation with Shio. When other people threaten to interfere with Satou\u2019s lifestyle, whether intentionally or not, she deals with them decisively. She uses various immoral tactics including deception, blackmail, and even murder. These tactics are relatively successful when dealing with isolated incidents. For example in the early episodes we see Satou successfully quashing love confessions, coercing her boss into actually paying her properly, and turning an attempted rapist into her loyal errand boy. Unfortunately these isolated successes don\u2019t prepare her for what\u2019s coming next; a focused effort from Shio\u2019s brother (Asahi) to find Shio.\\n\\n\r\nAsahi\u2019s persistent search for Shio serves as Satou\u2019s biggest threat. From Asahi\u2019s perspective, Shio is a missing child. He searches tirelessly for her. He has a weak disposition and is often ignored, and even beaten, when trying to pass out flyers. Asahi presents the major moral conflict of the show. Is Satou right to be holding the custody of Shio? Through Asahi we see that there are people who care about Shio. It becomes clear that Satou is not in the right for hiding Shio from the rest of the world. Although Satou\u2019s intentions to protect Shio might be good they are having unintended consequences.\\n\\n\r\nShio in not mentally stable. While Satou is out and about all day, Shio stays alone in their apartment. Shio is shown to have an unclear memory, distorted due to the trauma she faced. Shio is shown drawing an effigy of her mother on a closet wall despite repressing memories of her. Shio\u2019s mental instability is heightened when she is alone. \\n\\n\r\nShio\u2019s situation touches on some moral conflicts. Shio is clearly better off with Satou than she was with her mother. Satou provides a motherly presence for Shio that her actual mother did not. However Satou isn\u2019t capable of healing all of Shio\u2019s wounds, and there are even some that she doesn\u2019t know about. Is Shio truly better off being with Satou? Would Shio be better off with her brother or some other caring guardian? Is Satou\u2019s protection of Shio a selfless act to protect Shio or a selfish act to satisfy her own needs and desires? These aren\u2019t easy questions to answer and that\u2019s part of what makes them so compelling.\\n\\n\r\nThe moral conflicts of Happy Sugar Life are very interesting and they make me want to think. However, thoughtful and difficult moral questions do not make an anime good by themselves. The art of Happy Sugar Life add a lot to the emotional element of the show. Below, I will discuss some of my favourite motifs and symbols that forced me to feel.\\n\\n\r\nOne of the main visual motifs and symbols is the jar full of candy. This jar is shown in varying states. Sometimes the jar is full of candy and the characters eat from it. Sometimes the jar is spilled and the candy is absent. The symbolism here is obvious but powerful. The candy represents the positive emotions associated with the concept of a \u201cHappy Sugar Life.\u201d The jar represents the capacity to maintain these positive emotions. It\u2019s important to note that the jar is made of fragile glass. The characters need to put in a concerted effort to maintain the wholeness of their jar. Even if the jar is completely empty and devoid of candy the presence of the jar itself is evidence that the capacity for a \u201cHappy Sugar Life\u201d still remains. Satou has to work to make sure her jar remains intact. She doesn\u2019t want to end up like her Aunt, whose jar is described as being broken, which can help explain her bizarre behaviour and general insanity.\\n\\n\r\nEvery night Shio and Satou perform a wedding ceremony. Shio drapes a white bed sheet over Satou\u2019s head as a veil and they recite matrimonial vows. This nightly ritual serves not only as an affirmation of their love for each other but also as an act of purification for Satou, who uses morally questionable tactics to maintain her status quo relationship with Shio on a daily basis.\\n\\n\r\nDuring a particularly brutal and emotional scene, Satou ends up with scars on the back of her hand. The scars are left as the last attempted resistance of one of Satou\u2019s murder victims. The scars on Satou\u2019s hands serve as a reminder to Satou of the lengths that she has gone to to preserve her secret relationship with Shio. They are simultaneously a reminder of her regrets and of her conviction. The scars reminded me of the \u201cdamned spot\u201d that stains the hands of Lady Macbeth. After feeling guilt and regret about her decision to commit murder, Lady Macbeth hallucinates a blood stain on her hands. She cries \u201cOut, damned spot! Out, I say!\u201d as she frantically tries and fails to wash the imaginary blood from her hands. Satou does not react to her hand\u2019s scars in same way as Lady Macbeth but the similarity between the two remains. They both have an uncleanable permanent stain on their hands. One that appeared there due to their own decisions and actions. One that will haunt them for the rest of their lives.\\n\\n\r\nThroughout the entire show the art is underscored by this unsettling and horrifying theme of contrast. When Satou and Shio are alone together the colours are bright and vivid. The presentation seems happy and carefree similar to something from a cute girls slice of life anime. But unlike those cute girls shows, the happy artstyle here is chilling due to the stark contrast with the rest of the show. The rest of the show has a very drab artstyle which is a lot more in line with the darker and more morbid themes of the show. This contrast between happy and carefree with drab and morbid is what makes the show horrifying for me. This contrast makes everything unsettling. The parts that are happy and carefree feel like they are on an island, surrounded by violent waves of morbidity. The happy parts feel like they don\u2019t belong and they feel like they could be swallowed up by the ocean of morbidity at any time. The characters act in ways that corroborate this theme which helps to enhance its effect. Satou is cold and calculating when she is in the outside world but when she is alone in her apartment with Shio she is warm and loving and kind. A lot of Satou\u2019s actions can be viewed as her protecting Shio from the cruel outside world.\\n\\n\r\nOverall I think the art direction does a great job at complimenting the themes of the story. The symbols and motifs are quite potent and the general tone and style of the art helps accentuate dark themes and makes dramatic moments more impactful. The actual themes themselves delve into deep moral questions. The moral questions are not forced down the audience\u2019s throat but rather they present themselves naturally through the interesting and compelling actions of the characters and the conflicts they have with each other.\\n\\n\r\nHappy Sugar Life had an interesting effect on me. While individual actions by Satou are pretty clearly objectively reprehensible I still end up with this feeling like she isn\u2019t wrong. This conflict between my thoughts and my feelings is at the core of why I like this show. This show took a character who does bad things for an arguably unjustifiable motive and it made me like her. Satou is damaged and flawed and I really think that I shouldn\u2019t support her but I can\u2019t help it. Her fight just feels right to me because she is fighting for love. So while \u201call\u2019s fair in love and war\u201d can be picked apart with logical arguments, it still just feels right. Maybe not everything is fair in the pursuit or defence of love but in Satou\u2019s case I feel like she is good. And if I\u2019ve learned anything from this show, it\u2019s that good things are worth fighting for.",

Don't listen to all the \" This Anime is for edgy 12 year olds\" etc... spam. They are obviously the immature ones (with awful taste I might add...). This Anime is a perfect blend of Mystery/Suspense/Horror with warm cute shoujo.

This show has the cuteness of slice of life and moe anime, mixed and executed perfectly with dark/mystery and Horror. It'll give you the chills a badass anime with amazing Mikasa eyes does but also give you the warm sweet sugar feeling that a slice of life does. HIGHLY RECOMMEND! \\n\\n\r\nWhat this anime does phenomenally:\\n\r\n- Characters and their psych\\n\r\n-Tension /Atmosphere \\n\r\n-Unique loveable Art style\\n\r\n-Mystery that is especially dark\\n\r\n- Satou is Yandere Queen!

            "content": "Happy Sugar Life is a show where all the human beings are sick and suffer more than anyone else in the city. I consider the story a bit exaggerated. Also, I cannot understand how some can highly praise the series after criticizing Eromanga sensei, Citrus, School Days to name some.\r\nFor example, several spectators cannot stand Citrus' assault. However, they can accept a teenager that has committed murder and locks a young girl of no more 6 \u2013 8 years old in an apartment. They accept many other cases of abuse and assault portrayed in this series. Additionally, the series introduces the denigrations of societybut in a way where almost all the cast is ill and pervert under the flag \u201cthat is love.\u201d I forgot the pedophilia references but it is not a taboo in this anime in comparison with other series. The audience accepts it because the series has the psychological, horror and shounen tag. In my case, I only have a word for this, incoherence. In this fantastic world, all the antisocials, ill persons, demons, converged. I think the author forgot recreating some demonic ritual to add more emotion to the plot. \\n\\n\r\nThe plot 4/10\\n\\n\r\nThe plot is very easy to follow and too fantastic to digest it. We have a little girl called Shio, who is the center of all the story. She has a rough past but irradiates the purity of a young person free of any illness of the evil world, and she is a beacon of hope. One day a teenager, Satou, finds her and magically fallen in love with her (it is called a psychological twist\u2026no, it is called incoherence). However, Satou that felt empty now is a complete person and will do everything in her hand to be with her beloved, but the deprivations of the world already contaminated her mind, and Satou\u2019s actions are total madness and too fantastic to be accepted. The rest of the story is a rollercoaster where the author adds more and more suffering to entertain the audience and several bitten it. Ironically as it looks, in this unreal story, the little girl knows and understands the meaning of love more than the rest of the cast, and I consider it an interesting outcome. For me, the plot fluctuates from average to acceptable with some minor high peaks at the end. Also, the lack of reality in a psychological narrative is a huge mistake because some will interpret the plot as absurd and comical. One of the most important factors in horror and psychological thrill is the reality contrasted with the unreality, but this show is unreality contrasted with unreality the result is a series with some useless scenes where the characters are wasted and distorts the plot development. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters 5/10\\n\\n\r\nAlmost all the characters are generic. Yes, the face and the madness is interesting, but almost ALL the characters are the same. They are ill silhouettes with a different perversion or suffering. Only two of them have a credible background the rest are a pit of emotional sickness. One positive point is how the author maintained Shio\u2019s personality. She is the most mature character in a nest of failed characters (Mitsuboshi) and wasted ones (spoiler). Also, she is the character that has a healthy progression, but for her age, some can think that it is a sci-fi achievement.  On the other hand, the relation between Shio and Satou gives the impression of a relationship between a mother and a child, but in the last episodes, the relationship has a significant evolution that could have appeared early in the middle of the story.\\n\\n\r\nThe art and the sound 7/10\\n\\n\r\nThe series creates a normal contrast between a colorful world and the pervert and sick one. However, that variation is basic in any horror and psychological film or series. Also, there is good camera management. Sadly, some parts of the art are rough and are not finished correctly. Some angles are very ugly and with wrong proportions.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound and the OST are normal. The OP is a mix of soft and hard sounds to create the sensation between good and mad. \\n\\n\r\nThe verdict is very simple; you should skip this show if you cannot handle an inconsistent plot, pedophilia, and irrealistic horror treatment because you could end complaining of the outcome. \\n\\n\\n\r\nExtra information\\n\r\nSeason rank 337 (246 points) in Japan\\n",

            "content": "Happy Sugar Life (HSL) is a psychological horror about normal people being pushed to their limits. Throughout this show, contrasts are stressed and found in every way possible as I will be discussing throughout this review.\r\nArt 8/10: One of HSL's best attributes.\r\nStudio Ez\u03ccla has opted for a pretty basic art style for this Anime. The surroundings or backgrounds are simple, but never feels fake or takes away from the original style, so no points deducted from that. This is the best example of where you can see contrasts being used. In happy or cheerful scenes, the colors used are extremely bright and sparkly. The colorscale also shifts more to red to give that \"alive\" and \"warm\" feeling. And on certain scenes the art turns extremely dark. The entire scene gets washed in a blue like hue to give of this \"dead\" and \"cold\" feeling. HSL also uses the \"eyes are the windows to the soul\" saying to its fullest. In some scenes the eyes of the characters change drastically to reflect their inner struggles. Subtle things like the eyes giving of a burning sensation when the characters are engulfed in in anger is a nice touch and is sometimes pretty hard to see unless you look carefully.\\n\r\nThere is almost never really on-screen violence in the Anime. The Anime uses visual hints as well accompanying sound effects to make you visualize those scenes for yourself. Which is what makes this Anime a truly psychological Anime. \\n\\n\r\nSound 8/10: The Opening explores this contrasts theme a bit more. The OP begins with a innocent voice and a happy sounding tone. The Opening then switches to a more deep tone and the singer (Akari Nanawo) sings in a more intimidating tone. \\n\r\nThe Ending has an overall calm tone to help with pressure release and the end of the episode.\\n\r\nThe OST is subtle but effective, builds tension when it must and sets the overall tone for the scene when needed. In some stages the lack of an OST is also used to give a false sense of security to the viewer before taking you by surprise.\\n\r\nThe special insert song used in its respective episode was used to support the visual metaphor of the arc as well as support the feelings of the character the arc focuses on.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters 9/10: The characters are all introduces as normal people. On the surface they all look trustworthy. All the characters are in respectable positions and are in some cases even idolized, but then their insanity meter gets turned up to 11 if they are pushed overboard. Contrasts are once again used here, down to the names of our two main characters, Satou (sugar) and Shio (salt). On the topic of names. The names of the characters all have a meaning to what they provided or represents in the Anime. If you are done watching the Anime I would recommend searching the meaning of their names. The characters feel real in the sense they all have the inner struggles that we as humans are fighting everyday. The only part where this subtracts from realism is the fact that so many characters snap around the main character.\\n\\n\r\nStory 9/10: The story is pretty dark. Themes are explored which is not really that common in some Anime. Which once again brings it back to the contrasts. All of the characters are looking for their \"Happy Sugar Life.\" Yet they don't see that by searching for this happiness they keep on leaving despair and once they find this \u201cideal\u201d life, they are confused as to why they are not happy. The story intentionally makes you empathize with the main character. Which I would say is hard to do as if you take the character out and place them in the real world, this member would be hated. The story does a great job in making you root and care for a really repulsive being. The pacing is not something to complain about. Not too fast and not too slow. The ending was a bit abrupt and for many was a bit distasteful.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 10/10: Why I liked it: The use of all the above discussed means to tell a pretty dark story was something I enjoyed a lot. The overall usage of contrasts was also something that I liked a lot. Studio Ez\u03ccla did a pretty fine job in their first Anime and I am looking forward to more of their word if they are to pursue more titles in the future. I have since then bought the Manga for this and the adaptation done by the Studio was pretty good. The ending was also fully original as the Manga stopped around episode 11.\\n\\n\r\nWhy You might not like it:\\n\r\nThe story is not a Happy Sugar Life. It is a psychological horror that keeps you asking \"Is this really OK?\", \"Are we the baddies?\" and \"Why am I rooting for this person?\" Even though there is never really that much on-screen violence. The Anime keep hinting towards what happened and the means in which this violence occurred. The ending was for some a bit distasteful. The story is about a relationship between a child and a high-school student. I think those are the main reasons you would not like this Anime. I would also not recommend this as a first Anime for someone just starting out, unless they like Horror or similar shows to this.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 9/10: I was really impressed by this Anime. With a totally new Studio and a director which has only directed a few Anime in the past, my expectations for HSL was pretty low. But as the story progressed I could see the effort the director and the animators put in to make this first project a huge success in my opinion.",

My first reaction is.\r\nYea..no..yea..no..yeaaa!\r\nHappy sugar life is the new addition this season that currently have only 6 episode released as of this moment. And I already watched them all.\r\nThe main character Matsuzaka Satou, voiced by Hanazawa, Kana is a freshman highschooler that works at a cafe to finance her life with Shio Koube a 4 year old child(approx).\r\nStory revolves how she maintains a nice appearance with people around her at school and work until her relationship with Shio Koube gets challenged. Andyeah shit will hit the fan.\\n\\n\r\nWhat would a psycho do out of pure love? Every scene would appear to be predictable but the very intricate execution of the feelings of the character and how it's drawn and presented makes it feel really unique and stimulating. And the moments of what she called happy sugar life brings out a different aura on the scenes that makes it refreshing.\\n\\n\r\nThe darkness of the plot will keep you glued in anxiety hoping that everything would work out but obviously wouldn't. And the kind of questions that arouses every episode will keep me hanging and waiting for more to come.\\n\\n\r\nOverall this is a very unique genre and obviously not for everyone. But if you enjoy dark plots with a twist of eye gouging and pedo kissing then this is for you.\\n\\n\r\nThe only problem I have is that it feels like everyone here has a mental disorder but yeah I still enjoyed the show.",

            "content": "Too often people confuse perversion and degeneracy with a demarcation of intrigue. This anime in particular deals with plenty of themes that stray from the path of God including homosexuality, killing, affairs, pedophilia, probably rape, but so what? In the end it doesn't make any sense. \r\nIf I had to guess the train molestor manga artist who came  up with this story was trying to convey the idea that people are all fucked up by writing in characters who lead somewhat normal lives with an intense perverted quirk about them, like BnH for pedophiles. I don't think it works, their backstories aren't fleshed outenough to derive a definitive conclusion at this point, but from what I've seen up to episode 5 is that their deviancy doesn't come from strong enough of a place. \\n\\n\r\nThe formula thus far has been to introduce another freak in each episode and you have a too many cooks in the kitchen situation that could be seen as a interesting and interwoven plot but none of that matters because from the set up you can already see the ending. The mystery box fails to contain its self and the plot is tracked on a cliched line where all the twists were noticed from the end of the first episode. \\n\\n\r\nAlso there is no real suspense each episode follows the same basic punches, you get a cliff hanger moment that gets resolved with no consequences, then the \"sweet\" portion, then they introduce another degenerate, then there is the \"bitter\" portion which ends with a cliff hanger that gets resolved immediately in the next episode. \\n\\n\r\nAnytime there is momentum it gets immediately torn away and you get 15 minutes of boring daily shit that has no purpose seemingly, all the resolutions are nonsensical like the author didn't think of them before introducing the problem and just needed to submit some shit before the deadline. I guess I'm just trudging along at this point because the original premise was interesting but this anime actually just sucks.\\n\\n\\n\r\n4/10\\n",

            "content": "TL;DR: Built on an unrealistic setting, but turns out pretty well \r\nPeople usually have different perspectives on a subject whether this is right or wrong, good or bad? In Happy Sugar Life, this subject of matter is greatly reflected, whether in the anime community or inside the story.Generally speaking, people think this anime is trying to hard to be edgy.However,this anime isn't a straight edgy anime, which gives you a lot of death or violent scenes. This anime is kinda dark in another way around on the characters conflicts and the atmosphere, which is better than most dark anime in my opinion.\r\n+Great character interactions\r\n+Descriptive characterstories\\n\r\n+Interesting story followed by mysteries\\n\r\n+The atmosphere is kinda well-built\\n\\n\r\n-Slow paced\\n\r\n-the plot is built on an unrealistic setting\\n\\n\r\nTo begin with, this story is built on an unrealistic setting, which may bother someone around. Like \"Satou love a little girl called Shio and Satou's aunt is sick\", but let me tell you, this anime is intended to be like this because it's supposed to be a dark anime and like I mentioned just now, this anime is better than most dark anime, because Happy Sugar Life isn't built on death scenes. If you are sick with dark anime,which gives you violent scenes directly. This is an anime for you, so why would Happy Sugar Life being called as a dark anime? This is because the atmosphere is built on characters solely. The relationship built up is based on some wrong perspectives or past events. The reason why Satou like Shio and they love each other is mainly because of their tragic stories and they found their own love, although in general public we think they're definitely wrong, but I think this is what the writer want to reflect on. This anime doesn't need many violent scenes, as it's already more than enough.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters' stories are presented pretty perfectly, it explains well on their tragic events about their childhood and why would the main characters conclude with this kind of relationship from the scratch till the ending. Including the side characters, they all have their own aims and thoughts, which lately on resulting in large conflicts and it's pretty amazing. The inner feelings of the characters are done really well, like they asked themselves whether this kind of action is right or not. It's pretty interesting. For those who hate dark twisting anime in general, they wouldn't appreciate this anime in this kind of way, as they already dislike the setting in general, so you should consider on your preference whether you would accept this kind of storytelling or not.\\n\\n\r\nThe only issue I have in this anime is it's kinda slow-paced, as it solely focus on the characters, the plot doesn't really move, it can be the whole episode talking about characters' inner feelings and past events, while the present events don't really move a lot, which someone may feel bored occasionally for people who are looking for thrilling events, but it doesn't affect much to the storytelling, as I generally enjoy what I have watched from Happy Sugar Life.\\n\\n\r\nIn short, Happy Sugar Life isn't a typical dark anime, it's a dark anime built on characters relationships, what this anime is lacking of is the pace control, which I think personally this anime could insert more story events, but if thinking from the characters aspect, this anime has already done more than enough. The journey is enjoyable and interesting.\\n\\n\r\nI think the animation is done pretty great, it fits the dark elements pretty well with gloomy textures and shadowing, but the character designs look kinda identical, same eyes drawings, similar face shapes, maybe it's because of the authors' style preferences, but personally I think they could make it a little bit different, so that each character looks more unique. The sound effects are done pretty good, many background music and sound effects are used.Though, I think they could insert more throughout the scenes and events.The op and ed gives me the feeling of the dark atmosphere,which are pretty well-themed. Voice actors are pretty awesome too, Hanazawa Kana is in this anime voicing as Satou, which anime fans can't miss this out.\\n\\n\r\nIf you are sick of the ordinary dark anime, this is a refreshing option to you, but if you dislike dark anime in general, you shouldn't consider this anime, because this anime is built on an unrealistic setting that you may bother with. Whether you agree with my points or not, it's up to you, but I just want to tell you that this anime is great in my opinion, that's all.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 8/10 (A)\\n\r\nAnimation: 8/10 (A)\\n\r\nSound: 8.5/10 (A+)\\n\r\nCharacters: 9/10 (S)\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8/10 (A)\\n\r\nOverall: 8.3/10 (A)",

            "content": "No one in the world is an absolute saint or perfect, there are some sides to people you just don't know...\r\nHappy Sugar Life looks one such person wanting as much sweet happiness but her \"methods\" and \"ideals\" are not exactly right.\r\nSatou Matsuzaka voiced by Kana Hanazawa is that person when she found Shio Koube voiced by Misaki Kuno and the key word here being \"FOUND\". See Satou is someone who has a corrupted view on what love is as she never knew what love is and her experiencing love in the real world had been fruitless to say the least until she found that happiness,that sugar that fills her jar that being Shio and she'll do ANYTHING to keep her secret life, secret from everyone. The thing the majority of the cast have a screw loose, deriving from their desires in some of the more extreme ways, such as Daichi Mitaumekawa voiced by Kaito Ishikawa, a womanizer, even though he's married and has children but he wants that \"thrill\" of not getting caught and the pleasure of it all which his drives lustful desires, Taiyou Mitsuboshi is also one though not at first, wanting to be pure through Shio due to his extreme phobia of older woman and like Satou will do anything to see Shio. \\n\\n\r\nIf Happy Sugar Life is telling anything is looking into society and how it expects everyone to be \"normal\" but sometimes people wants to break away from that conformity and find their own \"happiness\" their own way and sure some of these characters are unhinged to the point of absurdity but the thing is, LA thinks some of these cases of madness some of these characters go through have some level of relatability towards them especially looking at Satou's views on happiness and love (of course not her...killy killy side).\\n\\n\r\nHappy Sugar Life at a first glance looks like something you'd stay far away from it's premise especially with Satou and Shio's relationship but diving deeper into Satou's mindset as well as what it's other unhinged minor characters brings us to the table, Happy Sugar Life is more or less telling of what it takes to gain your happiness and what the lengths people will do to keep that \"happiness\" from disappearing. Yeah and the thing is if you think Shio is all pure due to her being a kid...well think again, by the end of the anime, LA thought that they SHOULD be together considering how fucked up both of them were, almost like society itself has pushed them to be together and all the more better for that in LA's opinion. The only two characters LA thought had some semblance of normalcy were Shouko Hida voiced by Aya Suzaki, Satou's friend and colleague at work as well as Asahi Koube voiced by Yumiri Hanamori, Shio's older brother who's looking for her, but the only one to succumb and get batshit insane became Asahi, almost becoming his own worst nightmare as to what HE was trying to achieve in order to do it.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation done by Ezo'la was actually pretty good, from the character designs to the typical background work, but where Ezo'la's animation shines is in it's psychological take on Satou and Shio's mindset and how they visualize as it gets into some very creepy and psychologically damaging visuals and considering the viewpoint and narrative focus is mainly on Satou, the animation work done to visualize her psyche was amazingly done well, be it the symbolism of her \"sweets jar\" or how her psyche gets more and more corrupted as Satou does increasingly irredeemable things is telling of how the good animation is on that front. Ezo'la really outdid themselves really.\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of voice acting, well we have LOTS of playing against the type roles, from the first one LA can think of being Yumiri Hanamori crossdressing role as Asahi Koube to Aya Suzaki as Shouko in a fairly laid back role (where she was usually typecasted into a genki role). MVP's easily goes to Kana Hanazawa as she easily holds this anime from her cutezy moe vocals and instantly change to a menacing, bloodlustful murderer the next, Misaki Kuno was amazing as well, in doing sure, some of her typical typecasted roles, but this time as an unhinged and psychologically damaged little girl that is more than she seems, as considering she had the same amount of screentime as Kana Hanazawa, Miskai Kuno had some great chemistry with Kana in the process, lastly would be Yumiri Hanamori, no not only because of her crossdressing roles but how much of a \"playing against the type\" role she played as Asahi, both appearance AND personality wise as to how he was near the end of the anime, how she HAMMED it up to acceptable levels. Happy Sugar Life really casted some great voice actors into Happy Sugar Life and really got them out of their comfort zone (well maybe except Kana Hanazawa) and it bloody shows through it's entire cast!\\n\\n\r\nHappy Sugar Life is an invariably deep look into \"happiness\" to the most extreme degree and how people will do to get it. Satou and Shio's relationship is the focal point of this entire anime and the relationship itself is point of contention to Satou and Shio both as characters, Satou for her corrupted views on happiness and her will and devotion to get it no matter to the point of murder, Shio with her family backstory and how she got to where she was and sure at first being oblivious to what is going on, but soon showing that not even Shio isn't as pure as she is though not of her own volition as it shows that even society can poison the most purest people. But nonetheless Happy Sugar Life's view on society of how people thinking everyone is pure is an outright lie, that people deep down have corruption hidden in them and sure Happy Sugar Life shows this to the extreme but Happy Sugar Life' social commentary of this is nothing but impactful at large when concerning Satou and Shio's relationship and how society shuns their happiness, be it for not \"being normal and conform\" or individuals wanting to steal their happiness away. Really LA was expecting much more of a gorefest from Happy Sugar Life, but LA got more of a psychological dive into a mind of person who wants nothing more than happiness in ANY ways possible to get it and by all means Happy Sugar Life delivered it with conviction and great execution (no pun intended) to display it, Happy Sugar Life was crazy, psychotic and psychologically relatable hell of a ride and LA loved every moment of it...\\n\\n\r\nLA's jar feels empty now since Happy Sugar Life finished..LA needs more sweets...",

            "content": "Where do I even start. (I will be posting some spoilers throughout so keep that in mind if you read on.)\r\nHappy Sugar Life was an anime of the 2018 Summer Season that caught my attention in the first couple of episodes. It was something that gave me almost School Days like vibes with the way it presented itself. This isn't necessarily a bad thing as I am one of the fans of how that series portrayed itself as almost a deconstruction of the harem genre.\r\nThis however, crumbled into a real mess as the show progressed and I put it on the back burner as Iwasn't really enthralled to watch the series. The first couple of episodes were pretty good and set an initial tone to the show which I actually enjoyed. Seeing Satou and her \"Yandere\" moments early on were some of the interesting moments of the show.\\n\\n\r\nI'll section this into categories from here.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 3/10\\n\\n\r\nAs I said, the initial couple of episodes were actually pretty decent and set a dark tone without going overboard on the whole creepy side. As the show continued it became a series with very little substance. If I had to name it, you could almost call it Stockholm Syndrome the anime. Shio is essentially under house arrest by Satou and locked away from the outside world all day until she comes home. She is so naive that she doesn't seem to notice anything wrong with this situation for a good long time. Just when you think she is going to rebel against Satou because of this, she then reverts and accepts everything, even the fact that Satou has killed someone in the apartment while she was there. The best character and the main source of reason was easily Shoko who provides moments of normalcy throughout the plot. However when she is killed off for what almost feels like shock value after triggering so many death flags, the story becomes damn near ridiculous. The finale was honestly something I was looking forward to as I was genuinely hoping for Satou to truly suffer for the pain and anguish she had caused the rest of the cast. Instead she got hit once and was able to die the happiest she has ever been. At least School Days has a satisfying conclusion in comparison and he got what he deserved. Satou did far worse than Makoto ever did and she got so much more leniency. The final scene with Shio was genuinely creepy and it feels like Satou had managed to perform one last despicable act in screwing up someone else's concept of love to the point where it will probably hurt others as she did herself.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 4/10\\n\\n\r\nThe art was fairly bland and certainly nothing special. The expressions were pretty good but outside of that there was nothing of particular note. I was watching it on stream and the scenes with black and white scrawlings over the screen played hell with the buffering. I understand why they were there but they felt lazy. Add to the fact that most of the anime was still frames, it made it feel half-assed and lazy. Almost like they were hoping the shock value of the plot would cover up any discrepancies.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 4/10\\n\\n\r\nThere were no stand out moments in the soundtrack. The OP and ED were fine but certainly nothing special. Certainly not on my download list or anything like that.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 4/10\\n\\n\r\nThis is probably the main point of contention as this was the focus of the anime all in. Character traits were taken to extreme levels to the point of being totally unbelievable.\\n\r\nSatou couldn't find love until she kidnapped an elementary school loli who just happened to smile nicely and hold her hand. \\n\r\nShio is honestly hard to make heads nor tails of. She was essentially Satou's prisoner for weeks/months and eventually rejected everyone else just because Satou \"loved\" her. Watching her turn against her brother in the final episode was honestly rage inducing.\\n\r\nTaiyou was downright creepy and as much as I find lolis cute, this guy was one step off plucking a child off a playground just to sniff her hair. It was distressful to watch and his fate was one I didn't mind as it honestly served him right.\\n\r\nShoko as I said was the main saving grace of the show and kept some semblance of common sense throughout the characters during any time she was on screen. Her interactions with Asahi were honestly the highlight of the show and I won't deny there had to have been a ship out there for them among the fanbase.   \\n\r\nAsahi was the real tragedy of this whole series. He spends his life trying to reunite his family and goes from getting the crap beat out of him by random guys he meets to being rejected by his sister after finally finding her. I genuinely felt for him as the plot was so against him for the whole show.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 5/10\\n\\n\r\nIt was fun, in a cringy way, the first couple of episodes were nice and interesting to watch, however as the show progressed I found it harder and harder to enjoy as things kept getting more screwed up. Seeing another \"fingernail\" scene reminiscent of Higurashi was absolutely horrifying for me and I found it very difficult to maintain my focus on the show for the remainder of that episode. I would have enjoyed it more had the series had a satisfying payoff but sadly it didn't deliver.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 4/10\\n\\n\r\nSo yeah we got a show with rage inducing moments like School Days, however this doesn't have nearly as memorable an ending as the former and will no doubt fall into obscurity like a lot other \"horror\" anime. It's a shame too as it had potential at the start.",

But as the saying goes, \u201cone man\u2019s trash is another man\u2019s treasure\u201d, and it looks like I\u2019ve found mytreasure in the trash that is Happy Sugar Life.  \\n\\n\r\nLet me be clear that this exact brand of trash was thrown aside just so a degenerate like myself could come and fish it out of the gutter. If you\u2019re not messed up in the same exact ways that I am then you should stay away from this shitshow, so I\u2019ll just cut to the chase. If you don\u2019t like yuri romance, age-gap romance, or cute girls and lolis, then take your leave. This show is abjectly terrible, so just save yourself while you still can. If you DO like that kind of thing, then let\u2019s get into this shit. \\n\\n\r\nHappy Sugar Life is in the \u201chorror comedy\u201d genre of anime that are technically horror thrillers, but that are so bad that they just become funny. Everyone and everything is comically over-the-top edgy for no reason, there\u2019s murder, rape, extramarital affairs, any overused bullet point on the edge checklist gets checked. Everything looks like shit, the animation is god-awful, the character designs are beyond basic, the OST is either boring or actively unfitting, the cinematography is almost exclusively flat-panning shots with 60% of every episode being still frames, and I could honestly keep going because this is a bottom of the barrel production from a nobody studio and staff that looks and runs terrifically bad.  \\n\\n\r\nThat said, the main character is a cute yandere girl with pink hair, buns, and is somehow voiced by Kana Hanazawa, who is in love with a literal elementary school loli with whom she shares a home, bath, and bed. I am fucking sold; This show is perfect. Watching this week by week was hysterical. The show is worst of the worst, but we all got to be reminded that there is a real show, that is actually being made in real life, that features a yuri age-gap romance about a psychotic sex-craved schoolgirl who murders and blackmails anyone who threatens to interrupt her life living with a loli that she literally kidnaped and locked in her apartment. I don\u2019t need to elaborate on the concept because only one single thing of note happened throughout the entire show, and I don\u2019t think that just because there\u2019s a decent five minute scene at the end of episode nine you should go and watch the show, because the remaining two hundred and fifty nine minutes were pure garbage. Any mature person that happens to come across this review can see that this show is nothing but mindless self indulgence, so if it sounds like something you can indulge in like I did, give it a watch. \\n\\n\r\nThat\u2019s it. Done. Ten out of ten, would watch again. \\n\\n\r\nThank you for reading. (I know my other reviews are more serious than this, but this show was just far too much for me XD.)",

            "content": "THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS\r\nMahou Shoujo Site was a fun series from last season. It went so overboard and above what is acceptable that it became nothing less than great series to watch, and in the mean time, managed to offend lots of people -- which is always a plus. I expected the same from Happy Sugar Life, and while it hasn't been exactly as over the top nor has it managed to make people lose their self-control in similar fashion, it did deliver.\r\nOur story focuses around two characters: Satou Matsuzaka, a psychotic lesbian pedophile, voiced by Hanawaza Kana (Hype, ikr). And this assumably 4-5 years-oldchild. Satou used to be into guys and also didn't suffer from several different mental illnesses back then. However, now she is really into this 4-5 years-old girl with whom she lives with (and whom she kidnapped), and they together form this supposedly pure and innocent lesbian romance. Real haato waamingu stuff. \\n\\n\r\nHowever, there is more to life than living in a relationship with a 4 years-old child. At day time, Satou is a working-class citizen, doing real normo shit. In this series universe, normo shit includes reverse-raping men, bullying co-workers, threatening people with murder and torture and of course, serving customers in a restaurant. I know, pretty sick stuff, yuck!\\n\\n\r\nThe series values the comfy and aesthetic side of life -- with what I identify personally pretty hard with. My favorite scenes include stuff like Satou decorating the house. Who needs paint and a brush, lol only nobs use such things. Machete and a living person, do some well timed choppity chops and oh my, the walls look like new. Such a pretty look to it. Definitely a real home feel right there. I have heard the saying \"paint the mirrors black\" but I guess \"chop the walls red\" isn't too bad either. \\n\\n\r\nThe OST consist of nothing but fantastic decisions. Practically these are songs that sound a lot like any random piece from Youtube audio library which people can use for free in their videos. Practically any of the songs could be used by a random content creator who makes guides on how to change a light bulb to your microwave. Imaging this has only added to the experience.\\n\\n\r\nAs a conclusion, this is not a series I would recommend to just anyone.Those who have the tendency of finding beauty from stories that were inspired by madness, will have significant chances of liking Happy Sugar Life there were other will only experience bitterness. heh pun\\n",

            "content": "It\u2019s only stupid if it doesn\u2019t work.\r\nNowadays, the shows I fight to defend are highly misunderstood because their appeal is too specific, causing the general audience to flaunt their standards around like they\u2019re supposed to mean anything.  Past examples include Mahou Shoujo Site, Jashin-chan Dropkick and Hand Shakers.  Yet, Happy Sugar Life is a different sort of\u2026 thing, whose plot setup is about as logically sound as riding a lawnmower during a hurricane, seemingly leaving not but a select, niche appeal for the sickos like me.\r\nA high school girl is basically holding a little girl hostage in a populated apartment complex; she hidesthis among her normal daily life of going to school and working part-time jobs.  You know, like all teenagers do.  If this is your first time reading the synopsis, then you\u2019re probably asking a lot of questions like \u201cHuh?\u201d or \u201cWhat?\u201d  because the basic rules and structure of society suggest that this shouldn\u2019t even be possible.  And for me, knowing that much is what made this story interesting--HOW these characters are living such lives, and what will happen when it inevitably shatters.  Because there\u2019s just no way it won\u2019t--and the very first scene of the anime suggests that it very much will. \\n\\n\r\nHappy Sugar Life makes use of its own flaws.  The sugar-coated scenes of the main characters in their unnatural habitat are not just for show; they\u2019re presented as a true illusion from reality.  The conflict is all the outsiders learning more about their lives and trying to tear it down, a plot that snowballs as the situation becomes more and more complicated.  A situation known as \u201creality\u201d. \\n\\n\r\nWhat\u2019s more, is that the aforementioned little girl doesn\u2019t even seem to be a real character.  Shio Koube lives and breathes, but her actual personality is baffling.  She\u2019s constantly happy and cheery and trying to do the best she can to help her caretaker.  She doesn\u2019t question the life she lives or the outside world she\u2019s prevented from seeing.  She is simply \u201ca daughteru\u201d:  the ideal child anyone would want to have--no, scratch that.  Megumin and Chtholly are daughterus to me, but that\u2019s because they actually seem like real characters, because real characters have flaws.  Shio Koube does not.  Shio Koube is not a real character, nor a daughteru--she is a pet. A Shia pet, if you will.  She exists to be cute and fluffy; you feed her and play with her a bit, and if you can do those two things, then she\u2019s not gonna be a bother to you outside of the occasional natural fuck-up.  That\u2019s cool and all, but that\u2019s not how a human child actually acts.\\n\\n\r\nBut what\u2019s smart about the anime is that it actually addresses this.  Shio\u2019s personality is the result of past trauma that\u2019s she\u2019s forgotten; and as she learns more and more about herself, it starts to crack a little.  By the end of the series, Shio outright states that she\u2019s meant to be more than a living object used to draw mental security from, practically breaking the fourth wall by stating she\u2019s a real character who has a functional and realistic train of thought that accurately feeds into her personality.\\n\\n\r\nIn other words, Happy Sugar Life was only pretending to be retarded.\\n\\n\r\nBecause, with the way it handles its plot by addressing its flaws and nailing its appeal with few problems, I can\u2019t help but think that Happy Sugar Life is actually pretty clever.  As dumb and over-the-top it may seem, it was in full control of itself and did what it set out to do.  \\n\\n\r\nSuffering, violence, trauma and psychosis.  Of course an anime called \u201cHappy Sugar Life\u201d would be about anything but.  Characters have very specific, intricately detailed mental issues, so much so that I can\u2019t guarantee the anime doesn\u2019t take place in some sort of high-tech asylum that simulates society as therapy for its patients.  The way they\u2019re presented are interesting on their own for what they are, but the main character herself acts in a surprisingly grounded manner.  \\n\\n\r\nIn the first episode, she verbally beats down her employer over a payroll cut, explaining how she was fully aware of the manager\u2019s schemes but played along for the sake of being nice, only to still be punished.  She completely dismantles this person mentally and challenges her, but her tone of voice is what sells the scene.  She doesn\u2019t scream or shout, the soundtrack is dark but sparse with details, and the visual direction is simple but effective.  It\u2019s not dynamic, over-acted, or over-the-top.  This scene could\u2019ve easily been a screaming match between two idiots, but\u2026 that would just be silly and unnecessary.  Quiet words speak louder than loud words.  That\u2019s totally how the saying goes.\\n\\n\r\nSatou Matsuzaka, aka \u201cHoly Shit Is That A Motherfucking Mirai Nikki Reference???\u201d is fully in control of herself, able to function like a normal person in most circumstances.  And by \u201ccontrol\u201d, I mean she seems to be keeping a deeper anger pent up within her, choosing not to do any more than what\u2019s necessary.  It\u2019s a contrast from the manager in episode one, who fights back with shouting and more body language, among other characters that I\u2019ll get into later.  The stability of Definitely Not Yuno\u2019s mental condition is part of the snowballing conflict--as her Title of The Anime becomes harder and harder to keep, her psyche decays, and as her psyche decays, she becomes more and more dangerous.\\n\\n\r\nBasically, if you know what the fuck a yandere is, you know what\u2019s up.\\n\\n\r\nWatching Pink Yandere fall further into despair as the story progressed, as well as her drastic shifts in attitude, are a blast to watch.  Hana Kanazawa delivers one of the best performances in her incredibly prolific career, at times sounding completely unrecognizable to me.  She\u2019s not just using her Akane Tsunemori serious drama voice, she\u2019s speaking in a tone FAR lower than almost every anime she\u2019s been cast in.  And, as a huge fan of Mirai Nikki, you bet your ass I loved episode 11 when she tied her hair back to look exactly like Yuno.  Praise be.\\n\\n\r\nThe other characters in the series are in various stages of sanity, for better or for worse.  The most notable is Satou\u2019s Aunt, who hoardes trash and lets weirdos beat the shit out of her for pleasure.  You know, like all loving aunts do.  But, like Satou, she\u2019s fully in control of her actions.  Rather, this is a matter of one being so deluded of themselves that they believe their behavior to be healthy.  AILF (aunt i\u2019d like to fuck) even convinces herself to have a fulfilling role within society, accepting hostility and fucking it out of them.  She is indeed quite over-the-top, but the long dialogues she provides make her believable enough to be enjoyable.\\n\\n\r\nAnd then there\u2019s the lolicon guy\u2026 oh boy.  This fuckin\u2019 guy.  As a result of things happening that cause him to distrust adults, he becomes so fully attached to Shio that he takes passionate inhalations of her missing poster flyers.  THIS is the over-the-top character that you\u2019d expect to see from a full edgelord show, and really, your opinion of him just depends on how much you\u2019re into that kinda stuff.  To me, this character is no more than a punchline--more like a punching bag, actually, given all the shit he goes through.  A full display of maximum disparity and lack of self-control, his actions are so cartoonish and ridiculous that all he ends up doing in the series is suffering. A lot.  He\u2019s just a dumping ground for all the negative consequences brought on by the other characters.  Overall, not a character to be taken seriously; he stands at the border between Happy Sugar Life being a completely serious drama and a goofy, edgy comedy.  I like the mixture of both worlds.\\n\\n\r\nBut the crowning jewel of this anime are some of the more psychologically-based scenes.  For as weird and silly as the anime can be, there are scenes of actual genius scattered throughout--most notably, the first half of episode eight.  It explores the backstory of Satou\u2019s and Shio\u2019s apartment through the eyes of its former resident.  All of it is in first-person view with no music, and the resident never speaks.  Instead, their moments of \u201cdialogue\u201d are replaced with a glitchy audio clip over a fluctuating black line.  The pauses before these clips make noise and their varying intensity fill in the blanks of Satou\u2019s conversations perfectly.  It\u2019s a tremendously well-done scene that I would recommend to anyone, even if you haven't seen the rest of the anime.\\n\\n\r\nSound manipulation is a motif in this series; characters\u2019 voices will become static-y and distorted in key moments to intensify their dark expressions.  Several different visual tricks are used for similar reasons--glowing eyes, static, reflections, scratchy lines, lighting, shadows, tactful shot compositions and other things are all deployed for the show\u2019s depraved, depressing and dark moods without overdoing any of them.  Meanwhile, happier moments are shown with sparkles, bubbles, clouds and bright, poppy colors; so corny that they\u2019re almost vomit-inducing, and I mean that in the best way possible.  Happy Sugar Life doesn\u2019t necessarily excel with animation, set pieces or character designs, but the various tricks it uses to communicate its feelings are excellent.\\n\\n\r\nSimilarly, the soundtrack doesn\u2019t particularly stand out, but the sound design is quite good, I\u2019ll say again.  Rising violins, static, vocal manipulation and prestigious voice acting get the job more than done.  The OP is one of my favorites of the entire year, using a song perfectly toned to this anime with its siren-like guitar riffs and optimistic, upbeat tone, shifting in and out of muttered, paranoid passages.  Bizarre, photographed objects float about in the background; a Shio-like angel flies over shadowy figures of the characters, and various trappings by glass jars and thorns lay over Satou as the video glitches with inconsistent timing.  It\u2019s easy to see what\u2019s going on in the OP based on a few episodes of the show itself, but it\u2019s communicated in so many incredible ways that the OP never got skipped.  The ED is good\u2026 for an ED, that is, which is to say not much, but the animation of Satou and Shio is cute, and the song itself is quite touching.\\n\\n\r\nIf you\u2019ve read my reviews before, you know that I\u2019m completely and 100% serious in all of my reviews, and I never make any jokes whatsoever, so when I say this is a 9/10 anime, I mean that it should be watched by all eyes, no matter what.\\n\\n\r\nNow, if you\u2019ve ACTUALLY read my reviews before, you\u2019d know I like to play around, that I don\u2019t really care about ratings, that I\u2019m not all that interested in seeing a fully-serious, masterfully-crafted story.  But with its combination of surprise turnarounds, smart directing and just the right amount of silliness, I\u2019d truly say that Happy Sugar Life is a quality anime; not just by my standards, but for drama and psychological anime as a whole.  Indeed, it is not perfect--some people will be unhappy with some of the characters or not be willing to see how the anime fixes itself down the line.  In fact, I myself have room to complain about the teacher not having any real exploration to his character, as well as some scenes that simply would not happen in the real world, such as Satou's Aunt seducing the police officer, as good as it was.  A lot of it is conveniently written.  The characters aren\u2019t particularly deep and more idealized than realized.  But, overall, Happy Sugar Life is FUN.  It is an exciting series that takes little time to light its first match, and once it gets going it doesn\u2019t let up until it has burned everything down.\\n\\n\r\nI dearly recommend this anime to anyone who\u2019s into not just edgy comedies, but anyone who\u2019s interested in a kinda wacky psychological drama that even manages to unnerve you a little bit.  Perhaps it is not the most effective at what it is, but it is, nonetheless, effective.\\n\\n\r\nStory - 8/10\\n\r\nArt - 8/10\\n\r\nSound - 8/10\\n\r\nCharacters - 7/10\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 9/10\\n\r\nYandere - 10/10\\n\r\nOverall - 9/10\\n\r\nFavorite episode - 8\\n\r\nFavorite character - Satou.

            "content": "\"MUHAHAHA, lookie look how crazy I am -- I'm wheezily drooling over a little girl's picture and screaming like a complete idiot!\"\r\nThat's pretty much the best way to describe this anime.\r\nStory: 3\r\nThe writing is below the level of both David Cage and Uwe Boll's work. \"You're less stable than the other girls. I'm an adult. I'm sure I can help you.\" This is a literal line a character has delivered in this series. Not only does composition repeatedly get dumped in our faces, it has to be in the most awkward ways imaginable. \r\nHappy Sugar Life is anime about a girl named Satou. She hada past of banging random fuckboys and until she stumbled upon a rare wild loli. She caught it and now she oughta protecc it and attacc random badly written losers from capturing it, but most of all, she doesn't give a fucc about everyone else. In fact, she invariably feels the need to state this.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 1\\n\r\n\"Oh wow, these type of characters have never been represented before! This is SO edgy!\"\\n\r\nLast time I heard that line it was a reaction to \"13 Reasons Why\". Just like that series, HSL takes the piss out of mental health, but this is on a whole other level. Each character is constantly forced to state their true nature in the most cringe-worthy ways possible. Now I know anime shouldn't be viewed as film, but this anime just buries the 'Show not Tell' rules in ten meters of diarrhea. One of the characters (NO SPOILERS) is a borderline pedophile, but instead of revealing his nature by his actions they have him immediately drool over the loli's picture without any buildup. Although his way of handling is eventually shown, it gets completely destroyed with crank ass straightforward monologue that makes everything feel cheesy and overexaggerated. \\n\r\nThis is something you'd see frequently in a Thomas the Tank Engine episode since the mono- and dialogue is that bleak. If you play around with ADULT themes like these, write this series in a way ADULTS can enjoy (and no, I'm not talking about you angsty teenagers).\\n\\n\r\nWhat did I miss..? Oh yeah, the main female character is a joke. We get it, she is a strong deranged woman who don't need no men. No need to make her constantly repeat that. I can't believe they wasted such a good voice actress like Kana Hanazawa for this bullshit.\\n\r\nThe teacher is a plain imbecile; how does that impulsive moron still have a job and isn't locked up somewhere. I guess the loli is the only character that isn't so hyperbolically written. Well maybe because it is a child, but I can give the writers some props for her.\\n\r\nBut then again, every character is written like an incongruous child.\\n\\n\r\nMisc - Art: 6 | Sound: 5\\n\r\nAnimation-wise, it's plenty for whatever this series requires. The art and character design, namely the combination of grey tones and vibrancy, decently manage to convey the offsetting atmosphere this series is trying to portray -- nothing wrong with those. Its opening animations and song are probably the best assets this series has to offer. Apart from the opening song, the OST is pretty mediocre.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 5\\n\r\nAside from the bruises on my forehead I constantly get from slapping it, this series is somewhat enjoyable. It still has you questioning yourself what the fuck will happen next with these poorly written chunks of clay characters my 7-year-old cousin could replicate (figuratively speaking). \\n\\n\r\n(tl;dr)\\n\r\nOverall Final Score: 3\\n\r\nThe audiovisual aspects maybe great, but the context of its plot just pisses me the fuck off. I firmly believe that this series just presents character tropes instead of actual characters. The writers misrepresent real mental disorders to make this show seem as edgy as possible. And finally, as the cherry on top of the cake, they don't possess the skill level to handle such themes.\\n\r\nIf you want to see an excellent anime with godly written themes regarding mental health, go watch 3-Gatsu No Lion. That's all there is to it.",

            "content": "Once upon a time, there was a girl who didn\u2019t know what love really is. She seemingly had no goals in life with a rootless understanding about love. Sleeping with guys and not truly knowing what her life is about, she didn\u2019t know if there was a place to belong. Wondering around the end of abyss of life and not knowing who she can really be with. Then, a child appeared. An innocent child with a face full of life and sugar. Is this a chance to truly discover love? Is it a chance to live a happy sugar life?\r\nAs a show that combines elementsof psychological horror, suspense, and thriller, Happy Sugar Life looked deceptive at first glance. Now I admit, I\u2019m a bit of a sucker when it comes to shows where we have an anti-hero protagonist. I mean, the first episode speak for itself once you realize Matsuzaka Satou\u2019s personality. She is essentially living a double life \u2013 one that is of a normal girl and other being overly obsessive of Shio Kobe. This devotion to Shio is so strong that she is willing to kill others to \u201cprotect\u201d her from harm. In Satou's mind, being with Shio equates to happiness.\\n\\n\r\nDespite the complex nature of the plot, the setup of the story is actually very simple. We got Satou who pretty much takes Shio as a partner and isolates her in a place where she feels is safe. It\u2019s an apartment that looks normal on the inside and outside until you realize there may be something much darker going on behind the scenes. The first few episodes is rather cryptic about Satou\u2019s actions including parts where she takes questionable content in and out of the house. Meanwhile, there\u2019s definitely character chemistry going on between Satou and Shio. The duo shares an innocent love chemistry and ritual-like marriage ceremonies on a frequent basis. On most parts, the show seems fluffy during those segments while masking the suspenseful thriller storytelling. Throughout the series, we discover just how far from normal Satou actually is. The show also makes it clear that she will go to any length to protect Shio even if it means murder. Anyone who is familiar with the term \u2018yandere\u2019 will easily dedicate her character as such. In essence, Satou is a complex character who sees her idea of love in a twisted way. Regardless of consequences, she will do anything to protect that love. This puts Shio on the opposite end of the spectrum as she is an innocent child. Despite that, she seems to adore Satou and always values their relationship. It\u2019s the sort of child behavior you\u2019d expect from this show.\\n\\n\r\nThe more I watched Happy Sugar Life, the more I realized how this show depicts human behavior in some of the worst ways possible. Characters such as Taiyou displays borderline pedophile behavior towards Shio. Others such as Daichi and Satou\u2019s aunt also demonstrate their psychological tendencies in several episodes. With the exception of Shio, only one other character came to my mind who I can say is normal. Her name would be Shouko Hida but I wouldn\u2019t get attached to her easily. In fact, try to refrain from getting attached to most of the characters in this series because their real personalities are incredibly disturbing. Another reason is that some characters will not make it alive. I\u2019m not going to mention it as it\u2019s spoiler but let\u2019s just say that death isn\u2019t uncommon in the story. \\n\\n\r\nAs the majority of the series adheres to psychological horror, it\u2019s hard to really root for any single character. The characters Satou deals with are often evil as she is with some being even more twisted. However, I think some of her past can be sympathetic. Satou wasn\u2019t born with evil intentions but events shaped her to become what she is now. The past explores her character in depth and there\u2019s even one episode that explains how Satou ends up where she is now. Narratives in this series is incredibly important as it fishes out a character\u2019s personality to the fullest. Satou is the primary example of this as we see a journey to understanding love in her words. There\u2019s also a character named Asahi Koube in the show with a deep desire to reunite with Shio as a family. But unlike Satou, he doesn\u2019t go to measures such as killing to achieve his happiness. It\u2019s a bit sugarcoated but he is more of a hero than Satou will ever be. \\n\\n\r\nBy the time you reach the conclusion of the first episode, I think it\u2019ll become obvious whether or not it\u2019s worth following this anime. Are you the type that love suspenseful horror? Do you favor a story with twisted inhumane characters? Do you want to see if characters such as Satou or Shio really find love in each other in the end? If these are some of the questions in mind, then definitely give this anime a shot. Otherwise, it\u2019s going to be a sluggish ride as every episode builds more and more into the suspense. I personally find this anime unique in the sense that it isn\u2019t truly deceptive yet always makes me anticipate on what to expect next. The character cast wants you to hate them and they succeed without jeopardizing the plot. And to me, that\u2019s a feat that I admire.\\n\\n\r\nLike the title suggests, Happy Sugar Life has a sugary and sweet coloring to its animation style. Studio Ezo\u2019la (one that I never heard of before until this series) bought out its ideas to fullest. It\u2019s vibrant and full of life during moments when we see happiness. Then, there are those dark eerie scenes that brings out the horror of the story. It\u2019s often moody especially in Satou\u2019s apartment where questionable content lies in the dark. As you should expect, this show contains violence that includes murder. The TV version seems to have tone it down a bit as some of the graphic content is done behind the scenes rather than shown directly on screen. Satou is the main culprit of this but there are some other characters that commit sinful deeds. Oh and be prepared for some uncomfortable scenes from the main cast. Taiyou is a guy that I deeply regret watching for his pedophilic tendencies. Good God, erase him from the show. Other character expressions in the series are disturbing to watch such as with Satou\u2019s red predatory eyes or her aunt\u2019s mentally unstable behavior. The light in the dark tunnel is Shio as she brings in sugar, spice, and everything nice. \\n\\n\r\nIf you want psychology in this series, you need the characters to be convincing. Thanks to the modern talent of Kana Hanazawa, that is achieved. She\u2019s known for a variety of heroine roles and to play a yandere in this series truly bought out her talent to full. Misaki Kuno is also able to step into the shoes of a child to portray her character\u2019s innocence. The theme songs contain an upbeat mood that contrasts with the tone of the show. It\u2019s very playful and bubbly while the ED theme contains a more melodramatic feeling.\\n\\n\r\nHappy Sugar Life tells the tale of love that isn\u2019t the typical romantic story you\u2019re familiar with. Instead, it crafts psychological horror with a cast of degenerate characters. There are some that you\u2019ll find to be abominations of our society. Yet, this series is far from an abomination. It\u2019s a psychological horror done right with a clear set of intentions at its heart and soul.",

            "content": "Happy Sugar Life is a psychological horror starring Satou Matsuzaka as our main heroine. It is revealed early in the first episode that she lives with Shio Koube, who Satou considers to be her \"special someone\". Satou did horrible things to live with Shio, and as you might have read already on MAL's synopsis, Satou will do everything in her capabilities to protect her life with Shio, her Happy Sugar Life. Of course, Satou and Shio are not the only characters here. This anime is one to watch if you want to see a lot of psychologically scarred characters.\r\nA theme going on in the animeis about 'love' and the characters' different 'love'. The story is centered on Satou and Shio's relationship with what Satou believes is pure love. The atmosphere usually changes back and forth between Satou's sugar life and all the bitterness of the outside world. Scenes showing the sugar part of Satou's life will mostly be when she is alongside Shio. The bitterness is from characters that threaten Satou's status quo. Satou prefers to not interact with anyone else, but that is not possible. She has to work to support her life, keeping facades in school and her workplace. This leads to her feeling bitter when other characters are intrusive with their 'love'. Examples of this are when Satou started getting trouble from the likes of her manager and her teacher early in the show.\\n\\n\r\nHappy Sugar Life handles their characters very well. Most of the important characters are introduced early in the show, leaving time to explore them and for character development. There are only a few characters who feels like 'disposable characters'. Most characters are also screwed up in the head, almost everyone has some trauma or psychological disorder. This leads to interesting interactions between the characters, or rather psychos. With each characters comes different interactions, with Satou taking different approaches to keep them away from her relationship with Shio. Furthermore, every character does get their own bit of spotlight, showing their motives, their past, or how they got traumatized.\\n\\n\r\nThe story relies heavily on mystery and suspense. Feelings of unease can be felt during the calmer parts of the show. Satou's expressions are not always clear, leaving you wondering on what she might do. You are left not knowing most of the truth, and it keeps making you curious about what will happen next. When you thought you know what was going on, the anime revealed a different answer, and you are back in the mystery. Even during the 'sugar' scenes, just not knowing what is brewing without you knowing is enough to keep the suspense going. The music (or lack of) supports the atmosphere really well. All that said, some situations are so weird and absurd, you might feel disgust or get a chuckle out of it.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Happy Sugar Life is an anime filled with mentally scarred characters, with Satou and Shio in the middle bringing these characters inevitably bumping with each other. Happy Sugar Life uses its characters well without freely disposing them. It also does a good job delivering suspense. Scenes switch around 'sugar' and 'bitter' parts, with the suspense still intact. On the bad side, at times, it feels like the anime is just dragging out the mystery, and the situations might seem too unrealistic.",

            "content": "This anime scared the shit out of me like how Mahou Shoujo Site was, but thankfully it didn't try to be as edgy AF, but im my opinion, Happy Sugar Life is at heart a psychological horror yet decent drama-based show that I'm actually quite contented (and secretly excited...?) to see what mysteries and miseries does this series put us through the overall setting.\r\nHappy Sugar Life follows its aforementioned manga adaptation (which is fully caught up at the time of this review), and shows us the \"love\" of a broken high school girl (Matsuzaka Satou) and her victim of a broken yet naive understanding, ShioKoube. The title of the show is very misleading (just like Asobi Asobase, only more darker and sinister), but it creates a good context for all of the characters who are broken and/or blind-sided in many ways:\\n\\n\r\nMatsuzaka Satou, the pink-haired Yandere, voiced by the goddess Hana Kanazawa (and damn does she ever do a great job defining Satou's character). Spoilt out of love in her own family, which consists of her brain-washed of a wreck aunt, Satou has been mislead growing up, and asking about the concoction of love, to which her aunt shows her that love is everything of pleasure and desires, if she so wishes. And to that, her own experience of messing around and sleeping with boys serve as the catalyst of \"Do I really want to keep this love?\", and to that, her own heart is like a sweet, sweet jar, the happiness-filled jar that was once full is shattered into pieces, and in order to retain her love, she'll stop at nothing to make sure that she sees this towards the end.\\n\\n\r\nThe Koube family, of Shio and Asahi. Ah...the family conflict, someone gets drunk and accuses the significant other of upbringing the children in a bad way. Both characters have suffered under the demise of their wrecking ball of a father, so much so that the only link holding them both is their mum, to which her sanity could not be contained further, and Shio was kicked out of the house, abandoned by her mum. It was then and there that Satou found her and their Happy Sugar Life starts from there, maintaining the love jar and filling with sweet memories, while na\u00efve that Satou didn't kidnap nor harm her in the process, and strives to protect Satou in her weakest. The brother however, is kinda of a bad brother, as both him and Shio part ways to help their mum survive, and now he's back to take her home, with the realism that Satou \"kidnapped\" her for her own pleasure. A hidden character always that doesn't stand out, he is left to fend for himself.\\n\\n\r\nSatou's workmate and close friend, Taiyou Mitsuboshi the pedophile and Shouko Hida, the friend who promises of kept secrets and wants the best for everyone. For Taiyou himself, I don't really need to explain his character because it is what it is: his madly-deeply driven forbidden love for children that he's pretty much a psychopath and a lunatic at that, often taken advantage of in precarious situations. Shouko on the other hand, is pretty much a barebones character who often plays the best-close friend troupe, always concerning for others and helping them in need. If you haven't been paying close attention much, she is the ONLY sane character out of everyone, until her demise in Satou's vicious hands calls out her presence to save those still in the trap of trauma.\\n\\n\r\nDon't think for a millisecond that you're watching this show just to shit trash on it, its characters will turn you upside down to the point of misconception and stunning acting.\\n\\n\r\nNewcomer studio Ezo'la's art and animation really was off-putting to say the least, but for the balance between the real world and the various horror scenes that enclosed the vibes from the manga, it was a pretty good adaptation overall. For once, there were a lot of things going for it, such as the art degradation towards the comic feel (such as the static screens of horror) and the psychological aspect which plays a big part into making this series feel like reality that hits us in the face when we least expected it. The unique feel for the new studio just blew my mind at how the staff directorials punch in what is arguably the best part of the show: the unsteady visuals.\\n\\n\r\nThe music is also another area that best explicits the foreshadowing of the series to come. Many scenes with the horror vibes are actually used at the correct moments of storytelling in time, and not just for show. Just like Asobi Asobase (yet again, musically), the OST was a definite surprise for me as both the OP and ED nailed at whatever exposition the series storyline has going for it. Not to mention that the ED presents ReoNa's debut single, and its heart-warming tonality makes it the perfect ending IMO (and one of the best EDs of the season).\\n\\n\r\nHappy Sugar Life, we knew ye, we kinda understand ye. Horror is very subjective, that pertains to your own tastes of how you see it. As for personal takeaway, the real world complications exemplify the need for all of us to have the sense of the \"Happy Sugar Life\" jar in our hearts, even when bogged down by trauma. It's the same with trying to understand someone's life and what they have went through that culminates the core hypocrisy of all men, and this series did that for me.\\n\\n\r\nSo unless you have an affinity of finding out what your Happy Sugar Life is, watch this show to find out (and it's a recommendation too), ONLY if you're a sane person. (And yes, I'm definitely still sane after this).",

Because I only have seen the first episodes, so let's see if the story stays interesting.\r\nThe art is a mixture of bright colors with a gloomy shadow over it. That creates an atmosphere of unforeseeable darkness, which is only broken up in a few moments of \"Happiness\". \r\nThe sound fits most of thetime, but there are moments where there should have been any BGM or better BGM.\\n\\n\r\nWell coming to the characters, you currently only have to remember the two mains, the rest is at the moment not really interesting, but they all are pretty much corrupted in their behavior and doing. \\n\\n\r\nI personally am enjoying \"Happy Sugar Life\" very much, because like I mentioned before I like these kinds of stories and what happens next is unpredictable, because it can be almost everything.\\n\\n\r\nOverall \"Happy Sugar Life\" is not happy, it is more horrifying and disturbing, so it leaves you with the feeling of \"what has just happened and why?\". But it is addicting and you want to see more of it until there is a moment, which will maybe satisfy you.",

            "content": "Happy Sugar Life is a tragedy. I mean this in both literary and quality terms. Despite how interestingly and enticingly crafted this tragic tale is, and how effectively some of its presentation is, this show has one fatal flaw: overemphasis. One wouldn\u2019t think that this is so catastrophic, but Happy Sugar Life proves why \u201cshow, don\u2019t tell\u201d is a thing.\r\nThere are two forms of this devastating lingering. The first one is the monologuing. This is what damages Satou as a character and drags this anime down and out beyond belief. Her personality is interesting, almost as if you put a mary sue and a yanderein a blender and watched them eat away at each other in the process of having an overprotective pedo lesbian try to keep her image and ideal life intact. It\u2019s hard to care when the majority of her screen time is spent in her headspace, as she monologues about damn near everything. Regardless of what anyone thinks of this tragic hero on a moral level, it\u2019s easy to see how this can feel grating and unnecessary. These scenes of her expositing her thoughts on any given situation can go on for minutes on end when almost every single time, her expressions alone are enough to tell us next to, if not everything she is thinking and feeling. \\n\\n\r\nShrinking it all down to a sentence or two maximum to clarify something or truly encapsulate a scene for her, and letting the visuals do the rest would have been far more rewarding. It would have truly taken advantage of the imaginatively disturbing directing and presentation, both making Satou a far more interesting lead to follow, and making several scenes to be far more impactful and dramatic. It would have also kept a myriad of scenes from dragging out to more than double the length they needed to convey everything properly. Keep in mind that this applies to several scenes from several characters later on as well. You could cut down entire episodes worth of monologuing and probably improved the pacing dramatically, both in terms of an episode structure and scene-by-scene basis. The worst part of all is that the show understands this to an extent, with some of the most critical and stylistic scenes in the latter half of the show truly showcasing how powerful this approach can be.\\n\\n\r\nThe second devastating, drawn-out form of overemphasis is a more gratuitous, self-indulgent kind. It\u2019s what destroys practically everyone else in this show. It\u2019s no secret that the vast majority of the characters in this show are damaged, mostly reprehensible people. You can show that off while keeping the audience engaged and disturbed in a proper way. This show takes the worst approach possible with this. Whenever a character is established doing something fucked up, we linger on them licking something, drooling, and/or panting after sniffing something for extended periods of time or interacting with their target in some way. At that point, it\u2019s more tiresome than creepy, and more aggravating than repulsive. It\u2019s even worse when the show constantly reminds you of this with small moments and scenes that add nothing and could be cut out entirely. It\u2019s bad enough that the progression of certain characters\u2019 descent into pedophilic or stalker-like madness is utterly nonsensical, but when that becomes their defining trait, and when the show just lingers on about it, it becomes a nightmare to sit through for the worst reasons imaginable. \\n\\n\r\nTo really paint a picture of how bad this can get, a male police officer is sexually assaulted for minutes on end, with several characters watching, and it takes his partner so long to intervene. On top of that, all they do is leave, rather than arrest the perpetrator or do anything for committing a crime of sexual assault on an on-duty police officer. It\u2019s beyond wild how bad the gaps in logic are, and how much this show just wants to linger on the more disturbing elements for its own self-indulgent, narrative and character-damaging purposes. I\u2019m not sure if any of this was the fault of the material, the director/screenwriter, or both.\\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s a pity, really. Outside of all of this, there\u2019s an interesting, enticing tragedy at play, with some truly potent moments, both sweet and sour. The reveals are paced out well and tend to be brutal. The core narrative is theoretically engaging without too many glaring issues in terms of logic or consistency. On the audiovisual side, the visuals by newcomer studio Ez\u03ccla can be incredibly imaginative, even if their background and CGI endeavors are sometimes distracting and needless. The disconcerting feel the directing and imagery go for is a sight to behold. The music is generally good at bolstering emotional scenes with their own melancholic and beautiful tunes. The ED theme -\"SWEET HURT\" by ReoNa- deserves special mention in that regard. If the show just showed more restraint and used its artistic flair to more consistently tell its story properly, I genuinely believe this would have been one of the better shows I\u2019ve seen all year. Alas, the sweet that interested me was a tad too bitter.",

            "content": "This was pretty dreadful. Sure it was creepy you can like that stuff, but unlike decent anime I've watched that do give you chills like Higurashi, this was shock value. Pure shock value. It had no weight to it and it was incredibly boring and plain, besides the scenes where she goes scary yandere, I was SO surprised(sarcasm). You never feared that she was going to get caught, she had nothing to lose besides her precious loli that we all knew she would just end up murdering everyone for. Many of the characters were an eyesore, the art had no special qualities, it was stablebut that was all.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: They characters were SHIT. Ok, so the loli girl(Shio), was alright. She had what looked like a mental disorder which can explain a few of her actions and made me genuinely sad when I saw her being mistreated. And then, we have our MC. Satou. She was incredibly fucked up, which is not a bad thing in general, but all we see is an emotionless husk walking around, unless she's with Shio, or protecting her. I know there can be Villain Protagonists, but I at least want to see her get what she deserves every now and then. She can literally get away with EVERYTHING, because the police in this world don't give a shit. She has no personality, and even though it's supposed to be a don't judge a book by its cover kind of series, when she's happy, she's cardboard. When she's angry, she's copy and paste yandere girl. She never is really approached with a challenge, and when she is, she has to refrain herself from MURDERING PEOPLE as a solution. Her relationship with Shio is a love relationship, but I'm not sure if it's a romantic relationship or platonic which gives me an uncomfortable thought every now and then. The fact that she could be in love with a girl who's acts under 10 is unsettling. Asahi is a generally good guy looking for his sister Shio, but from what I've seen, is probably going to be killed for wanting her in the first place(just saying). And then literally, everyone else has some sort of edgy backstory and poorly written mental disorder as a plot device, so they will go after Shio/Satou, and Satou will have a 'justified' reason to kill them, or look like a total badass beating them up. Satou is actually a bit likable, with her intense love for Shio, how she's willing to work hard day and night to provide for the both of them, that brought a smile to my face.\\n\\n\r\nStory: Ah, where do I begin? There are many questions that never seemed to be answered or given an excuse. This makes the writing seem lazy and boring. Even certain characters are brought up just so that they can get in Satou's way, for example the creepy teacher masochist who wanted to molest her, or a generally good guy who wanted to find Shio, his smaller sister. The police are never fucking useful in this world, they practically only exist when needed, and from what I've heard so far, they're only used once. They seem to used the abused backstory card, as Satou is somehow justified of her behavior because her (Spoiler)  not gonna say their name** taught her a twisted love. Sure this explains her actions but doesnt justify them. I can't say Satou is even on the same page as the world she's in, she gets away with everything and the story doesn't care because it's supposed to send chills down your spine. I had to use the 'anime logic card' because it was so incredibly stupid. Every time our MC is about to kill someone, it's just boom, there dead. We never truly cared about what was happening, because nothing made sense. The concept of kidnapping out of love isn't unique, and is dealt with poorly, because all Satou has to do is to place a lock on the door from the outside, and done! Our blind loli hostage can't escape. No I don't mean the girl is physically blind but just taken advantage over. The story throws happy moments out of nowhere being hooked on the creepy on the inside happy on the outside that it feels really out of character. For example, when she's jealous because Asahi had said vows to Shio, she's goes a little insane, which is acceptable. But then she just goes happy go lucky because it apparently means her love for Shio makes her jealous, and mentally thanks her for that. It didn't evoke any emotion out of me because the story just puts it in my lap and waits for me to go, \"Awwww, cute!\".\\n\\n\r\nArt: The art was ok, the opening was the best example of what was supposed to look like a simple moe theme. But for the rest of the show, the characters look half-baked besides Satou who literally looks like a carbon copy of Yuno Gasai from Mirai Nikki. The backgrounds seemed like any other basic anime, and Satou's apartment has no character in it whatsoever. Even in the place they sleep there is no desk with textbooks to describe that Satou is a student, no toys or anything to convey that Shio is a child. Their apartment has no character, and is plain and an eyesore. There is actually one overview shot of Satou sitting at a table in a room, and I can't even tell what room it is in because there was literally nothing else but Satou, a chair, and a table. It could have been anywhere. When Satou goes crazy however, it has a decent art effect on her eyes which in my opinion, makes her look cool, rather than scary and insane. The art also does a good job portraying their struggle for money, as Shio's meals look just enough to fill her hunger, and are not overly polished. Her character design also do a good job on displaying a small child and an average teenager.\\n\\n\r\nSound: The sound was pretty decent. The songs were average, she being pretty bland, but the OST was actually ok. There's nothing remarkable but there was something.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: I didn't really enjoy it from an analytical standpoint but I did enjoy it when I turn my brain off. Watching Satou nearly murdering people got me excited and seeing the two live happily day to day was heart warming. Unless I looked into it further, I always would see Satou as a cool intelligent schoolgirl who would kick ass. But as soon as I looked deeper, it all went downhill.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: If you don't care about story and character elements, jump right in, enjoy the shock value. But if you've already seen some messed up creepy horror anime that had genuinely scared you, you might have second doubts, this could be just a boring anime with lame action scenes. If you can't turn your brain off, then just find a better show, the characters are hardly enjoyable and the story has lots of giant, gaping plot holes.\\n\\n",

This show tries waay to hard to be one of those \"its not what it appears to be on the surface\" kinda material shows. At first the artwork and character designs drew me in but the amount of pandering to try to seem \"edgy\" and \"dark\" is making me want to quit. Literally every character is deranged in some way or another which makes it infuriating to watch. I'll end up finishing it anyway, but at this point its not for enjoyment.

            "content": "All\u2019s fair in love and war. It\u2019s an expression that I\u2019ve heard a million times. It\u2019s so cliche that I kind of just take it for granted. The idea that anything is permissible if you do it for love seems fair enough on the surface. I never really questioned the validity of that cliche until I watched Happy Sugar Life. All\u2019s fair in love and war feels like it should be right, but if I really think about it I start to run into some problems. What sort of actions truly are permissible in the pursuit or defence of love? If two loves are competingwith each other then which one is just? Do the reasons or justifications behind someone\u2019s feelings of love matter or is the love defensible regardless? Happy Sugar Life explores all these questions and it does so while maintaining a high entertainment value. The moral questions present themselves naturally in the show through the interesting and compelling actions of the characters and how they conflict with each other. The artstyle of the show helps to enhance the themes, especially the general feeling of dread that persists throughout. Overall, Happy Sugar Life puts my thoughts and feelings in conflict with each other. While I might think certain actions are universally wrong I end up feeling like they are justified in the specific events of the show because they are done for love.\\n\\n\r\nHappy Sugar Life is about a pink haired psycho bitch (Satou) who abducts an innocent cute little blue haired girl (Shio) and basically uses her as an emotional support animal. On the surface it might seem like Satou and Shio have a shallow relationship but due to their past traumas we can see that isn\u2019t the case. The relationship between Satou and Shio is by far the most emotionally substantive relationship that either one has ever experienced in their lives. Their relationship can accurately be described as \u201clove.\u201d \\n\\n\r\nSatou has spent most of her life up until this point trying to find out what love is. Satou was orphaned as a child and ended up living with her Aunt who is an extreme pleasure seeker. Satou\u2019s Aunt\u2019s concept of love is very twisted and extreme. She pursues love through means of physical pleasure. This has lead to her becoming damaged, both physically and mentally. Satou\u2019s Aunt\u2019s pursuit of pleasure transcends any sort of common sense. She seeks physical love despite any cost, happily accepting beatings from random men. \\n\\n\r\nBecause of Satou\u2019s upbringing she didn\u2019t have a good understanding of love. Satou ended up spending a lot of time engaging in sexual relationships with men however she did not derive pleasure from these relationships. The relationships were very shallow and focused in physical pleasure only, this did not satisfy Satou\u2019s deep rooted emotional needs. Satou tolerated these shallow sexual relationships because they offered her a place to spend the night at a time when she was trying to escape her Aunt\u2019s putrid apartment. Satou was alone in the world and had to use her own wits to survive.\\n\\n\r\nUnlike Satou, Shio could not survive on her own. Shio is an innocent cute young girl who is filled with boundless energy and a childlike optimism that is cheerful and inspiring. Despite all that, she was treated terribly by her mother. Shio\u2019s Mother was heavily abused and the trauma from the abuse lead to her becoming extremely paranoid and eventually hostile towards Shio. She ended up abandoning Shio on the street, running away her responsibilities as a mother, leaving Shio alone to suffer.\\n\\n\r\nOn the night that Shio was abandoned she ended up being found by Satou. Satou took her in. Shio\u2019s presence had a calming effect on Satou. Satou was experiencing a happiness like she never had before. Perhaps she didn\u2019t yet realize that this feeling was love. Satou\u2019s boyfriend at the time had never seen her so emotionally satisfied before. As his extreme jealousy of Shio boiled over, he attempted to strangle her to death. This lead to Satou committing her first murder. \\n\\n\r\nSatou\u2019s first murder was defensive in nature. It wasn\u2019t premeditated, it was simply a spontaneous and necessary action to defend Shio. Unfortunately this murder would lead Satou down an irreversible path, where anything to protect Shio is permitted.\\n\\n\r\nThis is the point that the first episode starts at. Our first introduction of Satou and Shio is of them living alone together in secret. Satou goes to school during the day and works in the evening. She puts on a facade to get through the day. Shio stays home alone in their heavily locked apartment. When Satou returns at the end of the evening she is greeted warmly by Shio and they spend the night together. Satou is shown to be completely obsessed with Shio. Every action she takes is for the purposes of protecting her status quo situation with Shio. When other people threaten to interfere with Satou\u2019s lifestyle, whether intentionally or not, she deals with them decisively. She uses various immoral tactics including deception, blackmail, and even murder. These tactics are relatively successful when dealing with isolated incidents. For example in the early episodes we see Satou successfully quashing love confessions, coercing her boss into actually paying her properly, and turning an attempted rapist into her loyal errand boy. Unfortunately these isolated successes don\u2019t prepare her for what\u2019s coming next; a focused effort from Shio\u2019s brother (Asahi) to find Shio.\\n\\n\r\nAsahi\u2019s persistent search for Shio serves as Satou\u2019s biggest threat. From Asahi\u2019s perspective, Shio is a missing child. He searches tirelessly for her. He has a weak disposition and is often ignored, and even beaten, when trying to pass out flyers. Asahi presents the major moral conflict of the show. Is Satou right to be holding the custody of Shio? Through Asahi we see that there are people who care about Shio. It becomes clear that Satou is not in the right for hiding Shio from the rest of the world. Although Satou\u2019s intentions to protect Shio might be good they are having unintended consequences.\\n\\n\r\nShio in not mentally stable. While Satou is out and about all day, Shio stays alone in their apartment. Shio is shown to have an unclear memory, distorted due to the trauma she faced. Shio is shown drawing an effigy of her mother on a closet wall despite repressing memories of her. Shio\u2019s mental instability is heightened when she is alone. \\n\\n\r\nShio\u2019s situation touches on some moral conflicts. Shio is clearly better off with Satou than she was with her mother. Satou provides a motherly presence for Shio that her actual mother did not. However Satou isn\u2019t capable of healing all of Shio\u2019s wounds, and there are even some that she doesn\u2019t know about. Is Shio truly better off being with Satou? Would Shio be better off with her brother or some other caring guardian? Is Satou\u2019s protection of Shio a selfless act to protect Shio or a selfish act to satisfy her own needs and desires? These aren\u2019t easy questions to answer and that\u2019s part of what makes them so compelling.\\n\\n\r\nThe moral conflicts of Happy Sugar Life are very interesting and they make me want to think. However, thoughtful and difficult moral questions do not make an anime good by themselves. The art of Happy Sugar Life add a lot to the emotional element of the show. Below, I will discuss some of my favourite motifs and symbols that forced me to feel.\\n\\n\r\nOne of the main visual motifs and symbols is the jar full of candy. This jar is shown in varying states. Sometimes the jar is full of candy and the characters eat from it. Sometimes the jar is spilled and the candy is absent. The symbolism here is obvious but powerful. The candy represents the positive emotions associated with the concept of a \u201cHappy Sugar Life.\u201d The jar represents the capacity to maintain these positive emotions. It\u2019s important to note that the jar is made of fragile glass. The characters need to put in a concerted effort to maintain the wholeness of their jar. Even if the jar is completely empty and devoid of candy the presence of the jar itself is evidence that the capacity for a \u201cHappy Sugar Life\u201d still remains. Satou has to work to make sure her jar remains intact. She doesn\u2019t want to end up like her Aunt, whose jar is described as being broken, which can help explain her bizarre behaviour and general insanity.\\n\\n\r\nEvery night Shio and Satou perform a wedding ceremony. Shio drapes a white bed sheet over Satou\u2019s head as a veil and they recite matrimonial vows. This nightly ritual serves not only as an affirmation of their love for each other but also as an act of purification for Satou, who uses morally questionable tactics to maintain her status quo relationship with Shio on a daily basis.\\n\\n\r\nDuring a particularly brutal and emotional scene, Satou ends up with scars on the back of her hand. The scars are left as the last attempted resistance of one of Satou\u2019s murder victims. The scars on Satou\u2019s hands serve as a reminder to Satou of the lengths that she has gone to to preserve her secret relationship with Shio. They are simultaneously a reminder of her regrets and of her conviction. The scars reminded me of the \u201cdamned spot\u201d that stains the hands of Lady Macbeth. After feeling guilt and regret about her decision to commit murder, Lady Macbeth hallucinates a blood stain on her hands. She cries \u201cOut, damned spot! Out, I say!\u201d as she frantically tries and fails to wash the imaginary blood from her hands. Satou does not react to her hand\u2019s scars in same way as Lady Macbeth but the similarity between the two remains. They both have an uncleanable permanent stain on their hands. One that appeared there due to their own decisions and actions. One that will haunt them for the rest of their lives.\\n\\n\r\nThroughout the entire show the art is underscored by this unsettling and horrifying theme of contrast. When Satou and Shio are alone together the colours are bright and vivid. The presentation seems happy and carefree similar to something from a cute girls slice of life anime. But unlike those cute girls shows, the happy artstyle here is chilling due to the stark contrast with the rest of the show. The rest of the show has a very drab artstyle which is a lot more in line with the darker and more morbid themes of the show. This contrast between happy and carefree with drab and morbid is what makes the show horrifying for me. This contrast makes everything unsettling. The parts that are happy and carefree feel like they are on an island, surrounded by violent waves of morbidity. The happy parts feel like they don\u2019t belong and they feel like they could be swallowed up by the ocean of morbidity at any time. The characters act in ways that corroborate this theme which helps to enhance its effect. Satou is cold and calculating when she is in the outside world but when she is alone in her apartment with Shio she is warm and loving and kind. A lot of Satou\u2019s actions can be viewed as her protecting Shio from the cruel outside world.\\n\\n\r\nOverall I think the art direction does a great job at complimenting the themes of the story. The symbols and motifs are quite potent and the general tone and style of the art helps accentuate dark themes and makes dramatic moments more impactful. The actual themes themselves delve into deep moral questions. The moral questions are not forced down the audience\u2019s throat but rather they present themselves naturally through the interesting and compelling actions of the characters and the conflicts they have with each other.\\n\\n\r\nHappy Sugar Life had an interesting effect on me. While individual actions by Satou are pretty clearly objectively reprehensible I still end up with this feeling like she isn\u2019t wrong. This conflict between my thoughts and my feelings is at the core of why I like this show. This show took a character who does bad things for an arguably unjustifiable motive and it made me like her. Satou is damaged and flawed and I really think that I shouldn\u2019t support her but I can\u2019t help it. Her fight just feels right to me because she is fighting for love. So while \u201call\u2019s fair in love and war\u201d can be picked apart with logical arguments, it still just feels right. Maybe not everything is fair in the pursuit or defence of love but in Satou\u2019s case I feel like she is good. And if I\u2019ve learned anything from this show, it\u2019s that good things are worth fighting for.",

I've watched : Bannana Fish, Cell anime, Dropkick-chan, Chio-Chan, Asobi Asobase, Angels of death and Angolmois. \r\nHanebado, Attack on titan and Grand Blue \r\nThis anime however stood out very much for me. Don't listen to all the \" This Anime is for edgy 12 year olds\" etc... spam. They are obviously the immature ones (with awful taste I might add...). This Anime is a perfect blend of Mystery/Suspense/Horror with warm cute shoujo. And no, this is NOT a Yuri anime, however much it seems like.\r\n*Story/Premise: Is about a brokengirl struggling to live a normal and happy life with a person who showed her true love (caring love not sexual) for the first time ever in her life, under the harshness and unfairness of life and the people in it. This show has the cuteness of slice of life and moe anime, mixed and executed perfectly with dark/mystery and Horror. It'll give you the chills a badass anime with amazing Mikasa eyes does but also give you the warm sweet sugar feeling that a slice of life does. HIGHLY RECOMMEND! \\n\\n\r\nWhat this anime does phenomenally:\\n\r\n- Characters and their psych\\n\r\n-Tension /Atmosphere \\n\r\n-Unique loveable Art style\\n\r\n-Mystery that is especially dark\\n\r\n- Satou is Yandere Queen! (Sorry Yuno) \\n\\n\r\nFor me this has great great potential and might even become one of my personal top favorite anime. I'm in Japan rn for a vacation, and once I saw this, Oh hot damn I knew I had to get the manga fast.",

            "content": "Happy Sugar Life is a show where all the human beings are sick and suffer more than anyone else in the city. I consider the story a bit exaggerated. Also, I cannot understand how some can highly praise the series after criticizing Eromanga sensei, Citrus, School Days to name some.\r\nFor example, several spectators cannot stand Citrus' assault. However, they can accept a teenager that has committed murder and locks a young girl of no more 6 \u2013 8 years old in an apartment. They accept many other cases of abuse and assault portrayed in this series. Additionally, the series introduces the denigrations of societybut in a way where almost all the cast is ill and pervert under the flag \u201cthat is love.\u201d I forgot the pedophilia references but it is not a taboo in this anime in comparison with other series. The audience accepts it because the series has the psychological, horror and shounen tag. In my case, I only have a word for this, incoherence. In this fantastic world, all the antisocials, ill persons, demons, converged. I think the author forgot recreating some demonic ritual to add more emotion to the plot. \\n\\n\r\nThe plot 4/10\\n\\n\r\nThe plot is very easy to follow and too fantastic to digest it. We have a little girl called Shio, who is the center of all the story. She has a rough past but irradiates the purity of a young person free of any illness of the evil world, and she is a beacon of hope. One day a teenager, Satou, finds her and magically fallen in love with her (it is called a psychological twist\u2026no, it is called incoherence). However, Satou that felt empty now is a complete person and will do everything in her hand to be with her beloved, but the deprivations of the world already contaminated her mind, and Satou\u2019s actions are total madness and too fantastic to be accepted. The rest of the story is a rollercoaster where the author adds more and more suffering to entertain the audience and several bitten it. Ironically as it looks, in this unreal story, the little girl knows and understands the meaning of love more than the rest of the cast, and I consider it an interesting outcome. For me, the plot fluctuates from average to acceptable with some minor high peaks at the end. Also, the lack of reality in a psychological narrative is a huge mistake because some will interpret the plot as absurd and comical. One of the most important factors in horror and psychological thrill is the reality contrasted with the unreality, but this show is unreality contrasted with unreality the result is a series with some useless scenes where the characters are wasted and distorts the plot development. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters 5/10\\n\\n\r\nAlmost all the characters are generic. Yes, the face and the madness is interesting, but almost ALL the characters are the same. They are ill silhouettes with a different perversion or suffering. Only two of them have a credible background the rest are a pit of emotional sickness. One positive point is how the author maintained Shio\u2019s personality. She is the most mature character in a nest of failed characters (Mitsuboshi) and wasted ones (spoiler). Also, she is the character that has a healthy progression, but for her age, some can think that it is a sci-fi achievement.  On the other hand, the relation between Shio and Satou gives the impression of a relationship between a mother and a child, but in the last episodes, the relationship has a significant evolution that could have appeared early in the middle of the story.\\n\\n\r\nThe art and the sound 7/10\\n\\n\r\nThe series creates a normal contrast between a colorful world and the pervert and sick one. However, that variation is basic in any horror and psychological film or series. Also, there is good camera management. Sadly, some parts of the art are rough and are not finished correctly. Some angles are very ugly and with wrong proportions.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound and the OST are normal. The OP is a mix of soft and hard sounds to create the sensation between good and mad. \\n\\n\r\nThe verdict is very simple; you should skip this show if you cannot handle an inconsistent plot, pedophilia, and irrealistic horror treatment because you could end complaining of the outcome. \\n\\n\\n\r\nExtra information\\n\r\nSeason rank 337 (246 points) in Japan\\n",

            "content": "Happy Sugar Life (HSL) is a psychological horror about normal people being pushed to their limits. Throughout this show, contrasts are stressed and found in every way possible as I will be discussing throughout this review.\r\nArt 8/10: One of HSL's best attributes.\r\nStudio Ez\u03ccla has opted for a pretty basic art style for this Anime. The surroundings or backgrounds are simple, but never feels fake or takes away from the original style, so no points deducted from that. This is the best example of where you can see contrasts being used. In happy or cheerful scenes, the colors used are extremely bright and sparkly. The colorscale also shifts more to red to give that \"alive\" and \"warm\" feeling. And on certain scenes the art turns extremely dark. The entire scene gets washed in a blue like hue to give of this \"dead\" and \"cold\" feeling. HSL also uses the \"eyes are the windows to the soul\" saying to its fullest. In some scenes the eyes of the characters change drastically to reflect their inner struggles. Subtle things like the eyes giving of a burning sensation when the characters are engulfed in in anger is a nice touch and is sometimes pretty hard to see unless you look carefully.\\n\r\nThere is almost never really on-screen violence in the Anime. The Anime uses visual hints as well accompanying sound effects to make you visualize those scenes for yourself. Which is what makes this Anime a truly psychological Anime. \\n\\n\r\nSound 8/10: The Opening explores this contrasts theme a bit more. The OP begins with a innocent voice and a happy sounding tone. The Opening then switches to a more deep tone and the singer (Akari Nanawo) sings in a more intimidating tone. \\n\r\nThe Ending has an overall calm tone to help with pressure release and the end of the episode.\\n\r\nThe OST is subtle but effective, builds tension when it must and sets the overall tone for the scene when needed. In some stages the lack of an OST is also used to give a false sense of security to the viewer before taking you by surprise.\\n\r\nThe special insert song used in its respective episode was used to support the visual metaphor of the arc as well as support the feelings of the character the arc focuses on.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters 9/10: The characters are all introduces as normal people. On the surface they all look trustworthy. All the characters are in respectable positions and are in some cases even idolized, but then their insanity meter gets turned up to 11 if they are pushed overboard. Contrasts are once again used here, down to the names of our two main characters, Satou (sugar) and Shio (salt). On the topic of names. The names of the characters all have a meaning to what they provided or represents in the Anime. If you are done watching the Anime I would recommend searching the meaning of their names. The characters feel real in the sense they all have the inner struggles that we as humans are fighting everyday. The only part where this subtracts from realism is the fact that so many characters snap around the main character.\\n\\n\r\nStory 9/10: The story is pretty dark. Themes are explored which is not really that common in some Anime. Which once again brings it back to the contrasts. All of the characters are looking for their \"Happy Sugar Life.\" Yet they don't see that by searching for this happiness they keep on leaving despair and once they find this \u201cideal\u201d life, they are confused as to why they are not happy. The story intentionally makes you empathize with the main character. Which I would say is hard to do as if you take the character out and place them in the real world, this member would be hated. The story does a great job in making you root and care for a really repulsive being. The pacing is not something to complain about. Not too fast and not too slow. The ending was a bit abrupt and for many was a bit distasteful.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 10/10: Why I liked it: The use of all the above discussed means to tell a pretty dark story was something I enjoyed a lot. The overall usage of contrasts was also something that I liked a lot. Studio Ez\u03ccla did a pretty fine job in their first Anime and I am looking forward to more of their word if they are to pursue more titles in the future. I have since then bought the Manga for this and the adaptation done by the Studio was pretty good. The ending was also fully original as the Manga stopped around episode 11.\\n\\n\r\nWhy You might not like it:\\n\r\nThe story is not a Happy Sugar Life. It is a psychological horror that keeps you asking \"Is this really OK?\", \"Are we the baddies?\" and \"Why am I rooting for this person?\" Even though there is never really that much on-screen violence. The Anime keep hinting towards what happened and the means in which this violence occurred. The ending was for some a bit distasteful. The story is about a relationship between a child and a high-school student. I think those are the main reasons you would not like this Anime. I would also not recommend this as a first Anime for someone just starting out, unless they like Horror or similar shows to this.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 9/10: I was really impressed by this Anime. With a totally new Studio and a director which has only directed a few Anime in the past, my expectations for HSL was pretty low. But as the story progressed I could see the effort the director and the animators put in to make this first project a huge success in my opinion.",

My first reaction is.\r\nYea..no..yea..no..yeaaa!\r\nHappy sugar life is the new addition this season that currently have only 6 episode released as of this moment. And I already watched them all.\r\nThe main character Matsuzaka Satou, voiced by Hanazawa, Kana is a freshman highschooler that works at a cafe to finance her life with Shio Koube a 4 year old child(approx).\r\nStory revolves how she maintains a nice appearance with people around her at school and work until her relationship with Shio Koube gets challenged. Andyeah shit will hit the fan.\\n\\n\r\nWhat would a psycho do out of pure love? Every scene would appear to be predictable but the very intricate execution of the feelings of the character and how it's drawn and presented makes it feel really unique and stimulating. And the moments of what she called happy sugar life brings out a different aura on the scenes that makes it refreshing.\\n\\n\r\nThe darkness of the plot will keep you glued in anxiety hoping that everything would work out but obviously wouldn't. And the kind of questions that arouses every episode will keep me hanging and waiting for more to come.\\n\\n\r\nOverall this is a very unique genre and obviously not for everyone. But if you enjoy dark plots with a twist of eye gouging and pedo kissing then this is for you.\\n\\n\r\nThe only problem I have is that it feels like everyone here has a mental disorder but yeah I still enjoyed the show.",

            "content": "Too often people confuse perversion and degeneracy with a demarcation of intrigue. This anime in particular deals with plenty of themes that stray from the path of God including homosexuality, killing, affairs, pedophilia, probably rape, but so what? In the end it doesn't make any sense. \r\nIf I had to guess the train molestor manga artist who came  up with this story was trying to convey the idea that people are all fucked up by writing in characters who lead somewhat normal lives with an intense perverted quirk about them, like BnH for pedophiles. I don't think it works, their backstories aren't fleshed outenough to derive a definitive conclusion at this point, but from what I've seen up to episode 5 is that their deviancy doesn't come from strong enough of a place. \\n\\n\r\nThe formula thus far has been to introduce another freak in each episode and you have a too many cooks in the kitchen situation that could be seen as a interesting and interwoven plot but none of that matters because from the set up you can already see the ending. The mystery box fails to contain its self and the plot is tracked on a cliched line where all the twists were noticed from the end of the first episode. \\n\\n\r\nAlso there is no real suspense each episode follows the same basic punches, you get a cliff hanger moment that gets resolved with no consequences, then the \"sweet\" portion, then they introduce another degenerate, then there is the \"bitter\" portion which ends with a cliff hanger that gets resolved immediately in the next episode. \\n\\n\r\nAnytime there is momentum it gets immediately torn away and you get 15 minutes of boring daily shit that has no purpose seemingly, all the resolutions are nonsensical like the author didn't think of them before introducing the problem and just needed to submit some shit before the deadline. I guess I'm just trudging along at this point because the original premise was interesting but this anime actually just sucks.\\n\\n\\n\r\n4/10\\n",

            "content": "TL;DR: Built on an unrealistic setting, but turns out pretty well \r\nPeople usually have different perspectives on a subject whether this is right or wrong, good or bad? In Happy Sugar Life, this subject of matter is greatly reflected, whether in the anime community or inside the story.Generally speaking, people think this anime is trying to hard to be edgy.However,this anime isn't a straight edgy anime, which gives you a lot of death or violent scenes. This anime is kinda dark in another way around on the characters conflicts and the atmosphere, which is better than most dark anime in my opinion.\r\n+Great character interactions\r\n+Descriptive characterstories\\n\r\n+Interesting story followed by mysteries\\n\r\n+The atmosphere is kinda well-built\\n\\n\r\n-Slow paced\\n\r\n-the plot is built on an unrealistic setting\\n\\n\r\nTo begin with, this story is built on an unrealistic setting, which may bother someone around. Like \"Satou love a little girl called Shio and Satou's aunt is sick\", but let me tell you, this anime is intended to be like this because it's supposed to be a dark anime and like I mentioned just now, this anime is better than most dark anime, because Happy Sugar Life isn't built on death scenes. If you are sick with dark anime,which gives you violent scenes directly. This is an anime for you, so why would Happy Sugar Life being called as a dark anime? This is because the atmosphere is built on characters solely. The relationship built up is based on some wrong perspectives or past events. The reason why Satou like Shio and they love each other is mainly because of their tragic stories and they found their own love, although in general public we think they're definitely wrong, but I think this is what the writer want to reflect on. This anime doesn't need many violent scenes, as it's already more than enough.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters' stories are presented pretty perfectly, it explains well on their tragic events about their childhood and why would the main characters conclude with this kind of relationship from the scratch till the ending. Including the side characters, they all have their own aims and thoughts, which lately on resulting in large conflicts and it's pretty amazing. The inner feelings of the characters are done really well, like they asked themselves whether this kind of action is right or not. It's pretty interesting. For those who hate dark twisting anime in general, they wouldn't appreciate this anime in this kind of way, as they already dislike the setting in general, so you should consider on your preference whether you would accept this kind of storytelling or not.\\n\\n\r\nThe only issue I have in this anime is it's kinda slow-paced, as it solely focus on the characters, the plot doesn't really move, it can be the whole episode talking about characters' inner feelings and past events, while the present events don't really move a lot, which someone may feel bored occasionally for people who are looking for thrilling events, but it doesn't affect much to the storytelling, as I generally enjoy what I have watched from Happy Sugar Life.\\n\\n\r\nIn short, Happy Sugar Life isn't a typical dark anime, it's a dark anime built on characters relationships, what this anime is lacking of is the pace control, which I think personally this anime could insert more story events, but if thinking from the characters aspect, this anime has already done more than enough. The journey is enjoyable and interesting.\\n\\n\r\nI think the animation is done pretty great, it fits the dark elements pretty well with gloomy textures and shadowing, but the character designs look kinda identical, same eyes drawings, similar face shapes, maybe it's because of the authors' style preferences, but personally I think they could make it a little bit different, so that each character looks more unique. The sound effects are done pretty good, many background music and sound effects are used.Though, I think they could insert more throughout the scenes and events.The op and ed gives me the feeling of the dark atmosphere,which are pretty well-themed. Voice actors are pretty awesome too, Hanazawa Kana is in this anime voicing as Satou, which anime fans can't miss this out.\\n\\n\r\nIf you are sick of the ordinary dark anime, this is a refreshing option to you, but if you dislike dark anime in general, you shouldn't consider this anime, because this anime is built on an unrealistic setting that you may bother with. Whether you agree with my points or not, it's up to you, but I just want to tell you that this anime is great in my opinion, that's all.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 8/10 (A)\\n\r\nAnimation: 8/10 (A)\\n\r\nSound: 8.5/10 (A+)\\n\r\nCharacters: 9/10 (S)\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8/10 (A)\\n\r\nOverall: 8.3/10 (A)",

            "content": "No one in the world is an absolute saint or perfect, there are some sides to people you just don't know...\r\nHappy Sugar Life looks one such person wanting as much sweet happiness but her \"methods\" and \"ideals\" are not exactly right.\r\nSatou Matsuzaka voiced by Kana Hanazawa is that person when she found Shio Koube voiced by Misaki Kuno and the key word here being \"FOUND\". See Satou is someone who has a corrupted view on what love is as she never knew what love is and her experiencing love in the real world had been fruitless to say the least until she found that happiness,that sugar that fills her jar that being Shio and she'll do ANYTHING to keep her secret life, secret from everyone. The thing the majority of the cast have a screw loose, deriving from their desires in some of the more extreme ways, such as Daichi Mitaumekawa voiced by Kaito Ishikawa, a womanizer, even though he's married and has children but he wants that \"thrill\" of not getting caught and the pleasure of it all which his drives lustful desires, Taiyou Mitsuboshi is also one though not at first, wanting to be pure through Shio due to his extreme phobia of older woman and like Satou will do anything to see Shio. \\n\\n\r\nIf Happy Sugar Life is telling anything is looking into society and how it expects everyone to be \"normal\" but sometimes people wants to break away from that conformity and find their own \"happiness\" their own way and sure some of these characters are unhinged to the point of absurdity but the thing is, LA thinks some of these cases of madness some of these characters go through have some level of relatability towards them especially looking at Satou's views on happiness and love (of course not her...killy killy side).\\n\\n\r\nHappy Sugar Life at a first glance looks like something you'd stay far away from it's premise especially with Satou and Shio's relationship but diving deeper into Satou's mindset as well as what it's other unhinged minor characters brings us to the table, Happy Sugar Life is more or less telling of what it takes to gain your happiness and what the lengths people will do to keep that \"happiness\" from disappearing. Yeah and the thing is if you think Shio is all pure due to her being a kid...well think again, by the end of the anime, LA thought that they SHOULD be together considering how fucked up both of them were, almost like society itself has pushed them to be together and all the more better for that in LA's opinion. The only two characters LA thought had some semblance of normalcy were Shouko Hida voiced by Aya Suzaki, Satou's friend and colleague at work as well as Asahi Koube voiced by Yumiri Hanamori, Shio's older brother who's looking for her, but the only one to succumb and get batshit insane became Asahi, almost becoming his own worst nightmare as to what HE was trying to achieve in order to do it.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation done by Ezo'la was actually pretty good, from the character designs to the typical background work, but where Ezo'la's animation shines is in it's psychological take on Satou and Shio's mindset and how they visualize as it gets into some very creepy and psychologically damaging visuals and considering the viewpoint and narrative focus is mainly on Satou, the animation work done to visualize her psyche was amazingly done well, be it the symbolism of her \"sweets jar\" or how her psyche gets more and more corrupted as Satou does increasingly irredeemable things is telling of how the good animation is on that front. Ezo'la really outdid themselves really.\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of voice acting, well we have LOTS of playing against the type roles, from the first one LA can think of being Yumiri Hanamori crossdressing role as Asahi Koube to Aya Suzaki as Shouko in a fairly laid back role (where she was usually typecasted into a genki role). MVP's easily goes to Kana Hanazawa as she easily holds this anime from her cutezy moe vocals and instantly change to a menacing, bloodlustful murderer the next, Misaki Kuno was amazing as well, in doing sure, some of her typical typecasted roles, but this time as an unhinged and psychologically damaged little girl that is more than she seems, as considering she had the same amount of screentime as Kana Hanazawa, Miskai Kuno had some great chemistry with Kana in the process, lastly would be Yumiri Hanamori, no not only because of her crossdressing roles but how much of a \"playing against the type\" role she played as Asahi, both appearance AND personality wise as to how he was near the end of the anime, how she HAMMED it up to acceptable levels. Happy Sugar Life really casted some great voice actors into Happy Sugar Life and really got them out of their comfort zone (well maybe except Kana Hanazawa) and it bloody shows through it's entire cast!\\n\\n\r\nHappy Sugar Life is an invariably deep look into \"happiness\" to the most extreme degree and how people will do to get it. Satou and Shio's relationship is the focal point of this entire anime and the relationship itself is point of contention to Satou and Shio both as characters, Satou for her corrupted views on happiness and her will and devotion to get it no matter to the point of murder, Shio with her family backstory and how she got to where she was and sure at first being oblivious to what is going on, but soon showing that not even Shio isn't as pure as she is though not of her own volition as it shows that even society can poison the most purest people. But nonetheless Happy Sugar Life's view on society of how people thinking everyone is pure is an outright lie, that people deep down have corruption hidden in them and sure Happy Sugar Life shows this to the extreme but Happy Sugar Life' social commentary of this is nothing but impactful at large when concerning Satou and Shio's relationship and how society shuns their happiness, be it for not \"being normal and conform\" or individuals wanting to steal their happiness away. Really LA was expecting much more of a gorefest from Happy Sugar Life, but LA got more of a psychological dive into a mind of person who wants nothing more than happiness in ANY ways possible to get it and by all means Happy Sugar Life delivered it with conviction and great execution (no pun intended) to display it, Happy Sugar Life was crazy, psychotic and psychologically relatable hell of a ride and LA loved every moment of it...\\n\\n\r\nLA's jar feels empty now since Happy Sugar Life finished..LA needs more sweets...",

            "content": "Where do I even start. (I will be posting some spoilers throughout so keep that in mind if you read on.)\r\nHappy Sugar Life was an anime of the 2018 Summer Season that caught my attention in the first couple of episodes. It was something that gave me almost School Days like vibes with the way it presented itself. This isn't necessarily a bad thing as I am one of the fans of how that series portrayed itself as almost a deconstruction of the harem genre.\r\nThis however, crumbled into a real mess as the show progressed and I put it on the back burner as Iwasn't really enthralled to watch the series. The first couple of episodes were pretty good and set an initial tone to the show which I actually enjoyed. Seeing Satou and her \"Yandere\" moments early on were some of the interesting moments of the show.\\n\\n\r\nI'll section this into categories from here.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 3/10\\n\\n\r\nAs I said, the initial couple of episodes were actually pretty decent and set a dark tone without going overboard on the whole creepy side. As the show continued it became a series with very little substance. If I had to name it, you could almost call it Stockholm Syndrome the anime. Shio is essentially under house arrest by Satou and locked away from the outside world all day until she comes home. She is so naive that she doesn't seem to notice anything wrong with this situation for a good long time. Just when you think she is going to rebel against Satou because of this, she then reverts and accepts everything, even the fact that Satou has killed someone in the apartment while she was there. The best character and the main source of reason was easily Shoko who provides moments of normalcy throughout the plot. However when she is killed off for what almost feels like shock value after triggering so many death flags, the story becomes damn near ridiculous. The finale was honestly something I was looking forward to as I was genuinely hoping for Satou to truly suffer for the pain and anguish she had caused the rest of the cast. Instead she got hit once and was able to die the happiest she has ever been. At least School Days has a satisfying conclusion in comparison and he got what he deserved. Satou did far worse than Makoto ever did and she got so much more leniency. The final scene with Shio was genuinely creepy and it feels like Satou had managed to perform one last despicable act in screwing up someone else's concept of love to the point where it will probably hurt others as she did herself.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 4/10\\n\\n\r\nThe art was fairly bland and certainly nothing special. The expressions were pretty good but outside of that there was nothing of particular note. I was watching it on stream and the scenes with black and white scrawlings over the screen played hell with the buffering. I understand why they were there but they felt lazy. Add to the fact that most of the anime was still frames, it made it feel half-assed and lazy. Almost like they were hoping the shock value of the plot would cover up any discrepancies.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 4/10\\n\\n\r\nThere were no stand out moments in the soundtrack. The OP and ED were fine but certainly nothing special. Certainly not on my download list or anything like that.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 4/10\\n\\n\r\nThis is probably the main point of contention as this was the focus of the anime all in. Character traits were taken to extreme levels to the point of being totally unbelievable.\\n\r\nSatou couldn't find love until she kidnapped an elementary school loli who just happened to smile nicely and hold her hand. \\n\r\nShio is honestly hard to make heads nor tails of. She was essentially Satou's prisoner for weeks/months and eventually rejected everyone else just because Satou \"loved\" her. Watching her turn against her brother in the final episode was honestly rage inducing.\\n\r\nTaiyou was downright creepy and as much as I find lolis cute, this guy was one step off plucking a child off a playground just to sniff her hair. It was distressful to watch and his fate was one I didn't mind as it honestly served him right.\\n\r\nShoko as I said was the main saving grace of the show and kept some semblance of common sense throughout the characters during any time she was on screen. Her interactions with Asahi were honestly the highlight of the show and I won't deny there had to have been a ship out there for them among the fanbase.   \\n\r\nAsahi was the real tragedy of this whole series. He spends his life trying to reunite his family and goes from getting the crap beat out of him by random guys he meets to being rejected by his sister after finally finding her. I genuinely felt for him as the plot was so against him for the whole show.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 5/10\\n\\n\r\nIt was fun, in a cringy way, the first couple of episodes were nice and interesting to watch, however as the show progressed I found it harder and harder to enjoy as things kept getting more screwed up. Seeing another \"fingernail\" scene reminiscent of Higurashi was absolutely horrifying for me and I found it very difficult to maintain my focus on the show for the remainder of that episode. I would have enjoyed it more had the series had a satisfying payoff but sadly it didn't deliver.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 4/10\\n\\n\r\nSo yeah we got a show with rage inducing moments like School Days, however this doesn't have nearly as memorable an ending as the former and will no doubt fall into obscurity like a lot other \"horror\" anime. It's a shame too as it had potential at the start.",

            "content": "Happy Sugar Life is a good example of horror, craziness, and is certainly capable of ushering in an age of atmospheric horror and scares just from the characters, and art style alone. I believe it is certainly a step forward for anime that have an emphasis on psychology and mentality.\r\nStory (4/10): I don't believe I'm at liberty to say that the story (at least, at this point of episode 5), is in the best shape. Deriving enjoyment purely from the base plot of \"how far would you go in the name of love\" was certainly enough to reel me in. I believe that the storyis most certainly surreal in how it is presented\u2014everyone is adapted to common real-world normality. Grow up, go to school, graduate, and move on... but it certainly changes shape here. It appears that every character has something just a tiny bit off, not off enough to make you actually feel scared, but off enough to be bothered. That's how surreal horror should be played out. Normality, with tipped scales. The backstory is, well... we can't get too much of that. Not enough is presented for me to make good judgement.\\n\\n\r\nArt (9/10): The art certainly has an emphasis on reflecting psychological state. The art motifs of pink fluffiness, sweets, and candies are attributed to a state of flow and happiness, and the art motifs of jagged, uneven bolded lines lacking uniform and presenting a deep void of uncertainty follows the more dark sides of this show. I wouldn't say that the regular art is anything overly fantastic, but I rated this as a 9/10 as to how it is employed in this fashion. It's certainly very unique, you don't see this too often.\\n\\n\r\nSound (5/10): I'd say it's... alright. Can't say it's too bad or too good, but it is... fine. Average.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter (6/10): Let me clear this up. I enjoy this all for the unique personalities, they don't seem to deviate or make any exceptions. They are clearly defined and beautiful. Each and every character is unique to some degree, but they lack backstory to reinforce these identities. They laid a strong foundation, but they need to add more substance for this cake! But it'll likely be covered in later episodes.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (9/10): Despite all that I've said, Happy Sugar Life is certainly capable of making your heart jump. It can make you break into a cold sweat, and make you sit and stay there in suspense. What's gonna happen next? What are the next moves? Who is she? What does this mean? You'll ask yourself so many questions, afflicted by the art and character personalities just enough to make you yearn for the next episode in search of answers.\\n\\n\r\nOverall (7/10): Real good! Looking forward to seeing more, maybe that'll bump these scores up a lot more!",

            "content": "This anime was ridiculous in all the wrong ways. Attempts to capitalize more on the fetishes of each introduced antagonist instead of actually writing a compelling story and creating characters that aren't so surface-level in both appearance and personality. I'm all in for some crazy shenanigans involving a Yandere, but this is as basic as it gets, as in, there's other anime featuring Yandere that are way more refreshing or at least conceptually alluring than this shallow show.\r\nWow, these characters are crazy! Wow, these characters are crazy! Wow... these characters are... stupid. Yeah, I know, can we get something new?\r\nThis is not a slife-of-life orcomedy (this anime's attempts at humor fall flat), this is a show about a Yandere maintaining her Happy Sugar Life. How sweet. Except there's nothing remotely interesting about it. This anime is completely mediocre. The Yandere, Satou Matsuzaka, feels true love for the first time (very original) and decides to kidnap her beloved. Who is a child. Everything then falls into place and for some reason, Ms. Matsuzaka keeps meeting all these crazy weirdos who are surprisingly worse than her and all situations involving them feel contrived and pointless. As I was watching this anime, all I could think about was how can you side with the protagonist? There's no one you can actually truly root for. \\n\\n\r\nI like the Yandere type of character but this one is just shallow and uninspired. She's the sole driving force of whatever happens in the show and the perspective is usually around her but sweet Jesus, 99% of dialogue is stating how crazy she is and how much she dislikes people getting in the way of her love life. \"Bitter, I'm going to go crazy, You don't know what true love feels like,\" is pretty much all she says. And all the other character's dialogue is absurd, too. There's a scene where a guy gets aroused from a little girl touching his hand, as if he's never felt physical contact from the opposite gender before, and I gotta ask. What's the point? Why? Why keep introducing all these messed up characters if none of them lack any depth or substance. They're personalities are cardboard cut-outs designed for weak conflict. The story is just filled with predictability and is too straightforward for its own good.\\n\\n\r\nThat said, I'm fine with the animation and sound. Those two aspects aren't much for trouble but they aren't the anime's saving grace either.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, I didn't like this. I was bored the whole time. I like trash. You know, anime like Overlord. But at least that's entertaining. This type of trash isn't. It takes itself too seriously and tries so hard to warrant a reaction from us because, look! Disgusting characters! Wow! And that's all there is. Nothing remarkable, nothing that makes it stand out apart from its Yandere-centered premise. Only curiosity could make you watch more.\\n\\n\r\nFive episodes have been out so far. I've watched four of them. This might redeem itself in the future but right now, I can't say I can recommend this very early on.",

            "content": "Well, this is the first review I'm writing here, and I hope it helps someone if any of you are as indecisive as I am. \r\nAs a disclaimer, I'd just like to say this anime still has ample time to surprise us since there are 7 episodes left in its run time as of this review. However, if you're looking to be wowed, this is probably not the show for you. If you are lured because of its supposed Yuri themes, this is also not the show for you. And I'll tell you why below with as little spoilery information as possible. \r\nStory: Don't getme wrong, Happy Sugar Life was alright so far, and by no means was I bored. Nonetheless, there...just isn't much of a story going on. They teased repeatedly at some kind of deeper plot going on behind the scenes, but they failed to go farther than that. It's a surface level kind of show in my opinion. If that's not your speed, I highly suggest looking elsewhere.\\n\\n\r\nWhat actually does happen in each episode is a new (slightly random) problem presents itself for the MC, and she finds creative ways to solve them. As you can imagine from the description, these are often brutal ways. It plays out more like a fan-fiction for people who are interested in Yandere characters vs. an engaging story with depth and purpose if you know what I mean.\\n\\n\r\nAs far as Yuri goes, well, let's just say it's not at all what you're probably thinking. It is not a romance in the traditional sense. Similar to how people were shocked to find out Yuri on Ice did not involve two women falling in love, you'll be disappointed if that's the reason you start watching Happy Sugar Life.\\n\\n\r\nArt: I will say I'm not very picky when it comes to art. That said, I didn't find anything wrong whatever that's worth. In fact, I thought it was rather special how they executed different frames from time to time. The colors used, the angles, and the character designs all blended excellently.  I hate it when art styles subtract from the atmosphere of the anime. That definitely did not happen here. It may not have gone above and beyond, but it was intriguing indeed, and I thought the animation was a high point for this piece.\\n\\n\r\nSound: I wouldn't say there was anything special going on with the sound; it was simply not a distraction. None of the tracks particularly stood out to me. If you want a fabulous OST that speaks to you, my advice is to find an anime Sawano Hiroyuki or Takanashi Yasuharu worked on. If you just want to watch and don't put a lot of weight on the music, you should be fine with this one. The voice actors were quite talented however, especially Hanazawa Kana as Satou, but that's where the noteworthiness ends. Everything else purely matched the tone.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: For me, this was Happy Sugar Life's weakest element. Unfortunately, I just wasn't led to care about what happens to most of the characters. It might be because they are mainly built around adding shock value, or it might be because the events unfolding were too uninteresting. Whatever it was, the fact remains if I can't care about the characters, I can't get too invested in the plot either no matter how involved it is. And Happy Sugar Life already wasn't attempting to present a story heavy show. In this anime, the characters are there to move the viewer from one scene to the next. They don't seem to have much of anything else going for them. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: I'm sure this is the least objective factor, but I think it is still worth mentioning I did enjoy what I've seen so far to some degree. It may not have been mind-blowing or exciting beyond it's inherently dark narrative, but it was at least a decent method of passing the time.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: I would give this show a 5. It isn't especially unique, but it isn't anywhere near the worst I've seen either. if you're bored or can't find any anime you haven't seen lately, I do think this one is worth a shot at least. It may just fascinate you more than it did me. Just don't bite in expecting a gourmet dinner when what you're getting is Subway; on that account, I'm afraid you may be left bitter.",

            "content": "\"Let's get married!\" -A loli and a pink haired psycho girl.\r\nThis is one of those anime that you either like it or you hate it. The story revolves around a relationship of a loli and a psychotic girl with pink hair, so obviously it isn't for everyone. If you like yanderes and a bunch of messed up horror then you will probably like this. if you want a show actually about a happy sugar life then probably stay away.\r\nStory 6/10\r\nThe story is pretty hit or miss and it is nothing special. The horror aspect is nothing new but the story can be a nice changeafter watching some happier anime. Starts off as a basic Yuri anime and slowly spirals into a bunch of people turning into psychopaths. Not the most amazing thing ever but can be pretty entertaining.\\n\\n\r\nArt 7/10\\n\r\nThe art is pretty simple but not bad. The mix of vibrant and dark colours really fit the theme of this show and when they are used correctly can be pretty cool. There are no overused effects and nothing is overdone to the point of making it look bad. Again, it is simple but does the job\\n\\n\r\nSound 7/10\\n\r\nThe opening of this anime can be kind of catching and sets up the premise of the show really well. As for OST's, there were definitely a few missed opportunities to put in a great spookier soundtrack but for the most part the music and sound effects fit pretty well. As for acting, some characters felt pretty plain but others sounded pretty good.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters 6/10\\n\r\nReviewing the characters is kind of difficult when they re all mentally screwed, so i'm rating this based on how well they were presented, which was OK at best. Sure it was interesting watching them all get pushed to their breaking points but other than that not much really stands out about them. All of them lack emotion and meaning and they are incredibly hard to relate to. Some of their actions seem stupid and pointless. However I'll excuse a few things that could have been improved because of the type of anime this is. You aren't really supposed to relate with anyone, but instead watch them make choices and do things that you shouldn't be able to relate to (unless you are psychotic).\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 7/10\\n\r\nA fun watch and it is definitely interesting, but amazing? Nah. It is one of those anime you watch for the sake of curiosity and although it may have been entertaining it is nothing amazing. The storyline is nothing original although some parts can feel a bit refreshing from the usual horror\\n\\n\r\nOverall 7/10\\n\r\nAre you a lolicon? Are you psychotic? Do you like yuri? If your answer to all of these is yes (Which I seriously hope is not) then you will love this. If you like horror or yuri pedophilia then I suggest you try this. Whether or not you you like this really just comes down to what you are interested in. I recommend giving it around 3 episodes, if you are hating it drop it, if you are somewhat liking it it gets slightly better later on so maybe stick around until the end.",

            "content": "God this was painful to watch.\r\nI don't want to waste your time as this anime does, so i'll go straight to the point: this is literally the worst thing i have ever seen and it's the edgiest thing i remember ever finishing. Of course, i only finished this because it was fun as hell to watch with someone else, i could not have standed a single episode if i was alone.\r\nThe first reason is because it's ugly, the only decently looking thing is the opening because it's so obviously \"inspired\" by that mahou shoujo anime everyone knows about and some glitch effects that you'll seein indie horror games. Aside from that, the color design is exhaustive to watch and distracting, everything is way too bright and the backgrounds are totally generic, it has stupid tone shifts to increase the edgeness meter and voice distortion that doesn't come off as disturbing or uncomfortable in a good way, but as cringy and laughable.\\n\\n\r\nThe whole production of this show sucks, almost every character looks like shit or is decently looking at times but still generic, so nothing of interesting to look at or drag your attention.\\n\\n\r\nOh, the characters, if you can even say they're characters.\\n\\n\r\nLiterally everyone's a psycho for stupid reasons, there's not enough background or suffering to make their personality changes believable, it's just misery porn, and bad misery porn at that. There's sadist characters because it has to be edgy and there's masochistic characters because it has to be edgy, everyone's moved by some superficial obsession or things that COULD have been believable if they were given more nuance and time to develop. It's that type of show where a lot happens but nothing really happens, it constantly goes back and around itself in a 12 episode cycle of repeating the same uninspired analogies, the same edgy scenes, the same nonsensical phrases and the same ugly places.\\n\\n\r\nYes, no one calls the police because that's too hard, or plot forbidden.\\n\\n\r\nI think saying this was an attempt to portray traumatized minds is an overstatement, there's clearly no attempt at a logical plotline or at giving you a message, it's just edgy for the sake of it. Not to mention the unbelievable character's decisions and irrealistic things such as a child not being bored or smelling the rotten human flesh in the next room, or characters simply allowing other to do what they want to do and later being traumatized or disgusted because of their own stupidity.\\n\\n\r\nThere are things that are not brought up because it would make the anime end faster, such as a guy knowing where Satou works, having her appartment number but not doing anything to find it, instead he asks for another psycho to do it for him, who ends up doing exactly the same thing he did the whole show: being useless and dumb.\\n\\n\r\nBackstories and flashbacks are badly written and shown at inconvenient times, characters are \"developed\" at a single moment and never again, there are scenes where they don't ever bother to attempt an explanation, such as the passaport's scene in the last episode.\\n\\n\r\nWhenever there's an attempt at a foreshadowing, it's so obvious it's bad, something will get mentioned and it will happen in the most predictable way possible, character's jobs and school are ignored which makes it even more obvious that the only life everyone has is being a crazy person. \\n\\n\r\nAlso, the child has the highest IQ of all characters because everyone has to be stupid for a plot as this one to be duable at all, there's no remarkable aspect about it at all, just a lot of conveniences, it gets to the point where the city only appears to have two streets, like, seriously. The brother guy has been looking for this girl in the same place for three months and didn't call the cops even when he had proofs someone had kidnapped her, it's impossible to take it seriously or care about anything.\\n\\n\r\nSo, this show is actually enjoyable in an unintended way, it's so bad it's fun to suffer through and talk to someone about how badly written it is. If you want to learn some stuff about writing than maybe you should give it a go, but what you'll get from it is super basic and you probably already know it.\\n\\n\r\nIt's shit and i hate it.\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "So where to start?\r\nHappy Sugar Life (HSL) fails as a psychological horror.\r\nThat is fine.\r\nDon't go in thinking this is going to be a psychological horror, instead look at this more as a mystery drama.\r\nIt's not a standard \"Problem = Mystery\" style mystery, but instead it's got that sort of Another style mystery where you have a problem, but then the interest is figuring out who the characters are, what's happened leading up to here, etc.\r\nIt's a drama because everything is a drama. Drama is that blanket term for \"things happen, they're not neccesarily fighting, they're not always romance, they're not always [Blank], but they aresometimes\".\\n\\n\r\nThis Anime is about our main protagonist Satou, and our macguffin/second-protagonist Shio. By some means our MP has found Shio and is currently living with her despite the fact that she is an actively sought-after missing person. Satou's main drive then obviously is keeping her as a missing person while they have a romantic relationship.\\n\\n\r\nYes, The lesbian pedophile has a girl locked in her appartment, but the girl doesn't seem to mind.\\n\\n\r\nThat's literally as much plot as I can go into without spoiling this, so let's talk actual meat and potatoes.\\n\\n\r\nThis is a modern-day japan with normal life, but populated entirely by morally wrong people. Everyone's hiding something, everyone's an asshole. Our macguffin, in one way or another, seems to bring these assholes together and, as they do, they end up having confrontations. All the while you're going to be fed crumbs of information into the actual story, either through flashback, literal digging, or just someone's psychotic episode that leads to them no longer repressing some memories.\\n\\n\r\nAll these crumbs of plot start filling in the blanks for the mystery, but then just add more questions ontop of that and bring in more morally questionable situations for you to judge. All up until a breaking point where the current story kicks into high-gear and the mystery is essentially finished so you can wrap up the series and characters that you've spent the past episodes learning about and either loving or hating all with the final drama.\\n\\n\r\nYeah, I'm vague. That review is boring. Just watch this anime, as much shit as it sounds like I've given it, it's amazing. You're going into an anime where the writers dive into a psychopathic main protagonist and I know how much we all love those when they're not written as high-school vampire scene girls. You're not force-fed psychology 101, you're not shown a murder then beaten over the head with how wrong it is. You're just shown a bunch of relatable human characters who're pushed past relatable at times because you don't want to relate to their fucked psychology.\\n\\n\r\nAnd just ignore these dudes who watched 3 episodes and started screaming \"IT'S EDGY, WHY IS THERE A LOLI, THIS IS GROSS, I'M OFFENDED\" because they wanted to voice their opinions on an unfinished anime they decided to immediately wall themselves away from. Watch it and make your own call. It's not like we don't all sit around for 6-12 hours straight binging whole anime series on the weekends anyways.",

The cast consists of only morally and mentally fucked characters; leaving you wondering who you should actually be rooting for; if anyone at all.\r\nIt doesn't have the pleasant surprise of School Live's or Doki Doki's 180 tone change, but nonetheless it's still enjoyable, or at the very least interesting, to watch the darker atmosphere envelope and combine with everybody's favourite genre: cutesy moe blobs.\r\nThe sound direction catches you off guard, eventhough it repeats a lot of the same effects throughout the show, but still proves to be something that ultimately contributes to the intention of establishing how insignificant certain background characters are, or how brutal certain major events in the story actually play out, or what percentage of deranged certain characters are.\\n\\n\r\nHappy Sugar Life's story as a whole takes one sharp turn to redesign its adorable surface into a darker thriller that will keep hold of your attention while challenging your perception of its  unpredictable major cast of characters.",

It contains layers of dark stories and disturbing action done mostly everyone. If you're into things being out of the normal range of human behaviour, this is the anime for you. Bonus points if you like yuri or lolis.\r\nWhat I found this anime being fun is mostly from the protagonists' ability to do evil things. A cute girl who has a dark side waiting to be discovered by the viewer; all to protect her loved one with anything, butwith responsibility and sanity of her own to try to avoid trouble. It builds up with her punishing \"terrible\" people one after another, even if they used to be friends or coworkers she's met with her \"normal\" daily life outside, and dropping it with even darker and darker actions as the anime goes on. I seem to be obsessed with the idea that things get twisted just for maintaining the protagonist's relationship. \\n\\n\r\n10/10 because most parts of it are fun, interesting, and gratifying to watch. The music fits the story and the art style is sweet to the eye. Most importantly, they work together to make the atmosphere fit the storytelling beautifully.",

IF YOU DO NOT AN OPEN MIND TOWARDS THESE MATTERS, THEN THIS SHOW AIN'T IT CHIEF.\r\nNow for those with an open mind, I would potentialluy crown Happy Sugar Life in the run for Anime of the Year (not including sequels) and what it essentially came down to was the writing of the show for me. \r\nTo begin, Happy Sugar Life accomplished something that (based on my viewings was few and far in between) is thatit was capable of keeping me on edge on what the story will end with. A decent chunk of the characters (think Satou and Asahi) who had equally just motivations to stay with Shio; so much so that throughout the second half of the series, I was genuienely wondering how it would end.\\n\\n\r\nSecondly, Happy Sugar Life manages to evoke an empathetic and positive response to the majority of the characters who on paper, should have been universally on my shame list. The writers were so effective at this that I wanted Satou to have Shio in her arms at the end of it who is the same character that has commited multiple acts of homicide and ya know WANTS TO BE IN A RELATIONSHIP WITH AN ACTUAL ELEMENTARY SCHOOL GIRL. \\n\\n\r\nThirdly, Happy Sugar Life doesn't allow the tropes of Yuri and Large Age Gap  relationship anime to define it. The relationship that grows and flourished between Satou and Shio never devloves into the sexual mess that both realtionships seem to bring with it. It took till the endof the series and writing this review to register that it was a yuri relationship with a large age gap.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, I enjoyed the ride this series offered me. My only real complaint about the series is the level of edge the show carries which is minor issue. If this series could be compared to any series I've watched, it would be Scum's Wish, but with the edge and psychological factor cranked up. \\n\\n\r\n8.5/10: Would watch again, reccomend to friends, and financially support.",

There's superaggressive teenagers who beat and rape people in parks and streets, and school girls go around killing people and kidnapping children without any consequences whatsoever. Children walk around the streets alone and weirdos approach them and nobody notices or does a thing. I guess Japan is not a super safe first world country in this universe.\\n\\n\r\nIt's all too convenient for the setting and quite frankly i'm not a fan of that sort of plastic plot in this kind of anime.\\n\\n\r\nAgain, it's not bad, it's just not for everybody. The show looks nice, sounds nice, the characters are decent and the plot, even if super convenient, is alright. You should definitely watch a few episodes before really deciding if this is your thing or not.",

Let me first start off by saying, this had potential to be 10/10 for me, but I'll get into why it isnt for me. \r\nStory: 7 \r\nThe story was unique to me. I've never seen one like it. It had potential to be so good, but for me, I couldn't get over all of the pedophilia. Some of it was necessary or made even just a little but of psychological sense, but some was just so unneeded. Also, I'm not saying pedophilia is justified or okay, but I can see why it develops. Forexample, Satou did not get love as a child and I feel like she seeks love for a child to make up for it. Also, in Taiyou's case, what happened to him in the first episode made sense as to why hes the way he is. He is afraid of older women because of it. Satou's teacher did not need to be as disgusting as he was. They could have done without it. In my opinion, they could have done away with the whole pedophile thing n general and made an even moreamazing story. That is what's holding back my score for the story. I actually was going to drop it if there was any sexual scenes with Shio, but gladly that didnt happen. The ending of the show was really unexpected for me. It also wasnt exactly what I wanted to happen, but I didnt hate it. It was pretty bittersweet. \\n\r\nArt: 8\\n\r\nThe art is pretty unique. It's very cute and colorful. I think it's a great way to express how Satou's now has a happy sugar life. But they also did a great job with expressions. Satou's expressions made her look insane. \\n\r\nSound: 8 \\n\r\nThe opening song is a great example of how music should match the show. Its both cute, but also has some creepiness to it as well. \\n\r\nCharacter:8 \\n\r\nI think most of the characters have a lot of depth. As I explained above, satou's past was explained well and we get into her head a lot. Same thing with Shio and her brother. She showed us what happened to them in the past before shio ended up with Satou. We really know why a lot of the characters are the way they act because of it. Mt favorite characters were actually Asahi and Shouko. If they made a show with them, that would have been even better. I actually didnt like most of the other characters, but they were still made very well. \\n\r\nEnjoyment:7 \\n\r\nFor me, the pedophilic nature bothered me at some points. It got to be too much sometimes. Other than that. I really enjoyed it. Again, if it were dumbed down or removed completely, it would have made it an even better show for me. \\n",

Even though it seems perfect at the moment, she is well aware of the utilities they need in order to survive such as food, utilities, furniture, and clothes. At least she knows the responsibilities she has to do in order for them to live, since from what it looks like she has no support from any of her family or whatsoever.\\n\\n\r\nOh all those expenses.\\n\\n\r\nShe was finally home and well with Shio, she felt happy and more relaxed at this point. She did have her own worries and thoughts on how she has never felt love like this way before, saying that it was different.\\n\\n\r\nShio-chan gave me the gift of love.\\n\\n\r\nIn the end of the episode you see her walking inside a room that\u2019s dark and has a heavy atmosphere, you could tell this was where her sins for her love had started. And it cuts off to the part of a young boy putting up posters of missing signs with the face of the one and only adorable Shio Kobe.\\n\\n\r\nHello, happy sugar life.\\n\\n\r\nSo far I've been intrigued with the first episode and would love to see more of it.

            "content": "What is the best anime of 2018? Well, I haven't watched NEARLY enough anime that came out this year to answer this question, but I CAN tell you which one I enjoyed the most! Happy Sugar Life is my pick for this year because it's a psychological horror/thriller done right. This series is basically about a deranged girl who kidnaps a loli and forces her to live in her apartment with her without anyone finding out.\r\nThe story is a bit mediocre (5/10) as it doesn't really go far beyond the premise I just laid out, but it's the characters where this series really shines. Forexample, there's one boy in the show who's kind of a perv who is obsessed with the loli I mentioned earlier. So why do I kinda feel sorry for him? Because we see how he was physically and sexually abused by his boss, and how it mentally screwed him up to where he sees this little girl as an \"angel\" that can heal him. Y'see how it's complicated and have mixed feelings about him? I promise you every character in this series has layers like this (8/10).\\n\\n\r\nThe artwork in the show is mediocre (5/10) with pretty basic character models, aside from the eye-catching OP that REALLY reminds me of Madoka Magica. The sound design, on the other hand, is where this show really shines (9/10). This show knows when to have characters talk, when to have their voices muffled over for creepy effect, and when to have total silence to terrify the audience. So much of an effective horror movie/show is in its sound design, and this show nails it. I really enjoyed Happy Sugar Life and my favorite scene was at the end of episode 9 where a certain character strangles and stabs another character. All we hear is this girl's muffled screams and struggling, and we see her desperately clawing up the other girl's hand, and my God it was just so effective. Overall 8/10",

            "content": "When I first heard about this anime and what was going on in it, I was skeptical about it seeming to be good for horror; I mean you got a yandere and a child. But once you get to episode 5 and you start learning about Shio, you learn all those layers they built into this child and how she's more than just an innocent and caring child. \r\nSatou has a lot to her as well, not being a teen who kidnapped a child cause they love them sexually, but a true love for this girl who brought her happiness when she never received anyto begin with; but I do wish they would delve into more of both her past with her aunt and her love for Shio.\\n\\n\r\nThe supporting characters are very interesting as well, from Hida and Taiyo to Sumire and even Shio's mother; but they do need more of a backstory, so maybe some OVAs for the characters will do some justice.\\n\\n\r\nI highly recommend this to anyone who wants to watch horror but want minimal amounts of blood and murder since this is more on the mental and emotional aspect rather than gore. This is obviously not for those who aren't able to fully understand the true story behind this anime and explore the many layers past a teen and child romance.\\n\\n\r\nEven though the ending was very conclusive and overall perfect, I wouldn't mind a second season; maybe with different characters in this similar dilemma, like maybe men where the younger of the two murders to protect his lover.\\n\\n\r\nI overall highly praise this anime and recommend this to newcomers looking for a \"little blood as possible\" horror anime.",

I feel like this is the right time for me to review it.\r\nFor this review I will be focusing on the plot, art, characters, music and my enjoyment. There might be some spoilers ahead, so proceed with caution.\r\nStory/execution: To be honest, the story seems very scattered and confusing for the first few episodes. I admit that the show can seem a little boring when you don't know what's going on throughout the story. However, ones you watch further into the show, you will realize that there is actually apretty interesting premise underneath. The story is definitely very interesting and the creators seem to know what they are doing. There is also this blend of cuteness and scariness inside, but we have already seen that in many different forms. For example higurashi or gakkou gurashi shared the same cute to scary thing. There are definitely a lot of cheesy and over dramatized moments in this show, they just try way too hard to unsettle you at times.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nRight off the bat you can tell just by looking at the art style that this will not be a \"happy\" show. The art style gives this aesthetic vibe that definitely manages to unsettle you.  If you are looking for a very dark and gloomy yet still kind of a light art style. Then this show is for you.\\n\\n\r\nMusic: \\n\r\nThere isn't much to the opening, it's a very cutesy opening. However the opening doesn't have any replay value in it. It's definitely not a bad opening though. I know how subjective music is, but I am not the biggest fan of the opening. The ending song on the other hand is phenomenal, I can listen to the ending a million times and I won't get bored of it. Honestly, the ending is one of the best parts about this anime.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nThe characters come out as exactly what the creator wanted us to think of them as. Our opinions are constantly changing for the characters, it's hard to know who is the good guy and who is the bad guy. Satou nails the yandere trope very well, shio chan is adorable to the core. All the other characters are also brilliant. The characters get enough screen time for you to actually see the plot from their perspective. Ones you get to know all of their back stories, you get to know the reasoning behind their actions. Pretty much of the characters in this anime are pretty evil except for the all mighty shio. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: For the first 4 episodes I was bored out of my mind, the cheese was totally getting to me. However later on when I got to know the story a little better, I could find myself enjoying the whole thing.\\n",

            "content": "I went into Happy Sugar Life anticipating its deceptive cutesy mood and aesthetics hiding a more darker side since I seen this pulled before with a few past anime titles like Higurashi no Naku Koro ni and Puella Magi Madoka Magica. Low and behold, I got something rather unexpected and, at times, uncomfortable to watch with what the series explores with its plot and characters.\r\nFocused on high schooler Sato Matsuzaka and a little girl named Shio sharing an apartment together, Happy Sugar Life starts off being as deceptive as the titles I mentioned above in assuming you think it will be a cutesy slice-of-life titleinvolving our two leads, all the way down to the opening sequence for it not having a hint to the anime's more darker side. Beneath its cutesy facade, Happy Sugar Life is actually a psychological horror series delving into the more depraved elements of humanity and how such things can warp the mentality of those raised under such circumstances. Sato and Shio are characters of such circumstances with what Happy Sugar Life explores of their back stories and how their upbringings each effect them mentally, Sato especially as she does some rather heinous and, at times, deadly deeds to ensure her so-called \"happy sugar life\" is maintained with her living arrangements and bond with Shio. The exploration of Sato and Shio's characters are nicely done with exploring how dark and mentally jarring their past experiences shaped both of them to develop their bond with one another, at points even getting rather uncomfortable to watch that adds to how effective it shows how the bond may not be one for audiences to be completely sympathetic to.\\n\\n\r\nThe addition of other characters to the series is a bit of a mixed bag. There are some like Shio's brother Asahi and Sato's close friend Shouko that make for solid additions to Happy Sugar Life's plot as they start to unravel more about the circumstances surrounding Sato and Shio's predicament, as well as facing their own developments in regards to the circumstances. Others like Taiyou and Kitaumekawa-sensei were a bit too over-the-top with their behavior and actions to be taken seriously and felt mostly like shallow archetypes in the show's exploration of humanity's depravity.\\n\\n\r\nThe show also carries with it some issues in regards to its execution. It does take some time for the anime to start picking up steam in exploring Sato and Shio's characters, as we are otherwise introduced to the mentioned over-the-top characters in the series and Sato's actions to thwart anyone getting in the way of her bond with Shio. Also, there are occasions where the show's attempts at trying to come off serious can feel sloppy in their execution thanks to how over-the-top some of the characters come across with their actions, this being especially notable with Taiyou, Sato's aunt, and Kitaumekawa.\\n\\n\r\nSetting aside these issues, Happy Sugar Life is otherwise still a mostly solid psychological horror series whose cutesy facade hides an impactful and disturbing look at how people can be effected from being raised under horrific circumstances by their caretakers. I'd at least recommend checking it out once to see how effective its horror elements and character exploration are.",

            "content": "Will try not to spoil too much!\r\nLove is like sugar, It make life a little more sweeter.\r\nThis anime basically tells us about a story of a high school girl, Satou Matsuzaka who fell in love with a child named Shio Koube.\r\nTHAT BASICALLY IS NOT NORMAL.\r\nOkay, our protagonist, Satou was a girl who wants to know what love is(she basically found it before the first episode), her image in the school is not that great, I mean some consider her a girl who is a star student- good in studies, beautiful but some also thinks a girl who will sleep with any guy! Well that wasmostly true before she met Shio that is.\\n\r\nSatou is a freshman at Makikou High School and primarily works at Cure \u00e1 Cute, her image around her acquaintances is rather gentle and kind in nature and who gets along with people.\\n\r\nShe actually says that she don't feel anything about anyone around her!(Instead of Shio that is)\\n\r\nShe live with her AUNT or so everyone thinks, but in truth she lives with Shio. works for her to get money and live without any of those problems!\\n\r\nBTW a little spoiler SATOU IS A SAVAGE! XD\\n\\n\r\n    Characters\\n\r\nSpeaking of people, EVERY PERSON HERE IS INSANE, I mean expect Shouko, Satou's best friend every person have their problems!\\n\r\nFrom the Teacher to Taiyou, Satou to her aunt. There are two more characters I won't tell or they will be spoilers.\\n\r\nthese people are insane that much that I was suffocating with watching them in action!\\n\\n\r\n    Sound (OP and ED)\\n\r\nThe Opening is to good, I mean I watched the whole show because of it. I was randomly watching Youtube and then I watched it. It tells you about the whole show!\\n\r\nWatching just the opening will tell you that it is not normal,\\n\r\nIt starts with a cutesy tone with a beautiful scene where Shio and Satou are doing their ritual to show their love to each other followed by them hugging each other(that was actually cute)then title which also shows the dark theme the show has to offer. THAT alone was enough to force me to watch this show! I mean who won't. Don't judge me!\\n\r\nEnding was normal, I'm that was also a cutesy but not any dark.\\n\r\n~(BTW I forgot to tell that Shio was loved by three people, I mean she was treated as a toy by all three, at least  that was how things looked! But the thing is Shio only loved Satou).\\n\\n\r\n    Animation\\n\r\nThat was good, and was the one of the most positive things in this anime, matches it's cutesy as well as dark theme and is similar to that of Madoka\u2605Magica I think? That is up on your taste!\\n\\n\r\n    Enjoyment\\n\r\nI basically did enjoyed this anime and to confirm thing this basically is ALSO NOT NORMAL!\\n\r\nI'm who would enjoy looking at killing, I do but not everyone. I don't know why this anime is rated PG-13, that's absurd this should be at least PG-16.\\n\r\nYou will love this anime if you did like Mirai Nikki. Not sure about Madoka\u2605Magica since never watched it after ep1 (SORRY, DON'T SUE ME).\\n\r\nThere are times characters in anime do things that were easily avoidable. IDK why they did that. They had services legally!\\n\r\nLike other anime you can't predict what is going to happen next. I mean I was able to predict only one thing in this anime. lets see who else will, it's in the later episodes!\\n\r\nI didn't knew how to convey my feelings while watching this anime. Sometimes I'm sad sometimes happy and sometimes I'm like WTF is going on here. \\n\r\nAlso I was not satisfied with the ending!\\n\r\nBefore watching this anime be sure that you strengthen your heart as it is gonna be rough!\\n\\n\r\nHave a good day!",

            "content": "Love is scary.\r\nThis show reached me in a way I didn't expect. It was a very strange experience. Looking back, I didn't expect it to turn out the way it did.\r\nLove is a popular phenomenon throughout the world. It's praised and glorified as a wonderful and beautiful thing. However, that's all it is...a thing. No one has a solid definition of what love actually is. We think we understand it, but we describe it in various ways, mostly related to feelings. Most of us can't come up with a concise statement that truly breaks down what love is; love is understood differently by everyone.\r\nBecause ofthis, love is kind of like an eldritch abomination. We don't really know what it is, but we definitely know how it makes us feel. Overwhelming passion. Adoration. Elation. Security. Possession. Obsession. Madness. So, so sweet...\\n\\n\r\nThe romance genre likes to portray love as a happy, pure, and fulfilling experience, but anyone who's experienced romantic feelings knows that there's a darker aspect to it. Jealousy. Insecurity. Heartbreak. Nausea. Abuse. Stalking. Being hurt by a person you love can lead to mental health issues, such as depression. It's not uncommon to hear of people committing suicide after a breakup.\\n\\n\r\nIt really is scary, isn't it? You get incredibly attached to that one person. They make the world around you glitter. Reality is spinning as you get closer to them. They consume all your thoughts. Every time you see them interacting with someone else, that person is just another obstacle to you. Competition. Seeing them look so happy together makes your skin crawl and your blood boil. It makes you want to vomit.\\n\\n\r\nIn Happy Sugar Life, the heroine, Satou, experiences this intense emotion after meeting a beautiful nymphet called Shio, who remarks that Satou's \"jar\" is empty but not broken, which represents her desire for meaning. Satou has never felt happiness this intense before, and she becomes intoxicated with it. She wants nothing more than to maintain this feeling she calls \"love\". As a result, she becomes insane and emotionally unstable.\\n\\n\r\nIt's important to note that every character in this show experiences something they call \"love\" in their own individual ways, and every single one of them becomes at least somewhat insane because of it. Their \"love\" is also always connected to some kind of pain or trauma. The objects of their affections reveal some aspects of their personalities and inner selves. For example, Satou was always aware that a feeling known as \"love\" existed, but she didn't understand it. She didn't understand happiness, kindness, or warmth. When she met Shio, it was like a blind person seeing colors for the first time, or a deaf person suddenly hearing music. Her attraction to a young child is morally objectionable to most people, but Satou only sees it as pure, beautiful, fulfilling, and sweet. In a way, her love of Shio is metaphorical: she's young and vulnerable, pure and inexperienced, beautiful and weak. She adores Shio like a lion adores an antelope; she sustains her in a way that nothing else can.\\n\\n\r\nLove isn't necessarily what Satou and popular culture make it out to be. In the real world, love is conditional. Would your parents still love you if you weren't theirs? Why is it that people who are considered physically unattractive have difficulty in romance? Why do people who don't fit into social norms often end up bullied and friendless? \\n\\n\r\nWhen you fall in love with a person, do you really love that person, or the image of them you created? Why is it that when we fall in love, we tend to focus on the positive aspects of our loved ones and ignore the negatives? Why do so many abused people repeatedly end up in more abusive relationships? Would you still love your partner if they became severely depressed, physically or mentally disabled, or old?\\n\\n\r\nI can't offer any answers to these questions, but I hope Happy Sugar Life makes you want to answer them for yourself.\\n\\n",

            "content": "I think the tag \"horror\" should be changed to \"horrible\" when it comes to this show. \r\nHappy Sugar Life presents us the story of a high school called Satou. This girl is the classical perfect one: beautiful, decisive, kind, and actually intelligent. Nevertheless, just like everyone in this world, she has a defect: a lot of personality problems. Due to the emptiness she felt, Satou despairly searched for the true meaning of 'love' through a the perfect sweet life with a little called Shio. \r\nJust with the start, you can see everything here is going wrong. You haven't started watching the show, and it's easyto become aware of the awful situation of that. \\n\\n\r\nSomething you should know when you are going to watch this, is that you won't like any one of the characters. It reaches the moment that anything that happens to any of them doesn't matter at all. Some dies? Ok, goodbye. That's all on your mind. They don't really mind. \\n\\n\r\nWhenever the story continues, a lot of different awful people appears with their own problems. As I said, they are totally disgusting and you won't like them.\\n\\n\r\nNow, it's time to talk about the artistic side of this anime. Despite the good tracks you will find in the show, I can't say the same with the animation quality. It's not the worst I've watched, but it's so far to be the best. \\n\\n\r\nThis series is fulfilled with a lot of immorality, depravity, ignominy, and the constant: I feel bad for myself, so I can do anything I want to become happy. That's a thought I absolutely can't stand. \\n\\n\r\nAfter all the negative aspects of this I've said, why is my score a 5 and not a 1? Well, that's simple. At least, I can say this is 'enjoyable' and, sometimes, has some interesting themes to debate and learn. You can learn the consequences of acting on your own and the hidden cruelty in so many people. \\n\\n\r\nIf are interested on this, you can give a try, but I recommend you to go to anything else unless you are willing to waste your time.",

            "content": "Unlike most other shows, I'm entering this from the perspective of the a fan of the work it's being adapted from, namely the Happy Sugar Life manga. The anime adapts the manga ahead of itself, essentially, as of this writing, the manga is still ongoing and may or may not reach the same conclusions as the anime. Many points I've raised about the series as a whole from my manga review can also be applied here. Hence, I'm only looking into this purely from an anime standpoint.\r\nThe anime has been frequently described as a \"psycho-horror love story\" but it doesn't accomplish the horror parts particularlywell. As I've mentioned in my manga review, Happy Sugar Life consists of 2 halves, a \"Happy Sugar Life\" part of SoL delights with Satou and Shio, and an \"Salty Bitter Death\" part with all the other stuff. Quite frankly it's rubbish at the latter and I've only enjoyed it mostly for the cutesy (genuinely cutesy) SoL elements, to which there are too few in this adaptation. The anime mainly focuses on the poorly written grim stuff, which is to its detriment more to anything.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation itself is fine. For Ezola's first ever work, it's pretty decent. Very Diomedia-like in quality. Nothing special, some blemishes here and there that hurt the overall presentation but nothing to the level of Maerchen Maedhen. Some genuinely clever moments of visual direction and cinematography, but not enough of it. The main theme of Happy Sugar Life is brilliant and its leitmotif is heard throughout the soundtrack, making for some atmospheric scenes that complement some of my favourite manga scenes very well.  It's a bittersweet piece that's honestly a bit overpowering, but definitely one that makes an impact. The OP and ED are similarly well crafted and portray the overall theme of the story (the duality of Sweetness and Saltiness of the duo's lives) quite well in under 2 minutes. \\n\\n\r\nI will say to its credit the anime manages to condense over 40 chapters of manga (and ongoing!) into 12 episodes. It's a very efficient adaptation, most of the filler stuff is removed and some events are retooled slightly for a quicker pacing. Though I've noticed it cut a lot more from the later chapters than the earlier chapters. Yuuna's backstory I feel is improved this way, while other events such as the buildup and payoff to a certain Little Bird's demise feels awkward and is less effective as a result. \\n\\n\r\nI've iterated before that the grim stuff is poorly written. But seeing it in animation lends a \"So Bad It's Hilarious\" kind of quality to them, akin to a cheesy B-Horror film. Scenes meant to shock and terrify end up eliciting a laugh from me, turning this into my second most favourite blood-related comedy series with HanaKana as a main this season.\\n\\n\r\nTo its credit, the ending to the series is done decently well. It ends as you'd expect but the execution of the scene is enjoyable enough. For a moment you get a tinge of the \"horror\" element played up. Just a brief moment though. \\n\\n\r\nYandere and Yuri are two of my favourite things. To see them combined together is a rarity. To see them together in animated form even more so. I suppose I do have to appreciate the novelty of this show. You just don't get much of these. And hey, the romance part is done decently well enough. Your mileage may very well vary of course. But if you like yuri, consider giving this show a try. Just don't expect too much from it.\\n\\n\r\n6/10. The weaker of the HanaKana-focused blood-related comedy show.",

            "content": "Horror is a genre that is hard to do right. Often times horror anime tend to focus on shocking you with gruesome and disturbing imagery rather than focusing on building tension and suspense. This also causes the characters and story to be underdeveloped and difficult to care about. But when you build too much suspense or tension, it can lead to stretches of boredom. When done right, Horror anime can have some of the most memorable scenes in anime as the tension and atmosphere leaves you uncomfortable and scared as the scene is etched into your head. You can put Horror into any kind ofsituation as long you focus on what makes a horror anime good. Making the viewer feel uncomfortable and anxious. So when I watched the horror anime that was airing this summer, only one caught my attention and made me anxious to find out what happens next every single week. And that anime is the one I am reviewing today. \\n\\n\r\nSit back, relax and make sure to hide after you read this review because the FBI is coming after you as I present to you the anime review for Happy Sugar Life. Lets begin. \\n\\n\\n\r\nStory: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nWhere to begin with this series? Well the story follows Satou Matsuzaka, a seemingly average high school girl who is having the time of her life. Having a steady income and living with an adorable little girl by the name of Shio Koube where both of them care for each other deeply and are comfortable around each other (don't worry, it's not paedophilia...I think). However, when characters start to disrupt the peace and happy lifestyle that Satou has built, she starts to go off into the deep end. From there, we see what lengths Satou will take to prevent her happy life style from crumbling and maintaining her \"Happy Sugar Life.\" \\n\\n\r\nOver time, the plot does escalate to we really see the true nature of Satou and what kind of character she really is. This is all thanks to the show's tension and suspense that it does so well. Instead of just rushing into things, each episode builds to a point where Satou snaps and her true, manipulating mental state shows its ugly head. The horror aspect shines in this regard as it builds an atmosphere where these characters are not actually sane, but are great at hiding it. This makes their behaviour fairly unpredictable which adds to the tension of this show. \\n\\n\r\nThroughout the series, there is one question that hovers over this series and that question is, \"What is love?.......Baby don't hurt me!....Don't hurt me!..No more!\" (I am not sorry). Each character, including Satou, has their own twisted interpretation on love. Whereas love can be taken as being adored by everyone or by merely using it to cover your own problems. Each character uses their definition of love to drive their actions, causing conflict with Satou. Of course Satou uses that to manipulate people to do what she wants, leaving to some very tense scenes. \\n\\n\r\nNow the main thing I like about the plot is that it toys with your expectations. You think you know what is going to happen given your prior knowledge of other horror shows and what has happened in this particular show, but then it throws a curve ball and does something completely different. This leaves the show unpredictable as you don't really know what is going to happen next; adding to the suspense as you are waiting to see if you are right as you watch the outcome. \\n\\n\r\nYou can see why I said the Horror aspect of this show is done well. Through unpredictability and tense moments, we are watching an anime that builds suspense and and an atmosphere that makes us feel uncomfortable, but at the same time, making us lean forward as to find out what is going to happen next. \\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nSatou is definitely a character that questions whether you want to route for her or to see her life crumble around her. She is a character who will do very questionable things for the sake of \"love\" because, like every other character of this show, she has her own twisted interpretation of love. This is because she has no sense of morality whatsoever. She will manipulate anyone in order to get what she wants and she wouldn't hesitate to do so. And while she wants to try to avoid killing people, she wouldn't hesitate to kill if that was her only option. This makes her both dangerously smart since she has a sense of self control and a massive hypocrite. She constantly belittles people for their actions and desires but unaware that she is just as bad, if not worse than the people she belittles.\\n\\n\r\nThis pretty makes Satou a terrifying character as there is nothing more terrifying than a smart psychopath. Always looking to manipulate people and suffering no repercussions for doing so. Satou is not a good person and while her moments with Shio would make you question it, lets not forget that she is keeping Shio all to herself. She has no empathy for other characters and will remove them from the picture if she needs to. She is not a good person in this story. Rather, she is portrayed as the evil compared to other characters of the show. But the show does try its hardest to make Satou more of a sympathetic character and make you understand why she is the way she is, helping make her character less black and white than it initially seems. \\n\\n\r\nSo the reason why Satou does all these bad things is because of her love for Shio. And while Shio is so adorable, she does have her own mental problems as well as she is suffering from suppressed memories. She often needs Satou as a way to hide her problems as she appears not to know better. It is clear that Shio has suffered some kind of traumatic event and needs Satou to make her feel happy. This makes the whole situation with Satou and Shio morally questionable. On one hand, these two really do care for each other and do want to spend the whole time together. On the other hand, you can't deny the fact that Satou has taken Shio and is keeping her away from the outside world, meaning that Shio isn't aware of her current situation. It's these morally grey questions that help give Happy Sugar Life some thought provoking questions on who is in the right and who is in the wrong. Your decision maybe concrete at times but the anime will try its hardest to convince you otherwise. \\n\\n\r\nNow one of the things that drags this show down is that some of the characters of this show really are just crazy for the sake of being crazy. While they have their own opinions on love and use it as a crutch for their instability, it can be pretty weak and just highlights the fact that everyone in this show has some kind of mental instability. In fact, there is only one character in this show that you would consider sane, and that is Satou's best friend Shouko. Other characters like Taiyou start off sane but get crazy later after some traumatic event. And honestly, I wouldn't blame them if they went crazy later after experiencing something traumatic. That makes their mental state more believable because we see what they went through and understand why they are the way they are. Not just randomly crazy and then dismissed as a one off character. \\n\\n\r\nI actually want to quickly talk about Shouko because being the only sane character throughout the show, she would be the character we would eventually get invested in. While she may start out irrelevant at first, over time, we see her grow and we get to understand her better as she just wants to be more useful to the people around her (mainly Satou) and help them, ignoring the consequences. Of course, Satou is mentally unstable. So by the end of it, you just want to see Shouko go through this show unscathed. \\n\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: 6.5/10\\n\\n\r\nIn some areas, the animation excels and in other areas, the animation falls flat. So lets start with the bad side of the animation and that is the animation's art style. The art style is just plain and bland with nothing that stands out in this regard. While the character designs are bright, highlighting that this is a slice of life trapped in a horror anime, it doesn't invoke a sense of awe. \\n\\n\r\nNow what it excels at is everything that has to relate to the horror aspect of this show. Mainly, the character expressions. They are all just uncomfortable and unnerving to look at. Some more than others as they use different expressions to highlight their mental instability. Satou stands out in this regard. I already mentioned that she is a smart psychopath with a sense of control, well that relates to her facial expressions. She is able put on a Kawaii face, a straight face and a murderous face. This is especially true when her eyes glow or look like a swirling vortex of doom looking into your soul. \\n\\n\r\nOf course that isn't the only thing the animation does well as it also likes to use static during its more darker scenes as well as turning the screen red, highlighting that the situation has become dire and an emergency, normally when people are in Satou's way. It also likes to go cinematic with black bars on the top and bottom of the screen, highlighting that particular moment. These added effects to the animation really do add to the tension of the show and make the scene more dramatic. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack does add to the mood and there were a couple that stood out to me. And those ones are from the show's darker scenes. The soundtrack from the slice of life moments weren't memorable to me and didn't stand out except for one piece that played near the end of episode six. But my favourite scenes normally don't include an OST playing in the background. Rather, it is the absence of a soundtrack and just hearing the characters dialogue while an ominous, low, humming noise plays in the background and also using audio scratching and booming sounds to add to the atmosphere and tell the viewer that s**t just hit the floor. \\n\\n\r\nThe opening, \"One Room Sugar Life\" by Akari Nanawo is definitely a highlight of show, as it balances the slice of life imagery with the creeping aspect of horror lurking in the shadows. It switches between slice of life with bright colours, sweets, cakes and the relationship between Satou and Shio to dark imagery with static, video tearing, and showing that no-one is sane in this series. The song as well balances this with the vocals sounding like they belong in a slice of life whereas the instrumentals say otherwise. While the low quality imagery in some aspects of the opening as well as some of the imagery looks photo-shopped may bring the quality of this opening down for some people, it didn't bother me and just added to the quality of the opening. \\n\\n\r\nThe ED is appropriate. Going through an episode of this series is nerve-racking at times so having a calm ending is the sort of thing that would relax people. So why not show the sweet relationship between Satou and Shio to calm your nerves. \\n\\n\r\nOne final thing in the sound department, I have to give props for Satou's voice actress Kana Hanazawa. She has done a really good job of portraying this character with many faces and present a very good vocal range to portray Satou's various moods and expressions. \\n\\n\r\nConclusion \\n\\n\r\nHappy Sugar Life is a show that, for me, turned out to be better than it should have been. It has aspects that I look for in a horror series. Good pacing, solid characters, suspense, tension, an atmosphere built using animation, sound and a character's dialogue and actions and made me feel genuinely uncomfortable in some of its scenes or even entire episodes (like seriously, what the f**k is up with Satou's aunt). While the show does stumble with some of its characters and the art style isn't inspiring, it's pros out-way its cons. \\n\\n\r\nHonestly I wasn't expecting much from Happy Sugar Life because looking at it up front, it is about a pink haired, psychotic Yandere taking care of a loli and is surrounded by insane characters. But if look underneath the surface, you will find a well paced, well thought out horror series. Considering what horror series we've had so far this year from generic vampire hunters to over the top magical girls, watching Happy Sugar Life will probably do you no harm, except maybe scar you for life. It ain't for the feint of heart as some scenes are jarring and uncomfortable to watch, but if you can manage through that, then you managed to watch an enjoyable horror series. \\n\\n\\n\r\nMy personal enjoyment: 10/10\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall score: 8.1/10  Recommendation: Watch it\\n",

Animation isn't the most fluid but it serves its purpose, the color palette is also good making a depressing tone while not falling into a desperate attempt to look \"dark\" (like some other anime we already talk about).\\n\\n\r\nSound 7/10\\n\r\nAverage soundtrack, everything I said about the Art applies here too. Not too amazing but not bad, either.\\n\r\nThe ED and OP songs are great though, so it boosted the score a bit.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 6/10\\n\r\nOkay so here is where this anime gets fishy. Let's start with the actual good characters that thankfully are the main characters, Satou and Shio.\\n\r\nSatou is your typical tsundere can be cute but can also be scary, Satou makes sense and through the story go fordward we start to understand her personality and traumas.\\n\r\nShio is a shy and cute loli, her \"development\" is pretty much the same as Satou, but unlike Satou, Shio doesn't understand anything and gets confused while entering a state of shock, very realistic child trauma reaction here.\\n\r\nNow, the rest of the cast is pretty much plain with poorly written personalities which is a shame since the main characters aren't that bad.\\n\r\nBut i won't enter into detail here so my reveiw don't end up as a 400 pages thesis about human behavior.\\n\r\nSee the anime and judge the side characters by yourself. lol.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 8/10\\n\r\nOverall the anime is enjoyable to look at, with only a few bad exceptions.\\n\r\nAgain, nothing too crazy.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 7.5/10\\n\r\nHappy Sugar Life Is definitely worth watching if you want some cassual edgy fun anime or if you have some free time.\\n\r\nBut if you are looking for a Serious Dark or a Smart Adult anime, better go watch Elfen Lied or something else cuz Happy Sugar Life is not for you.\\n\\n\r\nIf you took the time to read all my rambling wall of text, then Thank you xD Here have a cookie. \ud83c\udf6a\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "6 - fun watch (cute grils), weak/unstable story (just as unstable as the bipolar characters)\r\nRandom thoughts so far:\r\n-Shallow characters -\r\neither they're mentally unstable, a background character or mentally unstable & a background character. the superficial personas are incredibly generic & the psychopath personas...iuno, I think it'd be safe to say they're built around stereotypes like if someone grabbed some symptoms off WebMD & pretended they had the disease (but worse). There seems to be a pattern of characters witnessing domestic abuse & becoming traumatised; to give an example, the blonde femboy (he should be in the chara list) gets pounced on by a cougar(rape), whichunchains his inner lolicon.\\n\\n\r\n-Repetitive - \\n\r\nSatou continually rambles on about love, she also never forgets to tell her fellow psychopaths that their perception of love is skewed; \"that's not love\" should be her motto.\\n\r\nThere are 2 moods that pop up quite frequently: 1) The sparkly flowery which appear during lovey-dovey moments/when the characters are fantasizing about their fetishes & 2) The 'bitter' mental breakdown when Satou confronts someone bitter (the aforementioned folks whose perception of love disgusts her). Each has their distinct background music+sounds & visuals.\\n\r\nPerhaps the series is just slowly hammering stuff in with the  recurring imagery+motifs.\\n\\n\r\n-Annoying loli- \\n\r\nPretends to be innocent, whiny, useless, controlled by fear, afraid of loneliness/cheat (ye she does business with her mom, her bro, Satou & the blonde femboy & misleads all of them). Hopefully these characteristics will be touched on more since they agree with the story's current themes.\\n\\n\r\n-Story's direction? idk-\\n\r\nThe first 4 eps were mainly repetition but each revealed a little extra context about the characters, the most recent beginning to hint at the deeper motivations of the main characters. Honestly, I have no clue what the series can do in another 8 episodes given it took 4 (maybe more) just to introduce the characters. It's likely the sort of show that just breaks into a slice-of-life mid-way, brings in a final boss/villain/conflict then tacks on an ending. How Satou & Shio decide to interact with each other in the remaining episodes may just as well make or break the series.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "I've been watching anime for some time, and this is the first time I felt like writing a review of a series. I will try to avoid spoilers as much as I can.\r\nSTORY: Outstanding\r\nOf all animes I watched, this one must have one of the more unique plots I have seen. I would go as far as saying this is a \"high art anime\".\r\nThe first chapters introduce Satou's life, a hardworking girl who is in \"love\". Her koibito is Shio, a kid that she apparently kidnapped and locked in her apartment. That's all I will say about the plot, read the synopsis if you wantmore info.\\n\r\nThis show is a roller coaster, with lots of thrillers, twists, lies, and a some horror scenes. I think Ez\u03ccla (HSL is the first anime of the studio) did a very good job pacing and keeping consistency, I have only found very small plot holes at the end. It mixes very well unrealistic actions with very realistic behaviors (confusing huh? I never experienced this before). In some instances the most \"normal\" guy will look the weirdest. I also liked how they treated stuff like domestic violence, work harassment and male rape.\\n\\n\\n\r\nART: Outstanding\\n\\n\r\nTypical art style that you would find in a slice of life show, round faces, big round eyes, lots of blur, etc. I think this makes a horror show \"darker\". Overall I think this show's color palettes are very well chosen and beautiful. The cute and happy scenes looked very vibrant and heartwarming, where the creepy scenes were dark with glowing yandere eyes. I also love the faces in this anime, in fact I have a folder with 35 screencaps of face expressions (this is the first time I screenshot while watching anime).\\n\\n\\n\r\nSOUND: Great\\n\\n\r\nLoved OP and ED. Also random Bleach OST. HanaKana, Kikuko Inoue.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER: Outstanding\\n\\n\r\nI will just say that I missed shows with good character development. This show does it greatly. Every character feels alive, has its own issues, pasts, and evolution through the series.\\n\r\nLoved MC's personality, I usually don't watch yandere shows, but her character felt very credible (? can't find the exact word). She keeps thinking rationally most of the time, and has real affection for his close friends (sadly they don't). She also doesn't go berserk randomly (killing is her very last option). Much more enjoyable than, for instance, Yuno.\\n\\n\\n\r\nI ended up writing a lot, ups. Overall this was a very refreshing show (I was tired of cliches and forced plots). Binge watched it in one sit, while usually I don't watch anime this way.\\n\r\nThe ending was perfect, I would have liked another one (crowbar should have fallen, stapid ring), but it's the most appropriate for the show.\\n\r\nNearly perfect score for me, 9-10. I wouldn't recommend this to \"everyone\", I'm sure most people would hate Happy Sugar Life and feel uncomfortable watching it (violence, harassment, rape, murder, kidnapping, lolicons, etc.). And that's fine, this show is very special (hence the \"high art anime\").",

I had high hopes but none of them really came through. There were a few small aspects to the storyline I enjoyed but overall - quite predictable and bland. The psycho element was purely just that and nothingmore. What's worse, the opening - while quite nice - was super catchy and I couldn't get it out of my head for some time.\\n\r\nBasically, to sum up - I am sure there are more interesting animes to watch that have the same theme and even to some extent - story, as it was not unique at all.",

            "content": "I think my relationship with this anime is not much different from Shio's with Satou.  In the sense that i was fairly happy watching it and kept coming back to it, despite having no concrete reason to do so.  It seems to have the perfect combination of \"good because it's bad\" and \"how could this possibly resolve\" to keep you hooked.  \r\nIt was sort of like a hentai.  A trainwreck where nothing and nobody made sense, but where you don't care, cause there's gonna be a payoff and you're just waiting for it, dick in hand, tissues at the ready.But here there's no sex.  I'm not even really sure what i was waiting for.  I guess a sort of morbid curiosity was egging me on; i just had to know how deep the rabbit hole went.  \\n\\n\r\nProduction wise it's mostly garbage.  The art is boring, the animation is hilariously weak.  The music is clumsy and far too obvious in its intent, like it was composed by a teenager.  There's some good voice acting at least.  \\n\\n\r\nSince the anime is going exclusively for constant shock value, all the \"characters\" are largely plot devices, all mentally fucked up one way or another.  They exist so that we can see some higurashi-style \"creepy\" huge-eyes-with-small-irises-and-husky-voice scenes as often as possible.  Shio is probably the worst example.  It's like the writer has never seen a child in his life; this is not how children act.  Her mind is at-times too simple and at times far too profound, with no coherence at all.  \"Let's die together\".  Yeah, right, i'm sure.  My only hope for the show was Satou's friend Shoko.  I was hoping she would be the one normal person in the shitshow who would just realize the mess around her.  But she just kinda goes with it.  Wasteful\\n\\n\r\nHorrible dialog and flowery scenes that don't go anywhere or reveal anything are far too long and too frequent.  Since the characters are plot devices and not people, you don't care about any of their feelings.  You only care what fucked up thing they're gonna do.  Wannabe \"deep\", artsy scenes a la Ef got me laughing really hard; they had absolutely zero credibility.  I found myself skipping a lot, which is fine.  \\n\\n\r\nThe show would have been much more powerful if they cranked up the degeneracy to 11 with regards to sexuality.  For being so \"violent\", it tiptoed around anything sex, often merely hinting at it.  It needed to go really ham, like have Satou snap and rape Shio or something exteeme like that.  It is remarkably tame for a show being centered entirely around shock value.  Maybe the internet just broke me.  \\n\\n\r\nThe one thing they did right is how they paced the reveals of the information.  Flashbacks used pretty tastefully for once, and giving you just enough breadcrumbs so that you don't give up altogether.  \\n\\n\r\nEven though each of the show's elements, inspected individually, is only worth a 2/10, at the end of the day, the only thing that matters is if the anime can get you to watch it, and if you get enjoyment out of it.  Hence i have to give it a honorable 5.",

            "content": "*Disclaimer*\r\nJust personal scratch.\r\nAdvised, possible spoilers.\r\nOpinion & Informal\r\nArt: 6/10\r\nThe art was usually fine. In some cases it could look pretty good while in other cases there was a noticeable drop in quality and detail. For example, sometimes hands could look a bit iffy or basic. For the most part however anatomy and proportions checked out. There were a impact shots but there weren't really any impact sequences. The impact shots themselves didn't look too impressive or leave any impact; they were usually the \"scary-face\" and honestly felt like they were used a bit too much...I get it, Matsuzaka is off. I don't need to be remindedof it more than two times. There were no nature or panoramic shots. There weren't any showcases of artistic skill either. Overall, the art was a pretty modern-standard type that didn't do much in differentiating in style, quality, or presentation.  \\n\\n\r\nAnimation: 5/10\\n\r\nThe animation, like the art, was about average in most cases. I do feel like the animation in a few sequences were terrible though. There was clear use of shortcuts such as selective framing (waist-up so as to not need to animate walking), cut-shot-action (for example, when Shio's mom slaps her, that's not actually animated), dropping frames (during actiony bits), and reused animation (multiple uses of the vows sequence or flashbacks). Two examples I can point to in the last episode, which is the finale and is expected to have some higher level of quality in my opinion, is when the blond dude trips trying to chase after Matsuzaka and Shio; his fall is animated as a cut-shot with selective framing as to not animated the rest of his body falling circa-impact. The second example is when Matsuzaka swings the luggage case at the hoodie dude. The animation in that was a bit...eh in which it's clear that a few frames were dropped. The one nice thing about the animation in this show was the nice use of supporting effects. The deep-glowing eye colors, the \"brightness\" during happy moments, and a few extra bits were all nice additions to the otherwise simple animation. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 5/10\\n\r\nThere was a needless amount of characters in this. The teacher was forgotten for more than half the show and only really served as the tutorial instructor for introducing Matsuzaka's twisted personality. The stalker-coworker...what was she for again? Was her only point in the show to eventually give Matsuzaka a passport because that's what it seemed like. The character designs overall were okay. I didn't like the hoodie dude's design too much; from what it seems he hasn't been in contact with his abusive father for quite some time, so why the bandages? I can understand why the aunt had bandages because of the nature of her \"work.\" The character development in this show was abhorrent up until the final episode. The amount of character development in this show should have been better suited to maybe 6 episodes; that's how much pointless plot and filler was added. I did not appreciate one bit how long it took to reveal the state of how Matsuzaka and Shio came to be as well as how long it took for a true antagonist to really appear. Basically, I feel that the character development never took off until the final episode. \\n\\n\r\nPlot & Development: 5/10\\n\r\nThis could seriously be condensed into maybe 6 episodes with the plot setup and the amount of meaningful development that was presented. I felt the pacing was way too slow for what was laid on the table. The plot was introduced pretty weakly and there wasn't much to go off on besides the fact that Matsuzaka and Shio are living together; the episodes on introducing the blonde guy, the teacher, and the stalker are honestly needed. What did the blonde guy do for the story other than as to serve as the roundabout way for hoodie guy to find Matsuzaka's apartment? The teacher was just there to be there to build the creepy atmosphere of the show. The aunt could have totally disposed of the bodies instead. Furthermore, the aunt could have totally somehow been able to give Matsuzaka a passport too. Matsuzaka's fake death plan was sort of setup to fail from the start. Using her own clothes on the body was pointless because bodies can be identified with dental records alone. Despite the lackluster and pointless development for most of the show, I decided to give the overall development a 5/10 because I genuinely appreciated the culmination of Matsuzaka and Shio's relationship in the final episode. Shio was confronted with a choice and she chose for herself giving her own true reasons for her choice. Matsuzaka also found her own resolve in what she wanted for herself, her happiness, and for the future of her relationship with Shio; she chose for herself. In the end, both Matsuzaka and Shio were able to make choices for themselves. Matsuzaka was finally able to understand what it is she was looking for her entire life and Shio was able to finally let go of everything to be with Matsuzaka. They both reached a climax from their decisions which was good enough character development for me to give this show a 5/10.\\n\\n\r\nMusic: 5/10\\n\r\nThere is no sound design worth bringing up. The soundboard was fitting for it's sequences such as bodily sound effects, blood and gore sound effects, etc. The music was average but was most fitting in only one case, the final sequence in the last episode. The OP and ED were okay to my tastes. \\n\\n\r\nConclusion: 6/10\\n\r\nI liked the final sequence conclusion, the burning building and their double-suicide part, so much that it redeemed only slightly a lot of the gripes I had about this show for the first 11 episodes. The conclusion answered many of the big questions by revisiting all of the characters in the show and what their fates were. The actual conclusion was open-ended and a bit interesting in regards to what the future for Shio holds. Though, not interesting enough to get me to watch a season 2 if that ever happened. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 5/10\\n\r\nNot as bad as I thought it was going to be. It's not bad, but it's not fine either. Overall, the art and animation were of average quality. The music was average too. The majority of the character and plot development were lacking, but the conclusion is only somewhat worth it to consider picking this up if you have time to kill or are interested in this sort of genre.",

            "content": "This is certainly not your typical anime, especially if you're naturally optimistic while in the watching state. Those that gave bad reviews for the show probably didn't get the message/meaning. The show mainly appeals to nihilistic, yet positively focused person(a)s - someone who can very quickly create lots of destruction around them without realizing it, because they're positively self-concerned. Lots of other themes that pop up during the show are: Addiction, Trauma, (Domestic) Abuse, Searching/Quest, Obsession (over another); Naivety/Cynicism.\r\nCritique/Explanation of Ratings\r\n= Story (8) - Strong, solid plotline, with a few close (almost) encounters. [Those are very nail-biting and then facepalming afterwards]\r\n= Art (9) - Theart is great, and put to good use too. It very strongly and often emphasizes the times where Sato is hopelessly naive about her goals and objects of affection/appreciation.\\n\r\n= Sound (6) - The sound wasn't bad, but nothing special either.\\n\r\n= Character (10) - This show is rich with character, each showing a very archetypal personality with their own unique nuances.

            "content": "(This review is spoilerless.) \r\nHappy Sugar Life isn't a good series. Having interesting ideas or main characters' designs don't mean you can bypass any criticizing about your bad directions, horrible story pacing, awful dialogues, nonsensical progressions and back and forth developments. Even though, the ideas and designs alone can make many viewers feeling impressive and satisfy so much that they say this is the best psychology-horror-thriller-action series of the year. This isn't fully wrong by the way. This series is 3/4 bad and 1/4 good. So first, look take a look at the good things that this series can give you some satisfactions before thecriticizing part that will butcher the horribleness of this series later.\\n\\n\r\nMain casts both small one and pink hair one are very well presented and designed in a way that can make interesting story progressions and developments. Both characters have very interesting dynamical and back stories along out the entire serie. What the serie want to archive about the love and relationship are extremely successful today. I won't be surprised if someone say they only watch Happy Sugar Life because of these two characters. The sweet moments. The sad moments. The decision moments. The hardness moments. The lovely moments. All of these are the most interesting in Happy Sugar Life. But sadly, there are just only small parts of the series that really show the aspects of relationship between these main casts. Also, family domestic violence and their influences in this serie are very well presented. Some people may say these are also the cringe and edgy parts of the series. But I kind of disagree as if we only discuss about main casts now, these aspects of presentation really do their best in building and creating backstories and personality for main casts. Small one is really good in portraying the role of child who having hard mental issues and nearly go insane, which later meet with pink hair one who also having family issues about anyone treat her only an object. (This is the bad part of the story not because pink hair's role but because other support characters' role) When pink hair and small one meet each others, the dynamical and sharing of love, pain, sweetness, and warmth between these two characters can be seen in such a wonderful way.\\n\\n\r\nOthers than what I say above, everything in this serie are badly designed, terribly executed and weirdly used. Let's discuss about the things that make this serie completely unwatchable and I don't want to recommend this serie to anyone based my opinion.\\n\\n\r\n1.) About the basic plot execution problem such as it doesn't make sense, it just kind of happened and it can tell you but it won't the series. Characters and events are purposely being stupid and hypocrite as much as possible with no sole purpose or reason to do it. This serie has a lot of conveniences for characters and events to meet in order for plot progression without any subtlety. Last but not least, the way mysterious theme work is that it's the type of series where it won't let viewers to know or understand anything until it reach at some point. Viewers don't even need to think and predict anything along out the series. Nothing give any clues and informations at all.\\n\\n\r\n2.) Overall, I don't personally like the morals of this series. I feel like this serie is some kind of bias. Everything born and design to be bad. No good deed person or voice of a reason at all in this series. Every plots and scenes have to reflect unnecessary amount of dark story in our societies without any redemptions or ways to reflect the other sides of coins. (good side of the world and society) Also, main morals and stories in each episodes almost look the same for the most of times. The story always begin with MC meeting with some crazy guys, problems occur not so long after that, mystery (plot) begin to reveal with annoying trauma and PTSD sequences and end with cliffhangers where viewer don\u2019t actually know what are actually conclusions and morals. \\n\\n\r\n3.) Around 80% of the dialogues are actually pretty horrible. For instance, these dialogues are annoying and ruin the atmosphere of well directed story pacing. Many characters talk nonsense and repeat what they\u2019re actually said and think in the previous minutes for no reason. Also these dialogues are pointless and telling nothing important to the story at all. Viewers can easily tell the story even if their ears close but the serie are still needlessly to tell things they notice from the background or presentation or hidden message again which ruin the mystery and complication of the plot later.\\n\\n\r\n4.) Repetition of a lot of presentations and storytellings in each scenes and episodes are kind of annoying and irritation most of the time because they\u2019re telling things viewers already seen and known for so many times with the sole purpose of showing characters and plot tones\u2019 frustration, depression, fear, psychological factors and other negative emotions which later (kind of) destroy the creativity and uniqueness of presentations and storytellings style in both short and long runs. This can be very boring as nothing significantly going on and consume a lot of viewing times.\\n\\n\r\n5.) I personally don't like how this serie handle the supporting characters at all. This serie has one of the worst supporting characters\u2019 design during the entire year. Characters\u2019 designs and their roles are so obnoxiously pandering to the maximum limit. Every single one of them are so much stereotypical and born to be bad (or weirdly good) person without any subtlety, building or even a reasons why they are so bad nothing good coming from them to begin with. They are shape-shifting characters where they can be anything in order to satisfy viewers or built the plot in the most convenient way possible. No dynamic. No redemption. Nothing in these characters. Around 90% of the entire casts are useless, has no impact and built significantly nothing in order for plot and story developments and progressions. Most of the cast are there so the serie could have a \u2018plot\u2019 for main cast to do something. Cutting them out from the serie would change nothing in the meanings, progressions and conclusions.\\n\\n\r\nAnd that is actually how I feel about Happy Sugar Life. Sometime, it is such a bittersweet feeling for us to actually believe that good main characters like small one and pink hair are ruined by pretty much everything in the series. That is unfortunate. In the end, I can't base the series by two characters alone. I don't watch Happy Sugar Life just for 2-3 episodes in the beginning and in the end. I watch all of them. This will be a useless viewing experience if I watch this series only for those two right ? So in the future, what is the difference between watching this series and reading a fan fiction then ? I think Happy Sugar Life should be Happy Sugar Life. Not Small One and Pink Hair life stories.\\n\\n\r\nThe final score is 2/10. 2 comes from the two main casts, small one and pink hair one. Cutting 8/10 because those elements of bad directions and terrible designs are unacceptable and ruining my days of enjoying the lovely cringe cliche' and edgy yuri couple.",

            "content": "When you watch the first episode this looks very similar to your typical Yandere anime. The main heroine (actually anti-heroine), Satou, is indeed a by-the-book high-schooler Yandere girl, the usual seemingly sweet at school and at her part-time job but whose heart is empty until she meets her so-called true love. So far sounds boring right?\r\nWell, her so-called true love is actually a grade-school age loli girl called Shio, who actually loves Satou as well. The two live together in Satou's apartment, seemingly having a sweet though forbidden age-gaped relationship. The problem is that nobody knows of that and that Shio is actually a missingperson, though she doesn't know about this because Satou cuts her off from the rest of the world like that princess in the castle. For Satou, even the thought of Shio *talking* to anyone else is unacceptable. The main difference from the typical Yandere story is that Satou already has her love and this is the story of her attempting to keep it and hide it. From here it's the usual Yandere things from lies to murders. Actually quite a good story for people who watch Yandere anime for the first or second time but may still be too typical if you've already watched shows of this kind several times.\\n\\n\r\nThe only thing that actually makes this show different, that made it enjoyable and that makes me give it a 7 instead of 3 is the character of Shio, who is the only character in this show who has any depth. Shio comes from a shattered family, probably the worst childhood one can have. Parts of the show tell her life story and how she ended-up being with Satou, adding a dark slice-of-life aspect to the show and giving it some sort of uniqueness over your average Yandere anime.\\n\\n\r\nArt is usually very bright and moe, except when depicting a murderous or violent intent, as well as during the flashbacks into Shio's dark past. It's pretty much what you'd expect from a show of this type but overall no complaints here. Sound is great, with an opening theme that can suit a romantic comedy anime. Again, this is pretty much expected since most Yandere shows have that. Again, no complaints here.\\n\\n\r\nBottom line - If you don't have anything special on your plan to watch list and you like Yandere and/or dark slice of life, then sure, give it a go. It's fun to watch and not that boring, but not breathtaking on the other hand.",

It could have explored the discrepancy between what adults want and what children need, but instead it was disgusting. The entire time I watched this show I was hoping that the relationship between the two main leads would be about the two teaching each other how a family is supposed to work and heal from it, but it turned into a love story. This would not be an issue if the love were not glorified. But through and through we see this idea that the lovebetween the two main characters is fine because they had each other.\\n\r\nAbuse created more abusers. That's already a gross moral, but I can't get over how much this glorifies pedophilia. The only good thing about this anime is the art.",

            "content": "Happy Sugar Life is about two people who love each other very much and live their lives,it's full of sugar but it's not really happy.Not one bit.\r\nI was in for a surprise at episode one.I swear on my life that I wasn't looking for a thriller disguised as Moe.i had a long day at work,so I had to shut my brain off for a few minutes,but it looks like I don't even deserve that.What I really appreciate is that this anime actually had a story with a start,middle,and end. This show feels like it was made by two different people.There are a lot of happymoments mainly dealing with Sato and Shio when they are inside their house, but the happiness starts to fade when Sato goes into the outside world and Shio is alone at home.The first couple of episodes were intriguing for sure, there were things being shown here and there and what kept me watching was how things ended up this way in the first place and I wasn\u2019t disappointed. Around the middle of the show, I kinda got a bit annoyed of the characters because there is something wrong with literally almost every single character introduced in the show.If one person wasn\u2019t abused or sexually assaulted another person was a straight creep or pedophile. It got to deviantart OC levels of edge this side of Magical Girl Site. But right when I thought the show lost its way, episode 8 happened and it picked up.The combination of the art direction and editing really emphasized the psychological thriller this show is supposed to be.As a result the really screwed up moments come in at the final episodes where everything concludes and I feel satisfied.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe art is basic and animation is average.One thing that is actually worth talking about was how at certain moments, the art direction took advantage of the basic art style to make it psychological.But that\u2019s about it.(Like my reviews weren\u2019t long enough)\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe sound is that bad either, Voice acting is great, a bit over dramatic, but great,nonetheless.Also the soundtrack is \u2026...good. The actual foley for this show was well done,There were some very weird sounds that played with my emotions.The Opening is addictive and the ending is too. Some of the insert songs are really good as well, it makes it stand out more when it is heard at certain moments.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nOkay, the characters. Sato, is what a way more accurate example of what a Yandere should be like.She traces the \u201cYandere\u201d criteria from when it first originated back in 2005 when Kaede from \u201cShuffle!\u201d was first made. Sato is more sociopathic than psychopathic. People can go around calling Yuno the true Yandere,but while watching Mirai Nikki I just saw Yuno as a horny killing machine and nothing else for the past twenty something episode.Sato mainly screws with people and manipulates everyone, she is a crazy person, but a crazy person with a brain.She also has CHARACTER development,there are some insecurities that she deals with like interest in taboo relationships(because if you think about it this is just a more clean genderbent version of Boku no Pico) and it's only been twice this year where I watch a show with that type of theme(the other one being Koi wa Ameagari).Shio is super duper cute but I kinda prefer her cute oblivious self over her hallucinatory self.She does get some redemption in the final episodes where the show focuses on her and Sato the most..The real problems come with all the other characters who are crazy AF. One person I would like to touch on is Asahi Kobe. This is the problem i have with him.He at first seems to act like the most sensible person in this show.Right? Wrong. There is one time where he threatens to cut someone's fingernails off, and it's for a split second. It wasn't even revealed in a twist type of way, it just HAPPENED.:/.And with the other characters, the problem is not what's wrong with them, but how much they are crazy.They pull of weird kookie faces but beyond that they act normal, if the show was more subtle about it, it would make the characters infinitely better.\\n\\n\\n\r\nIn the end, I enjoyed myself watching this, but I don't wanna say my life has changed from watching it.Probably since I've been watching so many psychological horrors these past years,nothing comes closest to Monster and compared to that show and Happy Sugar Life, Happy Sugar Life goes a bit too out of proportion.Also it's bland art style doesn't help either.What really made it stand out though was its story and it's interesting art direction,so I have to say that this is a good show for someone to be introduced into  thrillers like this and not be too traumatized.\\n\\n\r\nOverall-7\\n\r\nPlease don't kill me for what I said about Yuno.\\n",

            "content": "At first I had plans to drop this but for some reason I went against that and decided to finish it anyways, do I regret it? No, but I wouldn't say it was worth the time I wasted to watch it.\r\nSTORY/CHARACTERS: \r\nThe plot is basically about a pink haired girl named Satou  that is a (((non offending))) pedophile, who kidnapped a small child named Shio that she has groomed into becoming her emotional escape in life. The pink haired girl is also homicidal , has a crazy aunt, and is very psychopathic.\r\nUnfortunately, she is not the only character with serious mental issues and she'snot even the ONLY pedophile. There are 4 pedophiles in this anime, one is a teacher, one is a manager who raped a teenager who became a pedophile as well, and our anti-hero protagonist. \\n\\n\r\n Not a single character within this anime is remotely sane either. This gets really old, really fast. Even the only \"pure\" (according to the anime) character which is the child clearly has behavioral traits similar to developing sociopaths.\\n\\n\r\nMany aspects of the story makes it hard for me feel immersed what so ever due to how absurd and unrealistic it is. Almost everything that happens in this would never happen in real life scenario, especially in terms how undetected everything is regarding the murders committed and how it is dealt with along with the behavior of these characters. It is just crazy and in a laughably bad way. I understand this is a piece of fiction but if you can not even make your world believable, then you can not make the viewer feel much at all aside from annoyance of how lousy the world building is.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSOUND: it's just there, ok? And it's like, who cares- there's nothing special about it but it is also not intrusive.\\n\\n\r\nART: Super generic modern anime looking. Like the music, there's nothing going for it, the character designs are from a million anime you have seen before. You won't find anything eye catching here artistically speaking. In regards of its animation, it does its minimal job in showing movement.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT: Barely. I basically watched it like I was watching a car accident in super slow motion. You already know it's going to end horribly, but you just want to see how the collision goes. \\n\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL/FINAL THOUGHTS: \\n\\n\r\nI'm surprised people would call this a 'horror' anime, as it is not scary at all, just disturbing and unpleasant as we have to watch this yandere pink haired monster get away with murders and keeping a child that she has romantic feelings for inside of her apartment. The real horror is how horribly bad this anime is. \\n\\n\r\nThere are far better psychological horror anime out there, this is one to give it a hard miss, you're not missing anything unless you're a creepy pedophile using lolicon/shotacon content as a form of escape, or a person who is very desperate to watch some sort of 'disturbing' content when the only really morbid thing is the pedophilia which is grossly sugar coated and romanticized (at least from the protagonist's view)\\n\\n\r\nWatch it if you want to laugh at how bad it is, but that's all you should watch it for , really.",

            "content": "Oooh boy, here we go! \r\nFun fact I forgot my login to MAL, I lost my previous acc ayy.  But that being said after reading the reviews on this particular anime I felt obliged to write something because I feel people are too bust being sarcastic or memey with this anime to get to the real point people want to hear with this. \r\nI recently finished happy sugar life and I\u2019ll admit, I went in knowing it would be dark.  I heard yandere and since we actually don\u2019t have too many anime\u2019s entirely centred round yanderes (except that one with a certain pinkhaired anime who will not be named) and it got me intrigued.  I saw that the yandere interest was a little girl- through me off a bit but seeing it being described as \u201cpure\u201d I was like \u201cah like a big sister little sister thing\u201d.\\n\\n\r\nFirst off, can the people calling this relationship \u201cpure\u201d go and rethink what pure is. Yes this relationship isn\u2019t sexual and the general interactions between the two girls is fine. But it\u2019s a twisted relationship, with an unstable girl and a little girl that clearly gains stockholm. This is not a \u201cpure\u201d relationship no matter how \u201cpure\u201d the interactions between the two are.  It is pretty much a tamer version of pedophilia. \\n\\n\r\nNow, now lolicons, before you start defending your underage hentai manga saying \u201cbut it\u2019s just cartoons\u201d, regardless of how much I disagree with people treating the two girls relationship as \u201cpure\u201d (or calling it age gap romance- my dudes no, age gaps only cool when they are both age of consent, NOT WHEN ONE OF THE CHARACTERS IS 4) I don\u2019t think this shows intent was to promote pedophila as so many people are saying it is but avoidinh dropping the pedo bomb for. \\n\\n\r\nHappy sugar life does not go out it\u2019s way to glorify the characters actions, but much rather it tries to look at the idea of sexuality and the topics surrounding pedophilia in different lights- mostly anti pedo as I will explain.  The overall theme of the show is love and it tackles this theme by looking into love corruption and where it stems from.  Asside from our tame pedo pairing in the foreground, is a character who after being raped, gains pedo tendencies from the experience, an actual extreme psychological response to sexual assault and rape.  We get a weird stalker and obsessed character, a masochistic pervert character and a character who see\u2019s love as abuse.  This show tackles the nitty gritty of love and in a way that I think is quite well. It takes us into areas we are too afraid to explore and just shun off the moment we hear it. \\n\\n\r\nThe show goes out it\u2019s way to tackle the idea of pedophilia and it looks at it from all angles.  These two girls clearly care deeply for one another, should we shun their relationship? The person who was raped, clearly has been through something traumatic, should we call him a monster for his perversion. The show really kicks you out of your comfort zone to ask those questions and make you ask them. However this show does not aim to show pedophilia in a good light.\\n\\n\r\nThe show does all it can to make these characters disturbing. Many reviewers have stated \u201cit\u2019s for edginess\u201d but they are missing the point. These characters are not meant to be liked. The show does not want you to condone what they are doing. Down to our pink haired yandere, they want you to feel like what she is doing is wrong and uncomfortable with her actions.  There a scene where she literally asks the audience in her mind \u201cWhat I\u2019m doing is okay isn\u2019t it? I\u2019m not in the wrong!\u201d This is purposefully put there so you can reply back \u201cno, what you are doing IS wrong!\u201d \\n\\n\r\nThe show will put it\u2019s creepy characters on full max and you will always have an overwhelming feeling of disgust and discomfort around them.  Me and a friend were talking about this show the other day and we agreed, happy sugar life is a sattire on these topics and personality types. But not a funny one.  A sattire is meant to make you question the characters type and your own thoughts on a topic or debate through their exagerations. I can hobestly say it made me feel disgusted and that\u2019s just my general opinion on those topics anyway.  The show does a good job at really making you question your morals. \\n\\n\r\nAs for the soundtrack.  I liked some of it, didn\u2019t think much of the rest. I liked the main theme and how it fit the bipolar feel of the show. As well as the opening, it truly was a bi polar themed one and I always found myself watching it.  If was a kind of refreshing op, albeit nothing grandeous.  The main theme for the ost has some different renditions of it and I liked how that was used. The rest is meh and I swear there was an ost that sampled the bleach ost as well in there \ud83d\ude02 \\n\\n\r\nAs for characters and voice acting.  I liked the voice acting! It wasn\u2019t the konosuba of voice acting but it was far from bad.  The characters however were either pretty disturbing,  clich\u00e9 and occasionally alright.  Then again seeing as this is a horror I think disturbing us was the point. With the themes and charscters. The horrors not in the main characters murders but in the general feel and theme of the show. \\n\\n\r\nThe art was nice but held a massive uncanny valley feel for me in that I swear I have seen the style before, what\u2019s more I think it\u2019s a shoujo artists style of all things too! \\n\\n\r\nI wanna end this review on why I think this show was made.  In japan currently one of the biggest problems they have is pedophilia- particularly in it\u2019s otaku community. Yes let\u2019s lolicons will start hissing and saying it\u2019s just cartoons, but alot of lolicons already have or go on to have a real twisted interest in young children. That interest is not okay and you need to see help. This anime does it\u2019s best to show that without being direct about it. In those scenes where you are thinking \u201cthese characters are twisted and need professional help\u201d they are scenes where you can perhaps compare them to your own views and realise maybe you are just as twisted and need help. It doesn\u2019t show pedophilia as something natural but as something that stems from mental illness. And I\u2019ll end this by saying, please get help if you do have any sort of relation to any of the topics explored in this show, be that pedophilia, rape or anything else. There are professionals who will help and not judge. \\n\\n\r\nAnd that\u2019s that.  Now we wait for me to loose my login to this acc too!\\n\\n",

It's more like Mental Illness: The Anime!\r\nTwo victims of abuse and abandonment survive through unhealthy coping mechanisms. Shio has a large dose of stockholm syndrome, where she falls in love with her kidnapper, sociopsychopath Satou. Added bonus: everyone is a pedophile since Shio is like 6 years old. Literally everyone except \"dude what the hell is going on with you we never hang out anymore\" Shouko.\r\nI love how the story was told from Satou's POV instead of the classic \"outsiderwho gets dragged in\" POV. You want so badly to find some redeeming moment for the protagonist, but there's just isn't really one. She's doing what her little jacked up brain sees as right, justified because it's for the person she loves.",

open in previous episodes in order to get new perspectives on some of these characters.\u00a0 This is done mostly because Happy Sugar Life is a story of the starvation of love, the twisting of the word to fit the definition of Satou and the various side characters that act as obstacles to her ultimate goal of being with Chio no matter the cost or circumstance.\\n\\n\r\nIt's with this the show plants its feet into some very uncomfortable themes, ranging from obsession to rape and abuse, portraying its characters as sick and depraved individuals where their madness can only be satiated by their desires.\u00a0 The plot itself is pretty straightforward with only a few small twists given how the audience more or less knows how things are going to end anyway.\u00a0 But given how it's a well paced show with many character facets to expand on the overall story of the series, that can be ignored given how the audience at the beginning doesn't know everything.\\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+ Good pacing\\n\r\n-\u00a0 Spoiling the ending is a bit of an odd narrative choice\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\\n\r\nMatsuzaka Satou as the show's resident protagonist is a true testament of what it means to be a yandere.\u00a0 The psychotic, crazed love of the trope as she desperately tries to keep her 'Happy Sugar Life' is ingrained to her character as she exhibits an outwardly friendly behavior towards the one she loves and to feign as a sweet girl, acting cold, ruthless, and calculating only when the situation calls for it, manipulating those around her to her whims, taking matters into her own hands when it really calls for it.\u00a0 I just find it nice to see a yandere for once not just be out of her mind to gain the affections for the one they love, but instead act rationally to keep or progress what they have planned out.\\n\\n\r\nKoube Shio on the other hand isn't really as fortunate as a character.\u00a0 The show really puts her on a pedestal that makes it extremely hard to understand the logic behind some of the characters' reasons to fawn and (literally) drool all over her.\u00a0 Like everyone calls her SUPER CUTE, but she's not THAT cute, like come on.\u00a0 She remains this way for a majority of the series, and only really comes to have some development/backstory for her at a point near the end of the series where both her and Satou get an explanation as to how Shio ends up being locked away in an apartment in order for Satou to get all of the love that she's been desiring all her life.\u00a0 It's only then that she gets any proper development, being a factor that comes just a bit too late for my liking, though the rewards for it are certainly interesting.\\n\\n\r\nI'd argue the sidecast is worse off than either Satou or Chio in terms of their mental health state, which is surprising considering you'd expect it to be the other way around.\u00a0 Ranging from Satou's aunt who first taught her of love, the unfortunate Mitsuboshi whose had to cope in some...unconventional ways, some of Satou's coworkers, and Asashi, who puts up missing posters of Shio in hopes of finding his missing sister, the sidecast only helps bolster the madness and depravity that goes on in this series, making the main characters almost sympathetic in a way given the kind of people that surround and breathe down their necks.\\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+ Solid main character\\n\r\n+ Memorable (and insane) sidecast\\n\r\n- Shio is put on a pedestal way too much\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\\n\r\nAs the first project produced by Studio Ezo'la, Happy Sugar Life is a very solid show to come out from a seemingly new production studio.\u00a0 There're hardly any animation or consistency errors that I can see from, and the artstyle has this nice fluffy, almost picturesque style with light, bright colors that does a good job of portraying Satou's perfect world with Chio.\\n\\n\r\nThis is immediately counteracted by the moments of insanity where the entire color scheme gets darker, the storybook setting is gone, and whatever happiness was there is replaced with the harsh suffocation of obsession that takes hold of this show, with the only light in any given frame of this being the neon glow of the characters' eyes to show that they're not in the right state of mind.\u00a0 This, combined with other aesthetic choices like Chio's head scribbles and disturbing imagery gives a great two sides to the art that flows seamlessly with the nature of the show.\\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+ Solid work for a first project\\n\r\n+ Flips between two versions of the same style seamlessly\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\\n\r\nAkari Nanawo's \"One Room Sugar Life\" is a song that tells you EXACTLY what you're getting into watching this.\u00a0 Starting with an initially cheery beat before twisting chords to give some dissonance to the show's other half, the OP is one of the more memorable tracks in recent memory because it mixes its show's duality in a manner that tells you exactly what you're getting into.\u00a0 Its sister, ReoNa's \"SWEET HURT\" however is a softer, more relaxed song that sounds nothing like a song that should be a part of a show like this.\u00a0 I don't find it as memorable personally, and actually see it as something that's really out of place cause its tempo and melody really doesn't fit in a show where depravity is a character trait handed out like candy.\\n\\n\r\nPersonal Enjoyment:\\n\\n\r\nI kind of feel dirty watching this show.\u00a0 Like something violated me deep inside due to a number of the cast's perverted tendencies making it impossible for me to not writhe in my seat watching this show.\u00a0 My experience can pretty much be summed up as 'uncomfortable' due to the sheer amount of twisted logic that appears in Happy Sugar Life.\\n\\n\r\nThat being said, I did find the show fun to watch on account of just wanting to see where it was going to go.\u00a0 Happy Sugar Life does a very good job at gripping its audience, leaving them wanting more because in a scenario as precarious and intertwined as this, the slightest mistake made by Satou or another ends in their demise.\u00a0 The tightrope act was really exhilarating to watch even though I knew how it ended from minute one, and I still find it really weird yet grateful that the series managed to find a way to make Satou one of the more sane/sympathetic characters in the show when everything is taken into account.\\n\\n\r\nWhile the subject matter is uncomfortable for those that aren't looking for it, Happy Sugar Life is a recommendation I would make only on the basis that it's an interesting psychological horror that paints a grim picture using only the wits and desires of the human brain.\u00a0 Satou is a great protagonist where she and almost everyone in the cast pulls their weight to create a story that quite literally has its characters flying high.",

She comes upon a lost child named Shio Kobe, for whom she feels something towards for the first time. Having felt this emotion she believes is true love that she has never experienced before, Satou is determined to hold Shio close and never let her go. No matter who or what stands in her way. \r\n    Satou basically kidnaps Shio up off the street and drags her ass to her home with her,then proceeds to isolate her in an apartment by telling her the outside world is dangerous and later physically locking her in. She knows full well that there are missing person posters everywhere for her, and knows who's looking for her. But she refuses to even consider letting her go because shes an edgy pedophile. No one sane exists in this world just a bunch of pedophile killers who kidnap and rape children. \\n\r\n    Anyway the story is unique as in I have never watched something with such a burning intent on wanting to have sex with a child. However there is more than people wanting to diddle kids here. There is also domestic abuse and stuff to make it \"Edgy\" for all those 12 year olds looking for the \"Forbidden\" since being a pedophile isn't degenerate enough for them. \\n\r\n    The art was alright nothing too fancy and or bad however the music chosen for this was your generic anime music you can find if you just type \"Anime Music\" in YouTube. Ofcourse don't forget your ear busting suspense shit they throw in. \\n\\n\\n\r\n    Overall I rate this anime 2edgy4me/10 hopefully it drops below the 7star Thresh hold since its dying fast lol.\\n\\n",

It is confusing and feels like it should be a female romance novel but i am almost certain it isn't. I don't know how i feel about it. I don't know if i feel bad for the mc or creeped out. Sometimes I wanted to close out and stop watchingit, but for whatever reason i continued anyways. \\n\\n\r\nI am a huge fan of horror/thriller/psychological but i don't think this really fits?

            "content": "\"Happy Sugar Life\" so far has me hooked.  This show is creepy on a whole different level than most anime I have seen.  It takes concepts we all know and understand but actually portrays them in a tragic and intense manner.  The characters are not completely unique but they are all done well.  The main character Satou has a backstory that is yet to be revealed yet seems to be one of the most interesting characters I have seen in quite a long time.  Not only is Satou a great character but the side charactersseem to have a decent amount of screen time as well.  One character, which I will not name for spoiler purposes, did a complete 180 from what I had expected.  The way the show throws off your expectations and makes you question your morals is great!  \\n\r\n     I have been craving a good show to watch for some time of watching cookie cutter basic shows and \"Happy Sugar Life\" has not let me down.  Certain events that happen in the show, with some strategically placed mystery, make you think deeply about what you think is the right thing to do and about how these things actually happen somewhere in the world.  It tugs at your heart strings and draws you in with creativity and the need to find out what happens next.  So far it seems every episode ends with a cliff hanger, but that just may be me wanting more of it.\\n\r\n     The art is great.  It isn't so beautiful as to be on the same level as \"Your Name\" or something of the like, but it is still very pleasing to the eye.  The character designs, the auras behind the people, and the atmosphere are all very well done and somewhat stylized.  I won't lie, it isn't something that we haven't really seen before.  It isn't as recognizable as \"One Piece\" or \"Death Note\" but that doesn't mean the art isn't well done.\\n\r\n     The sound in \"Happy Sugar Life\" is awesome!  Not only is the voice acting phenomenal but the music as well is very well placed and perfectly executed.  When the mood of a character swings, the music follows suit.  When things are good, the music is bubbly and happy.  When the mood is dark, the music is eerie  and intense.  Not to mention the beginning theme song and its unique sound and the ability to replay it.  The ending theme song is not as memorable as the beginning, but that may be because I skipped it once or twice.  The voice acting as I mentioned before is very well done.  Some characters are shown screaming, drooling, laughing hysterically, threatening, giggling and so on and so forth - all done perfectly.  Matsuzaka Satou is voiced by Kanazawa Hana and she does a great job with switching her voice from a sweet sounding cute girl to a menacing and bold yandere.  Hanae Natsuki, the voice actor for Mitsuboshi Tayou, also does a very good job at following the constant mood swings and grotesque sound effects while still remaining to sound like a perfectly nice guy when he is not alone.\\n\r\n     Over all I would say \"Happy Sugar Life\" is very promising and even if what I or others may say does not seem to appeal to you I would still check it out regardless.  People often follow the three episode rule, there are four out as I am writing this, so if you don't see fit to watch any more when the rest comes out, then obviously it is not your thing.  The show seems very lighthearted and cute on the surface, but I assure you it is not.  As I mentioned before, \"Happy Sugar Life\" is deep, dark, and disturbing.  That being said it is incredibly entertaining if you are not of the fainthearted and I believe it is very enjoyable.  I will be waiting for the rest of the season to come out :) \\n\\n\r\n~WolfAlliance~",

            "content": "Happy sugar life can be a hit or miss. For me it was a little bit better than mediocre.\r\nThe show starts off pretty good, but then it starts showing a little plotholes towards the end, or trying to make one girl just look plain stupid.There were some unanswered questions at the end credits, which you probably would have to fill in I guess. For me I needed some extra scenes, but the studio probably wouldn't want to show it a gore scene at the end if you know what I mean *splat*.\r\nI don't know if the series was rushed a little bit, but for meit was. Well the situation was only 3 months and it does show what money is needed, also what working means, but also what alcohol can do for some people, well won't get into that. The mental state of children and teens is very crucial, because it can affect them in the future in a terrible way, where they can be psychotic or have tendencies which is dangerous. You have to help them before they get broken (can recover a bit, but never fully) or past broken (which you can't recover from or never), but past probably only 1%. This anime shows you the mental state of which I talked about. This anime also shows you how some terrible people are, like co workers, bosses, lolicon (trying to take, for themselves) and how you can get consumed by others personalities. I said a little mediocre, but I rate overall a 6 want to say good, but towards the \"end\" it was just not my thing anymore. Its not who choose who, maybe a little, but it's just that I didn't like how you can get consumed by love in a bad way, if you love someone let them go, which can go both ways (good or bad). Last note probably, wanted to say more, but would spoil.\\n\r\n(TL:DR This anime shows you how you how you can become broken, if you don't get love when your a child. FYI had this as 8/10, but then thought about it 6/10.) One last note the who choose who didn't break this anime for me, just wasn't feeling it anymore and it kinda rushed well for me.\\n",

            "content": "Well. This shit right here is all kinds of fucked up.\r\nI kept asking myself, \"why am I still watching this?\" - but much like being witness to a trainwreck, the sheer amazement is just too hard to turn away from. So I kept going. If nothing else, it was fascinating to follow a schoolgirl main character who's a complete psychopath. You don't see too many of those in a straight-up horror/thriller sense.\r\nSo... Well, apart from the innocent little child that everything in the show eventually revolves around, and one side character in addition to that, there are no good people in this show. Period.\r\nEvery singleother person is severely flawed. Selfish, cold, remorseless, perverted, sadistic, masochistic, sociopathic, pick any combination. Almost every character's broken personality is more or less chalked up to the \"broken households spawn broken offspring\" trope. How true to life that is is not my area of expertise.\\n\\n\r\nOne tiny little thing that I'd like to bring attention to, in contrast to some other reviews I read: Yes, there is a heavy \"loli love\" angle in this show towards the one child that every character for whatever reason becomes instantly enamored with. But I would have to disagree with others' claims that it is sexualized. If it was, I'd honestly stopped watching.\\n\\n\r\nIn the main character's relationship with the little girl, while referred to very explicitly as love, I could not find a single instance where any sort of physical (sexual) aspect would've even been hinted at. Unless I watched some kind of a heavily censored version, which I doubt, all in all there wasn't a single time where I felt that the little girl was sexualized in any sense. No uncomfortable camera angles, too little clothing or questionable intimacy. I've felt much, much less comfortable watching some fanservicey drama or fantasy shows where a loli side character isn't even part of the main group. So in my opinion \"the loli question\" surprisingly wasn't much of a problem.\\n\\n\r\nWell, that turned out to be much more than I intended to write.\\n\\n\r\nTL;DR If you want to watch something pretty fucked up unfold, here's something that should make you think. Also - Art looks kinda OK but all animation is so minimal and cheap it's almost laughable.\\n\\n\r\nEDIT: I actually came back to this series and gave it even more thought than on the first viewing, and decided that my original score did not accurately portray the show's strengths. It's still seriously fucked up, but there is certainly method and a point to the madness. It's a surprisingly well-crafted episodic study on our societal norms and prejudices as the viewers, and given how I almost live for shit like that, I'll certainly give the show credit for initially not even making me realize what it is doing.",

            "content": "To be fair, I didn't like Happy Sugar Life from the moment is begun and was desperate to drop it, but, decided to give it a go. To be in an agonizing pain for 24 minutes again and again. So this review is taking too much of my pesonal opinion rather than a, aproach from all sides, kind of thing. There is much hate for the anime due to it being so out of expectations, because I really wanted to like it. So I sat through all 12\u00e9pisodes.\r\nSound:7/10\r\nNow, where to start, I'll go from best to worst, and the best has to be the openingsong, which in the 150 anime I watched is one of the few I actually sat through every episode and listened to it. The closing song was not as good but did try to be good so I'll leave it at that. Apart from the songs, the voices, reactions etc, where pretty good, at times there was a touch of laziness in it, and at others it was too much. But I will  not be that critical, hence the 7 which in my diary is good.\\n\\n\r\nArt:7/10\\n\r\nI don't know much about studios and stuff, so what I watch and like is not based on that. And till this moment, I do not know who took on the art for Happy Sugar Life. For the medium budget I believe it to have, they did what was right. It was overall average, with small \"high quality\" moments when stuff really begun to stray from god's path AMEN.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:1/10\\n\r\nCharacters for me is how much I can relate or understand one's actions and way of thinking and also, how much character development there is, so it's 2 in 1. With that said, character development for me was a 0. I did not see any difference from the first episode all the way to the 12th, with the only exception being a \"young,blond,hot playboy\", who turned pedophile and yes you know who I mean. Aside form that, I did like the fact that the main, and supporting cast had messed up characters. However when we leave the \"some messed up\" and close in on \"all messed up\" that's where things for me start getting bleached, and when my pain intesified because it goes like this:\\n\\n\r\n\"Hello I'm a whore who's been with 100 men but a 5 year old girl makes me more fulfilled\" - MC\\n\r\n\"Oh hello I like you and you rejected me, I got bondage raped by an older woman, and now I only fancy myself lolies\"- young,blond,hot playboy\\n\r\n\"Yo, I'm a teacher with a wife and kid's, but I do like my willywarmer young\"\\n\r\nYou can watch, of have watched it and catch up on the rest.\\n\\n\r\nStory:2/10\\n\r\n2 is being generous and is only given for 2 moments in the whole anime that I liked. Apart from that, there is no story, nor plot here. It's more like this. We have a starting set, and small events that happen all of a sudden. We do have some minor plot twists that can be predictable, but like some anime fans I don't like thinking about an anime while watching it, but simply try to get absorbed by it , and think the details and what I didn't like next.\\n\\n\r\nOverall Enjoyment: 2/10\\n\r\nFor me happy sugar life was one of the very few that I would call, a time loser. In all honesty you may find me over reacting but in my defence, I am not. I have watched a lot of trashy anime and Have never felt this disappointed.",
